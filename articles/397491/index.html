In the 17 years he spent on Mars, a man had to work with the citizens of the United States, China and Russia.  The main mission of Captain Kay was to protect the five research bases built by people on the Red Planet from the aggressive "indigenous peoples" inhabiting Mars. <br><br>  For more than three years, the authorities of several countries have been preparing Captain Kay for a difficult alien service. <br>  During this time, he learned how to manage three types of space fighters and the same number of bombers specially designed for combat operations in airless space.  The training was conducted on a secret lunar base called <i>Lunar Operations Command</i> .  About how many colleagues he had, Captain Kay did not tell.

      ‚ÄúIn the incomplete 20 years of service in the Martian troops, I was incredibly tired,‚Äù admitted the man. <br>  The leadership responded to the request of the military for resignation with understanding and arranged in his honor a magnificent farewell ceremony.  As the American said, it was attended by many high-ranking officials, including former US Secretary of Defense <b>Donald Rumsfeld</b> . <br><br>  Representatives of the channel UFO TV shot about this half-hour film. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKAyH6_96oQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Captain Kay's story sounds strange to say the least, but he is far from the only one who claims that there are secret military bases on Mars. <br><br>  Among others, this is the <b>great-granddaughter of US President Eisenhower</b> , who reports that: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAn independent Martian colony already exists‚Äù </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/063/ad2/b6a/063ad2b6a8e4398e5ec0419758190887.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This was reported by <b>Andrei Dmitrievich Basiago and Laura Magdalene Eisenhower</b> .  They confirmed the existence of a secret colony located on Mars in a joint appearance on Exopolitics Radio with Alfred Lambremont Webr. <br><br>  A lawyer from Cambridge, Andrei Dmitrievich Basiago, who lives in Washington state, said he was a member of the <b>DARPA</b> time travel program.  Participating in the <i>Pegasus</i> project (1968-72), he successfully teleported to the US base on Mars twice in 1981. <br><br>  <b>Ms. Eisenhower, the granddaughter of US President Dwight Eisenhower, was recruited into the project in 2006.</b> <br>  They told how the secret Martian colony is funded, that the money comes from the black budget, military and intelligence sources.  The base is created as a survival mechanism for the human genome in the event that solar flares, nuclear war, or any other cataclysm will end human life on Earth. <br><br>  In the Three-hour interview, Basiago and Eisenhower call on the US Congress to investigate the American presence on Mars with an emphasis on military occupation, rather than the diplomatic participation of human society with the indigenous peoples of Mars living in underground cities under the surface of Mars. <br><br>  Ms. Eisenhower stated that ‚Äú <i>Alternative 3</i> ‚Äù - the notion that trillions of dollars of resources should be spent to protect human life, keeping it on Mars - should give way to ‚Äú <i>Alternative 4</i> ‚Äù to a new social awakening to achieve sustainability of human civilization life on Earth . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/em2Mxoqkjlc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Their historic interactive exposure of the Star Martian Gate on Exopolitics Radio was based on direct personal experience.  Basiago made 2 trips to Mars in 1981, when he was at the age of 19.  He walked on the surface of Mars.  He got there by teleportation from a CIA military facility in El Segundo, California. <br><br><h5>  Mr. Eisenhower was recruited by the CIA in 2006, when she was 33. To take part in the project and become a secret settler of Mars, she had to understand her personal life, actually start everything from scratch. </h5><br><br>  During the interview, they announced that they did not agree with many factors of the Martian colony.  They said that when recruiting conscripts for a flight to Mars, the CIA resorts to various methods, including psychological manipulation. <br><br>  Basiago claims that there are currently working on Mars individuals who have Aryan blood, which does not represent the genetic diversity of the entire human race on Earth.  Ms. Eisenhower agreed with the arguments of Andrei Dmitrievich. <br><br>  They suggested that this policy might be revised. <br><br>  After the interviews, Mr. Basiago and Ms. Eisenhower made a joint statement about the colonies of human survival on other planets.  You can listen to the interview on the Exopolitik Radio website via the <a href="">link</a> . <br><br>  <i>There are other facts of the presence of the US military on Mars.</i>  <i>Among them is the <b>book of Michael Relf</b> , who served in the US Army from 1976 to 1996.</i>  <i>There was also a scientist, Arthur Neumann, who publicly stated that he teleported to a secret colony on Mars for project meetings.</i> <br><br>  <b>Michael Relf</b> is an eyewitness to the colony on Mars and is an informant and former member of the US armed forces, who in 1976 was hired as a permanent member of the secret colony of Mars.  During his service, he made not only flights to Mars, but traveled in time for up to 20 years, after which he successfully returned to the point of departure. <br><br>  Michael Relf wrote a book in two volumes, where he describes two types of persons on a secret Martian colony.  Michael Relf also mentions the presence and functions of reptiles and Gray Aliens on a secret Martian colony. <br><br><h4>  As for the projects " <i>Curiosity</i> " and others, they are only a diversion to hide the true state of affairs. </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397491/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397491/</a></p>
