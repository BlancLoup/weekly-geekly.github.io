  <section class="page js-page"><h1>8-800 - is it worth it or not?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf2/dfa/a46/cf2dfaa466ea415d97d239f9bda66534.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  This material is not about the once-popular business model of the Nokia 8800 phone, although the topic still concerns telephony in the most direct way.  We'll talk about the number 8800 or 8-800 (freephone, freecall, toll free), which any person can call, and absolutely free - the owner of the number pays the bill for calls. <br><br>  Phone numbers 8800 are used by entrepreneurs who place them on their websites, billboards, business cards, etc.  Thus, the interested client can call the specified number from any phone: landline or mobile.  In addition, it does not matter at all that there can be several tens of thousands of kilometers between the owner of 8-800 and the caller.  The essence of this number in one: calls are free for the caller! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      At the same time, the cost of incoming calls for the owner of 8-800 depends on where this call comes from.  Thus, for an incoming call from a fixed Moscow number, you will have to pay 0.80 / 1.00 rubles per minute, and for a call from the numbers of mobile operators in Russian regions - 3.20 / 10.00 rubles per minute. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Statistics show that calls from fixed numbers in Moscow make up from 10%, from fixed numbers in other regions of Russia - from 15%, and from numbers of mobile operators - about 70-75%. <br><br>  Plus, the owners of the 8800 numbers may be subject to additional requirements.  For example, the monthly fee or the minimum required bill.  As you understand, with a large number of clients, a rather substantial amount is charged over a month to pay for the ‚Äúconvenient‚Äù number 8-800.  In order not to be unfounded, we clarify that our company pays about 15 thousand rubles a month for servicing the number 8800. <br><br>  Of course, 8-800 is convenient, but not for everyone.  The advantages of this number include the fact that it is available to customers in any region of our vast country, moreover, completely free of charge.  That is, the owner of the number does not need to create offices in other cities, just one thing is enough - the main one.  Of course, if you have a large company that works with all of Russia, this number will obviously come in handy.  But if you work only in Moscow and the region - what's the point of paying huge bills? <br>  Quite an ordinary number 495, while you can choose a "beautiful" combination of numbers. <br><br>  Also worth knowing that owning the number 8800, you can literally go broke.  For example, calls from telephone hooligans may come to your number, plus the likelihood of DDoS attacks.  In addition to the fact that after that customers simply can not reach you, there is a chance to get an account with astronomical amounts.  A reasonable question is brewing: do you really need the number 8-800? <br><br>  These numbers are so popular among businessmen, because there are several erroneous assumptions about them.  For example, many people think that if you place the number 8800 on your site, it raises the site‚Äôs conversion, that there will be more calls to the company, such a site is more credible than the sites of competitors without the number 8-800 (they say, a serious company, and not "Sharashkina office", once "forked up" on a similar number).  In addition, many believe that the site with this number is at a higher level in search engines.  Unfortunately or fortunately, it is not.  Personally, we 8800 did not give anything from the above. <br><br>  Therefore, you should think soberly and understand whether you really need the number 8-800.  If it is useful for large companies, it is simply useless for small local firms. <br><br>  Before you buy the number 8800 for your company, you need to decide: <br><br><ul><li>  Will the advantages of this issue be for you; </li><li>  calculate if the maintenance costs for 8-800 are too big for you; </li><li>  will you be able to pay for the calls of all your customers (most of which will be potential, that is, their service will not pay off). </li></ul><br>  If you decide that you do not ‚Äúpull‚Äù the costs of servicing the number 8800, you can always use the ordinary number 495, including the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.nomer-495.ru/nomer-495">beautiful</a> ‚Äù one.  And, by the way, the presence of the Moscow city number also inspires confidence - instead of an illusory set of numbers, a person sees the telephone code of the capital and clearly understands where he is calling. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298142/</a></p>
