Basic Concepts "- a book of the author and designer of world renown Ellen Lupton.  In it, for the convenience of students and professionals, she gathered into a single system all the basic knowledge, without which modern design is impossible.  A large number of examples of outstanding projects, as well as detailed comments Ellen Lupton will help you to take a fresh look at the basic concepts of the visual language practiced by designers today.  Modernity requires a deep understanding of both the theory of design and the latest trends in art and in the field of technical achievements.  Ellen Lupton‚Äôs book will help you reach new heights in graphic design, creating ingenious, inspirational and harmonious works. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Foreword </h3><br>  This book is a tutorial on creating visual forms. After reading it, you will learn how to create complexity from simple interactions.  We wrote the first book in 2008, because we did not find anything like it for today's students and young designers - a modern, concise textbook on two-dimensional design.  "Graphic design.  Basic concepts "enthusiastically accepted around the world.  Everywhere we went, everywhere we met teachers and young designers who used the book and learned something new from it.  What is the difference of this edition?  It was revised and supplemented by new ideas that were born in our classrooms at the Maryland College of Art, MICA.  And, most importantly, a completely new chapter was written - it opens the book - dedicated to form-morming (the term was introduced by Jennifer Cole Phillips).  Form Streaming is a set of structured techniques for generating visual solutions to graphic design problems.  We open the book with this chapter to immediately immerse readers in the world of visual creativity. <br><br>  As teachers with many years of experience in secondary and higher education, we have seen that the scope of design is constantly changing, responding to the emergence of new technologies.  In the 1980s, when we ourselves were students, classic books, such as Armin Hofmann's Guide to Graphic Design, published in 1965 (Armin Hofmann, Graphic Design Manual), began to become obsolete in the restless and unstable design world.  Postmodernism was on the rise, and abstract design exercises ran counter to the then interest in appropriation and historicism.  In the 1990s, design teachers were forced to teach (and learn) computer programs, and many of us found it difficult to combine technical skills with visual and critical thinking.  The form is sometimes lost as design methodologies have moved away from universal visual ideas and come closer to a more anthropological understanding of design. <br><br>  In this book, we tried to bridge the gap between software and visual thinking.  Focusing on the form, we included the pioneering work of modernist designers - from Joseph Albers and Laslo Mohoy-Nadia from Bauhaus to Armin Hofmann and such great teachers as Malcolm Greer.  We started this project when we noticed that our students are not easily given the construction of abstract concepts.  They worked great with the components of pop culture, but they felt less confident, changing the scale, rhythm, color, hierarchy, grids and properties of diagrams.  This book is intended for students and novice designers and is illustrated mainly by the works of our students.  MICA College has become our laboratory.  Many teachers and students took part in our bold experiment.  The works presented on these pages are very diverse and heterogeneous, which reflects the natural difference in skills and range of cultural characteristics.  Unless otherwise indicated, the work belongs to a MICA student;  Several projects were created by invited representatives of other schools or those in which our graduates taught.
