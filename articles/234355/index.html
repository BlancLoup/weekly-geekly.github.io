We have already written a lot about ourselves - who we are, why and from where.  In fact, all these preliminary posts of general informational nature were a prelude to what the platform was created for - helping decent startups to attract investments.  Moreover, for this relatively short period, more than 200 of them registered on our website and a rather high percentage of them have the potential for financing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/942/7e6/cfb9427e6a884a2e95d5a6bc674ee4c0.jpg"><br><br>  It is time to show the goods face.  From this point on, the VCStart blog will regularly cover projects counting on crowdfunding investing, the ideas of which seemed to us promising and interesting.  And one of them is the <a href="https://vcstart.com/project/quickorder/%3Fref%3Dhabr0007">mobile service QuickOrder</a> . <a name="habracut"></a>

      The project is a cloud-based CRM utility that optimizes the relationship between the restaurant business and its client with the help of digital technologies, which ultimately significantly increases the level of service and has a positive effect on sales. <br><br>  Forrester Research assesses the mobile CRM market as fast-growing.  More and more Western companies in the integration of CRM (Customer Relationship Management) into their business are focused on mobile solutions.  Such a direction for its activities was chosen by the Russian project QuickOrder, covering at once all the main mobile platforms - iOS, Android and Windows Phone. <br><br>  As a target audience for integrating their software, QuickOrder developers took the restaurant business and, in the future, a chain of restaurants and fast-food cafes.  Applications are electronic menus of cafes and restaurants, with the ability to receive payments.  With their help, the service offers a wide range of opportunities for both restaurateurs and customers. <br><br>  For the first, QuickOrder is an effective communication channel with visitors and a tool to increase the revenue of the establishment.  With the help of the software, the institution forms a knowledge base about visitors, improves the quality of service and optimizes the work of the staff.  In addition, the software provides tools for collecting statistics and analytics. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Shelekhov, CEO QuickOrder: </h4><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/3dc/b57/f953dcb576e340e6a819a187b4eea3ed.png" alt="image"><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúAt the disposal of the restaurateur now there are no comprehensive effective tools to answer the question:‚Äú Who is your guest? ‚Äù(For example: Sergey, 29 years old, walks on Wednesdays and Fridays, after 19:00, usually orders pizza and takeaway coffee) and while still getting a tool that uses this information to increase the average bill and / or number of visits, which ultimately affects the revenue.</i>  <i>We implement all this in QuickOrder.</i>  <i>For guests, we provide the convenience of ordering food and payment without unnecessary expectations, as well as nice bonuses and discounts specifically for users of the application. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Users of the service also have something to attract.  Customers of restaurants directly in the application can see information about the institution, contacts, news, photos, as well as browse the menu and order selected dishes. <br><br>  Recently, the international chain of coffee shops Starbucks announced that it is introducing an ordering system and the subsequent payment of coffee through an application in a smartphone.  QuickOrder users got this opportunity even earlier.  Having tied a bank card to his account, a client can pay her in a restaurant without any participation of the waiter.  In mobile applications of the service, the full cycle ‚ÄúChoose.Order.Pay‚Äù is available, which is integrated with the institution's cash system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/891/a97/6d0891a97bd34fb8a45b07257b6b52a5.jpg"><br><br>  Additional motivation to download the app, rather than go to the restaurant in the old fashioned way (wait for the waiter to place an order, then wait again to pay) is also present.  Registered users have access to a list of promotions and special offers of restaurants, and in some of them when ordering through QuickOrder, visitors receive discounts ranging from 20% to 50%. <br><br>  For guests of restaurants working with applications is as follows.  Downloading QuickOrder (for free, of course) in the application store of your mobile platform, we register in the service - you can log in via Vkontakte or Facebook, let the application determine the geolocation, go to the search section, find the restaurant of interest, scroll through the menu, select the dishes, find on the table, for which we sit, the QR code for which we place an order. <br><br>  The application interface is intuitive, difficulties in working with him will not arise.  In addition, you can use filters by choosing a restaurant according to the parameters you need.  And in one of the latest updates appeared the function of food delivery to the house.  In short, the utility is quite convenient and functional if you often visit restaurants and cafes. <br><br>  More than 5500 people use QuickOrder applications for different platforms.  Among the service partners are a number of restaurants and cafes, including the popular metropolitan Tsurtsum and ArteFAQ.  The monetization model is also understandable - the institution pays for setting up a CRM infrastructure and creating a modern image, in return for optimizing service and potentially high audience of the application.  Everything is thought out, works, and corresponds to the stated capabilities.  At first glance, it‚Äôs not even entirely clear why the developers needed funding. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jh3Btqazyx8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7qVWkcE-cy_dix-96fNWpjuO8bg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  However, not all so simple.  The QuickOrder sowing stage has been successfully completed, it is time to market, and this will require funds.  First of all, the start-up team needs to seriously address the expansion of its geography and the involvement of the maximum number of restaurateurs to create an extensive federal base.  We need good sales people and PR specialists in the state.  Restaurants also need, first of all, a wide audience, which QuickOrder can quickly achieve by bringing applications to the tops of their platforms.  Therefore, an advertising campaign for the promotion of the application, as a measure to popularize it, would be a logical and necessary step. <br><br>  To attract the necessary funds, the project is ready to give investors a 30 percent share.  <a href="https://vcstart.com/project/quickorder/%3Fref%3Dhabr0007">Investing in its development</a> , as well as in dozens of other interesting startups, is possible on <a href="https://vcstart.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr0007">the VCStart collective investment platform</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234355/</a></p>
