      fill in the profile, album and each record <b>as completely as possible</b> . <br><br>  Genre.  Tags  Tongue.  With / without vocals (and male / female vocals?).  Used tools.  Pace.  Specify everything.  Service search allows you to specify multiple tags.  Fill everything in detail and correctly - help your listeners find you.  Through the search and not only.  After all, there is <br><br>  <b>recommendation system</b> .  Demonstrated at the beginning of the article.  In the right column of the artist / album / song page, a block is displayed ‚Äúif you like it, you may like it and ...‚Äù.  It seems that in addition to the genre, tags, etc.  likes / dislikes are taken into account.  While frankly bad recordings, the system did not advise me. <br><br><h4>  In words, everything is fine.  Does it work? </h4><br><br>  We uploaded our single in mid-January.  Now there are 1116 auditions and 21 downloads (the whole album was downloaded 5 times).  At first I doubted that there was no external influence.  An article about recording our single was unexpectedly popular, let it happen a month before uploading to <i>Jamendo</i> . <br><br>  However, later our guitarist laid out his solo work there.  And now he has 1020 plays.  Almost caught up, scoundrel. <br><br><h4>  And what other services? </h4><br>  <i>Last.fm</i> - 60 auditions and 7 listeners from mid December. <br><br>  <i>RealMusic</i> brought 4 downloads and a couple of auditions. <br><br>  There are no statistics on <i>kroogi.com</i> , as well as the recommendation system. <br><br>  Our <i>SoundCloud</i> received a good dose of Habr, because it makes no sense to take into account the data from it.  But the account with my solo work earned only 96 auditions in six months. <br><br>  At <i>ThankYou,</i> we have not yet laid out anything, but there is also no such recommender system there, as well as on other services known to us.  I think we got so many auditions thanks to her and the number of <i>Jamendo</i> users. <br><br>  All these services seemed to tell me: ‚ÄúHey, we can listen and download songs from here for these cool guys that everyone knows.  Well, who wants to - you can search among the rest. ‚Äù  Only <i>Jamendo</i> constantly reminds: "In addition to these tough guys, there are more of these, you might like it."  And yes, quite often the system is right. <br><br><h4>  Statistics, likeslose, button download, online listening - great.  What about the other buns? </h4><br><ul><li>  Listeners can leave reviews for the album / song. </li><li>  You can start a blog yourname.jamendo.com and write news in it </li><li>  Anyone who has become your fans on Jamendo can write a letter. </li><li>  You can get the code of the song / album widget for embedding in the site (customize the look).  The widget allows you to listen, download, share on social networks. </li><li>  There is a <i>donate</i> button.  But this feature is limited to <i>PayPal</i> , <i>Kroogi.com,</i> and <i>ThankYou are</i> more flexible in this regard. </li><li>  You can become a member of <i>Jamendo PRO</i> .  Then anyone can buy the right to use your music for commercial purposes.  And if you are selected for one of the <a href="http://www.jamendo.com/en/radios">radio channels</a> , you will receive money for that.  I can not say how much.  IMHO - a bit </li></ul><br><br><h4>  "The interface is English-speaking, even when choosing the Russian language" </h4><br>  This is true.  But it is gradually being translated, recently there has been a major update of the localization section of <a href="http://artists.jamendo.com/">artists.jamendo.com</a> (for bands and performers).  Gradually translate everything. <br><br>  In addition, the word " <i>download</i> , <i>share</i> " knows many people who do not speak the language.  Yes, and much is clear intuitively. <br><br><h4>  So is there a Russian on this service or not? </h4><br>  There are a lot of Russian-speaking people there.  Both performers and listeners. <br><br><h4>  "We need to mess with the papers and the right to confirm" </h4><br>  This is a plus.  Indicator that the service is serious.  And one of the reasons for its popularity.  How else to sell your music?  We need documentary evidence of compliance with all rights. <br><br>  And where is the fuss?  Paper one - certificate.  After completing the creation of the artist on <a href="http://artists.jamendo.com/">artists.jamendo.com</a> and filling in the personal data of the copyright holder, you receive a certificate for downloading.  Print out, enter <br><ul><li>  address </li><li>  other holders of rights (or put a checkmark in "[]", confirming that the only copyright holder) </li><li>  place where signed </li><li>  date </li><li>  signature </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/214/4f8/35d/2144f835d17e6b95cf7db31fe1db85f2.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://forum.jamendo.com/index.php%3Fp%3D/discussion/11002590/esli-vash-albom-ne-publikuetsya-spryatan-ili-udalen/p1">a source</a> <br><br>  It remains only to send it by fax or <i>email</i> .  Everything.  Other, including the license and participation in the <i>PRO</i> , already through the site. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúAnd if there are no auditions?‚Äù </h4><br>  Hence, little information is indicated.  Or your creativity is at a very low level.  No one but you can help you here.  Develop and try again. <br><br>  Or maybe humanity has not grown to your art.  Then it's not about service - you just have to wait.  From year to several centuries. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  A good (at least) recommendation system, a decent (at least) search and a large number of listeners will give you a large audience for beginners.  Russian users a lot.  All modern internet buns available.  You can earn.  All the fuss with certificates and filling tags / genres is justified.  Russian localization in the process. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> : the service is quite suitable for the role of one of the main platforms for laying out music.  Naturally, one should not be limited to one. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And there are spots on the sun.  About errors, shortcomings, write in a personal, so quickly react and correct.  And, of course, specify alternatives.  Surely there are many others besides those mentioned, including those that support <i>Creative Commons</i> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211849/</a></p>
