The producer of the project is Sergey Pimenov. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">MADEINRUSSIA.TV</a> is the first Russian Internet TV channel of high resolution.  In addition to the method of distribution - broadcasting occurs on the Internet - this channel has a special image quality.  Thanks to the use of HD (high definition) technology, the picture is even better than the standard DVD currently considered to be the standard. <br><br>  Video is becoming increasingly popular on the Internet due to the increasing speed of subscribers to connect to the network and all new web services.  However, the vast majority of clips and programs that can be seen on the monitor screen, to put it mildly, do not meet the requirements of the most demanding viewer - the image size is 320 by 240 pixels and the slurred sound kills even the most beautiful idea.

      One of the tasks of the new TV channel is to push the scope of the computer user‚Äôs usual view of the video, to show how well the filmed, mounted and shown visual line may differ from what is accepted to watch on the Internet.  The screen will show the smallest details that before, due to the imperfections of the technology, remained behind the scenes. <br><br>  The name - <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">MADEINRUSSIA.TV</a> (‚ÄúMade in Russia‚Äù) - was chosen, of course, not by chance, and not only because the new TV comes from this country.  All the stories that the audience will see will be devoted to all that is happening in Russia.  ‚ÄúWe want to show our homeland beautifully and at the same time technologically,‚Äù says Sergey Pimenov, producer of MadeInRussia.  Topics for gear are not limited to almost anything.  If it's interesting, stylish, beautiful - it will be on the air.  Starting from the spectacular performances of Russian VJ, ending with cultural material on the art of sawing with a jigsaw.  And all this in stunning quality, backed by professional editing and soundtrack from the best domestic sound producers. <br><br>  The <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">MADEINRUSSIA.TV</a> format <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">does</a> not involve long plots; all videos will take no more than 5 minutes, so the viewer will not be bored.  The first issues are already recorded and ready to be distributed.  Their lead was chosen by Tina Charles, a well-known media character.  In the future, a variety of personalities will take its place - they will all be bright and extraordinary people with their own point of view on events. <br><br>  The fundamental difference between the new TV and the fact that we watch on TV every day is that MadeInRussia is not streaming, but the so-called ‚Äúon demand‚Äù television.  In other words, the structure of the ether itself is networked, not linear.  ‚ÄúThe spectator himself can choose what and when to watch him, and download exactly those programs that he wants.  You will not have to wait for an interesting show for hours and worry if you missed, ‚Äùnotes Rustam Mirzoev, producer of MadeInRussia TV.  To do this, do not even have to go to the site - you can subscribe to the RSS and get the latest videos "home delivery".  In addition, all the plots can be downloaded in a lower resolution - up to the same 320 by 240 pixels.  Convenience and choice are the basics of new generation television. <br><br>  The <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">MADEINRUSSIA.TV</a> channel focuses primarily on those who are not satisfied with the quality of on-air TV and Internet video and who understand what HD is and are able to appreciate the advantage of the new technology.  The editors of <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/">MADEINRUSSIA.TV</a> will follow the audience‚Äôs reaction on the website and in blogs, as well as raise topics that the viewers themselves suggest.  Sergei Pimenov: ‚ÄúThis is the very interactive - what we lack in standard TV.  Live interaction with the viewer, a lively reaction.  We will be releasing what is interesting to the audience. ‚Äù <br>  ¬© Text taken <a href="http://madeinrussia.tv/about/">here.</a> <br><br>  What is unusual. <br>  You can comment on the video and the project itself not only on the site itself, but also on the most popular blogs.  The video is simultaneously published on YouTube, Rutube and some other video hosting sites.  Also, information is published on popular blog services such as LJ, Li and others, where users can also comment and discuss the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8228/</a></p>
