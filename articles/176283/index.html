Today we look at the younger model - HTC Windows Phone 8S, which can serve as an excellent entry ticket to the world of the new mobile OS. <br><br>  Windows Phone NTS devices were designed taking into account the features of the system, and the source of inspiration was a simple and modern interface, which is based on interaction with people close to you.  In the end, the phone is designed specifically for this, and the smartphone only brings additional convenience to the process.  Why, even look at him nicely! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fb/c12/8df/6fbc128df0b737d25c31fdca2263f7ce.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  HTC 8S is made of practical matte plastic, completely immune to stains and minor scratches.  The device will look like new under almost any conditions, and the build quality does not leave any complaints, despite the presence of a removable part on the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/079/4af/4ca/0794af4cabbcc50c39a7ab3afbe00d6f.jpg"><br><br>  Next to it is the logo Beats Audio - an algorithm that allows you to make the sound in the headphones more saturated.  In addition, the speaker is located next door, and on the back wall you can find a five-megapixel camera and LED flash.  The front side of the device, as expected, takes a four-inch display, made by technology Super LCD.  The composition of the control buttons is standard for WP8, so there are no surprises. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b36/091/d34/b36091d34d45dbba8a2f3eaedc0bbb6e.jpg"><br><br>  Under the conditions of the modern assortment, the 8S looks downright tiny, but its modest dimensions (120.5 x 63 x 10.3 mm) will definitely delight everyone who has long been eyeing compact, but functional smartphones.  The 8S weighs a bit too - only 113 grams, so it will not pull away the pocket of not only jeans, but also shirts.  To compare the dimensions, we took some comparative photos with current smartphones of today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fb/364/b0f/2fb364b0fcebc8cf043e729dbfbf2475.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9a2/16d/595/9a216d5950e2282682babf4f00b918fe.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bd/83a/2fa/5bd83a2fade1c43d02dcf44712d5cc0f.jpg"><br><br>  Along the perimeter there is a standard set of control keys: on, two-position camera button and volume control rocker.  A careful inspection of the device involuntarily asks the question: ‚ÄúWhere should I insert the SIM card?‚Äù The thing is about the catchy bottom insert, which is easy to detach by gently prying the cover with the nails.  It is under it that slots for microSIM and microSD-cards are hidden.  Despite the fact that the element is removable, no squeaks and backlash are not noticed behind it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd3/f25/726/bd3f25726d8226b4860f25286bf137bd.jpg"><br><br>  Built-in memory - 4 GB, and the maximum amount of expansion cards - 32 GB, so that for the availability of space for storing photos, videos and music, and you can worry.  RAM at the same time - 512 MB, and the device works on the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 platform.  The devices on the WP8 are significantly less demanding on resources than their fellows on Android, so this set is quite enough for fast and comfortable work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/703/19d/8e2/70319d8e285d229b902ecf83250affce.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/891/f78/a1e/891f78a1eaa0a5428007fc506d39a182.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47a/c07/29b/47ac0729b10a50bbba2d78996f195b6b.png"><br><br>  We didn‚Äôt take it for work and conducted several tests using applications available in the Marketplace.  They are the popular AnTuTu Benchmark package and the free WP Bench utility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b29/8eb/7e9/b298eb7e999311260cb021066c329b46.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c70/4b0/a1e/c704b0a1edd13d3590531ef877b5ad0c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c20/4d9/f63/c204d9f635e73894e512524778f4708a.png"><br><br>  So, what is this small but extremely pleasant device capable of?  Of course, all branded "chips" and Windows Phone services are provided, including mobile Office 2013, integration with the SkyDrive cloud service and other features.  For the platform, new applications appear almost daily, and the standard screen resolution within the ecosystem (800x480 pixels) negates any potential compatibility issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0dc/e5d/e20/0dce5de20fe272aa766e3c2cf924b534.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a3/9eb/8d9/5a39eb8d9bad029cbe8246250d1a10c7.png"><br><br>  The photographic side of the device is represented by the main camera, which allows you to take pictures in resolutions up to 2592x1944 pixels.  If necessary, you can use the flash, and all images are stored on the memory card.  In the process of taking pictures, the camera two-way button is very helpful - one of the essential features of smartphones on the OS from Microsoft.  We took several pictures in different conditions, each image is clickable: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/767/9b9/828/7679b98285dd374a9ca96d4ef816b6c5.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81a/9d1/ef2/81a9d1ef29242dfdd33338d0139ea946.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09c/af9/796/09caf979619a8b85cc52f70b69d9cb50.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f9/4f7/cee/4f94f7cee7f1fa1af149b82701eee014.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3a/480/4e6/b3a4804e68eb8dee8374db1008f0eac3.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26b/fe6/c34/26bfe6c34dd7e4f85be178545d8691d1.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c5/1d8/f26/9c51d8f2611afc2b4b2288859371df0d.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f7/9d8/c6f/1f79d8c6f553136d14637a7334cfdaac.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c0/b40/667/0c0b40667aef2260dae47d7628f777ba.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/882/cc6/7e3/882cc67e397bc184a6dee135a6e3b07c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The main effects (b / w, negative, sepia) are available for photos and videos, as well as adjustments to the brightness, contrast and saturation of the picture.  In addition, face recognition is enabled by default, which can be useful in portrait shooting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/273/a01/185/273a011850904c3dc726ad1a7edae29c.jpg"><br><br>  An example video in 720p resolution is available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DjwALMSofko8">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/053/ee2/96b/053ee296bf546e7f41e9ae7344fa3d84.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c07/130/809/c07130809a28ae27c4a07910a0a6177c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d6/501/322/0d6501322a87fb02abc606964f64705e.png"><br><br>  As you probably already know, one of the unique components of Windows Phone 8 is deep integration with social networks.  You can update statuses on Twitter or Facebook, as well as track your friends' activity using built-in hubs, and the chat of the world's largest social network is fully integrated into the messaging service and available with an Internet connection.  In case of problems with the connection, good old SMS will come to the rescue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/854/d82/c21/854d82c21d2596096fd320765084e6c2.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a44/32c/4ce/a4432c4ce3a87bb09fb49cc20bf5e7cb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/293/c45/dc1/293c45dc1bd0c4dc726454c480c5b33a.png"><br><br>  NTS could not fail to provide the device with several proprietary utilities, and among them it is worthwhile to list the hub with news and weather, as well as programs that facilitate the arrangement on the new platform and help in everyday life with banal time savings.  This is a multifunctional unit converter, flashlight and photo editor.  In addition, within the home network, you can stream content to a compatible receiver and display it on the big screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a9/525/407/0a95254076663d2699373f4699e3e655.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/577/727/10f/57772710f37c165f226daee88712852b.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eac/b20/e3e/eacb20e3e1d04039f602e8e41b7a0d21.png"><br><br>  Windows Phone 8 has brought many positive changes to the user experience, and the owners of the devices on this system can do without additional tools to synchronize with the computer, clean up the home screen using smaller tiles and take screenshots with a simple key combination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15c/593/8f8/15c5938f85b93c1980e10eabedce5761.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the fact that HTC 8S belongs to the average price segment, the OS installed on it is not subject to any restrictions, and the speed of its work will pleasantly surprise anyone who will use a neat and nice smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bf/686/49b/5bf68649bd37b2a89bc5782d536f5929.jpg"><br><br>  The battery capacity, by the way, is 1700 mAh, and this figure allows the device to stay afloat for two days.  During this time, the phone was used for calls (oddly enough) and photographing, listening to music took several hours, and the rest of the time it was connected to wireless networks and synchronized data in the background.  Of course, if you wish, you can land the battery in a day, but HTC 8S has a pleasant margin of safety, which is good news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f6/883/09d/8f688309d4d11119891532141357751b.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps, 8S is the best way to get acquainted with a new and dynamically developing platform.  This phone stands out among the many faceless "classmates" and will delight the eye with bright colors and dynamic live tiles every day.  And any variety of dear is worth in the time of immensely prolonged winter, which continues to regale us with monotonous landscapes and the dull gray of the surrounding world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05e/935/d41/05e935d4158637b24beb6989c864b6bb.jpg"><br><br>  The main features of HTC Windows Phone 8S are shown in the table below. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  OS </td><td>  Windows Phone 8 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sizes, mm </td><td>  120.5 x 63 x 10.3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight, gr </td><td>  113 </td></tr><tr><td>  Display </td><td>  Super LCD 4 '' WVGA </td></tr><tr><td>  CPU </td><td>  Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 @ 1 GHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Ram </td><td>  512 MB </td></tr><tr><td>  Memory </td><td>  4 GB + microSD up to 32 GB </td></tr><tr><td>  Network </td><td>  GSM / GPRS / EDGE: 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, HSPA / WCDMA: Europe / Asia: 900/2100 MHz </td></tr><tr><td>  Sensors </td><td>  GPS / GLONASS, accelerometer, proximity and illumination sensors </td></tr><tr><td>  Interfaces </td><td>  Bluetooth 3.1, Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n </td></tr><tr><td>  Camera </td><td>  5 MP, autofocus, LED flash, f / 2.0, 35 mm, HD video recording (720p) </td></tr><tr><td>  Sound </td><td>  Beats audio </td></tr><tr><td>  Battery </td><td>  Li-Ion 1700 mAh </td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176283/</a></p>
