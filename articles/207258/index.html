I think it will be interesting for the habrasoobshchestvo to see what is hidden behind the scenes of the modern ophthalmologic clinic.  I think that for many it is not a secret that Femto LASIK technology is one of the most effective ways to correct vision.  The main task of a femtosecond laser is cutting out a corneal flap - a flap.  This is an extremely important and crucial stage of laser vision correction.

      Today we look at unusual unboxing.  I think that all Habrahabr readers have become accustomed to frequent reviews of new phones / tablets /% devicename%.  But today we will deal with unpacking a much more impressive ‚Äúgadget‚Äù.  This is one of the newest representatives of femtosecond lasers - <b>VisuMax</b> from Zeiss.  This is a very happy event for our clinic - the laser will allow you to correct refractive errors with very high accuracy for a lot of indications.  This article was preceded by a lot of work on choosing the most suitable solution for our clinic, training engineers, doctors, and much more.  I just want to warn you - I am a doctor by training, but I will try to fully disclose the technical details and nuances.  Do not be offended if I make any mistakes - I will be glad to any of your comments. <br><br>  There <u>are a lot of</u> photos and traffic under the cut.  Some of the photos I will try to hide under the spoiler, so as not to inflate the page size to infinity. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Stage One - Rise on the 5th floor </h4><br>  When it comes to most of the equipment for ophthalmology, their delivery and installation do not cause any problems.  But the weight and dimensions of the cargo do not allow to lift it on a standard elevator.  In order to deliver these containers, weighing about a ton, it was necessary to use a crane.  With the help of someone's mother and a number of other obscene expressions, the boxes were successfully placed inside the room of the future operating room. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d48/d67/035/d48d670357c2fb39937d80d47ff810a8.jpg"><br>  There are also a number of problems associated with the manufacturer‚Äôs shipping requirements.  I think that any of you who were engaged in the delivery of servers, faced with restrictions on the angle of inclination of the platform, the limits of overloads.  So here, in the case of violation of these rules - the loss of warranty. <br><br>  Especially delighted with its simplicity tilt sensor.  Inside the balls of non-ferromagnetic alloy - cheating with neodymium magnets will not work. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a47/d6e/d88/a47d6ed883c3b15c59461df70002940c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also on the case is glued the classic indicator of maximum overloads and something strange, intended, as far as I understood, to indicate freezing. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Indicators</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d5/be2/abf/3d5be2abf75b98374d1f684ec20755fa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bb2/868/ab7/bb2868ab776961ff4c94afad2dd8070a.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  After a difficult delivery procedure, all the containers have finally taken their place and you can proceed directly to unpacking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6a/c1e/05a/b6ac1e05a8e0db4b1f286b3d370a0681.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Stage Two - Unpacking </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43f/b05/3f7/43fb053f786383c7d23374c17bb98243.jpg"><br>  To carry out the installation of all the rules and the initial configuration, we received certified service engineers.  The process of their work is fascinating)) Something a bit like unfolding Christmas gifts.  The same long wait for something and the joy of the kind of "gift", which is gradually released from its packaging.  Probably the upcoming holidays predispose. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Laser unpacking</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa8/050/373/fa80503738398685601368018030a801.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/089/eaa/37b/089eaa37b9cbd19154670c448029e4df.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  First unpack the container with the laser itself.  Mount a special ramp for a gentle descent to the floor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/229/993/845/2299938457e9958a7e1bf43bc8f6be87.jpg"><br><br>  Then unpack the operating table.  Its feature is the ability to rotate 90 degrees.  This is necessary due to the specifics of the operation for laser vision correction.  Without going into details, we can say that the primary processing of the cornea and cutting out the flap occurs on the ‚Äúhero of the occasion‚Äù - the femtosecond laser, and directly controlled evaporation of the cornea on an excimer laser.  Thus, the patient rotates between settings during surgery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/882/114/853/8821148539ed8131d30ad7ff85d83c33.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In your organization, too, admins are engaged in carrying loads?))</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Technical Director Ruslan, together with his deputy Alexei, are engaged in the removal of "technological" garbage)) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bf/24a/b58/6bf24ab585f0fa12cf4cf0072b97d907.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6af/e41/cc1/6afe41cc1db76f9677c8350dcacc7ece.jpg"></div></div><br>  In the final, everything is put together and assembled into a holistic platform.  This is necessary to ensure the rigidity of the whole structure and to avoid shifting the operating table relative to the laser system.  Although, in any case, there is absolutely nothing to worry about.  Even in the event that the patient shudders or an earthquake suddenly happens - the eye-tracking system will work, which always monitors the exact position of the pupil in the operating area.  In case of power failure - high-power battery packs with a peak power of up to 1.5 kW. <br><br><h4>  Stage Three - Setup </h4><br>  What exactly happened at this stage is a mystery even for our engineers.  Service engineers faithfully observe the <s>secrets of the codes of the nuclear suitcase</s> technical regulations, which prescribe to restrict access to the internal organs of the laser only by authorized experts.  Even the service manual is stored under super-reliable ciphers inside the rar-archive)) Everything is strictly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/424/56a/42d/42456a42df069550af17d703bb40bec9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91c/990/bff/91c990bff8c0b5d6bfc8f20b873a6b05.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Stage Four - we study near </h4><br>  In general, it must be said that modern high-tech equipment is distinguished not only by its unique functionality, but also by the soul of the designer, invested in the external aesthetics of the product.  This is felt in everything - from the smooth curves of the body, to the nuances of coloring and polishing surfaces.  I'd like to come and touch it.  As a medical product, everything is done with the expectation of frequent treatment with disinfecting solutions and hard ultraviolet quartz lamps.  Pay attention to the keyboard.  No gaps, trackball instead of a mouse.  Everything is permeated with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãfunctionality and ergonomics. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dd/38c/a3f/8dd38ca3f1591eee24e9bb5a5329e3e4.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">View of the working area below.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Laser lenses are closed with a protective cap.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Right technological hole for an ophthalmic microscope that is not yet connected.  Somewhere in the same zone, an optical splitter will be connected to a camera for remote control and recording of the operation protocol. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/367/f3d/0e3/367f3d0e319fe311cd97bcd4b279dad2.jpg"></div></div><br>  Interface.  Inside Windows in some variation after vivisection in the good hands of the manufacturer.  As far as I understand, there is no need to fear BSOD during the operation.  The OS performs a service function for receiving a laser program, processing data and transmitting everything to the controlling low-level laser controller. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf6/bb0/8a9/bf6bb08a941cc4011f8918354daf178d.jpg"><br><br>  Ruslan is testing the rotation of the platform.  This is quite an important point - we need to make sure that both lasers successfully dock in a single working area (looking ahead - everything went well) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/989/d8a/033/989d8a03332459f314da183c7b2b8c23.jpg"><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some more photos near</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f1a/01e/6e6/f1a01e6e6adf4de5bf91bd6bb4c661cc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e42/351/ba9/e42351ba9ebe61cee03d37626ac9f822.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  What did not fit into the frame </h4><br>  In the final, other activities were carried out that are very important for the outcome of the treatment - measurements of humidity, temperature and other parameters.  Even such seemingly unimportant things as the difference in pressure levels inside and outside the operating room were taken into account.  Ventilation is organized in such a way that due to a bit of increased pressure inside, all the dust particles and microorganisms are blown out.  There are certain similarities with the organization of the production of high-purity materials or electronics.  The laminar flow test method is severe and spectacular.  One of our leading ophthalmic surgeons with an impenetrable face walked around the perimeter of the future operating room with a burning candle, keeping a close eye on the deflection of the flame.  Judging by the satisfied expression - the air flow was distributed as it was intended for the project. <br><br><h4>  A small greeting from the female part of our team. </h4><br>  When the female half learned that I was writing an article on Habr, I was immediately pointed out to my complete misunderstanding of the essence of the Friday post.  Especially on the eve of the holidays.  We have many read Habrahabr, despite its preferential IT-orientation.  I was told that they would never forgive if I did not give the opportunity to congratulate everyone.  Therefore, to complete our article will be a photo below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90e/073/6f8/90e0736f8f916c0694a7aab6ae726175.jpg"><br><br>  Svetlana ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sveta-shved/" class="user_link">Sveta-shved</a> ) also asked to convey that they all department decided to participate in their version of ADM and prepared some small gifts to the most attentive habravchanam who can receive them.  What kind of perfidy our girls thought up - even I do not know)) <br><br><h4>  Instead of an afterword </h4><br>  Here is such an article.  A lot of material, a lot of things I want to tell, but you need to follow certain limits.  I will be very glad to any questions and comments.  I will try to answer everything that I can.  In a situation where I can‚Äôt do it myself, I‚Äôll connect engineers and other specialists. <br>  If the dear community like it - you are waiting for new publications on this topic.  There is a very interesting material about the essence of the operation on laser vision correction, according to the methods and technical features. <br>  Thank you all, mastered all the material to the end. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Gift wrapping for the most attentive: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c3/c92/42e/2c3c9242e6b90b41dfa28bfb9695b99b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As soon as we receive feedback from our lucky ones, we will post them here. <br>  <b>UPD2 Video lifting to the floor</b> <br>  Actually, the video is not of high quality.
