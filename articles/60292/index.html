Providers come up with new tariffs, use tricks like "unlimited tariffs *" with a bunch of conditions in small print at the bottom of contracts.  Users swear, blame the much cheaper Internet in Moscow, Kiev or Vilnius, they fiercely dislike the state monopolist, commercial provider structures and want to download-download-download.  Employees of various departments periodically "merge" information, journalists write pompous texts, I traditionally try to understand this tangle. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A new round of talk on this topic began after Beltelecom expanded the external channel to 12 Gbit / s. <br><br><blockquote>  The external gateway of the national telecom operator RUE Beltelecom has expanded to 12 Gbit / s for the second time this year.  Additional speed is provided by the expansion of the channel in the direction of Russia.  At the moment, the gateway in the direction of Russia provides 10 of 12 Gbit / s. </blockquote>  <a href="http://providers.by/2009/05/minsk/beltelecom/beltelekom-rasshiril-vneshnij-kanal/">¬©</a>

      Users who are not very well aware of the situation with the provision in the country began to hope for lower tariffs and an increase in speed of both Beltelecom and private providers.  Hope was unfounded - because at the moment the external channel is not too loaded.  For example, private providers buy a share of approximately 2 Gbps from Beltelecom.  And even the largest service provider in the country - the same Beltelecom - does not eventually load the gateway at 100%. <br><br>  Commercial providers do not provide high speeds and cheap anlim due to the fact that their external channels can not afford it.  On average, a guaranteed bandwidth of 1 Mbit / s costs about $ 1000, and this is a consequence of high prices for traffic and, as a result, a small (what is 2 Gbit / s across the country) demand for access to the gateway. <br><br>  The high price of Beltelecom could be explained by the prices of Russian partners, which the national operator pays.  But recently, the Web has such a drain: <br><br><blockquote>  But the purchase price of the external channel for a long time remained a mystery.  Electroname.com got the deal details.  So, the initial commercial offer of the Russian company was $ 34.5 per 1 Mbit / s.  Tense negotiations led to a decrease in the price of the offer and now Beltelecom has the opportunity to connect "to civilization" for only $ 18.5. </blockquote>  <a href="http://electroname.com/story/2429">¬©</a> <br><br>  Accordingly, the question arose: why does Beltelecom wind 3000%?  It is clear that there are expenses for personnel, for the maintenance and development of the network, but not such space money!  The situation was somewhat clarified by the conversation with Alexey Fedorinchik from Beltelecom, who, firstly, did not confirm (but did not deny!) The price of $ 18.5, rightly calling it a trade secret, and secondly, he told the official reasons for the high price markup. <br><br><blockquote>  If the most part of providers bears first of all the expenses related to the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù (the channel from the subscriber to the PBX, and from there to their servers), then Beltelecom is forced to build core networks throughout the country.  Also, high prices are still due to certain social responsibilities: RUE Beltelecom carries high-tech services in the depths of the world and has huge losses on these projects. </blockquote>  <a href="http://providers.by/2009/05/minsk/beltelecom/beltelekom-zarabatyvaet-na-provajderax-3000/">¬©</a> <br><br>  In the discussion of the material from which the quotation above was given, two versions were born: <br><br>  1) Commercial providers do nothing useful, they only earn money through mediation, like shuttle traders selling clothes on the market. <br><br>  2) Beltelecom's core network pays off in less than a year at current rates, which means that after a payback period, the monopolist could lower prices, thereby contributing to the penetration of broadband access in the country. <br><br>  Here we get to an interesting aspect.  In Belarus, the state is following the development of telecommunications. <br><br><blockquote>  According to the plans of the Council of Ministers, brought to the Ministry of Communications and Information, nearly two million subscribers must be connected to broadband data networks in order to successfully implement the state strategy by 2010.  At the same time, the main operator of RUE Beltelecom has undertaken to bring its own subscriber base to just a million, thereby providing a plan to private providers.  The latter, due to the inflexible policy of the monopolist, actually have no means for further development.  . </blockquote> <a href="http://it.tut.by/news/93919.html">¬©</a> <br><br>  That is, providers will have to connect a million subscribers.  Mostly Minsk subscribers.  About 2 million people live in Minsk, this is where the main interests of private providers lie.  In the regions, the activity of private providers is minimal, there is dominated by a monopolist who was able to build an unprofitable backbone network.  The reason is that now the provider business is low profitable.  Investing in the construction of reference networks in the republic now seems hardly possible, since  The market situation can at any moment kill small providers and put large ones on the verge of closure. <br><br>  Over the past two years, Beltelecom has reduced prices for end users by 81% (tariffed traffic) and 91% (unlimited tariffs).  For providers, prices have dropped over this period by 43.38%.  It would be like squeezing out of the market if it were not for the obvious logical errors.  Beltelecom is a state structure, and only a very naive person is inclined to believe in the absence of a dense mutually beneficial connection between the national operator No. 1 and the Ministry of Communications.  That is, there would be a desire - providers could be ‚Äúkilled‚Äù by strict laws.  And the laws, in turn, are only becoming more liberal for providers, allowing new activities such as Wi-Fi provider.  It is also worth considering that Beltelecom receives about $ 2 million a month from providers for resale of access ‚Äúto the world‚Äù from providers.  Pleasant help for the budget of the state organization, which can not be simply reclined. <br><br>  But back to the ‚ÄúElectronic Belarus‚Äù.  Providers in the current conditions obviously will not scrape a million subscribers, because now the provider with 10 thousand cross-connected ADSL connections is considered large.  It is difficult to imagine the scale of incentives that these companies would need, and they are not needed - instead of helping them, they are frankly under pressure. <br><br>  The site I am inclined to believe, Marketing.by, is <a href="http://marketing.by/main/market/news/0029182/">already predicting mergers between</a> providers.  It sounds believable: now providers are obviously hanging by a thread.  Should there be a devaluation, which will increase the price for providers (for them it is pegged to the currency, but for the end user byfly - not), or another reduction in the price for the end user (for example, Beltelecom likes to lower prices during the PTS in the fall) - and providers tumble down like thin birch trees during a hurricane. <br><br>  We make bets, gentlemen.  Providers are sick, they will help or shock dose of vitamins, or life-giving euthanasia.  So far, in the role of doctor "Beltelecom", and it will not work to change, unless there is a drastic change in the strategy and level of interaction between providers.  And users have already prepared places to monitor the agony of patients. <br><br>  By the way, already now for the end user the connection to byfly from Beltelecom is a queue and a shortage of ports on the PBX.  But the brand byfly is more and more loved by the masses.  The state has found opium for an addicted people who have already tasted the charm of broadband Internet access. <br><br>  <i>I would like to say thank you for the help in selecting information for the sites <a href="http://providers.by/">Providers of Belarus</a> , <a href="http://electroname.com/">Electroname.com</a> , <a href="http://it.tut.by/">IT.TUT.BY</a> , and personally Alexey Fedorinchik as a representative of Beltelecom and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/televizor/" class="user_link">Televizor</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/arseny_info/" class="user_link">Arseny_Info</a> as representatives of a commercial provider <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/adslby">ADSL.BY</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60292/</a></p>
