As an example, you can take a refrigerator - now these devices are equipped with all kinds of temperature and humidity control systems, some refrigerator models even know how to order products themselves on the Internet.  But here the problem with the smell is relevant even for the owners of the most modern refrigerators. <br><br>  If you left something open, did not wrap it in a bag, or did not leave it in a special container - write it was gone, the smell for tomorrow will be on all products and surfaces.  And no protection does not help here, I involuntarily checked it many times.  In addition, it happens that even in the most modern refrigerator some product quickly deteriorates.  The reason is also here - these are microorganisms, some of which feel great at low temperatures.  And it is a pity when you are going to eat something in the morning, you open the door of the refrigerator, and that‚Äôs all - you realize that you‚Äôve left without a snack.  And in other places, the problem of unpleasant odors occurs with enviable regularity.  And it is solved surprisingly simple. <a name="habracut"></a>

      But then they are technology to help us.  The <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/ozonator">device FreshON</a> has recently appeared <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/ozonator">on the market</a> , which will <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/ozonator">eliminate</a> odors, and as a bonus, it will prolong the life of products in the refrigerator. <br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  FreshON is an autonomous wireless device that produces negatively charged oxygen ions.  These ions combine with a molecule of ordinary oxygen, O2, and a triple molecule, O3 (ozone), is obtained.  The ozone molecule is not the most stable, so after a short time it breaks down into molecular and atomic oxygen.  The latter, being a very strong oxidizing agent (recall chemistry), reacts with chemical compounds in the air, destroying them.  In addition, atomic oxygen adversely affects the viability of bacteria and fungi (for example, molds). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/886/642/335/8866423357490524b9ada5db0e450a22.jpg" height="500"><br><br>  As a result, there are no smells, and products are stored longer than usual. <br>  In fact, this is the principle of action of any ozonizer.  But most of them are not autonomous, and they can not be placed in the refrigerator.  Uncomfortable - in the closet.  It is this problem that FreshOn solves. <br><br><h3>  More options </h3><br>  In general, FreshON acts in a similar way not only on the refrigerator and its contents.  The device can help, for example, get rid of the persistent unpleasant smell of shoes (many have such a problem, right?).  To do this, just put the device in the same shoe, and the next morning there will be almost no smell.  Constantly installed in a closed locker with shoes, FreshOn removes odors from all the shoes that are there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/080/58f/bec/08058fbec33226ec99e881ae6674de1e.jpg" height="500"><br><br>  FreshON can be placed in the pantry with food, if you have it, of course.  There will be no smell either, and the same vegetables will practically not rot, if the device is working - the device will not allow multiplying rotten bacteria.  Not forever, of course, but the process will slow down significantly.  Tested by numerous tests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93d/8a3/1fc/93d8a31fce4f9dfd85fd4826d0075467.jpg" height="500"><br><br>  In addition to these examples, the device can be useful in: <br><br><ul><li>  cabinet or shelf for shoes; </li><li>  bathroom, toilet room; </li><li>  toilet places for pets. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  About health </h3><br>  Ozone in large quantities can be very harmful to health.  With FreshOn, this problem does not arise, because  ions produced quite a bit.  Its beneficial effect is achieved by working in a closed space. <br><br><h3>  Personal experience </h3><br>  Once, before the weekend, I put the dishes in the dishwasher, and forgot to turn it on, leaving for the country.  Upon arrival, the dishwasher could be used as a gas chamber, if the device itself was bigger.  The smell was just stifling. <br><br>  After a while, before going on vacation, I put the dirty dishes in the same long-suffering dishwasher and wanted to turn it on before leaving for the airport.  And here it turns out that the house turned off the water.  A machine full of dirty dishes, a two-week absence ... But not to miss the same plane, losing a lot of money.  Nothing else came to mind than to shove FreshON into the car, hoping a little.  A week later he returned, opened the dishwasher - and, oh, a miracle, there was practically no smell. <br><br>  In the refrigerator, FreshON has been prescribed for a long time, there are fewer unpleasant odors (for the sake of fairness, I must say that I store the products correctly, therefore there are few smells)  But stored the same vegetables and fruits really longer. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  The device is small in size, there are no wires.  Works from accumulators or 3 finger-type batteries (AA). <br>  If desired, you can connect an external power supply (not included), but the main advantage of the device is then lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/081/305/f12/081305f12ae2624f5859ed65a8a922b3.jpg" height="500"><br><br>  Battery life: more than 2 months <br>  Power: 0.5 W <br>  Capacity: up to 250 million anions per cubic centimeter of air per minute. <br><br>  Detailed technical information on the device can be found <a href="http://dadget.ru/image/data/products/manuals/mt1082_manual.pdf">at this link</a> (instruction, PDF). <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/ozonator">FreshON</a> is an effective way to get rid of unpleasant odors in an apartment, plus prolong the shelf life of products, both in the refrigerator and in the pantry.  Not only your grandmother will be happy with this device, it will be useful for you too :) <br><br>  =================== <br><br><h3>  Invitation to test dadzhetov </h3><br>  The djadget invites authors interested in testing our devices and writing an objective review for cooperation.
