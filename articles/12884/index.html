  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You're fired! For your own good</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I recently read the opinion of Igor Kuzin, Chairman of the Board of DeltaCredit Bank, regarding the dismissal of employees.  He believes that many managers are afraid to fire people.  But in fact, you should not be afraid of dismissals - <strong>dismissal for a person is an opportunity to find a new chance for success.</strong> <br>  That is, not the most capable employee is sitting in one place, but his boss is thinking ‚Äúhow can he be fired, he has been here for 5 years, and he is a good person and his family has two children‚Äù.  And he continues to sit on, without career growth, somehow fulfilling what he is supposed to perform.  But when there is a crisis in the company or in the economy, this employee is the first to go down. <br>  Cousin's words do not go out of my head.  But the chairman is right.  Sometimes firing is really good for a person.  We all need from time to time a good kick in the ass to get us moving.  Dismissal is a great incentive to try yourself in something else. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A friend of mine wants to quit her job for a long time.  At first she said - ‚ÄúI will quit in March‚Äù, then - ‚Äúafter the holidays‚Äù, the next option is ‚Äúin the summer‚Äù.  Now she tells me that she wants to see through the new year.  The main reason is ‚Äúnowhere to go.‚Äù  But intuition tells me that it is unlikely she will change jobs in the winter.  At the beginning of the summer, she was paid a salary, after the new year she can be raised again.  The farther, the more it grows into its seat, the environment, clings to the material incentives of the organization. <br>  She does not like what she does, she does not like the leadership, but she cannot find the strength to give up everything and leave.  She would be very helpful if the management said to her in person ‚Äúyou are fired!‚Äù.  She could find a new chance of success, find herself in her favorite business.  But in her case, unfortunately, this will not happen - the girl is an intelligent employee, they will not dismiss her. <br>  I worked in the same company for 10 months.  By the seventh month, I realized that I was not satisfied with what I was doing.  I began to notice for myself that the productivity of my labor had fallen.  Because I was not interested.  But I was not fired.  On the contrary, I knew that in a few months I would get a promotion and the salary would also increase. <br>  Fortunately, I found the strength to dismiss myself.  <strong>I gave myself a good kick in the ass and found a new chance for success.</strong>  Almost everyone thought that I was doing a rash act (I went almost nowhere), the management talked with me, from the immediate superior to the head of the organization ‚Äî they wanted me to stay.  But I still left and now do not regret it. <br><br>  In the same company one more employee works, more than 7 years.  He is a classic illustration of the words of Igor Kuzmin.  All 7 years old he occupies one position, only his leaders change.  While I was working, all employees of the department were increased by 25% in salary, he was raised only by 10%. <br>  Some middle managers are dissatisfied with the quality of his work and would be happy to dismiss him, but the president is against it.  He is one of the oldest employees, he has been with us for so long - how can you dismiss him?  A person is not allowed to start in a new place where he could have achieved much greater success.  He is tied to the organization to retirement.  Or until the next crisis, when the first will be reduced. <br>  Do not be afraid to dismiss employees!  You act for their own good! </div>
