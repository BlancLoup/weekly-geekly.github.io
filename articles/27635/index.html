The Swedes themselves are confident that <u>this has been done for the sake of a qualitative breakthrough in collecting information about Russia</u> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Radio Service of the Armed Forces of Sweden (FRA) has the right to completely officially record, copy and analyze the messages entering and leaving the country.  Formally, this is done in order to toughen the fight against terrorism and other threats ‚Äúfrom outside‚Äù.  In fact, all residents of the kingdom fall under the hood, as well as citizens of other countries - after all, even a call, say, to a Finn to a Finn, can go through Sweden, depending on the service operator.

      But the main goal of the ‚Äúhunters for secrets‚Äù is Russia.  <u>This is openly written by authoritative Swedish media.</u>  <u>Here is what, for example, reports the popular magazine CS ("Computer Version")</u> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost of the Russian Internet traffic goes through Sweden and will be available for FRA.  According to our information, obtained from well-informed sources, this is the main reason for the introduction of the new law.  A network of powerful Internet channels surrounds the Baltic and connects Western Russia, including Moscow, with Western Europe and further across the Atlantic.  The division of TeliaSonera, International Carrier, is responsible for a number of the largest channels, thanks to which about 80 percent of the traffic coming from Russia goes through Sweden.  This provides a unique opportunity to listen to electronic communications in Russia, especially at night, when the activity of Swedish clients in the network drops sharply and the power is idle.  The Swedish infrastructure is of high international class, and the user‚Äôs computer, when connecting to the Internet, chooses the most accessible and easy way - here are messages or conversations and cross the Swedish border.  Swedish intelligence can then "trade" the collected information with other countries. " <br><br>  A few hours before the ill-fated vote, a bomb exploded altogether: the fourth channel of Swedish television reported that a secret unit already exists!  "Cable Scouts", it turns out, has already been assembled, prepared and just waiting for the commanders.  "This department was created several years ago, in the expectation that the law will be passed," writes the newspaper "Express". <br><br>  In fact, the day before yesterday, the northern kingdom became the only EU country openly committed to fundamental democratic principles in the name of facilitating intelligence work.  Not all Swedes agree to participate in the experiment "unheard of openness." <br><br>  One of the first outraged local Union of Journalists and the Union of Publishers.  "Swedish citizens will be monitored without the slightest suspicion of criminal activity!‚Äù Said the Union of Journalists Agnetha Lindblum H√ºlten, "People initially become suspects."  Representatives of large businesses are also in alarm - after all, international cooperation presupposes the presence of "company secrets." <br><br>  <strong>The most interesting is that:</strong> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWithout waiting for a vote, the telecommunications giant TeliaSonera left Sweden, which, in order to protect customers, transferred its mail servers to Finland.  Behind him ‚Äúgot ready to go‚Äù and Google: Peter Fleisher, a representative of a famous company, praised the new law in the press as ‚Äúsomething incompatible with Western European democracy.‚Äù <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/24116.4/339273/">www.kp.ru/daily/24116.4/339273</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27635/</a></p>
