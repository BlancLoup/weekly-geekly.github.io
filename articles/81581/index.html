  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hero Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://www.rugeroi.ru/"><img src="http://www.rugeroi.ru/images/L3.gif" alt="image"></a> <br>  Slavik irreplaceable, Nikita Litvinkov, the legendary door washer and many others became famous thanks to the ocean of the world wide web.  And the country, as you know, should know their heroes by sight, that's why we established the prize <a href="http://www.rugeroi.ru/">Hero of Runet</a> .  Already in the first days of its existence, the site was visited by about two hundred thousand people.  And then - more, in the first 2 months about a million people were noted on the site, 4 of them living in Nigeria.  In total, they looked at just over 5 million pages.  On average, users stayed on the site for about 6 minutes, but fanatically-minded Jedi spent more than 10 minutes a day on the site.  The search engines fed the award site well: more than 100,000 people ran into the award at the request of ‚ÄúRunet Hero‚Äù and ‚ÄúRunet Hero Prize‚Äù.  On the hottest days of voting, the site was visited by about 50 thousand people. <br><br>  For almost a month, people constantly voted for their nominees, the struggle was serious, but the winner was finally determined.  They became Ilya Madison, the author of insane video reviews of games and movies.  The army of his fans continuously voted for him, as a result of his detachment from the nearest rival, the cat Manul, amounted to as many as 20 thousand votes.  But Slavik, who was in third place, indispensable, slipped into 4th place and lost the award to omnipresent Anatoly Wasserman. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the second stage of the award, we contacted many nominees and learned a lot of interesting information about them.  For example, Slavik is irreplaceable - not at all Slavik, but Ivan, the passion of his life is a car, he works and lives in his garage.  And Slavik is his friend, who was directly involved in organizing the very legendary jump from the roof of a nine-story building in Krasnoyarsk.  It was really interesting to communicate with him, as well as with other nominees, because they are all interesting personalities.  Their words turn into winged phrases, and their actions become a reason for discussion and admiration. <br><br>  Winners will receive original and interesting prizes.  The physiognomy of Mad, who took the first place, got the opportunity to light up 100 times on one federal channel.  In addition, together with Mad, we will record a unique video message that the whole country will see.  To choose an interesting and original prize for the winners, we organized a competition of statuettes.  Designers laid out their work, and users voted.  As a result, the designer won under the nickname monstur. <br><img src="http://www.rugeroi.ru/images/aw.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Now, when the voting is over and the winner is determined, we can say with confidence that the project has been a success.  An indicator of this is the high attendance of the site and the active voting for the nominees.  Next year there will be new nominations and interesting prizes, it remains only to find new nominees, in which there will definitely not be a shortage. </div>
