  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Many worlds of Hugh Everett, 50 years from the publication of the article Mnogouriya ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scientific American published an article in honor of Hugh Everett's 77th birthday - ‚Äúa brilliant mathematician, icons of quantum theory and then a successful defense industry contractor who had access to the nation‚Äôs most sensitive defense information‚Äù, as well as the 50th anniversary of his article on his multiverse . <br><br><blockquote>  QUOTE <br>  Everett's scientific journey began one evening in 1954, as he recalled a couple of decades later, "after a portion or two of sherry."  He, his collaborator on Princeton Charles Meisner, and a guest named Aage Petersen (then assistant Niels Bohr) reflected on the "wacky things in the consequences of quatt mechanics."  In the course of this, Everett found the basic idea behind his theory of many worlds, and the following week he began to form it into a thesis. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãHugh Everett (let me explain how I understand it, and if you want to present it in your own way - use the comments) is that this particle is not in an inaudible state, either on the right or on the left, and the measurement pushes it into one, as per the theory of Niels Bohr, but simply the universe forks - in one it is on the right, in the other on the left.  It divides, of course, like Niels Bohr at the time of measurement.  In general, "and where did you put the keys to the car ???" It is possible that they are true, some in the toilet, others in the bedroom, and still others in their pockets.  And at the moment when you asked this question, the universe divided into three - one for each option. <br><br>  The article was written by Peter Byrne, a journalist and popular science writer who is currently working on the biography of Hugh Everett.

      Some dates from the life of Hugh Everett: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ November 11, 1930 - born in Washngton, DC <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1943 - Albert Einsten replied to a letter from young Hugh <br>  ‚Ä¢ Autumn 1953 - enrolled at Princeton's ‚Äúgraduate physics program‚Äù (fourth year) with academic advisors Eugene Wigner and John Archibald Wheeler. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Winter 1954-1955 - began work on a dissertation on quantum mechanics <br>  ‚Ä¢ January 1955 - the first version of the thesis ‚ÄúThe Theory of the Universal Wave Function‚Äù is ready <br>  ‚Ä¢ Spring 1956 - Wheeler (head Everett) discusses a draft draft in Copenhagen with Niels Bohr and other leading physicists, and receives a negative reaction <br>  ‚Ä¢ June 1956 - accepted the offer from Pentagon's Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) for research work <br>  ‚Ä¢ August 1956 - March 1957 - the thesis was rewritten in a very truncated form <br>  ‚Ä¢ November 1956 - married to Nancy Gore <br>  ‚Ä¢ November 1956 - appointed head of the WSEG Mathematics Department <br>  ‚Ä¢ April 1957 - The dissertation committee accepts a truncated version of the '' Relative state 'formulation of Quantum Mechanics " <br>  ‚Ä¢ May 1957 - Review of Modern Physics editor Bruce DeWitt insists in a letter to Everett that "the real world does not divide." <br>  ‚Ä¢ June 1957 - the same journal publishes Everett's truncated dissertation with the von Wheeler commendation. <br>  ‚Ä¢ June 1957 - defended his thesis (Ph.D.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ July 1957 - Elizabeth's daughter was born <br>  ‚Ä¢ April 1963 - son Mark was born <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1964 - Everett and his colleagues form Lambda, a firm specializing in defense contracts <br>  ‚Ä¢ September 1970 - DeWitt (who argued with Everett in 1957) publishes a story in Physics Today, endorsing Everett's theory <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1973 - Everett left Lambda and set up the WBS data processing company. <br>  ‚Ä¢ December 1976 - Everett's theory is popularized in the science fiction magazine Analog <br>  ‚Ä¢ July 19, 1982 - died in bed from a heart attack <br>  ‚Ä¢ June 1985 - David Deutsch offers a quantum computer model based on the Everett model <br><br>  Fantastic works based on Everett's theory: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The Coming of Quantum Cats by Frederick Pohl - Spectra, 1986 <br>  Copies of heroes travel back and forth in numerous alternative time lines. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quarantine by Greg Evan - Harper-Collins, 1992 <br>  The world is a multiverse, all reasonable races understand this and use it with pleasure.  Except one.  Everywhere, where the human sight penetrates, the multiverse collapses into one single reality, destroying alternative universes and all who live in them.  The aliens inhabiting the multiverse see no other way out how to put quarantine on the Earth, isolating it with an optically impenetrable sphere. <br>  ‚Ä¢ His Dark Materials (trilogy) by Philip Pullman - Knopf, 1995-2000 <br>  The trilogy captures several alternative universes.  In one of them, the hero mentions the work of Everett in 1957.  In another, a pair of theologians proposes a "multi-world" heresy. <br><br>  In Everett's personal life, everything was not very good.  Having burned himself in science, Everett was cold and detached, not to mention his addiction to alcohol.  His son Mark, then still a teenager, discovered his lifeless body in the bedroom on July 19, 1982.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know how to react to the fact that my father had just died,‚Äù Mark recalls. ‚ÄúI have never had a real relationship with him.‚Äù Daughter Everett Elizabeth a month before that attempted suicide.  Mark found her insensible in the bathroom and was able to deliver her on time to the hospital.  In 1996, she did kill herself with an overdose of sleeping pills, leaving a note that she would live with her father in an alternative universe. <br><br>  More seriously about Everett's theory and about himself can be read, for example, in these books: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The Many-World Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.  Edited by Bryce S. DeWitt and Neil Graham.  Princeton University Press, 1973. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The Fabric of Reality by David Deutch.  Penguin Books, 1997. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Biographical Sketch of Hugh Everett, III by Eugene Shikhovetsev, 2003. <a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/everett">space.mit.edu/home/everett</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Science and Ultimate Reality: Quantum Theory, Cosmology, and Complexity.  Edited by John D. Barrow, Paul CW Davies, and Charles L. Harper, Jr.  Cambridge University Press, 2004. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Everett.
