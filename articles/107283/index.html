  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Unifying and destructive internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I read an article about the statements of the chief architect of Microsoft Ray <br>  Ozzy on building on cloud computing tasks and simplifying <br>  devices to connect users.  It all resembles the development of <br>  spirals. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once we programmed on large EU machines and for <br>  data used simple terminals.  Studying in the MEPI in the 80s, we still <br>  used punch cards to enter our program code for processing in the EU.  AT <br>  In the early 1990s, we received the first personal computer of the 286 series and <br>  were happy.  We had a doer who locked the computer in the safe and gave out <br>  its strictly on schedule.  Now in my family, one and a half computers per member <br>  families, including a four-month baby.  And technological progress leads us to <br>  A new round of spiral - cloud services that will allow processing <br>  tasks faster and cheaper.  And the Internet in this case plays a unifying role. <br>  This is great, just great.  Enough to have at home unpretentious <br>  computer, and all applications can be used via the Internet.  Is coming <br>  one more qualitative leap in information technology.  We will all be <br>  jump with happiness! <br><br>  Now it's time to talk about the destructive power of the Internet.  Have you ever <br>  watched the movie "The Dead Season"?  Let me remind you that a movie about <br>  a scout seeking former Nazi doctors who invented gas for <br>  management people.  For some reason, the whole Internet reminds me of one big gas one. <br>  camera filled with gas to control people.  Moreover, gas is often released <br>  poor quality.  By the way, the Nazis took into account that a man-robot should be happy <br>  all the time.  I understand that it is beneficial for the capitalist to have a human robot.  I think, <br>  that if there was an opportunity they would fully automate all processes, and <br>  people were given just chowder every day and some kind of sleeper.  The Internet - <br>  the perfect tool to make a human robot.  Inside social networks you can <br>  get to each brain individually, and through Youtube show <br>  ideologically directed material. <br><br>  The destructive power of the internet is that the more we use it, <br>  the more lonely we become.  I have a lot of friends who order food <br>  and buy food and clothing over the Internet, so as not to drive around Moscow <br>  traffic jams.  They also communicate a lot on social networks, and if you need to talk, <br>  then use skype.  Everything!  Man no longer needs to leave the house.  He can <br>  live inside your home.  Our grandmothers talk on the bench near the entrance, and <br>  today's young people in old age will communicate via Facebook.  And I notice that <br>  A person's consciousness is changing, only until I can understand in which direction.

      We are also in some way making a feasible part in the destructive force. <br>  the internet.  On the one hand, our project for an online consultant on <br>  website <a href="http://www.rustalk.net/">www.RusTalk.net</a> &lt; <a href="http://www.rustalk.net/">www.rustalk.net</a> &gt; helps to find another channel <br>  communication between buyer and seller.  But on the other hand, we offer <br>  technologies that allow you to organize a large company where employees <br>  work at home.  The company can be geographically separated, overhead <br>  reduced to a minimum due to transfer to the regions with a minimum wage <br>  fee.  And so all these operator people become cogs in some <br>  the mechanism.  By the way, companies can play a huge social role if <br>  take on the role of operators of disabled people who can not leave the house. <br><br>  There is still much controversy surrounding the issue of nuclear energy.  One side <br>  it provides unlimited opportunities in the energy sector, on the other hand - <br>  the destructive power of the atomic bomb. <br>  And here is a question by analogy: Is it good that the Internet has appeared or is it bad?  Question <br>  very serious and not having a definite answer.  I'm especially serious about this. <br>  thought now, when I see that my son spends so much time in <br>  Internet, zombie his brain.  But maybe you need to relax?  Maybe this <br>  new generation of people?  I invite you to take part in the discussion: Internet <br>  destroys or unites? <br><br>  Follow the news <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rustalk">www.twitter.com/rustalk is</a> also the technology)) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107283/</a></p>
