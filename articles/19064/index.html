      Events on the situation "Atomic alarm" <br><br>  ¬ßone.  Preliminary information. <br><br>  1.1.  The most likely time for a nuclear strike on Moscow is about 18 hours Moscow time.  This is because: <br>  a) 10 am Washington time allows us to prepare and make a strike during the working morning of the relevant security forces, without drawing prematurely increased attention of our intelligence services to the activity of the offices of a possible enemy during off hours; <br>  b) at the end of the working day all types of urban and long-distance communications are overloaded, and coordination of emergency defensive measures is difficult; <br>  c) the attention of the duty services at this time is reduced; <br>  d) a significant part of the population is on the road between places of work and residence, which further complicates the coordination of measures and actions; <br>  e) transport arteries are paralyzed with traffic jams, and the population located in them is primarily unprotected against damaging factors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1.2.  The most likely power of thermonuclear ammunition is from 2 to 10 megatons.  The super-power of the ammunition is limited by the capabilities of the delivery vehicles and is due to the large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Moscow metropolis, the concentration of central reconnaissance and defense units and enterprises in it, and along its perimeter the belt of missile and aviation cover complexes, but first and foremost by the high shelter protection of the presidential and governmental apparatus and management services of the Ministry of Defense, which are the main goal. <br><br>  1.3.  The most likely time from the time of the alert "Atomic alarm!" To the moment of the striking strike: <br>  a) about 14 minutes when launching ground-based launch vehicles from the territory of the Americas; <br>  b) about 7 minutes when launching launch vehicles from submarine-based sea-borne rocket carriers, occupying positions in the North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean. <br>  This corresponds to the flight time of ballistic missiles moving in a supra-atmospheric space along ballistic trajectories with a speed of the order of the first cosmic, that is, 7.9 km / s, or approx.  28,000 km / h  Practically in combat conditions it is possible to foresee some failures and communication delays, which can actually reduce the warning time to a few minutes. <br><br>  ¬ß2.  The ‚ÄúAtomic Alarm!‚Äù Signal is sounded by voice through all channels of television and radio broadcasting, as well as duplicated by the sounds of railway locomotives and floating craft ‚Äî one long beep and two short repeats several times. <br><br>  ¬ß3.  Persons secured by their official position as shelters immediately begin to act in accordance with the evacuation plan in case of nuclear alarm under the direction of civil defense officials, or building commanders, or team leaders, or independently.  It is necessary to act without panic, in an organized manner, without the slightest delay.  Any manifestations of panic should be immediately stopped by any possible means, including the use of force and weapons. <br><br>  After no more than 6 minutes (or earlier by order of the senior asylum officer, who was convinced that there were assigned groups in the asylum), after the first warning signal, all entrances to the asylum should be closed and blocked in the combat mode, despite the cases that did not have time to hide them and the number of those left outside.  Attempts to prevent the closure of entrances by any person, without exception, should be immediately suppressed by any means, including the use of weapons. <br><br>  ¬ßfour.  On the ‚ÄúAtomic Alarm!‚Äù Signal, persons not provided with shelters act independently, depending on where they are at the moment, taking all necessary measures to protect themselves and hiding from nuclear damage factors without delay and panic.  You should act calmly, competently, assessing the specific conditions of your whereabouts, encouraging others to follow your example and instill confidence in them with your voice and action.  The first step is to take care of the safety of children and women, as well as the elderly. <br><br>  4.1.  If the house has a basement, you should take refuge in the basement.  The gap in the door must be shut with any cloth, it can be wetted.  It is useful to take a small supply of drinking water with you. <br><br>  4.2.  While in the building, it is better to take shelter indoors - the internal corridor, the bathroom, the pantry - which is separated from the external walls by an additional partition and has no windows.  It is also useful to plug the door crevices and stock up on water. <br><br>  4.3.  In a room with a window, lie on the floor with your feet to the outer wall, with your head covered with your hands.  Choose a place at the bottom or side of the window so that the light falls on you as little as possible.  It is better to hide from the light behind a heavy object - a wardrobe, a sofa, a table. <br><br>  4.4.  Those on the streets should immediately hide in buildings, at least in their entrances, or use other natural refuges, which include: <br>  a) underground - the best of all possible shelters; <br>  b) any basements, boiler rooms, under ground garages; <br>  c) sewer wells and tunnels of any underground routes; <br>  d) foundations and lower rooms of new buildings; <br>  e) underground passages and automobile tunnels; <br>  f) warehouses, underground toilets, etc. <br><br>  4.5.  Being in public ground transportation, you should immediately leave it and take cover (see above). <br><br>  4.6.  While in the car, you should immediately leave it and take cover (see above).  When the car is in a tunnel should stay in it.  If it is impossible to leave the car in a traffic jam or if there are no shelters nearby, lie on the floor between the seats and cover your head with your hands, protecting yourself from external radiation. <br><br>  4.7.  If it is impossible to hide in any room, lie down on the ground near the building under the wall opposite to the city center, where the epicenter of the explosion will be located.  Try to choose a courtyard well closed on all sides or a narrow passage between buildings. <br><br>  4.8.  When you are in a park area away from possible shelters - identify a thick tree, or a hill, or a ditch, or any unevenness of the terrain, or a monument, and lay your feet on it, facing the city center, where the epicenter of the explosion will be located.  This will protect you from heat radiation, which is the main damaging factor. <br><br>  4.9.  All entrances to the metro on the alert close immediately.  Any manifestations of panic among the population or attempts to counteract the immediate closure of the entrances are suppressed immediately by the police station pickets with appropriate means, including the use of weapons to defeat.  However: <br>  a) all escalators are switched to the descent;  after the descent of all citizens on the station platforms all the escalators stop; <br>  b) station personnel switch the power supply of all equipment to emergency in economic mode; <br>  c) trains from stations do not depart;  trains traveling in tunnels on the hauls continue to the nearest station and remain on it or within the limits of possible proximity; <br>  d) trains that are in the stretches in an open space should reach the entrances to the tunnels and, if possible, go deeper into them. <br><br>  ¬ßfive.  In clear, cloudless weather in daylight, the approach of a declining warhead can be determined by the white inversion trail, similar to that of an aircraft at a higher altitude, arcuately descending from the upper atmosphere towards the center of Moscow at high speed.  Remember: the sound of a flying and declining warhead will not be heard due to its supersonic speed. <br><br>  ¬ß6.  With the accuracy of modern means of targeting, the epicenter of the explosion will be located within the Boulevard Ring, focusing on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Kremlin ‚Äî Lubyanka ‚Äî Arbat. <br><br>  ¬ß7.  In Moscow, we should expect a ground explosion.  This somewhat reduces the total damage radius compared to an aboveground explosion, but increases the seismic wave power, which leads to ground movements such as tectonic disturbances of a nature similar to high power in the upper layers, leading to crushing and destruction of even significantly buried shelters of increased strength in the radius. ten to fifteen kilometers. <br><br>  ¬ßeight.  Heat damage factor. <br><br>  8.1.  At the epicenter of the explosion, a flash of light arises, which is many times greater in brightness than the observed sunlight.  For 0.03‚Äî0.04 sec.  the flash is formed into a dazzling luminous sphere 1.5-2 km in diameter, with a temperature of 10-20 million "C.  It covers the city center within the Boulevard Ring - Kremlin - Glade radius, and everything entering this space instantly ceases to exist, turning into a plasma state. <br><br>  8.2.  Within a radius of 3-4 km, all objects of organic origin that are directly exposed to the direct thermal radiation of the explosion (untouched people, animals, plants, wooden parts of buildings facing the explosion) are instantly evaporated and incinerated.  Asphalt pavements, metal fences, roofs and parts of building structures, concrete and brick walls, including with stone and ceramic cladding, both open to direct thermal radiation of an explosion and hidden to a depth of several meters, instantly burn down, evaporate. .  All substances, both organic sheltered and inorganic heat-resistant, in the radius of the Garden Ring immediately after the moment of explosion burn down within a few seconds with a temperature of tens of thousands of degrees. <br><br>  8.3.  Within a radius of 20-25 km, wooden, plastic, painted surfaces, plants, burned metal roofs, concrete, brick, glass, metal, stone melt;  the window frames are burned, the glass evaporates, the wires melt, the asphalt lights up.  Active fire zone instantly covers the city within the Moscow Ring Road.  Outside the Moscow Ring Road there is a ring forest fire.  Fully built-up arrays and forest-park zones are set on fire.  The Moscow-river and Yauza reservoirs evaporate, the upper layer of the Khimki reservoir boils. <br>  Remember: direct radiation heat exposure lasts from fractions of a second to several seconds and even to several tens of seconds depending on the power of the explosion and extends only in a straight line, i.e. any obstacle between you and the explosion, in the shadow of which you find yourself, can save you life in a situation of sufficient distance from the epicenter of the explosion. <br><br>  ¬ß9.  Striking shock wave factor. <br><br>  9.1.  The action of the shock air wave begins immediately at the moment of the explosion and follows the heat radiation, however, lagging behind its instantaneous impact as the distance from the epicenter of the explosion goes on, the longer the time. In the second zone of damage, the speed of the air shock wave reaches 1-5 thousand. m / s, i.e.  Everything in this zone, and already exposed to heat, is carried by a powerful explosion in the direction from the epicenter to the periphery, turning into the leveled surface of crushed fragments burning with high temperatures (the so-called ‚Äúdeflation of the landscape‚Äù).  The crushed burning debris of substances that were between the radii of the Boulevard and the Garden Ring, are ejected by the shock wave along an expanding concentric circle into zone three. <br><br>  9.2.  In the third zone, i.e., within Moscow within the Moscow Ring Road, the speed of the shock wave somewhat decreases, especially near the surface, but continues to remain above supersonic, i.e., to 300‚Äì500 m / s at the Moscow Ring Road border, which causes instantaneous destruction all ground buildings, both high-rise and low-rise.  Burning and burning parts of surfaces facing the epicenter, mixing up with other materials, give so-called.  "Fire carpet" with a temperature that ensures the burning of metals and the melting of ceramics.  In the process of passing a shock wave, separate parts and parts move in air at speeds of the order of artillery shells, aggravating the process of destruction of everything that rises above the surface.  All plantings are pulled out, water from all reservoirs "is squeezed out". <br><br>  9.3.  The forests, settlements and airports closest to the Moscow Ring Road are also subjected to complete or preferential destruction, partial or complete destruction and combustion. <br><br>  9.4.  Within the entire affected area, a region of sharply reduced atmospheric pressure arises due to both the oxygen burning out of the air and the concentric retraction of the air masses.  As a result, shortly after the passage of the shock wave, a ‚Äúreverse shock wave‚Äù arises, directed toward the epicenter.  It is characterized by a much lower speed, commensurate with the speed of an ordinary hurricane, but it brings to the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãignition masses of fresh oxygen, which creates the effect of "blacksmith furs", creating a so-called.  "Fire storm" in the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãdestruction.  The zone within the Moscow Ring Road is likened to the smoothed surface of hot coals in the furnace. <br><br>  ¬ßten.  The seismic impact of a ground explosion causes an ‚Äúearthquake effect‚Äù with compaction and shearing of the surface layers.  All underground structures of the metro within the Koltsevaya line and the stations closest to it collapse and collapse completely.  All bomb shelters within the Garden Ring are completely destroyed.  All basements within the Moscow Ring Road are completely destroyed.  All sewage and ventilation underground facilities in the space of Prospect Mira, Zoo, Serpukhovskaya, Ploshchad Ilyicha are crushed, destroyed and collapsed.  All entrances and exits from the subway, ventilation shafts, emergency and service exits are filled up, or crushed, or completely blocked by a layer of red-hot mass on the surface. <br><br>  ¬ßeleven.  The external picture of the explosion is usually typical for a high-power thermonuclear explosion.  The white plasma sphere, which, like a two-kilometer cap, covers the center of Moscow and is four times as high as the Ostankino television tower, begins to dim after a few seconds, twitching in a purple smoky veil and separating from the surface, ‚Äúfloating up‚Äù.  The burning city "falls" in all directions, like a domino circle, covered with swirling smoke, and streams of smoke and fire rush from the periphery of the Moscow Ring Road to the rising sphere, forming a characteristic "mushroom stem" that expands down to the limits of the affected area, narrowing above to the sphere which is enveloped in a cloud of "mushroom cap".  Swirling smoke at the foot of the fungus reaches a kilometer in height, the diameter of the "leg" narrows to eight hundred thousand meters under the cap.  The ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù continues to rise, and although the ascent looks slowly due to its gigantic size, in three to five minutes its height reaches 25‚Äì35 km.  With the explosion of high power, this picture can stand up to several hours. <br><br>  ¬ß12.  The fire itself, which does not give an opportunity to begin any rescue work, can continue, taking into account the affected area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Moscow metropolis, up to several days. <br><br>  ¬ß13.  The high radiation background will not allow any rescue work to begin in the megalopolis earlier than in 15‚Äì20 days, with the exception of special operations of special importance.  Any rescue operations should be considered expedient in a zone no closer than 5‚Äì10 km behind the Moscow Ring Road. <br><br>  ¬ß14.  A funnel in the epicenter of the explosion is a crater with a diameter of about 2 km and a depth in the center of up to 200‚Äì300 m. Its surface is a vitreous mass up to 10‚Äì12 m thick. <br>  The second affected area is a relatively flat surface, covered with a layer of vitreous sintered mass with a thickness of 0.3-0.9 m. <br>  The third zone of damage is a bumpy surface, largely covered with a glassy sintered mass with a thickness of several millimeters to several centimeters. <br>  Tests of similar ammunition, conducted by the USSR, the USA and France, have shown with confidence that attempts to carry out any rescue work within the specified radii have no real reason.  The defeat of open and sheltered manpower, equipment and buildings reaches 100%.  Rescue work should be focused on resettling and assisting people who are outside the zone of direct destruction, outside the 100-kilometer zone. <br>  Megapolis Moscow should be considered lost forever, any use of its territory in the next decade is absolutely impossible. <br><br>  ======= <br><br>  The result (without pathos and irony): we all die: ( </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19064/</a></p>
