Nothing new, even the list of books is old.  Silver bullets will not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Comrade S studied little by little, something and somehow, and began, like many, with <s>B</s> J3QQ4.  He graduated as a result of the Higher Educational Institution, with a diploma.

      Comrade G studied close to the subject - the production and programming of microcontrollers, the specialty is called ‚Äúcomputers, complexes, systems and networks‚Äù.  Comrade's opinion: the <i>trick is that the name of the specialty is an outright lie, it was firmly sharpened on chips, and the programming was studied rather superficially.</i>  <i>There was also a specialty ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù, which was taught this, but it was very or not, I could enroll in it, but I wanted to work with iron.</i> <br><br>  Comrade V suddenly turned out to be the most educated - he graduated from a university in the regional center of Ensk with a degree in the automated process control system, and began with them. <br><br>  <b>I'll start with friend G</b> <br><br>  Special signs: at the sounds of the group Slot loses its will.  Bearded.  I started programming on basic under BC, then Spectrum, Pascal, Delphi.  Then - all different.  At the first job, they almost immediately switched to C #, when he (C #) had just left.  At the penultimate place of work, I was busy programming under IOS, from which I had no less suddenly switched to Java under Android. <br><br>  After that, no less suddenly (as suddenly - he responded to vacancies, see below), he was invited to 33 different interviews.  Passed the interview from the second time, passed (after a long study - exercises, grammar) IELTS for many points (8.5), collected socks and went to Holland, where he remains to this day, programming for one fairly well-known organization. <br><br>  <b>What taught and what was useful</b> <br><br>  I did not study on purpose, I had a lot of uninterrupted professional experience and, due to the specific nature of the profession, I mastered several different areas of programming that happened to be correct.  Here's how to succeed?  From my point of view it is very simple, you must first work hard on experience and reputation, and then realize that you want to achieve something concrete - and start to achieve it. <br><br>  What I learn, I think, anyway.  A goblin quotation is appropriate here: a real jigit swims not with the flow and not against the flow, but where he needs to go.  In other words, if you need to achieve something concrete, then you probably need to learn what is required for this. <br><br>  For example, when I interviewed a current job, I was completely humiliated in a telephone interview, but then they said - we will call you back in a month, let's see what you learn.  I made conclusions and learned all that they wanted. <br><br>  The theoretical minimum certainly helps, but a balance is needed. <br><br>  <b>About what you need to know</b> - let's say what are threads, what are objects, how is memory allocated to objects.  This is in most languages ‚Äã‚Äãthere.  For example, the levels of complexity (algorithm) - this is one of the things that I was asked to interview and which I did not know.  But, by and large, you should know two things: the first thing you need to pass the project to the customer, and the second thing you need to pass the interview.  These are two different things, and I, before this work, knew only the first.  Unfortunately, a significant number of people know only the second. <br><br>  <b>About cadres and youth</b> <br><br>  I constantly studied new technologies depending on what the customer wanted.  But it was not so that the type must be developed! 11 new technologies!  - as these young and promising all love, namely, that we have a project, we must do it. <br><br>  <b>Dropout:</b> <br><br>  10% in the first interview remains and 10% of this amount in the second, according to what HR says.  Still *** around.  Mystic. <br><br>  <b>Market evaluation in the Russian Federation:</b> <br><br>  The market is like a market, but you need to go to Moscow, otherwise the work will be on a residual basis.  For students, however, normal, I think.  Just the students all at once without thinking twice about the rod to Moscow and are very deeply surprised that no one needs them there. <br><br>  I personally had no desire to go there, and I outgrew the possibilities of offices available in Ensk. <br>  <b>I got to the current and next to last job through</b> : linkedin and careers.google.com responded and got here. <br><br>  By the way, a good way is to write to the office you want and try to get there.  Even if you do not fit at all, you will know what you need to learn. <br><br>  <b>Comrade V</b> <br><br>  Not bearded.  He started, suddenly, almost in his specialty - a factory, programming microcontrollers, test benches.  Then, no less successfully, he escaped to the zone of the then closed trade, where he mastered C #, C ++, ASP and ASP.Net + MSSQL.  Plus came Subversion, NUnut, SVN.  From distant countries, after the five-year period, I returned to my native Ensk, where I switched to pure C, some Java, and so on. <br><br>  I changed jobs and went deep into the Web ‚Äî css3, doT, ajax, javascript, jquery, and so on. <br>  After another five years of sitting on the stove, for some reason I decided that there were some Jewish roots in it and went to practice in Israel.  However, it turned out that there was still no (Opinion: <i>First, stress, and second, there were few tests in Ensk wrote, and they had all auto tests</i> ), so I gathered strength and moved to work again in Cyprus, where he does redux, rxjs , typescript and all that.  Very scolding angular. <br><br>  <b>What you taught and what was useful:</b> <br><br>  After the children's book, Wirth (N. Wirth ‚ÄúAlgorithms and Data Structures) learned more or less to write simple algorithms, at the same time he learned about search, sorting, hashes. <br><br>  Any functional programming - now it is used a lot.  Shallow, but the basics are worth knowing.  Classic pro OOP type gang of four: <br><br><ul><li>  Object-oriented design techniques.  Design Patterns (English Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software). </li><li>  Alexandrescu A. Modern C ++ Design: Generalized Programming and Applied Design Patterns = Modern C ++ Design: Generic Programming and Design Patterns Applied. </li><li>  Grady Butch.  Object-oriented analysis. </li><li>  Jeffrey Richter.  Programming on the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 in C #. ‚Äù </li><li>  Jeffrey Richter.  Windows for professionals.  Creating effective Win32 applications tailored to the specifics of the 64-bit version of Windows. </li><li>  Mozgovoy M.V.  Classics of programming - algorithms, languages, automata, compilers. </li></ul><br>  <b>Evaluation of the Russian market:</b> there is work, all.  There are also galleries, in the sense of large open-spaces, packed with programmers. <br><br>  <b>On the current and the penultimate place of work got through</b> : My circle. <br><br>  <b>Opinion about current frames:</b> 6 out of 10 can not replace the substring write online.  In the editor and during the interview.  Dropout - about 1 out of 15 found by personnel officers remains.  Someone falls off after the first interview, someone after the test task.  We made a simple online test for js, so that we would not lose an extra hour for the first interview. <br><br>  Mass problem: misunderstanding of the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/">need for typing in the web</a> - type checking with auto- <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/">typing</a> , as in ts, flow, scala. <br><br>  It is interesting that although the culture of code "is more or less everywhere, there are almost no normal requirements. What is called requirements management and behavior specifications. <br><br>  <b>About a recent questionnaire on Habr√©:</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/334538/">Interview for a front-end developer in JavaScript: the best questions</a> .  A good questionnaire, but no one would have passed through it.  One out of 15 would have reached questions of average complexity, and one out of 30 would have passed them, maybe. <br><br>  <b>Comrade S</b> <br><br>  Not bearded.  After a short but extremely interesting career in a company with one mutual friend, or rather during this career, I took and learned the basics of C, then even without ++ and #, after which I got into one more different company to support software, junior.  After a couple of years of study and work, he moved to Moscow, changed a couple of jobs there, ended up in one nefgazmyservice, in one of his many divisions, after which he moved to the same nefgazmyas, but already international.  He is thinking about relocation, and seems to be moving soon.  Until now, he writes on any C, and at the same time he manages all sorts of different SQL. <br><br>  <b>What you taught and what was useful:</b> <br><br>  First C, then C ++ / #.  In the spring I passed the next exam on the MS SQL track. <br><br>  <b>Market Assessment RF:</b> There is work, all. <br><br>  <b>On the current and the penultimate place of work got through:</b> hh.ru and recruitment agency. <br><br>  <b>Opinion</b> : <br><br>  There is no universal recipe.  Learn English.  About 15 years ago, everyone in the market shouted that the future was for Oracle and they had to be taught that way, for 7 years they started to sink for SAP, now it‚Äôs even difficult to single out one thing.  Previously, the market was more static - you could learn how to code under 1C and reap the benefits for 15 years.  In general, I agree with Comrade G. - first you gain experience, then you understand what is interesting for you and you begin to dig hard in this direction.  Well, continuous self-education <br><br>  <b>What to read:</b> <br><br>  Encyclopedia of Professor Fortran. <br>  Figure E.V. IBM PC for the user <br>  D.
