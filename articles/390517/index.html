  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gravitational waves detected by the computer program of Sergei Klimenko</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the scientific world, the euphoria about the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270916/">discovery of gravitational waves</a> does not subside.  At the same time, new details are becoming known about the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/270936/">participation of Russian physicists in the international LIGO project</a> : these are scientific groups from Moscow State University and the Institute of Applied Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Nizhny Novgorod). <br><br>  In addition to them, another person made a significant contribution - Sergey Klimenko from the University of Florida, USA.  He is <a href="http://tass.ru/nauka/2660918">officially considered the co-author of the discovery</a> , which will no doubt be awarded the Nobel Prize.  In the final scientific article there are two links to his work (and one more unpublished). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3c/994/f18/e3c994f1827654b25293af9c2b284a9e.png">

When the LIGO project began, the physicist "for a change" decided to think about the problem of data processing.  The result was an algorithm and a program to detect the signal in extraneous noise. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúThe main program is not to write, the main thing is to invent.  I invented it and developed it together with my colleague from the University of Florida, Professor Genakh Mitzelmacher.  And since 2004, it began to be used in LIGO, - said Sergey Klimenko in an interview with TASS.  ‚ÄúIts essence is that it looks at the data, finds a signal, estimates how reliable it is, and reports the signal parameters and its findings.‚Äù <br><br>  The merits of the scientist are not limited to this.  On that very day, September 14, 2015, when the signal from two rotating black holes was received, Sergey was at home in Florida.  At six-thirty, he began checking the email inbox ‚Äî and found a message from his program that something unusual had happened.  "I began to understand what it is, and very quickly realized that this is a phenomenal signal - the very thing that we have been looking for for a long time," said the scientist. <br><br>  Klimenko immediately informed his colleagues about the event.  It was very important, because at that moment the observatory was not in the normal mode, but actually in a state of adjustment.  If changes were made to the settings, then it would be impossible to check the signal.  Already at 7:15, he sent a note to his colleagues about the ‚Äúunique event‚Äù - such speed was critical. <br><br>  Event checked - registered fluctuations (red on the diagram) corresponded exactly to the calculated pattern (gray). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be3/bbf/b44/be3bbfb4455244aaaa4e2982346b9a22.png"><br><br>  After additional measurements, a scientific work was published, which was reviewed for several weeks, and <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102">published</a> yesterday in the journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i> (an article in the public domain). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390517/</a></p>
