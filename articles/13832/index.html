      <strong>Work for you hobby, or heavy necessity?</strong> <br><br>  Work takes up most of my life, so it is always important for me that work bring moral satisfaction.  When I start a new business, I try to consider it not only from the point of view of business, but also as an occupation that I will devote a lot of time, and which, therefore, should bring me pleasure.  This is not just a desire to make your life more colorful and interesting.  I believe that a successful businessman simply has to be passionate about his business, because only this way truly good ideas can be born, in order to later grow into successful large-scale projects that it will be pleasant for a person to put into practice. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>How often do you have to curb your emotions for the sake of business success?</strong>  <strong>Do you lose your temper?</strong> <br><br>  In general, I am a rather emotional person, but if I get seriously angry, I still try to curb my emotions without splashing them on others.  I give myself time to think about the situation, if possible, and then settle.  This is an important aspect of business ethics, and a wonderful way to maintain good relations with business partners and subordinates. <br><br>  <strong>How and when did you earn the first rubles?</strong> <br><br>  I was 11 years old.  In the early nineties, it was pretty easy to surprise with a simple service.  At the urban vegetable base, I bought Bulgarian pepper, sparing no time selecting the best specimens, then carefully packing the vegetables into bags and selling almost twice as much, but, most importantly, with a smile on my lips and not hanging around, which was very rare at that time.  Housewives loved it.  He also worked at a gas station.  Washed and fueled cars.  Perhaps it was then that I learned the basics of a successful business.  :) <br><br>  <strong>Do you think women in men value, above all, wealth or external beauty?</strong> <br><br>  But what about the "rich inner world"?  :) To be honest, I think that the question of what women want is beyond my power.  Sometimes suspicions creep in that they are also hard to answer.  And to summarize in such a delicate matter as women's preferences is a thankless job.  Let's just say - this is a matter of taste.  However, it happens that the appearance and security are rather closely related.  For example, when it comes to such additions to natural data, as an opportunity to dress stylishly. <br><br>  <strong>What kind of cars do you prefer?</strong>  <strong>Japanese, European, American?</strong>  <strong>What kind of cars do you have?</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/af4/ec2/e58/af4ec2e5889edf3869df449862459715.jpg" width="320" height="240" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Among the manufacturers of any country there are cars of the most diverse class, so here I don‚Äôt have certain national prejudices.  Fortunately, now I have the opportunity to pamper myself with quality things and cars are no exception.  However, I had previously been guided by the principle that it is better to do without a personal car at all, than to master the profession of auto mechanic.  Now in my fleet of favorites are the BMW M6 and Mercedes GL 420. <br><br>  <strong>When you have to pick a partner for a business, does his character matter?</strong>  <strong>By what criteria do you rate your partner?</strong> <br><br>  Choosing business partners, I primarily focus on their business qualities.  However, I value these qualities in people in general.  Honesty, responsibility, punctuality - without this productive cooperation is impossible.  I am impressed by the British style of business relations, when the word of honor is worth a lot, and transactions are often secured by a simple handshake.  Therefore, in business I value partners most of all not just with a strong business acumen, but those whom I can trust.  Of course, I often have to learn from my mistakes, but in general I pay attention to the reputation of the person with whom I intend to cooperate.  If a person does not fulfill the promises made to others, then I do not really hope for a special attitude towards myself. <br><br>  <strong>A good rest for you is traveling, fishing, drinking with friends?</strong>  <strong>Do you have enough time to rest?</strong> <br><br>  There is enough time.  But sometimes desires are different.  Starting from a holiday on some islands surrounded by gorgeous nature, ending with the next banal shopping in Italy and the bright tuse in nightclubs.  By the way, a couple of years ago was a stable clubber.  But something is now fed up.  I like to spend time with friends.  Usually, we almost every day have dinner somewhere, smoke hookahs and play all sorts of games: from chess, to UNO. <br><br>  <strong>Do women's advice and participation help in business?</strong> <br><br>  I think that since the Middle Ages, in terms of women's moral support, little has changed.  Now, as before, there is a charming lady of the heart behind almost every male feat, except that cambric handkerchiefs are not in fashion now.  But supportive views still inspire heroic deeds.  But seriously, sometimes only ‚ÄúI believe in you‚Äù can make you move mountains and realize the most ambitious plans. <br><br>  <strong>How do you feel about alcohol, cigarettes, drugs?</strong>  <strong>Do you often have to drink?</strong> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/1d7/4a7/0d3/1d74a70d3c6641b938528c088f62323d.jpg" width="400" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Actually, I‚Äôm pretty serious about my health.  I am engaged in fitness, boxing, swimming, at least - yoga.  Therefore, I drink extremely rarely and smoke only hookah.  Nevertheless, perhaps, I can consider myself a connoisseur of good wines.  Until recently, I was the owner of the restaurant business, so I was fortunate enough to try out the best wines of France, Spain, Italy, Argentina. <br><br>  <strong>Is business and friendship compatible?</strong> <br><br>  I think yes.  I maintain friendly relations with my partners.  This is a pledge of mutual respect and trust, without which it is difficult to find a reliable partner.  Since they, like me, are business people, we always find mutual understanding, when we have a thin line to distinguish between business and friendship. <br><br>  <strong>Tell me where you visited, and what impressed you in other countries?</strong> <br><br>  I travel quite a lot for both business and leisure purposes.  Soon I will change the third passport, because there is not enough space for new visas.  In almost every country there is something to be surprised at.  From the same places where you often go, I really like England, in particular London.  Switzerland, Italy, Canada.  Recently flew to Mauritius and magically rested.  :) <br><br>  <strong>I know that you are not limited to online business.</strong>  <strong>What is offline business?</strong> <br><br>  Online business is only a small part of what I have to do.  My assets are widely diversified.  From the restaurant business to the oil and gas industry.  True, the restaurant business recently sold. <br><br>  <strong>Would you be able to fully transfer your assets to online and receive dividends from online projects?</strong>  <strong>What projects are interesting to you as an investor?</strong> <br><br>  Hardly, completely.  As already said, I tend to diversify my business.  Still, any large online business as a result will still lead to a very real office, staff, live communication with partners, investors and colleagues.  No matter how modernized the business is in our time, it will not be possible to manage a large company using ICQ and e-mail.  Now the main focus of my online business is lending and investing.  As an investor, I am also interested in other promising projects in non-supersaturated niches of the network business that can ‚Äúdiscourage‚Äù investments in a year and a half.  Now I am just considering several options. <br><br>  <strong>Your success formula?</strong> <br><br>  This is a function with many unknowns.  If ever I find out the exact algorithm, then I will definitely share it.  So far, one of my most important rules has never been to stop there.  There are only two ways: forward and backward.  But no one has been able to stand still either in business or in sports or in personal cultivation.  Therefore, I do business all the time.  I remember the time, and if possible I try to overtake him - this is one of the important components of the formula for successful business management. <br><br>  <strong>Who was your main teacher in life?</strong> <br><br>  I try to scoop information from all possible sources, communicate with a wide variety of people a lot and always find something to learn.  In general, one of my most useful skills I consider is the ability to find a common language with people.  Sometimes it is hard to even imagine how valuable information can be gathered, in time to start a conversation about the weather.  :) <br><br>  <strong>Which million bucks was harder, first or second?</strong> <br><br>  I won‚Äôt reveal a secret - millions have never been given to anyone easily, unless you catch Jack Pot ‚Äúfor life‚Äù.  And then, as a rule, Jack Pot has a hard effect on the later life of the lucky ones.  In business, it is always worth the nervous, mental and physical stress, sleepless nights, tireless work.  Although, of course, the first million was much more complicated.  But also the pleasure from the achieved was received much more.  The first million allowed me to discover a new level in life values ‚Äã‚Äãand priorities. <br><br>  <strong>Have you ever suffered a fiasco in business?</strong> <br><br>  There are always ups and downs.  Fortunately, the first million did not have to earn again. <br><br>  <strong>Is your riskiest step in business?</strong> <br><br>  In general, I protect myself from risky steps.  Although, in our country, any step, by definition, can be risky.  My most powerful and important argument in business, and in life it is my intuition.  Helps a lot.  Sometimes I am surprised myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ae3/3a9/557/ae33a9557dccf665f4e1aae11647fb2b.jpg" width="160" height="222" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  <strong>Success depends on luck?</strong> <br><br>  I think yes.  But I can also assume that luck in turn depends on our actions.  There are people who, with surprising persistence, dismiss gifts of fate, or simply do not notice them.  For me, the first priority task after each unexpected turn of fate becomes to turn it in my favor, to make it so that I can consider the most adverse events a happy coincidence.  In business, it is impossible to do without punctures: the deals are broken, the plans are crumbling, but, looking back, I see that all this was not in vain and, to some extent, in the end contributed to my current well-being.  For me, a failed plan is a reason to come up with a more successful one, and a losing trade is a reason not to lose even more on a similar error, but on a larger scale.  I can consider myself a lucky enough person, but the term ‚Äúminion of fortune‚Äù probably does not suit me.  I just often know how to find a common language with Mrs. luck. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13832/</a></p>
