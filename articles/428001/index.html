This patch set can be called the worst Tuesday patch by Microsoft for a very long time, because it revealed a lot of errors, not only making PCs on Windows 10 unusable, but also causing (in some cases) users to lose files. <br><br>  Everything was so sad that Microsoft <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-has-pulled-the-windows-10-october-2018-update/">had to revoke the</a> Windows 10 updates from October 2018 in order to find out exactly what caused the problems, fix it, and then check the updated set using Windows Insiders.

      In this article we will look at the worst mistakes associated with these updates, and solutions to fix them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The October 2018 update removes some user files. </h2><br>  The most destructive error in this update package is a bug that deletes user data during the update process.  Such users have no choice but to restore data from a backup, shadow copies, through system recovery, or through software to recover files. <br><br>  It got to the point that Microsoft recommended not using computers affected by this error, so that the file recovery software would have a better chance of recovering them. <br><br>  A week later, Microsoft announced that deleting files was due to the fact that the Known Folder Redirection setting was turned on on users' computers. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBefore re-releasing the October updates, our investigation found that a very small number of users lost their files during the update with the October package,‚Äù stated in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/09/updated-version-of-windows-10-october-2018-update-released-to-windows-insiders/">a</a> Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/09/updated-version-of-windows-10-october-2018-update-released-to-windows-insiders/">announcement</a> .  - This happened if the Known Folder Redirection (KFR) function had been enabled before, and the user left the files in the original, ‚Äúold‚Äù folder, instead of moving them to a new one, to which the redirection is set.  KFR is the process of redirecting known Windows folders, including Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Screenshots, Videos, Camera Roll, etc.  from their default location, c: \ users \ username \, to a new location.  As part of the feedback from the previous April service pack, users reported the appearance of an additional, empty copy of ‚Äúknown folders‚Äù on the device, ‚Äùexplains John Cable, director of program management, Windows service and delivery.  ‚ÄúBased on the feedback from users, we introduced a code in the October updates that removes these empty copies of known folders.  This change, together with another change that updated the sequence of updates, led to the fact that the original, "old" folders were deleted along with their contents, and only the "new" ones remained intact. <br><br>  Unfortunately, users who have not had backup or shadow copies to restore files can restore them only with the help of special software for recovering deleted files, like Recuva. <br><br><h2>  Incompatible keyboard driver dropped HP computers </h2><br>  By installing the latest service pack, users of HP computers detected multiple OS crashes in the form of a ‚Äúblue screen of death‚Äù, which demonstrated the WDF_VIOLATION error.  These failures were caused by an incompatible HP keyboard driver (version 11.0.3.1) installed along with the updates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/042/de1/69b/042de169b7b3d184d5b5f064b44c12e6.jpg"><br><br>  According to the accompanying <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468372/hp-devices-may-experience-blue-screen-error-wdf-violation-after-instal">article</a> , Microsoft found the driver causing the problems and removed it from Windows Update.  For users who have installed the driver and have not yet restarted the computer, Microsoft has released another update that removes the incompatible driver. <br><br>  "Working with HP, Microsoft identified a HP driver with a known incompatibility with certain HP devices when running Windows 10 versions 1803 and 1809. On October 11, Microsoft removed the driver from the update to reduce the number of affected devices.  We also released update KB 4468304, which removes the incompatible driver from devices requiring a reboot.  HP is actively working on this issue. " <br><br>  Users who have installed the driver, rebooted the computer, and faced with the OS crash, can use <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/hp-pcs-getting-wdf-violation-bsod-after-installing-windows-10-updates/">the recovery instructions</a> . <br><br><h2>  Audio issues after installing updates </h2><br>  For a while, Microsoft sent Intel's audio driver to users by mistake, which caused the audio on their computers to stop working in Windows versions 10 1803 and 1809. The users affected by the driver faced the lack of sounds in Windows 10, and the operating system gave the message ‚ÄúNo Audio Output Device is installed ‚Äù[missing audio output device]. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f37/3ae/5df/f373ae5df148bdbdc5c48b02bc89d9f9.png"><br><br>  Microsoft has already stopped distributing this driver, but if you are affected by this, you can use <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-10-audio-not-working-after-installing-latest-windows-updates/">the recovery instructions</a> . <br><br><h2>  Problems with the brightness of the screen </h2><br>  After installing updates, some users <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-brightness-issue-after-the-1809-update/2a1689ae-5625-4679-9ab7-3f754cb8111b">complain of</a> a very low display brightness after each reboot.  They have to restore its level manually.  It may be possible to fix it after installing the updated video card driver, but most people with such a problem say that it does not help. <br><br>  Unfortunately, at the moment this problem has no known solutions. <br><br>  Microsoft Edge and UWP applications cannot connect to the Internet <br><br>  After the release of Windows 10 1809, the Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Store applications require the inclusion of TCP / IPv6 support, without which they cannot access the Internet.  To enable support, you must: <br><ul><li>  Open settings. </li><li>  Select "Internet and Networks". </li><li>  Select "Change adapter settings". </li><li>  Right-click on the adapter that is used to access the Internet, and select "Properties". </li><li>  Make sure there is a checkmark next to Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP / IPv6). </li><li>  Click OK to exit the properties. </li></ul><br><br>  After that, you can check whether Internet Edge and applications are online.  If this does not help, you can edit the registry.  To do this, run regedit.exe and go to the branch <br><br>  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SYSTEM \ CurrentControlSet \ Services \ Tcpip6 \ Parameters" <br>  There you need to find the variable DisabledComponents and set its value to 0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/658/e3a/143/658e3a14349e7edff481de877d9fd0f3.jpg"><br><br><h2>  "I need your attention" warning related to Intel Audio drivers </h2><br>  Finally, if when you try to install the latest updates you see the notice ‚ÄúI need your attention‚Äù, which shows the driver ‚ÄúIntel Audio Display (intcdaud.sys), KB4465877‚Äù, you will not be able to install the latest Windows 10 update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/936/6c2/5cc/9366c25cc3869f04dce17aaf380a80a7.jpg"><br><br>  You see this message because Microsoft found incompatibility with Intel drivers that may cause problems with the October update.  Microsoft says that if you see this message, you need to click "back" and wait until the updated drivers come out. <br><br><h2>  Error unpacking Zip archives </h2><br>  Another error in upgrading to Build 1809 leads to the fact that the user is <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-10-1809-zip-extraction-bug-overwrites-files-without-confirmation/">not shown confirmation</a> of overwriting files from above when extracting files from zip archives using the built-in functionality of Windows.  This error behaves inconsistently, since some users have overwritten the files without confirmation, and for some, nothing happened.  This bug was fixed in the latest Windows 10 19H1 update. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428001/</a></p>
