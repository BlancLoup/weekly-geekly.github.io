  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook Corporation is building another data center in Sweden: a new concept of "accelerated construction" of data centers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Facebook announced plans to expand its server capacity in Sweden, namely, the plan to build the second Data Center in the city of Lulea.  When building a data warehouse, the newest design approaches will be used, thanks to which the company expects to double the effective capacity of the building and build it much faster than it was possible before.  The advantage of the selected project Data Center is that it can be geographically erected anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6a/fae/21f/e6afae21f746a1a6e384542c999af92b.png"><br><br>  The first Data Center of the company in Lulea, which was commissioned back in 2012, became the data center pioneer of Facebook, for the first time the data center was moved outside the territory of the United States.

      The new concept of ‚Äúaccelerated construction of DC‚Äù is mainly to produce large elements of a common structure at remote enterprises, and then deliver them with all sorts of vehicles to the site of construction for their quick assembly into a single structure.  For the first time, Facebook announced this approach to building its own DC at the Open Compute Summit in January, held in San Jose, California. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing prefabricated structures for the accelerated construction of DC has become widespread over the past few years.  Actually, the approaches themselves within the concept vary somewhat: from the delivery of standardized containers filled with server hardware to the production of huge elements of collapsible data center designs in factories, with the aim of assembling them directly at the site of the future DC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/0d7/85c/cba0d785cf110b6ecdecd0a06efd0df9.jpg"><br><br>  Companies such as Google and Microsoft in the construction of the data center have always adhered to the rules that allowed to place their capacity in the existing data center providers "from the outside."  Therefore, several smaller companies from the USA and the UK took part in the construction of this facility for their needs. <br><br><h5>  Chassis concept </h5><br>  At the heart of the chassis concept is the following principle.  Using hints from various industries, where automation and standardization of production are widely used, we managed to form a vision and implement the ‚Äúchassis‚Äù - the basis (in this case, a steel frame with approximate dimensions of 3.6 m by 12.2 m) and use the assembly line for the work items. <br><br>  "The elements of the creation of DC also include all the infrastructure that accompanies the server racks: cable trays, laying power lines, device control and measuring units and lighting," - wrote in his blog, dedicated to the announcement of plans to create DC, Marco Magarelli, engineer Designer project for the construction of data center for Facebook. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur‚Äú chassis ‚Äùalready supports the entire infrastructure that accompanies the server racks.  In container solutions, in addition to the equipment itself, it is also necessary to transport the ‚Äúair‚Äù in the container.  In this idea, only the basic structure is transported, which is located above the server racks and is ready to connect communications. ‚Äù, Describes the vision of his team Marco. <br><br>  After assembly, the chassis is loaded into the body and transported directly to the DC itself.  In the construction itself, the delivered assembly is mounted on prepared concrete pillars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ef/72f/ef7/7ef72fef71756c8b0fcc27d7f1dcf49a.png"><br><br>  Two connected chassis form an 18-meter passage.  A typical data center machine room will accommodate 52 chassis, thereby forming 13 corridors, including those for cooling server assemblies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70f/4b2/dcb/70f4b2dcb3846d1e61f0d4c99dc68f76.png"><br><br>  Prior to the project, which is being implemented today in the city of Lulea, Facebook erected the DC, repeating the principle of construction and the entire design of its first DC commissioned directly in Prinville, Oregon.  The company has built during its existence, six versions of this DC.  The company is also currently constructing two Data Centers in North Carolina and Iowa, as well as leasing space from several major providers in the United States. <br><br>  The new concept of "accelerated construction" of data centers will help not only save money, but also use resources more efficiently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43a/083/9b7/43a0839b7b2f7336a2cf866412d0681e.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221461/</a></p>
