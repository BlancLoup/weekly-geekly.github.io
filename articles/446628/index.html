  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give more HighLoad ++: since Monday in St. Petersburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" width="190" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/up/vp/ql/upvpql4szk3afn7scfidjdmgyna.png">  Next week, Saint HighLoad ++ starts - the second part of our experiment on the expansion of highload to large IT centers in the country.  The elevated prefix at the beginning of the title, as well as for our other conferences, means that on April 8‚Äì9 <strong>we go to St. Petersburg</strong> .  The <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/schedule">program</a> includes <strong>40 reports</strong> , a traditional track from Aletheia Business and user generated meetings.  All reports are new and specially selected to take into account the sociocultural context of the IT of the northern capital.  What is the regional specificity and how it affected the program, I will tell you further. <br><br>  First, let's share why we started it all.  Normally, it was - a large annual gathering of all those interested in ensuring that web services were able to handle the load efficiently and make millions of users happy.  When we started in 2007, there were not so many of them - just a small hardcore <strong>get-together</strong> , but <strong>in 2018 3,000 people came to HighLoad ++ in Moscow</strong> .  The conference was not just big, but huge: 10 main streams of reports, 10 streams of master classes and meetings.  In such an abundance of all sorts of alternatives it is very difficult to navigate. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But this would be half the trouble, in the end, the schedule is structured so that topics for a similar audience are close.  Such a scale makes us, as a Program Committee, think broadly and choose topics that are interesting to many.  For discussion of narrow topics, only mitapnye remain, and local features are taken into account in the format ‚Äúin Russia, we love hardcore and live practice, and do not like marketing bulshit‚Äù. <br><br>  Last summer, we tried another HighLoad ++ in Novosibirsk.  And they were surprised to find that for a conference in Novosibirsk, a completely different program is needed than for a conference in Moscow.  <strong>The large IT companies in the region have their own specifics</strong> , their requests, which the conference should satisfy.  For example, in Novosibirsk fintech is much more noticeable, and you need to pay attention to topics relevant to FinTech.  The program HighLoad ++ Siberia 2018 contains several reports about Oracle, which in Moscow is usually not very much in demand.  Look at the open <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLH-XmS0lSi_xgCBtleObFPk-8I4_Nh0PB">playlist</a> reports HighLoad ++ Siberia 2018 and you will understand what I'm talking about.

      After a successful conference in Novosibirsk, we thought - you should not close on one of the flagship HighLoad ++, you should try <strong>different regions with different needs</strong> .  We know how to prepare cool programs, learned how to create conditions for experts, consider, <a href="https://youtu.be/HRQ73xZuIZQ">launched the</a> ‚Äúconference incubator‚Äù.  Highload is a favorite and dear topic, so you need to offer the adapted versions of this conference to the community in different cities. <br><br>  It is with this intention that we are going to St. Petersburg - the second largest IT city in the country.  It is already clear that topics topical for HighLoad ++ in St. Petersburg are not quite typical for a conference in Moscow.  This will not be a replay of the best reports; this is a completely new unique <strong>program based on the specifics of the IT industry in the region</strong> .  For example, St. Petersburg is known for its commitment to Java, and there are <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4883">reports</a> on Java in the timetable. <br><br><blockquote>  If you want to be aware of everything that happens in the world of high loads, you should visit all <a href="https://www.highload.ru/">HighLoad ++</a> conferences. </blockquote><br>  This year we will have: St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk and Moscow.  Over time, we will expand this list, we are working on options: Ekaterinburg, Minsk, Kazakhstan.  Write in the comments in which other cities you would like to see HighLoad ++ and how IT lives in them.  In Novosibirsk it turned out to be very soulful, and this seems to me to be a distinctive Siberian feature. <br><br>  From St. Petersburg I <strong>expect thoughtfulness and deep immersion in the subject</strong> .  It‚Äôs definitely not exactly chamber-like, there will be about 1,000 people, 5 streams, many interesting local <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/partners">partners</a> .  But all the same, relying also on the experience of our <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/HighLoad-User-Group/">training mitaps</a> , I think there <strong>will be a St. Petersburg atmosphere.</strong> <br><br>  And in order not to be unsubstantiated, I will talk structurally about the topics and presentations. <br><br><h2>  PostgreSQL, ClickHouse and other databases </h2><br>  At Moscow's HighLoad ++, we usually have a lot of reports about databases and storage systems, and each track is actively highlighted for each popular and actively developed one.  In St. Petersburg, exactly a quarter of the reports are devoted to this topic, but <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> stands out: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4871">Postgres 12 in etudes</a> - Oleg Bartunov. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4833">Common mistakes when developing applications working with PostgreSQL</a> - Ivan Frolkov (Postgres Professional). </li><li>  <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4433">Postgres Highload Checklist</a> - Ivan Panchenko. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4890">Fighting PostgreSQL workload, does replication help with this?</a>  - Andrei Salnikov. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/jb/5-/zzjb5-h6wjssrhmcwbpvyjet7lm.jpeg"><br><br>  First of all, <strong>ClickHouse</strong> is represented by <strong>Alexey Milovidov</strong> himself with a <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4808">report</a> on how to make data for testing from data that represent commercial secrets.  Alexander Krasheninnikov will <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4862">introduce</a> ClickHouse usage patterns that have been implemented in Badoo.  Alexander Kharitonov, on the contrary, <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4667">will talk</a> about the experience of the game studio Pixonic, which has not yet moved to ClickHouse, but <strong>handles a billion events a day</strong> . <br><br>  In addition, the program <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4771">MariaDB</a> and the native multi-model database <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4852">ArangoDB</a> from the direct developers of these databases and reports on design patterns without regard to specific products. <br><br><h2>  Architecture, backend, programming theory </h2><br>  This section also includes a third of the reports - it makes no sense to list everything.  I will name only some.  AWS architect Vasily Pantyukhin <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4979">will talk</a> about the internal structure of the <strong>Firecracker micro-virtual</strong> machine and show how to integrate it transparently with the usual containerd containerization method.  Anatoly Makarov promises to <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4785">tell</a> you why AWS did not fit Rostelecom so much that they decided to write their FaaS platform. <br><br>  Anton Skogarev <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4689">will share the</a> history of the evolution of Yandex.Taxi architecture from the ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù algorithm to the standard assignment problem.  Vladimir Krasilshchik promises to <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4592">show</a> how to use vert.x: a polyglot framework for building <strong>high</strong> - <strong>load</strong> reactive <strong>applications on a JVM</strong> . <br><br>  Artyom Kalichkin <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4931">proposes</a> to raise the topic of ‚Äúrewriting legacy or continue to support‚Äù, but not for the sake of empty dispute.  <strong>In the format of a round table</strong> , we will listen to the arguments of the parties, we will try to objectify and reduce to a certain general recommendation, which will help choose the approach to work with Legacy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/jo/od/ctjood4x59woyfq3rficcn0m2ac.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  BigData and machine learning </h2><br>  Machine learning and artificial intelligence have firmly established themselves in large-scale projects, and therefore it is becoming more and more associated with it.  At Saint HighLoad ++ we will start to dive right in the morning - Stanislav Shushkevich will open a speech in the ‚ÄúMoika‚Äù hall with a <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4797">report</a> with the intriguing title ‚Äú <strong>Neural networks in the production of dental prostheses</strong> ‚Äù.  Dmitry Merkushov from Mail.ru Group <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4824">will talk</a> about the implementation and operation of machine learning in <strong>anti-spam</strong> .  Andrey Ivanov will tell about the application of technologies on the <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4388">example of the</a> <strong>recommendation system</strong> in Tinkoff.ru.  Maria Matskevichus <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4981">will tell</a> how Data Science team Grid Dynamics from scratch collected its application for <strong>accurate recognition of parts from the photo</strong> .  Evgeny Zhurin from Odnoklassniki will tell the <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4932">story of</a> an endless struggle with spammers. <br><br><h2>  Devops </h2><br>  In the process side of DevOps we dive into <a href="https://devopsconf.io/">DevOpsConf</a> , here the reports are less specific, and more useful to a wide range of developers. <br><br>  Evgeny Potapov <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4917">will take</a> us through the modern <strong>stack of monitoring</strong> , logging and tracing complex applications, using the example of monitoring a ‚Äúlive‚Äù project, we will show you how to find problems as quickly as possible.  Dmitry Volyntsev from Nginx, will <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4839">present a</a> project that allows you to extend the functionality of nginx in JavaScript.  Andrei Polovov and Ivan Mikheikin <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4993">will talk</a> about what solutions found in the company of Flant for the <strong>expansion and addition of Kubernetes</strong> .  PVS-Studio developers <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4721">will demonstrate</a> how to enable static analysis in CI.  Alexey Uchakin <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4904">asks</a> : ‚Äú <strong>Why is the Internet still online?</strong>  ‚Äù, And, probably, in his speech on the evening of April 9 will give an answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/bp/lw/ttbplwryqkl9ykwtjf_sdvvofhm.jpeg"><br><br>  There is also ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù, but see for yourself about it - there are narrow topics of testing enterprise, IoT and Alexander Tobol with a <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/4990">story</a> about the future of the network stack.  Perhaps now about <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/">the</a> Saint HighLoad ++ <a href="https://www.highload.ru/spb/2019/abstracts/">program</a> you have enough information to join.  There is little time for this, but we still do not predict overflow of the site. <br><br>  And I want to finish our mission - we organize conferences to develop professional communities and, as a result, <strong>make the world a better place</strong> .  With such a global goal, it is wrong to concentrate on Moscow.  Objectively, work in Moscow has many advantages, but also many disadvantages for life.  So that people can live where they feel comfortable and at the same time work on what they want, it is very important to <strong>support the local IT ecosystem and local communities</strong> .  Then, one day, we will bring the HighLoad ++ award winners from all over the country. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUGQlriA-xs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Join, participate in conferences, organize your meetings, propose new topics and cities!  We will read everything :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446628/</a></p>
