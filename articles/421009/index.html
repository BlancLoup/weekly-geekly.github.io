  <section class="page js-page"><h1>August 25 and 26: Online Operational Management Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In May, I was fortunate enough to take graduation papers from students of our annual online executive education program.  250 people, 250 phoned with each.  All in order to once again make sure that all people are different.  Traditionally, we teach people in two directions: working with people and project management. <br><br>  Working with people turns out to be useful for everyone, but not everyone has project management.  It came as a surprise :) If the manager is obviously the project management manager is very necessary.  But no.  It turned out that 20% of our students do not manage projects from the word at all.  They manage departments, support teams, etc.  That is, they are where project activities under their control do not exist.  But there is a lot of process control. <br><br>  Hence the idea to make a conference about process management.  There is a lot about project management and conference project managers, but it seems that they don‚Äôt talk about process management separately.  And let's say.

      The concept came up with this: to invite experts who would cover the materiel + practitioners who will tell about their process management cases.  It turned out a small chamber conference, where we invite everyone: <br><br><h2>  August 25 and 26, ONLINE conference on operational management </h2><br>  First half of the day on the air: 6-8 speakers from different companies will tell about their experience and practical cases of debugging the processes of operating activities.  Participation in the conference is free.  <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5309030770431458562">Registration &gt;&gt;</a> <br><br>  Below is the conference program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Held with the support of the <a href="https://stratoplan.ru/association/">Association of Managers ‚ÄúStratoplan‚Äù</a> and <a href="https://pmi.org.ru/">the PMI branch in St. Petersburg</a> . <br><br>  The program of the event: <br><br><h3>  Alexey Pikulev </h3><br><h4>  Kanban coach and trainer, Unusual Concepts. </h4><br>  ‚ÄúThe process model of company management is not new, and has long become the mainstream for many Russian leaders.  Business process maps, regulations, scorecards, and other tools should transform a result-oriented company.  But behind the apparent simple approach lies the other side.  Many companies that want to go on the process of management, make a lot of mistakes, starting to describe chaotically processes, confuse the state "as it is", "as it should", etc. As a result, the processes are described, "lie on the shelf", and there are no other changes. <br>  In my report, I want to share the 5th most common mistakes in applying the process approach that I have encountered in my projects.  We will talk about process ‚Äúrakes and crutches‚Äù and discuss together how to avoid them. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Ilya Alyabushev </h3><br><h4>  Federal expert on the implementation of systematic work in teams of managers and employees.  Speaker of many conferences.  More than 100 implementations in the companies of the country. </h4><br>  ‚ÄúNot every day we create something fundamentally new.  The team should be able to do well and repetitive tasks - without waste of power and with a guarantee of quality.  For this, you need to describe the processes, there are hundreds of books, articles and automation tools on this topic.  But when in practice you try to build typical processes - it does not happen easily.  The thing is that for some tasks, jagged instruction is suitable, for others - prescribed algorithms in ERP, and for the third - the rhythm of regular brainstorming sessions on typical tasks. <br><br>  Together we will figure out how to act in practice in each case. <br><br>  We will answer the questions: <br><br>  - When you really need to describe the processes, and where to start <br>  - What are some popular examples describing typical processes? <br>  - What should not be done in order not to systematize the processes ‚Äúon the table‚Äù <br>  - How can you ‚Äúsell‚Äù the team an idea to work on typical processes? <br>  - How to ensure the rhythm of process implementation in a team <br><br>  What will happen as a result of the meeting: <br><br>  - Consider examples of managing typical processes in a team. <br>  - We will analyze the basic concepts and techniques <br>  ‚ÄúEveryone will get a training manual with key steps and templates for managing typical tasks and processes.‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Roman Ivliev </h3><br><h4>  Technical director of the project mos.ru </h4><br>  Hurdling: the history of the formation of the command mos.ru <br><br>  ‚ÄúI entered the software industry in 2002 as a test engineer.  He managed to work on private and public companies, participated in the creation of medical, banking software, military software, was engaged in the development of high-load systems.  He went from engineer to top manager and head of large divisions.  At the moment I manage the technical department in the project mos.ru.  The sites kaspersky.com, woman.ru, itar-tass.com, banki.ru went through my hands and teams, equipment saves people‚Äôs lives, manages airplanes while the pilot drinks coffee, and something stands guard over our Motherland. <br><br>  I will tell you how we have experienced growth from three in-house engineers and a large participation of customized development and administration to 35 in-house engineers in one year.  How the team was recruited, how the groups were formed, why for the "carousel" is not children's entertainment, but a part of daily activities that save us when there is more work than there are performers.  I'll tell you why at some stages we stopped, returned to the starting one, changed the strategy and started to grow again.  How we took over the work from external performers: what work and modules were taken away first and foremost, and which competencies were increased, and that we still trust in our partners.  Naturally, all this could not happen at the wave of the hand of a magician.  It was partly a subtle calculation, partly luck, but mostly it was a lot of work and a desire to build a team and processes in such a way that everyone would be interested and comfortable, and the output would be a good product that millions of Muscovites use. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Andrey Degozhsky </h3><br><h4>  Since 2001 in the IT industry.  Since 2006, in QA, of which for 8 years I have been building teams / departments and developing people. </h4><br>  Now I am a ‚Äúmatrix manager‚Äù - I work for EPAM in St. Petersburg.  On the one hand, I lead testing on one of the many projects.  On the other hand, I play the role of a resource manager for 40+ people, that is, I am responsible for their development and employment on projects.  In general, I collect a puzzle from ‚ÄúI want interesting tasks‚Äù and ‚Äúwe need an experienced person to do the work‚Äù.  I am responsible for the full life cycle of my employees in the company - hiring, development, rotation, retention, etc. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn my report I would like to talk about the problems of matrix organization on the example of our company EPAM.  Then I will tell you about the tools and processes that we built to solve some of the problems of human development. <br><br>  I would like to highlight the following issues: <br><br>  1. Exhaustibility of the market of specialists <br>  2. How to develop people who do not have current project objectives <br>  3. Keeping employees in the company for a long time and ensuring a controlled replacement process <br>  4. Transparency of the growth / transition between functions <br>  5. Employee Motivation (How to Avoid Burnout) <br>  6. Maintenance and development of specialization inside the function " <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Pavel Kolosov </h3><br><h4>  Business trainer.  Works with Gazprom Neft and Rosneft on transformation in an IT company.  In the past, Mail.ru, Rambler &amp; Co, Tenzor, Alfa-Bank and others. </h4><br><br>  He started his career with a courier, a production manager, a developer, a project manager, a development manager, and now he is increasing the effectiveness of divisions and companies as a playing business coach. <br><br>  Pavel will tell about five conditions, the fulfillment of which will increase the quality of your processes at times.  We illustrate this with experience stories. <br><br>  There will be 3 cases: <br><br>  - from IT, where they worked on supporting Heinz projects <br>  - outside IT: production, where the main production process is built, which led to a change in the entire company <br>  - the story of how to restructure the company's processes in the context of lack of resources for companies with a lot more than 10,000 employees <br><br>  We will talk about the change in the company's culture as a success factor: <br><br>  - Result, not efficiency: what is the difference and what to focus on <br>  - No need to worship tools: Kanban [substitute your own version] should not be the only tools <br>  - To see the participants of the process: we begin to respect the colleagues who bring the applications and serve the users of our product <br>  - Dependence of company culture on processes: processes will become as advanced as company culture allows and vice versa, culture will match your processes. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Max Vyaznikov </h3><br><h4>  The former head of the technical support team, currently the owner of the product (Product Owner) is a self-service product of a large advertising network operating under the brand PropellerAds.  He has experience in outsourcing as a project manager.  Ex-owner of his own web studio.  Entrepreneur. </h4><br>  The way of learning and building the process of working in stories <br><br>  Step 0. The start of the team can be described as "Here are the tasks, here is the team - go ahead!". <br><br>  Step 1. Initial analysis of the incoming task. <br>  So that the Customer was satisfied and the developer did not grieve, they added a new role to the team. <br><br>  Step 2. Research by the developer. <br>  We include in the process of work mandatory periodic communication with colleagues.  First, remove the symptoms, then look for the root causes. <br><br>  Step 3. Verification of the result by the tester or the Customer. <br>  Fuzzy boundaries of responsibility win: everyone tests, and Dev, and QA, and the Customer, since each has its own context and case studies, so there is no double work. <br><br>  Step 4. Confirmation by the Customer of the solution to the problem. <br>  The fact that within the scope of the task someone did something does not mean solving the problem.  Standup or sitdowns? <br><br>  And of course, the details, the details and the conclusions! <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Alexander Sertakov </h3><br><h4>  CFO with 10 years of experience in IT, banking and the oil and gas sector.  He consults Russian startups on financial management, organization and strategy. </h4><br>  "Startups and budgeting process" <br><br>  At the end of the webinar, participants will learn: <br><br>  - Why startups need budgeting; <br>  - How budgeting helps strategy; <br>  - How not to get into bondage to the investor; <br>  - What mistakes do startups make in budgeting? <br><br><hr><br>  Despite the fact that there are two days left, the program of the event can be updated and supplemented, follow the announcements: newsletter, facebook. <br><br>  25th and 26th of August.  From 10:00 to 14:00 Moscow time. <br><br>  Participation in the conference is free.  Entries will be sent to all registered participants. <br><br>  <a href="https://register.gotowebinar.com/register/5309030770431458562">Registration</a> (broadcast is organized in the gotowebinar system) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421009/</a></p>
