  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux staff monitoring: when demand creates supply</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Studying the modern market of our potential customers, we, to our surprise, came to the conclusion that the majority of large companies that need personnel monitoring and time tracking work in Linux.  As it turned out, small and medium businesses prefer Linux-systems for one simple reason - it is much cheaper.  And once the business moves to Linux, then personnel management tools must be supported and widely used in this environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a27/c5b/acd/a27c5bacd8cb489aaaec51243cc417a5.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A wide range of options - the key to success </h3><br>  Effective personnel management requires a clear understanding of what each individual employee and the department as a whole do.  This is especially clearly seen in the example of one of our clients.  His company includes several large departments at once, namely: <br><br><ol><li>  Accounting </li><li>  Software Development Department </li><li>  Call center </li></ol><br>  All these 3 departments do their work using Linux-based computers.  However, the specifics of the work is so different that a qualitative analysis of the work becomes difficult if you do not use additional tools.  By choosing our product for staff monitoring in Linux - StaffCounter, our client was able to resolve this issue for all departments.

At the entrance to the plant, the method of cards was used, on which the time was broken when the worker stepped in for the shift and the time of leaving the workplace.  Productivity is measured by the amount of output.  But such times are over, and now the working day begins with turning on the computer, and the result of the work is not always a finished and tangible product that can be measured in pieces.  That is why the tasks and methods of their solutions today are completely different from what they were before.  Requires flexibility settings, a wide range of features and informative reports.  And most importantly, all this should be automated and should not distract the manager and subordinates from the main work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7cb/3d4/058/7cb3d40586634c0eaf1edc83426e9023.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All features of StaffCounter for monitoring staff in Linux can be customized individually, making the final report as informative and correct as possible.  Regardless of the general activity of the company and its size, the functionality of the Linux staff monitoring system allows you to solve personnel management issues for all types of departments, including both the above and marketing, design, technical support departments, customer service departments, etc. <br><br><ul><li>  Accounting of working hours (the beginning and the end of the working day, breaks, lateness and processing) </li><li>  Screenshots showing the running application </li><li>  Accounting for running programs and applications and their time </li><li>  Accounting for visited websites </li><li>  Purpose of productive and unproductive programs and web sites </li><li>  Automatic violation notifications and regular reports </li><li>  Recording from webcams </li><li>  Lockscreen to switch between profiles of employees working on the same computer. </li></ul><br>  For example, the accounting department is the part of the company that knows everything about everyone.  Personal data of all employees, cash flow, details of each transaction.  In general, everything that, when hit by third parties, can harm the company and its employees.  To address this issue, we offer a permanent record of visited websites, screenshots of the name of the application being launched, and recording from webcams, thanks to which you can accurately track who used the computer in the time of interest. <br><br>  The software development department also requires some accounting.  To analyze the productivity of each employee, we offer functions for assigning and accounting for the use of productive and unproductive programs.  Also, to maintain discipline in the department, you should activate the accounting of working time and breaks.  By the way, an employee can view his own productivity report himself, thanks to which he himself will be able to adjust his work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/4a6/d1c/340/4a6d1c34027249c2bc4c0ff9dc7c51d3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To monitor call center operation in Linux, we have created an additional tool - Lockscreen.  Thanks to this function, there is no need to ‚Äútie‚Äù the computer to the employee.  It is enough to allocate for each your account and the corresponding password.  Depending on who will use the computer at the moment, StaffCounter will keep records and send data to its profile.  This is very convenient if the operators work in Linux in shifts or in the office with a large staff turnover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/576/0d1/301/5760d13017f94c1bb6e9fac976d8565f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Depending on the size of the company, its needs and capabilities, you can choose one of the solutions: a cloud service with the possibility of separately acquiring additional functions or a server version that includes all possible monitoring and accounting elements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328738/</a></p>
