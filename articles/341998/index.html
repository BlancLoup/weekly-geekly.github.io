He published such games as the Vicar, Costa Rouen, Zoo Magic, the Guild of Laar and a number of others.  Under the cut, we have prepared for you an outline of his lecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-z/is/od/-zisodamvvcstw_a3lhspjyc38w.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A game is a phenomenon not only of human life, but also a phenomenon of life in general, since everyone plays, both adults, and children, and animals.  Enough ancient games have reached our days, or references to them, including those that existed on earth 3 thousand - 4.5 thousand years ago. <br>  <i>But can everything be called a game?</i>  <i>The following symptoms are distinguished:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  The game is free, it can not be made mandatory for the player. </li><li>  The game is limited in space and time accurate and predetermined limits. </li><li>  The game has an uncertain outcome, it is impossible to predetermine its development, to predict its result;  The need for invention leaves some freedom for the player‚Äôs initiative. </li><li>  The game does not create wealth and wealth, is not related to the material interests of the parties. </li><li>  The game is subject to a number of conditions that suspend the operation of ordinary laws and establish new legislation that is valid for the duration of the game. </li><li>  The game is fictitious, accompanied by a specific consciousness of some sort of secondary reality or simply unreality in comparison with ordinary life. </li></ul><br>  <i>What does a game designer have to work with when creating a board game?</i>  <i>So:</i>

Play a board game. <br>  2. To love her, but not very much :) <br>  3. Come up with rules by which you will enjoy playing it.  And maybe your friends. <br>  4. Break in rules with friends, and maybe put them on the net. <br><br>  <b>Method II: Copy and Paste</b> <br><br>  <i>Instruction:</i> <br>  1. Play a board game. <br>  2. Love her very much. <br>  3. Come up with exactly the same, but about florists orcs. <br>  4. Add to your game a few "significant" differences from the original. <br><br>  <b>Method III: cool story</b> <br><br>  <i>Instruction:</i> <br>  1. Read a book or watch a movie. <br>  2. Be inspired by the plot. <br>  3. Come up with rules by which the characters of a book or movie could act in the game. <br>  4. Do not be able to do this and add event cards to the game. <br><br>  <b>Method IV: Players Spin the Crocodile</b> <br><br>  <i>Instruction:</i> <br>  1. Play a board game or look around. <br>  2. In the process, see a cool gaming solution. <br>  3. Use it in your own way. <br>  4. Add to the game a dozen of the same cool solutions. <br><br>  <b>Method V: Brainstorm</b> <br><br>  <i>Instruction:</i> <br>  1. Want to do a board game. <br>  2. Choose a time, call friends, stock up on paper and pencils. <br>  3. Create. <br>  4. PROFIT! <br><br>  <b>Method VI: be children</b> <br><br>  <i>Instruction:</i> <br>  1. Scatter components from board games on the floor, table, balcony and bathroom. <br>  2. Remember yourself as a child. <br>  3. Play the components as it is played, just to get high. <br>  4. After writing cool ideas, do not collect anything: suddenly stepping on a cube, will it strike you again? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/xl/lu/lrxlluytlurddp1i-0u7ewtrmny.jpeg"><br><br>  Now important information <b>about the prototyping of</b> your future game. <br><br>  <b>Prototype requirements:</b> <br>  1. It should be.  And the sooner the better. <br>  2. It can play at least a couple of moves. <br>  3. Draft design. <br>  4. Readiness to it with a handle. <br>  5. Readiness to throw out some first iterations. <br><br>  <b>Major errors:</b> <br>  1. Final art. <br>  2. Bad ergonomics. <br>  3. The convenience of players is not thought out. <br>  4. Non-playable balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kd/9q/yc/kd9qycbhpyjhzju9hmusurmrype.jpeg"><br><br>  This is followed by a <b>testing phase.</b> <br><br>  <b>Tasks for testing:</b> <br>  1. Identify the viability of the concept. <br>  2. Find serious bugs and breaks. <br>  3. Rid the game of crutches. <br>  4. Collect the emotional response of testers. <br>  5. Bring the game to the final balance. <br>  6. Polish the game to shine. <br><br>  <b>Testing script:</b> <br>  1. Find like-minded people or just kind people and arrange a meeting <br>  2. Tell the rules of the game on the spot.  It is not necessary to send the rules in advance if this is not a presentation to the publisher. <br>  3. It is advisable not to play yourself / yourself, but to watch from the sidelines. <br>  4. Respond to questions from testers, discuss controversial issues, come up with new rules in time. <br>  5. Record all ideas, questions, results of the party: the winner and its duration. <br>  6. Ask 3 questions: what did you like in the game, what didn't you like in the game, would you still play? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/an/qr/ib/anqribsry0kfhoxnkgpvwzs1jsc.jpeg"><br><br>  Behind testing should begin the stage of <b>balancing.</b> <br><br>  <b>Types of balance:</b> <br>  1. Mathematical balance: zero amount. <br>  2. Emotional balance: transactions. <br>  3. Testers balance: there are no weak links. <br>  4. Player self-balance: what immediately am I ?! <br>  5. The balance of the author: I am an artist, I see it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/6h/_9/pe6h_9fhhrdbd5mjwgwwdmdjaco.jpeg"><br><br>  After all this, you need to decide whether to publish your project yourself, collecting money for it through crowdfunding systems, or resort to the services of a <b>publisher</b> .  In the second case, it is worth considering the following features: <br><br>  <b>The specifics of working with the publisher:</b> <br>  1. The contract for ~ 5 years with royalties of 4-7% of wholesale. <br>  2. 98% change in setting. <br>  3. Recycling ~ 30% of the game to the needs of the publisher. <br>  4. A lot of feedback from testers. <br>  5. The ability to get an order for development. <br><br>  Thank you Yuri for such a useful and interesting workshop! <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, we invite you to our absolutely free exhibition-conference <a href="http://gamedevday.hsbi.ru/">‚ÄúLecture Day on the Gaming Industry‚Äù</a> , where we will have new reports on the gaming industry, the notes from which will also be published on Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341998/</a></p>
