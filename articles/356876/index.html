Assange requested security of ten thousand policemen. <br><br>  Earlier, Julian Assange said that he was afraid of the assassination attempt with the help of a drone and that he could be pulled out of the embassy by the leg while playing football. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ade/3a6/f41/ade3a6f41b7cce5bcf20af10022ffee1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Julian Assange has had pain in his right shoulder for the past few months and wants to have an MRI at the nearest clinic.  Assange sent an official request to the authorities, in which he offered to provide security for his car on the way from the Ecuadorian embassy to the clinic with the help of ten thousand police officers.  The event was supposed to last a few hours.

      Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Pati√±o, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/10/uk-refuses-assange-safe-passage-to-hospital-to-diagnose-shoulder-pain/">told reporters</a> that the UK authorities must respond to Assange‚Äôs request, as "he should receive all the advantages of the shelter we have provided for maintaining respectful international relations."  According to him, the British government reported that Assange could leave the embassy at any time, but the authorities do not guarantee his safety.  Pati√±o considers this another violation of human rights. <br><br>  On October 15, the <a href="http://ria.ru/world/20151015/1302534940.html">representative of Scotland Yard stated</a> that if Assange left the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãhe would be immediately arrested. <br><br>  Assange, 44, was granted asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy and has been there since 2012 in connection with allegations of sexual harassment, which two women have put forward against him in Sweden.  Prosecutors asked the authorities of Ecuador to provide an opportunity to question the founder of WikiLeaks, but could not do it.  While Assange was at the embassy, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/260152/">the statute of limitations for some of the charges expired</a> .  But one more accusation remains: rape - his statute of limitations will expire in 2020, when Assange will be 49 years old. <br><br>  Julian Assange in August 2015, said he was <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/261146/">afraid of an assassination attempt with the help of a drone</a> .  He believes that if he leaves the embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãhe will be kidnapped and taken to the United States, where he will face the death penalty.  In October, in <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/julian-assange-cant-play-football-in-case-police-pull-him-out-the-window-of-the-ecuadorian-embassy-2015-10">an interview, Assange said</a> that he wanted to play football during the World Cup with police officers, but he was afraid that they would drag him through the window by the leg with which he would kick the ball. <br><br>  In October, the British police <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/263852/">stopped guarding Assange at the embassy</a> .  For three years, the country's treasury his guard was worth 12 million pounds - about 18.5 million dollars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356876/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356876/</a></p>
