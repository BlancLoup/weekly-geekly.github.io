In short, the interview turned out to be no longer with Google representatives, but with the US Foreign Office.  For details, welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/284/fa9/4ae/284fa94ae01b4be7a9ec459d411409d9.jpg"><br>  <em>Google Chairman Eric Schmidt</em> <del>  looking at you </del>  participates in the annual meeting of the Pulse of Today's Global Economy (Pulse of Today's Global Economy), which is part of the Clinton Global Initiative September 26, 2013, New York.  Photographer: Mark Lennihan <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By July, the topics for conversation increased.  That summer, WikiLeaks continued to grind American diplomatic documents with a screech, publishing thousands of them weekly.  When, seven months earlier, we first began to issue such documentation, Hillary Clinton condemned us, calling it ‚Äúan attack on the international community‚Äù and ‚Äúgovernment‚Äôs <em>tear at the fabric‚Äù</em> . <br><br>  It was this turbulence that made the guys from Google build plans for June, land at the London airport and make the long way to East Anglia, in Beccles, Norfolk [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>Suffolk <a href="https://www.google.ru/maps/place/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%2581,%2BBeccles,%2B%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%2BNR34,%2B%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F/%4052.4431277,1.2501422,10z/data%3D!4m2!3m1!1s0x47d98aaa6aa9fec9:0xd3b589f4548fa957">actually</a></em> .]  Schmidt arrived first, accompanied by his then partner, Lisa Shields (Lisa Shields).  When he introduced her as vice-president of the Council on Foreign Relations - the American foreign policy think tank, which is in close relations with the State Department - I became thoughtful.  Shields, in itself, was straight from Camelot ("straight out of Camelot"), and also lit up with John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1990s.  They sat down with me and we exchanged courtesies.  They said that they forgot to take a tape recorder, so mine went on.  Having agreed that I would send them a recording of the conversation, and they, in exchange, the transcript, we began.  Schmidt decided to go into the pool with his head, immediately filling me up with questions about the organizational and technical foundation of WikiLeaks.

      Some time later, Jared Cohen joined us.  Along with him arrived Scott Malcomson (Scott Malcomson), who was introduced as an editor of the book.  Three months after our meeting, Malcomson will join the State Department as lead speechwriter and chief adviser <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Susan Rice</a> , who was then the US ambassador to the UN, and later appointed national security adviser.  Prior to that, he served as a senior adviser to the UN, while being a longtime member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  At the time of writing, is the director of communications for the International Crisis Group [ <em>app.</em>  <em>The International Crisis Group is positioning itself as ‚Äúan independent non-profit, non-governmental organization that conducts field analysis and creates high-level propaganda to resolve dangerous conflicts.‚Äù</em>  <em>Also, the organization is <a href="http://archive.is/b8G3o">described</a> as ‚Äúa high-level think tank that provides policy advice to governments and under the leadership of NATO reforming the Balkans - Michael Barker,‚Äú Imperial Crusaders for Global Governance ‚ÄùSwans Commentary, April 20, 2009‚Äù</em> ]. <br><br>  At that moment, the delegation that arrived was a quarter of Google, and three quarters of the United States foreign affairs agency, but I still did not catch up.  Having finished with handshakes, we set to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc1/442/501/bc1442501f44474aad5a40cbea53f424.jpg"><br>  <em>Eric Schmidt is posing in the New York Elevator, holding a new book, World Order, by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8">Henry Kissinger</a> , September 25, 2014</em> <br><br>  Schmidt was misleading.  At the age of sixty, looking with a squint from behind owl glasses, officially dressed - the stern look of Schmidt pointed to a purely machine ability to analyze.  But his direct questions often let him know what he wants, as if betraying his external severity and constructive reason.  However, it was the same mind that managed to abstract the engineering and programming principles in order to grow Google into mega-corporation, building a corporate structure in such a way as to always find ways to grow.  This was a man who understood how to build and how to maintain <em>systems:</em> information systems and human systems.  My world was new to him, but it was the same world of unfolding social processes, growth and information flows. <br><br>  For a man of the systemic mind, Schmidt's convictions ‚Äî as I understood from our conversation ‚Äî were surprisingly mundane, even banal.  He picked up a structural connection quickly, but found it difficult to put into words many of these things, often cramming geopolitical subtleties into the marketing turnovers of Silicon Valley or into the official language of the micro-language of his satellites from the Department of State <em>.</em>  <em><a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">in a footnote,</a> Assange notes that this can be considered a living confirmation of a weak version <a href="http://archive.is/QXJPx">of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a> about the dependence of thinking on the structure of the language used.</em>  <em>Probably not English in general, but a kind of dialect born in the political circles of the States and the valley, including</em> ].  In better shape, he was perhaps even unimportant when he spoke as an engineer. <br><br>  I found that Cohen is a good listener, but a less interesting thinker who is obsessed with the tireless idleness that usually ruins the careers of scholars and Rhodes scholars ("Rhodes scholars") [ <em>app.</em>  <em>Rhodes Scholarship - a prestigious award for non-British graduate students, giving a scholarship to study at Oxford</em> ].  As expected, based on his foreign policy training, Cohen had knowledge of international hot spots and conflicts and moved quickly between them, describing in detail possible scenarios to test my statements.  But sometimes there was a feeling that his orthodoxy was aimed at impressing former colleagues from official Washington.  Malcomson, the eldest, was thoughtful, his contribution to the conversation was attentive and generous.  Shields was silent for most of the conversation and only inserted remarks. <br><br>  As an interlocutor, I was supposed to make the most of the conversation.  I wanted to dedicate them to my worldview.  To their merit, I consider this interview the best that I gave them.  I walked out of my comfort zone and I liked it.  We ate, then walked around the area, continuing to record everything on the recorder.  I asked Eric Schmidt to tell WikiLeaks about government requests to the company, which he refused, suddenly nervous and citing the illegality of disclosing information about requests according to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">Patriot Act</a> .  By the evening we finished and they left, returned back to unreality, to the distant halls of the informational empire, and I stayed to continue working. <br><br>  This was all over, or rather, it seemed to me then. <br><br>  <b>More information:</b> <br>  Original excerpt <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">on WikiLeaks</a> <br>  "When Google Met WikiLeaks" in <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/when-google-met-wikileaks/%3Futm_source%3Dnewsweek%26utm_medium%3Dserial%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle_met_wikileaks">its entirety</a> ($ 10) <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24752/">The first</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24850/">Third</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24882/">Fourth</a> part translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24950/">Fifth</a> part of the translation <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25078/">Sixth</a> part of the translation </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299388/</a></p>
