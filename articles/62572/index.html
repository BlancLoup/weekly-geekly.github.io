  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Diploma Tips Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://sir-jack.habrahabr.ru/blog/62565/">first part,</a> I briefly wrote about the preparation of a thesis, about what to devote more time in it.  Here I will try to present my personal experience directly on the protection and preparation for it.  Still, it seems to me that in most cases protection is somewhat more important than the diploma itself.  Although, of course, there are numerous exceptions ... <br><br>  So, the diploma is written, in three days (or tomorrow) protection.  The excitement is understandable, especially for those who defend for the first time or have no experience speaking to an audience.  Remember one thing: you wrote this diploma and no one understands it better than you.  Consider yourself an author who shows colleagues (it‚Äôs easier to perceive the commission that way) your work.  And hence the corresponding attitude: you are not asking to give you a good grade, but explain to them the topic in which you are an expert.  Consider the protection of the usual presentation of a person who understands the subject (you), people who want to learn something new (commission).  Feel like a lecturer in front of students. <br><br>  But for this feeling to be truly persistent, preliminary preparation is necessary. <br>  I believe that in addition to the diploma itself, there should be a presentation and handouts on defense.  Well and, of course, food and drinks for coaxing the commission;)

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Presentation. </h5><br>  This is your official cheat sheet and presentation plan.  I will not go into the rules of the presentation - too much has been written about it.  The main thing here is: <br>  Minimum text on a slide - it should be easy to read, something like a story plan.  Very well suited here to use lists. <br><br><ul><li>  Maximum figures and diagrams - perfectly designed and visual.  Of course, in the style of the overall presentation design. </li><li>  The design should be one.  The text should be clearly visible in the background.  I prefer the dark font and light background. </li><li>  Attention to detail.  Every element that you put on the slides must be carefully prepared.  All figures should be cleared of unnecessary inscriptions, diagrams signed, etc.  Everything should be so that you do not have to explain what is depicted where.  Each slide should be clear without your story. </li><li>  A bit of humor and interesting decorations.  I personally like animated pictures in places where text is too boring or there is no graphics.  If these pictures fit well with the theme, of course.  The commission is tired of listening to boring and uninteresting reports - they will be entertained by animation and video.  But know the measure :) </li></ul><br><br>  The presentation should not be large charts and tables.  It does not look and depresses.  Place the really important charts and tables in the handouts better.  Well, offer the commission to view it in razdatke.  If they are interested in it. <br><br>  The most difficult thing when creating a presentation is to think about what is going on.  And what will you say at the time of each slide.  Therefore, the presentation should be done in parallel with the text of the report. <br><br><h5>  The text of the report. </h5><br>  Many read their diploma and think they can easily tell it.  In my experience it is very difficult.  You need to write specific words that need to be spoken on defense and link them to the presentation and handouts.  After polishing this text - you need to speak it out loud a couple of times.  And preferably "without a piece of paper." <br><br>  It is clear that the text of the report and the text on the slides should be correlated, but not the same.  Each phrase on the slide should correspond to a number of related sentences. <br><br><h5>  Handout. </h5><br>  They tried to impose on me the point of view that the handout was a printed presentation.  Of course, if there are 3-5 paragraphs of text on each slide, this is justified.  Personally, it seems to me that the handout is what is needed for the report itself.  Without it, you can do, of course.  If the necessary text heaps are in the diploma.  But the commission likes each of its members to have a copy of the necessary information.  And the diploma is the only one ... So here, look at the situation. <br><br>  The commission on protection needs to be led on the way.  Do not give her the initiative.  Everything should go as you thought.  This is possible, since you only have 10-15 minutes to speak and a lot of graduates who also need to defend themselves.  Therefore, try to plan everything so that the commission listens to you with open mouth, obeying all your words.  As students in front of a good lecturer.  Topical stories, jokes, interesting facts and everything that will relax the commission are acceptable.  They are people too. <br><br><h5>  Questions </h5><br>  Most are afraid of this.  I always devote time to preparing for questions.  We take the text of our report and for each proposal we come up with questions.  If there are questions that are difficult for us to answer, we will rewrite this part of the report so that this does not arise.  This is a difficult job, but there will be less undesirable questions. <br><br>  Another my favorite way is the expected questions.  This is when we deliberately do not touch on a particular topic or mention it in passing, but we study it enough to answer any question.  We, as if forcing the commission to ask the question, the answer to which we know.  It is rarely possible to do this, but this must be sought.  To do this, it is good to know the scientific interests of all members of the commission and to be ready to show in their diploma a part of their interests.  If, of course, you understand this area :) <br>  I would like to once again emphasize the following: <br><br>  It is better not to write what you can not explain.  Worst of all, when nonsense is written on the slide and it is noticed.  Therefore, every word in the presentation (ideally and in the text of the diploma) should be critically verified. <br><br>  At the end of the report, briefly state once again the importance of the work and directions for further development (although this may be a separate issue).  Show the commission that the work will not end with a diploma, but will continue to develop.  Also, the commission likes when the goals, objectives, methods, and relevance are clearly formulated in the report.  At the end of the report it's nice to emphasize that all the goals have been achieved and you are a good fellow :) <br><br>  The right mood, confidence and goodwill.  Feel yourself a lecturer, manage the audience.  Interest commission commission trifles, since the subject they know, as a rule, better than you.  Show everyone that this is your work, you wrote it and understood this topic well. <br><br>  Maybe I missed something.  However, GOOD LUCK! <br><br>  PS This article is also published on <a href="http://next2nothing.ru/blog/sovety-po-zashchite-diploma-chast-2">my blog.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62572/</a></p>
