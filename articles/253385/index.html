  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modular data centers from the Middle Kingdom and Asia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many people think that a data center is just a room with servers.  Ninety percent of all the information that has accumulated over the past decades, as well as being transmitted to each other via the global Internet, has become a reality thanks to the data center.  More and more companies, businesses, ordinary users and governments around the world depend on computer systems, software and networks, which in turn depend on data centers.  Infrastructure contributes to companies in business management, officials - in the management of the country and ordinary people for the exchange of information and not only. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c8/167/d12/9c8167d12fe34b7f93e05ea653fd619c.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The daily increase in needs has led data center owners to increase their infrastructure and computing power as a whole with minimal cost.  The concept of a modular data center allows you to reduce costs to a minimum, which at any time allows you to flexibly increase your consumer capacity at the moment.  Thus, owners avoid capital and operating costs and effectively satisfy the end user.  The modular solution market is gaining more and more popularity among data centers.  Recently, new information about modular data centers from Tencent, ZTE and Minkels has appeared.

    <cut><h3>  Tencent and ZTE Launch companies from China have been impoverished in the modular data center segment </h3><br>  Chinese telecommunications company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent Holdings</a> (the largest Internet provider) and the second largest manufacturer of telecommunications equipment <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE">ZTE CORPORATION</a> , jointly developed and implemented a modular container data center.  They reached a record level of energy efficiency, the estimated coefficient of energy efficiency (PUE) is 1.0665.  The data center receives energy from a solar farm located on the roof.  This figure is astounding because, as most data centers located in China, PUE is at a mark above 2.2, according to data provided by ZTE CORPORATION. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f85/168/b4c/f85168b4c9be40528744b3814d9c1096.jpg"><br><br>  Commercial data center was named Tencent West Lab.  It will provide the opportunity to lease standard container blocks based on the ZTE T-block to other companies, in which they will place their server equipment.  These modules will be mobile and at the request of customers, they can move around campus.  After the customer places an order, the modular unit is delivered on campus and proceeds to install additional, individual modular units and client equipment inside the container.  This equipment is installed and put into operation within two weeks after delivery to the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f2/62e/466/9f262e4664714bbe8347b9758aec772f.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/dda/642/56fdda6427984b76a157cb6ecc938b4a.jpg"><br><br>  It is planned to use an indirect evaporative cooling system for equipment located in containers.  Part of the electricity will come from a solar panel that directly converts solar energy into a constant electric current.  Additional electricity will flow through the high voltage direct current (HVDC) power line for cost savings. <br><br>  The software used to manage individual container blocks is called iDCIM (developed by ZTE specialists).  Physical assets on campus are managed using an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID">RFID</a> radio tag system. <br><br>  ZTE is represented on the market as the largest Chinese manufacturer of enterprise-class networking equipment, and Tencent is a holding company.  She owned numerous Internet services and data centers.  Previously, the company collaborated and together realized the data center, which is located in the city - Shenzhen.  There, a micro-modular solution was used to quickly and efficiently deploy additional computing power while achieving a high level of energy efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9a/eaf/b2a/b9aeafb2a5334f398fa0c3a2f9bd48ee.jpg"><br><br>  Two more large Asian companies, Foxconn (the world's largest electronics manufacturer) and Huawei (one of the largest Chinese companies in the field of information and communication technologies) have also entered the market of modular container data centers.  Foxconn holds a patent for the design of a modular data center that is powered by renewable energy sources, and Huawei has developed containers capable of operating in harsh climatic conditions with an outdoor temperature from -40 ¬∞ C to +55 ¬∞ C. <br><br><h3>  I also want to bring to your attention the company Minkels, which entered the European market of modular mini data centers called - MatrixCube </h3><br>  The Minkels company manufactures auxiliary equipment for data centers and enters the European market with the modular micro data center MatrixCube.  This solution is aimed at small and medium businesses.  According to the latest data, the product is already on sale in countries such as: Belgium and the Netherlands.  In the near future, it will be available in other European markets, including the UK and France.  MatrixCube is a product that allows companies to keep the computing infrastructure in their hands and not provide their valuable data and business tasks for storage to third-party colocation providers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/797/35a/3d079735a611418f8d9cac2547ec31f1.jpg"><br><br>  The system consists of two server racks and a DX cooling system (air cooler with direct evaporative cooling) and a near-secondary electrical distribution system.  It also includes an uninterruptible power system and a remote monitoring mechanism.  Minkels engineers achieved higher energy efficiency inside the MatrixCube using airflow optimization. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-QBqhN-I8U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgYGP3IJoKdr-aBZEMplnitSv_INg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253385/</a></p>
