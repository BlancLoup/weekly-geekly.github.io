Reports that are not only interesting to listen to, but also useful for both defense and attack.  But do not be sad: the ZeroNights <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/">conference</a> will be held for the fifth time on November 25-26 in Moscow;) Part of the program is already known, and we are pleased to present it to you.  So welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Main program </h4><br><h5>  <b>Key report: ‚ÄúOde to hackers‚Äù</b> </h5>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Rodrigo Rubira Branco</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hackers create knowledge and share information from the birth of high technology.  They really deeply understand how the systems are built from the inside, but they motivate each of them something different.  As a company, faced with competition and external challenges, seeks to create products that respond to these challenges, and improve it with each new version (or not), so the hacker accumulates knowledge and develops thanks to them.  Since different hackers have different goals and objectives, they direct their talents to different areas.  If someone hacking some system seems to be easy, he probably already got the relevant knowledge and figured out the task, but this does not mean that someone else cannot be at the beginning of the same path, follow it with passion and attention to the complexity of the system.

      Different goals - different means.  Work can be loved, interesting and difficult, but still work with all its traditional advantages.  Everyone has his own life, and everyone should understand this, take responsibility for their own decisions and pay for mistakes.  Like climbing the career ladder of a technical specialist in a large corporation, and hunting for bugs on loose bread (and there is a lot of common between these two extremes), a researcher must make informed decisions, and we will discuss them in this report.  The ultimate goal is to show that there are both difficulties and opportunities, and that you can arrange your life very differently, while remaining faithful to the main priorities: to acquire knowledge and have fun. <br></div></div><br>  <b>"Hacking virtual devices"</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Jeremy Brown</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Virtual devices are now being used everywhere, because virtualization is omnipresent, and hypervisors are common. <br><br>  More and more large vendors provide virtual clones of their products, previously available only in the form of a physical installation.  As in the case of the Internet of things and CAN-buses, everything is just beginning, and vendors are already late.  They are not ready, first of all, for the appearance of a huge attack surface teeming with vulnerabilities.  In addition, many vendors believe that virtualized software for the user is a convenient opportunity to evaluate the product before purchasing the physical version, so this version of the product is more accessible and easier to debug using the capabilities of the platform on which it is running. <br><br>  In my report, I will analyze the real cases of the appearance of various vulnerabilities due to errors that many large players make when delivering virtualized software.  You will learn how to find such bugs yourself, find out how vendors approached the task of fixing them and whether they solved it at all.  As a result of the report, you will firmly know how the task of remote code execution on a virtual device is solved. <br></div></div><br>  <b>"We pull out a sick (blue) tooth"</b> <br>  <b>Speakers: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Matteo Beccaro</a> , <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Matteo Collura</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Do you know how many Bluetooth devices are in the world right now?  With the advent of the Internet of Things and Smart Bluetooth technology (saves energy), there have been an incredible amount of them. <br><br>  Are they safe?  What if I tell you that I can unlock your smartphone?  What if I tell you that I can open a new SmartLock lock that has a door locked in your house?  In this report, we briefly explain how the Bluetooth protocols (BDR / EDR / LE) work, with an emphasis on their security.  Then we will show some known vulnerabilities and, finally, top secret, even demonstrate them. <br></div></div><br>  <b>"Cisco IOS shellcode - all-in-one"</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Georgy Nosenko</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Cisco networking equipment has always been an attractive target for attacks, due to the widespread use and the key role that this equipment plays in building network infrastructure and its security.  This equipment has a wide variety of architectures, types and versions of operating systems (firmware) that manage Cisco network equipment, which makes it very difficult to develop a universal shell code.  Shell codes for Cisco IOS, which are available in the public domain, sharpened for specific network equipment, are not distinguished by wide functionality and are of little use during penetration tests. <br><br>  This report will discuss the results of the study, which was undertaken by our research center, in order to create the most portable shell-to-portable between Cisco IOS firmware, which gives penters a wide range of possibilities, thanks to the ability to dynamically change the assignment of the shell code at the post-exploitation stage.  Also consider the possibility of the emergence of a "worm" that spreads through the network infrastructure from the firewall to the router, from the router to the switch, etc. <br></div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúFix it yourself: close vulnerabilities in UEFI with your own hands‚Äù</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Nikolay Shley</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  There was a vulnerability in your firmware, and the manufacturer is not in a hurry with the update?  Or was the update released yesterday, but instead of fixing the old vulnerability, they added two new ones? <br><br>  Enough of this, it's time to take the security of the firmware in your hands!  This report is about how to independently detect and close currently known vulnerabilities in UEFI-compatible firmware. <br></div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúBig Problems with Big Data: Hadoop Interface Security‚Äù</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Jakub Kaluzny</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  What are the new challenges for security auditors that have become fashionable ‚Äúcloud technologies‚Äù and ‚Äúbig data‚Äù? <br><br>  If you do not take into account the complexity of Hadoop installations and the number of interfaces, using standard techniques you can test the vulnerabilities of web applications, SSL security and other encryption.  We checked the prevalent Hadoop environments and found a number of critical vulnerabilities that could cast a shadow over the big data reputation. <br></div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúIllusoryTLS: No one but us.</b>  <b>Imitation, modification and operation "</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Alfonso De Gregorio</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Learn how to embed an elliptic asymmetric backdoor into an RSA module using the Elligator.

They are echoed by Hollywood films and numerous publications in the media, so now everybody is dedicated to the art of calling cybergaddon: you crack something that goes beyond the SCADA system, gas will immediately rush to the right place, and the world will go crazy.  And since no one really understands what kind of SCADA it is, then at the conference a speaker can hang an audience noodles on his ears. <br><br>  This report is an express course on the action program after hacking SCADA.  If an evil alien remotely attacks a rather complicated process, he doesn‚Äôt have magically exhaustive knowledge about this process, and he has to solve a number of intermediate tasks before the final attack.  How is the process controlled?  What commands does he understand?  What features can be exploited?  Without answers to these questions is not enough.  You can embed any data, but this still does not guarantee the ability to arbitrarily control processes.  The physics of the process and the intricacies of control logic can be a great confusion for the villain of the map.  As an example, we will bring the traffic lights to a catastrophic state, so that students will gain practical knowledge about SCADA hacking.  The report includes all stages of a cyber-physical attack with a description of the tasks performed at each stage, and nontrivial workarounds that sometimes have to be resorted to by an attacker. <br><br>  It is assumed that by the end of the presentation, students will be able to bring the charlatans to the clear water and are inspired to create their own interesting and original attacks on SCADA with arbitrary physical consequences. <br></div></div><br>  <b>"Modification of firmware industrial switches"</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Alexander Ermolov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The heart of any modern ICS infrastructure is a data bus.  In most cases, it is based on a family of Ethernet technologies.  The report deals with attacks on the main elements of the bus - industrial switches.  Methods will be shown to replace the firmware of switches using various vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù configurations.  Compromising such a switch allows you to get almost unlimited control over the process: you can interfere and change data within various connections between the PLC and SCADA, between the gateways and the PLC, forge data sent to the HMI and logging systems, etc. All this can result to the fact that the operator will not control the real state of the technological process and, as a result, to stop the process or the accident.  In addition, the possibility of permanent implementation (by compromising the bootloader) of the code in the switch will be considered. <br></div></div><br>  <b>"Direct X - Direct Path to the Microsoft Windows Core"</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Nikita Tarakanov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Thanks to graphics technologies, many APIs have appeared in the kernel mode drivers that are available for the 3rd protection code.  If you create materials for a computer game or video player, you will have to use one of the low-level functions provided by the Windows Display Driver Model to interact with the kernel driver.  Graphic operations are resource-intensive, complex and accessible to an unprivileged user.  This study focuses on finding vulnerabilities in low-level interactions of the 3rd ring with 0th within WDDM and through the GDI user mode library.  The presentation will show fuzzing statistics and techniques, as well as vulnerabilities found in Intel, NVIDIA and ATI drivers. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Defensive Track </h4><br>  <b>‚ÄúLet's play the game: another way to test for penetration‚Äù</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Kirill Yermakov</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Any modern corporation passes external pentest, audits and other checks of the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù of information security.  There are many different approaches to these processes.  Some of them are slightly better in efficiency than automated scanning, while others claim to simulate a real attack.  I will tell you about our approach to ‚Äúpenetration testing‚Äù and the story of a two-month survival game. </div></div><br>  <b>‚ÄúHow we fought 0-day in Adobe Flash: the hunt for a damaged vector‚Äù</b> <br>  <b>Speakers: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Andrei Kovalev</a> , <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Konstantin Otrashkevich</a> , <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Evgeny Sidorov</a></b> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In 2015, Adobe Flash exploitation remains in vogue among security researchers, as well as among cybercriminals.  After all, this is a player consisting of a single code base and working in all modern browsers and on all operating systems.  Such conditions allow you to attack different platforms with one exploit. <br><br>  The history of Flash exploits based on damage to vector objects began in 2013, when the first exploit for Lady Boyle CVE-2013-0634 was released.  In 2014, the CVE-2014-0322 vulnerability suggested a simpler approach: damage to the Vector.length field, which allows reading and rewriting the memory of the IE process, creating ROP shellcode and starting it.  This is a very powerful approach used in all new exploits (including the leaked HackingTeam resources). <br><br>  Only in July 2015, Google and Adobe invented a new countermeasure technology that protects the end user, but the developers of exploit packs do not care. <br><br>  We in Yandex have our own behavioral analysis technology developed for such exploits, and in our presentation we will share the key principles on which it is based.  We will also give instructions on the development of a behavioral analysis system for detecting complex Flash exploits. <br><br>  We will pay special attention to: <br><ul><li>  the main techniques used in recent exploits for the Adobe Flash player; </li><li>  The Vector &lt;...&gt;. length Google validation technique and its circumvention; </li><li>  approaches to reducing the risks from exploiting Abode Flash vulnerabilities and how to circumvent them (bypassing Adobe Flash Control Flow Guard); </li><li>  our experience in detecting such exploitation attempts. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Workshops </h4><br>  <b>"Cross-platform reversing with Frida"</b> <br>  <b>Speaker: <a href="http://2015.zeronights.ru/dokladchiki">Ole Andr√© Vadla Ravn√•s</a></b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the workshop</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Frida is a programmable toolkit for dynamic binary instrumentation that allows you to drastically shorten the development cycle of tools for dynamic analysis and reverse engineering.

If the word ‚Äúiron‚Äù for you means not only an element of the periodic table, then you are definitely worth a look at us.  There will be a lot of iron and electronics. <br><br>  Most of the time in two days will be occupied by workshops, reports from the old and new school of hackers, as well as question-answer sessions and contests on breaking the iron for a while. <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This year we will try to take into account the mistakes of past years, and try to better structure the project both in content and in time. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first day will be devoted to wired networks and standard data transfer interfaces such as Ethernet, 1Wire, UART, JTAG, SPI, etc. The equipment recommended for this kind of analysis, including oscilloscopes, logic analyzers and multimeters, will also be shown. We will tell you how to work with them. Dmitry Nedospasov separately will reveal the theme of FPGA / FPGA and their use for hacking.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The second day will be allocated exclusively for wireless data networks. This year we will try to cover the main part of unlicensed frequency bands (in particular: 350Mhz, 433Mhz, 868Mhz, 915Mhz, 2.4Ghz, and the popular RFID, NFC, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth exchange protocols. A small workshop on SDR may be useful for those who want to deal with this topic, but do not know how to start. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Speaking about the target audience, it is worth noting that the Hardware Village is a project from enthusiasts of the iron world and for enthusiasts of any level.
