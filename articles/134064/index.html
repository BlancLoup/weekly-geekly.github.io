By the way, this is exactly the project about which I wrote my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/netapp/blog/128301/">previous</a> (so surprisingly unpopular in this blog) post. <br>  A couple of months ago, the equipment was delivered to the customer, and I asked him to take pictures of some of the basic stages of unpacking and installation to show them to you. <br><br>  In this case, since NetApp FAS2040A with DS4243 disk shelf arrived much earlier than the rest of the kitchen (for which great respect for distributors and partners for efficiency, <i>some</i> would learn), we started with it, and that is why there is nothing in the photo except for it .  But here, in the end, not a blog of Cisco;).  As of today, the project has already been fully deployed and put into ‚Äútrial operation‚Äù.

      So, this is what you get when a new NetApp stack arrives. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt take the very first picture, with a fully closed and packed box, but when you open it, the first thing you find under it is a set of mounting hardware, so-called "rails", as well as cables and a quick start guide. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/e5a43ba4/3f150977/fff505e0/793b5dfc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3bf1565b/9a51d58a/1b3822d8/699679fe.jpg"><br><br>  Please note that the kit includes two sets of fasteners (screws and nuts), for metric and inch threads.  Choose what you use, so that you don‚Äôt get confused. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/31fcb21f/922a0b05/6ce6d455/6a30ffcb.jpg"><br><br>  The mounting bracket is installed in a rack and is ready for placement of the stack itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/57209208/ad946fcc/ffed061e/ff34ab74.jpg"><br><br>  Unpack the actual FAS2040A. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/72fe9ca3/09a73d52/841b88a1/abb60f9b.jpg"><br><br>  It is, I recall, a device with a height of 2RU (‚Äútwo units‚Äù).  In the box it is on the stops of their foam.  Pimply film, alas, was not found :) Right there, on the front side, is a cardboard box with a ‚Äúmuzzle‚Äù - bezel - front decorative cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5e49fa99/6482e617/f3f3a699/c75de909.jpg"><br><br>  So it looks like the unpacked FAS2040A from the ‚Äúface‚Äù, still without the installed ‚Äúmuzzle‚Äù - bezel.  I have already said that in this project we use the FAS2040A version without the discs installed in the case, although this option is possible.  In place of the discs in the case there are 12 plastic plugs, and the discs are located in a separate disk shelf, about which below. <br>  If you buy a system with installed drives, and this is also possible, there will be 12 SAS or SATA drives.  Perhaps later we will add additional disks here if we do not have enough space or speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b30c450d/5970ad17/316e351a/633006ba.jpg"><br><br>  This is a story "from the tail."  Here you can see two installed controllers, 4 Gigabit Ethernet ports on each (right), then two service Ethernet ports and a console port, then a SAS port for connecting a disk shelf and, finally, two FC ports.  To the right and left of the controllers are two power supply fans.  The red bolt is used to unlock and pull the controller out of the case, if you need to remove it and replace it in case of a malfunction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/04a46cb7/c70fec98/358079ed/8ad5a722.jpg"><br><br>  On the left, when viewed from the face, there is a sticker on the case with a serial number (two, for each controller separately) of the system.  You will need them for registration in the support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/910ccbf2/e4bf0a4e/21fc7103/d3ac8a0c.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, the FAS2040A took its place in the rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/57f9ee1c/7902b725/c507760d/f33a97ae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/11d59f36/7fb488dd/e55915d2/685ea67e.jpg"><br><br>  Now everything is neat, the disks, or rather, in this case, the caps, are hidden under the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/237df913/92e7a0ca/2c2a5546/b88d959f.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go to the disk shelf.  Here it is in the box on the pallet.  Pay attention to the inscription - 92kg.  Really heavy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4295086f/cacd2dea/8e19b04f/64b6ae7b.jpg"><br><br>  Above, as in the case of the base unit, are the "rails" and fasteners, as well as cable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4fee8919/fd43714a/93459337/217d1341.jpg"><br><br>  Included with the disk shelf are two SAS cables, three ethernet cables to enable a special out-of-band ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù of controllers controllers, and 4 power cables (in the shelf with SAS drives there are 4 power supplies, in the shelf with SATA drives - 2 ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/98110a02/06ae5564/ab0c489a/41013048.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/15d8aba1/a930f0d6/747340e1/c6d04206.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ad23ba64/5f3ae379/da580d63/c9232d06.jpg"><br><br>  Mount in the cabinet is installed, you can start loading the shelf. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0ee4762b/0690d477/5fd32590/ac6056c3.jpg"><br><br>  Unpacked shelf, 4U high, in which there are 24 SAS disks.  Pay attention to two sets of handles for lifting.  For installation will require the efforts of at least two people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d7b2b723/08d7ee93/991e079e/27e34d72.jpg"><br><br>  Everything is ready to connect and run. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dc4910da/80c002f4/f73f5b1c/96d07dd4.jpg"><br><br>  Some details on the implemented project can be found in my previous post, there are also details about the use of the storage system and its configuration. <br><br>  And quite at the end a little organizational.  Since after recent <i>improvements</i> on Habrahabr here, it seems that the blogs of companies have finally cut out of the tapes, that is, what you are reading now.  Unfortunately, this, as I see it, has drastically reduced the number of its readers.  Most likely, if you have not added a company to your ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù, you will not be able to see new posts from it in the stream.  So if you want to continue to read posts on the NetApp blog, I recommend adding this blog and its company to your favorites by clicking on the ‚Äúheart‚Äù in the title. <br><br>  Special thanks to the <a href="http://blog.aboutnetapp.ru/">blog.aboutnetapp.ru</a> blog for the provided photos and the work on making the project a reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134064/</a></p>
