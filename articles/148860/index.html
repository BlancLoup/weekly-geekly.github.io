Against this background, there are always interesting devices that, for one reason or another, stand out from all this diversity.  One of these, of course, is a laptop Dell Latitude E6430 ATG - a true universal soldier to work in difficult conditions, but with the usual office productivity.  Dell Latitude laptops are focused on corporate customers, they are not commercially available in ordinary electronics supermarkets.  However, with all the apparent narrowness of the audience, Latitude will certainly find its connoisseurs.  On the scale of Russia, where frosts, heat or high humidity occur suddenly <br>  and for utilities, and for ordinary citizens, the opportunity to "start" a laptop in the toughest <br>  conditions will be appreciated by many. <br>  <b>Caution!</b>  <b>Traffic!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The new generation of Latitude laptops, officially introduced in Russia on July 10th, is equipped with Intel Ivy Bridge processors.  What does this mean for the user?  Great performance, long battery life, support for all modern wireless networks, the latest USB 3.0 and Bluetooth 4.0 interfaces.  We also use advanced Intel vPro technology in this model, which provides the broadest remote management capabilities for system administrators of large (and not so) companies. <br><br>  All this fully applies to the Dell Latitude E6430 ATG, which is positioned <br>  like a laptop to work in extreme conditions. <br>  A couple of photos especially for those who have not yet seen our ‚Äúmonster‚Äù:

In addition, the corners are reinforced with a magnesium alloy material, and the display lid is anodized, which increases protection from the outside.  Metal hinges and a powder-coated base increase the overall strength of the notebook.  Such measures will protect the laptop when dropped from a height of 75 cm. <br><br><h6>  By the way, we checked, with its not quite small weight, the laptop without problems is held by the display lid in the opened state.  The hinges are tight!  :) <br></h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c89/cab/f25/c89cabf258b01490fea73ccadf2a97cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All external ports are closed with special covers to prevent the ingress of dust, dirt and moisture.  The E6430 ATG satisfies the MIL-STD 810G and <s>IP65</s> IP5X environmental resistance certificates, in other words, it meets the harsh military standards for use in ‚Äúcombat‚Äù conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b34/8db/18f/b348db18f64f38d60c7fef5a6d4caf67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  A little about the ports. </h4><br><br>  "Outside" displayed: <br><br><ul><li>  network RJ-45 (Gigabit Ethernet 10/100/1000 Mbit / s); </li><li>  2 USB 2.0 ports, 2 x USB 3.0 and combo USB / eSATA; </li><li>  combo stereo headphone / microphone jack; </li><li>  VGA + HDMI; </li><li>  card reader and ExpressCard reader (54 mm); </li><li>  dock connector (bottom). </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Conveniently: the laptop uses USB Powershare technology - even if the computer is in sleep mode, the connected devices can be charged. </h6><br><br><h4>  Display and keyboard </h4><br><br>  Protected by shock-resistant glass 14 "display gives a high-definition picture (1366 x 768).  Alternatively, a resistive touchscreen is available, also protected. <br>  The keyboard is waterproof and dustproof, with a standard layout, there is a backlight.  Optionally available: a fingerprint scanner, a handle for easy transportation, red keyboard illumination. <br><br><h4>  Insides </h4><br><br>  Well, now let's take a closer look at the proposed "stuffing".  We begin, as usual, with the processor.  Currently, there are four third-generation Intel Core variants running on the Mobile Intel QM 77 Express chipset, all with the ability to activate Intel vPro technology: <br><br><ul><li>  Intel Core i5-3320M (2.6 GHz, 3 MB cache in the third level); </li><li>  Intel Core i5-3360M (2.8 GHz, 3 MB cache in the third level); </li><li>  Intel Core i7-3520M (2.9 GHz, 4 MB cache in the third level); </li><li>  Intel Core i7-3720QM (2.6 GHz, 6 MB cache in the third level). </li></ul><br><br>  1600 MHz SDRAM DDR-3 RAM is available in 2 GB options (one module), 4 GB (one or two modules), 6 and 8 GB (two modules). <br><br>  The choice of the disk subsystem is also very flexible and depends on the intended tasks and the size of the wallet.  These are standard HDD at 7200 rpm with a capacity of 320/500/750 GB, and SSD with 128 or 256 GB, or a hybrid disk with 500 GB.  A rubber damper is used to ensure the stability of the hard disk to vibration, and a high-speed free-fall sensor is installed to further protect the information. <br><br>  For graphics capabilities, the default is the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 card. However, if its capabilities do not suit you, you can stop your choice on a discrete NVIDIA NVS 5200M card (GDDR5 1 GB). <br><br>  The laptop also offers a wide selection of wireless technologies.  So, the Wi-Fi card can be selected from several options: <br><br><ul><li>  Dell Wireless 1504 802.11g / n (single-band); </li><li>  Dell Wireless 1540 802.11a / n (dual-band, high speed); </li><li>  Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 802.11n; </li><li>  Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 802.11n; </li><li>  Intel Centrino Advanced-N + WiMAX 6250 802.11n. </li></ul><br><br>  Bluetooth - Dell Wireless 380 Bluetooth 4.0 LE (with reduced power consumption and full compatibility with the standards 1.1, 2.0, 2.1 and 3.0). <br><br><h6>  Convenient: To all of this, if you wish, you can add a Dell HSPA-EVDO Dell Wireless DW5630 (Gobi 3000) multi-mode mini-card with the A-GPS function. </h6><br><br>  And now, perhaps the most curious thing is the DVD drive.  More precisely, not the drive itself (the device is more likely endangered), but the basket into which it is installed - E-Modular bay.  It is here that can be installed additional modules designed to expand the functionality of the laptop.  In addition to the DVD-ROM (optional writing ¬± RW), there are the following options: hard disk of 320 GB 7200 r / min;  Additional USB 3.0 ports or an additional 30-watt three-cell rechargeable battery, which, together with the main 97-watt clock, will provide autonomous operation for as many as 32.7 (!) hours (this will also be supported by solid-state drive and the technology of new Intel Ivy Bridge processors).  Note that the drive can be removed ‚Äúon hot‚Äù, which means you can add a battery without turning off the laptop! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34a/f92/961/34af92961a908efd1f67804c28f9b948.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By the way, the second such basket can be equipped with a docking station and turn the laptop into a real office station wagon.  For example, a DVD-drive can be ‚Äúsettled‚Äù on the docking station - you will agree, it is unlikely that someone would think to launch Recovery DVD, being hundreds of kilometers away from the office or at home, although, I must admit, anything can happen. <br><br>  Additional data protection and access control are designed to provide technology Dell Data Protection |  Access in combination with a contact or contactless smart card, as well as the unique system expansion system Dell System Center Configuration Manager, which allows remote cleaning of hard drives on a separate channel using Intel vPro technology (note: will be launched in September 2012).  Data recovery from disks or guaranteed data destruction with the issuance of a certificate - if required, will be provided. <br><br>  The operating system is Microsoft Windows 7 in Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate versions, with 32 or 64 bits, with or without XP Mode support.  Since Dell has prepared Latitude for full-fledged use in large companies, we are ready to offer a whole range of services to make life easier for IT departments.  The customer can count on our assistance in the implementation and use of equipment at all stages.  For example, it is proposed to prepare a special OS image with a set of necessary software, store it and update drivers as necessary. <br><br><h5>  Recall about Dell‚Äôs traditionally serious approach to the entire Latitude family: </h5><br><ul><li>  generational continuity in terms of accessories - most accessories (batteries, docking stations) for the previous generation Latitude is compatible with the new generation; </li><li>  extensive customization options, various options for expansion cards (3G / WiMAX), etc.  - under each project of the customer we will select the necessary; </li><li>  Excellent service, comprehensively ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù under the provision of business continuity - the standard warranty for 3 years includes travel to the customer for the next working day (‚ÄúNBD on Site‚Äù), and the extended ProSupport - immediate departure to the customer with spare parts within four or eight hours from determine the cause of the malfunction (however, there are some restrictions on the territory related to the scale of Russia and the large distances between settlements). </li></ul><br><br>  Thanks to the flexible configuration when ordering a laptop, each customer can ‚Äúassemble‚Äù his ideal Dell Latitude E6430 ATG.  Of course, the reliability of data storage, more than decent battery life, wide communication possibilities and protection from adverse environmental impacts will primarily interest people who work in difficult conditions (geological exploration, oil production, construction, topography, rescue operations and emergency assistance). others).  In particular, we are proud that our laptops are used by the EMERCOM of Russia.  There are advantages in Dell Latitude and for individual retail customers - for example, those for whom the best rest is extreme sports or active tourism. <br><br><h4>  useful links </h4><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/ru/business/p/latitude-e6430-atg/pd">Page Dell Latitude E6430 ATG</a> on the Russian site Dell </li><li>  <a href="http://dell.ru/services">Details</a> about the possibility of servicing our equipment </li><li>  How does the <a href="http://content.dell.com/us/en/business/d/services/smb-image-management-imagedirect-us.aspx">Dell Image Management system</a> (in English) </li><li>  Dell Image Management's <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/deployment/en/image_direct%3Fc%3Dus%26cs%3D555%26l%3Den%26s%3Dbiz">video</a> </li><li>  Dell Latitude E6430 ATG Video: </li></ul><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGosUTLxohw&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhTTQ_o9HZChRKqpGb2HlBwYTiu9Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  More photos?
