  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Positive in the work of the administrator of the online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working with people by phone, undoubtedly, has its advantages - sometimes it is much easier to talk with a person without seeing him.  In addition, you lose the dubious pleasure of seeing the untidy or just unpleasant appearance of the client, and you do not have to tolerate the unpleasant smell from someone's mouth or delicately dodge saliva when talking.  But there are cases when you really want to look at the one who is on the other end of the line. <br><br>  The fact is that people tend to periodically talk and do stupid things.  Online store customers are no exception.  So, TOP-5 pearls, heard by the administrator from the handset. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>5th place</b> .  Here you can put together repeatedly distorted brand names of manufacturers.  For example: Vitek (Vitek), Pig (Sven), Sanon Dzhigital (Canon Digital), Haro (XORO), computer Elephant (Athlon processor).

      <b>4th place</b> .  Not everyone can immediately formulate the course of their thoughts.  While negotiating with the next client about the delivery time, in response to the question ‚ÄúWhen to bring up?‚Äù I heard the following tirade: ‚ÄúIs it now at 14:00?  Well ... two hours after now - and until the evening. "  This ‚Äúafter now‚Äù still cannot remember without a smile. <br><br>  <b>3rd place</b> .  Self-confidence is sometimes a good trait of character.  But only sometimes.  And in moderation.  One customer ordered a mobile phone.  Brought.  Half an hour later he calls and says that there is no Russian language in the ‚Äúmobile phone‚Äù.  Everyone is surprised, because the phone is not only Russified, but also certified, which was rare at that time.  We began to search all possible lasagna options on the menu, remembered all the keyboard shortcuts that can be used to translate the phone into Russian ... The man called back 5 or 7 times. they read the instructions at all, did everything written there? ‚Äù  The client‚Äôs response shocked everyone: ‚ÄúAm I a fool to read the instructions ???‚Äù.  In general, as expected, the Russian was still in the tube. <br><br>  <b>2nd place</b> .  Since the store is profiled on household appliances, customers in most cases call to order or clarify details about various household appliances.  Another call.  From the tube comes the "Hello, I'm calling you on a vacuum cleaner."  My philological nature, which, among other options, took the phrase, including verbatim, was tempting to answer: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm talking to you on the phone,‚Äù but it‚Äôs impossible - service J. It‚Äôs hard not to grunt into the receiver to pieces with laughter ... Subsequently, the entire labor collective of the shop was swaggering, inventing communication options through a refrigerator, a TV, and the like. <br><br>  <b>1st place</b> .  Not everyone can always remember the name of the online store from the first time.  As soon as the calling customers do not call him - * name * buy, * name * - shop-by, shop-by, shop-by, etc. All of us have not been surprised at such word-making for a long time, therefore the phrase ‚ÄúHello, Is this the Internet?  Familiar with all sorts of variations on the title, he replied in the affirmative.  The subsequent question ‚ÄúHow to connect to you?‚Äù Dotted i and, as they say, broke the hall.  The option that it was just someone joking immediately fell away, as it was all said in all seriousness, in an adult voice, and the person himself was confused when he heard in the background the friendly laughter of a restless team. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49000/</a></p>
