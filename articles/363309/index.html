But today, the role of oracles with success, and serious and commercial, has taken on outstanding producers and screenwriters. <br><br>  So next year promises to be fruitful for the realization of ideas that, with the light hand of Robert Zemeckis, the director and ideological inspirer of the immortal saga ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù, have become, without exaggeration, cult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/008/e54/e5a/008e54e5a8394e7a99e318b63b3a0065.gif">

      Already Tony Hawk (Tony Hawk) tore off the world's first prototype of a flying board - a HUVr haverboard (albeit in a pink version, but thank God, not from Mattel), Nike also presented self-laced high-tops, like Marty McFly.  In general, it remains only to wait for the flying Delorian - and here it is, the future, two meters from you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But while the court is on the case, and the majors decide how to get to the market louder, the harsh guys from Quebec, Canada, presented their version of self-tightening Powerlace sneakers.  At the moment, the project is in the process of collecting money for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748376549/powerlace-advanced-auto-lacing-shoe-technology">Kickstarter</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/f7c/c2b/4c7f7cc2bd4c41b7944fd6bbc49c59aa.jpg"><br><br>  The project is ambitious and largely divorced from real consumers.  For example, have you ever thought that lace up sneakers is a problem?  In general, thought about this shoe? <br><br>  But here you look at this guy's interview ... and you are amazed at his confidence, after all, the guys set a serious bar (650000 CAD ~ $ 573,000).  I must say, it is captivating. <br><br>  He holds a real model of his sneakers in his hand and simply says, they say, yes, we worked for a long time and today we believe that the world is ready for this product.  And without any bla-bla-bla, as he fought with his shoelaces as a child and how they changed his life.  And how he, at the grave of Einstein, swore to take revenge on them and create an absolutely new system for fixing shoes on his foot. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/guL5_rDjZic%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgmqThPApDFhqszlz6K7WZoJqitlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Moreover, the sneakers are really worth.  First, the design.  The modern monocoque design of the upper shell on the external version balances somewhere between comfortable sneakers and the best representatives of athletic shoes.  That is, it will fit every day, and it looks natural in jogging. <br><br>  Secondly, the materials.  Although the guys do not call the exact components and composition, again, in appearance, synthetic leather is guessed.  Well, since the sneakers are declared as all-weather, we can assume the presence of a membrane that provides both good water resistance and effective air exchange. <br><br>  And the most important thing is the mechanism.  No batteries, no electronics and motors, no springs and gears.  And what is inside is, of course, a mystery.  But how everything works, in general, is understandable. <br><br>  You slip your foot into the sneakers by pressing with a heel on the pressure sensor, which transmits the force directly to this hidden mechanism.  The force is multiplied in a certain way, and the tension of the cables occurs.  And here, obviously, a very successful engineering combination - the use of rigid lateral support, which is so necessary in sneakers, as a support for cable tensioners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d8/92b/7c6/3d892b7c650f4749b56949a55dd79ce5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5a/dd4/812/c5add48122aa413eb51f243a342eb4a5.jpg"><br><br>  A special spool, designed in a certain way, distributes pressure over the surface of the lifting foot, fixing the sneakers on the leg: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c1/fdd/a43/8c1fdda43efe47538f8c6aaf11e28039.jpg"><br><br>  The reverse process of loosening the lacing takes even less time - just pull the small lever on the back of the heel that continues the sole: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/83a/a3f/3da83aa3f799484f996c3194ad2ba597.jpg"><br><br>  As for the resource mechanism.  Here the issue is controversial and dependent on operating conditions, but the developers say 200,000 cycles, that is, about fifty years of active wear should suffice. <br><br>  Well, to check whether this is true or not is possible personally: as we said at the beginning, a startup is still in the process of funding, and pre-order is via <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1748376549/powerlace-advanced-auto-lacing-shoe-technology">Kickstarter</a> . <br><br>  Of course, there is a high probability that the project will not collect the required amount by the required date, but still the guys want to wish good luck, I love Kickstar for such strange and unusual projects.  Where else can you find something like that? <br><br>  You can deliver <a href="https://ru.litemf.com/">deliveries</a> from Canadian and American project creators through <a href="https://ru.litemf.com/">LightMIF</a> - I am sure that with us you will be able to send the goods much more profitably, unless the developers offer free shipping worldwide.  We deliver a parcel weighing 1 kg with the help of a courier and for only $ 20 to Moscow.  So you can safely invest in new projects, as long as the campaign <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/232059/">ends successfully</a> ! <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/d7d/506/521d7d506c53477494e0b40d66252dba.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363309/</a></p>
