      Honestly, I was somewhat surprised by how the new operating system entered our lives.  The manufacturers, having heard the good news from Google, pricked up their pumps for siphoning money from the people and, when the hour X came, began to pump so that they often almost sucked each other.  The result of this activity was an avalanche-like release to the market of a huge number of various devices, almost all of which belong only to the budget category - users who blindly buy ‚Äú <i>Android, e !!!</i>  ¬ªMust be taken hot. <br><br>  Were you happy about this situation in Google?  What, then, do the batuvans go ahead with all kinds of plastic, partially staining the reputation of the new platform?  Perhaps it was their insidious plan, but even if not so, I think they are happy - firstly, the hype is raised, and secondly, their device "and now, look, guys, how to do it" against the background of all kinds of android phones, would look doubly attractive.  In general, it seems like everything turned out - the platform was done, the hype was induced, the people were prepared - it's time to turn on the main pump) <br><br>  Watch in HD <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQ8pPyuVl78%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhdiLaIjSeL30SlKp7r6SB4k_z8JQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  So, the main pump is primarily interesting because it is built on the same platform as the HTC HD2.  In other words - inside the same <b>Qualcomm Snapdragon QSD8250 processor</b> with a frequency of 1 GHz.  And if in the review about the HTC HD2 (which, admittedly, many people liked), many were indignant, ‚Äú <i>Well, why WM ?!</i>  <i>There would be an android - I would take it right away!</i>  ‚ÄúToday in the review will not be indignant. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  The shape of the packaging is far from unique - our grandfathers built houses from bricks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b3/61a/967/8b361a9676e6553a757018284306911c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If no joke, then the box is really almost standardized - thick cardboard in the form of bricks, and on the outside ... no, this time there are no drawings of phones and tables - just two inscriptions "Nexus One" and "Google".  And it opens, unlike the HTC-shnyh a little differently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4df/513/9a2/4df5139a22b379052ad033c0972590db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But all this is thrown away trivia, the main thing - the content.  And there: <br><br>  - Phone <b>Google Nexus One</b> ; <br>  - Warranty papers; <br>  - USB-microUSB wire; <br>  - 4GB microSD card; <br>  - Charging from the outlet + euro-adapter; <br>  - Stereo headset + clip; <br>  - Case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9de/770/9f8/9de7709f87228d5edf29685559067c4d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tired of describing non-core things out of the box, if they are no different from many others, but for the sake of such a case ...;) So - the headset is the most common, except it has a small remote and a microphone, and the same Android is drawn on the right earpiece.  Despite the general fashion of making detachable plugs for charging, the adapter here is also the most common - non-removable.  Case - black neoprene, with the image of the same creation.  It looks very nice, on the phone (as opposed to the regular HD2) fits without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bf/2be/778/7bf2be7789399961c4d68974e658217d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, that's all.  I would like, of course, as usual - fixing and charging for a car, a beautiful cradle (to warm the soul in the workplace) ... but all this can be bought only separately.  For example, the original cradle <a href="http://googphone.ru/products/google-nexus-one-desktop-dock">costs</a> almost 3,000 rubles, but this price also includes certain functionality. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  It's no secret that HTC actually made the device, so it comes as no surprise that it is easy to find many similar elements in appearance with other communicators.  However, everything is in the best traditions. <br><br>  The case has rounded shapes and smooth edges, the materials - anodized aluminum, mixed with rough matte plastic - are very pleasant to hold in hands.  The dimensions are much more comfortable than HD2, although I also got used to them for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a9/8fa/9d3/7a98fa9d3381020acf0b9f4ea669be78.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  "Almost the entire front side" - soon this phrase can be inserted into the template.  But what, such a trend - to make a huge screen and a couple of buttons under it.  In this case, it is a fairly large (3.7 "") AMOLED display with a resolution of 480x800 (up to 16 million colors are displayed).  The same resolution as the HD2, only ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù into the screen with a slightly smaller physical size - the pixels will not be seen exactly.  Just below the screen there are 4 touch buttons hidden (Back, Menu, Home and Search) - all this is hidden under the glass (if you really look at it, you can find the ‚Äúpoints‚Äù of the proximity sensor and the indicator). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec8/fc9/c07/ec8fc9c07c6cd57343e75aebe08b5c47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, a little lower is the trackball, exactly the same as you could find in many models of the Taiwanese giant earlier (though there is a white backlight here).  Above the screen is an oblong speaker grid. <br><br>  At the top there is a headphone jack (3.5 mm) and a power button: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d26/e71/06e/d26e7106e3799d22c488457c9403d7a1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... at the bottom - a microphone, a microUSB connector and a pair of some contacts (apparently, for a cradle). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/980/d2e/4e1/980d2e4e170e3acaa4cfb189c21f84e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right side there is nothing, and on the left side there are almost non-protruding volume rockers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/480/99d/668/48099d6684b66218d714ac223d0ee808.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind - a smooth cover, a peephole of a 5 megapixel camera (with LED backlight) and a speaker hole.  Everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e9/735/032/3e97350328c5fd4aecd6edfafcdf9ecd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lid is not as practical as on the HD2 (there is metal), but still very reliable.  Under it is a battery (Li-Ion, 1400 mAh vs. 1230 mAh for HD2), a slot for a SIM card and a memory card.  The latter will definitely not be superfluous - the music and the 5-megapixel camera will eventually do their job. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1b/f02/1be/b1bf021bef6007c58526f1dc06ec4607.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bc/215/69f/7bc21569f327b55798b4d4d74df6d4b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The phone turns on immediately after the battery cover snaps into place - there is nothing left to do but get down to the most interesting part. <br><br><h2>  Inside </h2><br>  Immediately after the start, moving color dots appear on the screen, which draw the logo of the phone with their loops - using this animation as an example, one can fully judge the quality of the installed display.  However, those who have seen good AMOLED displays will not be surprised.  It is a pity that in the bright sun the screen is very blind - you have to set the maximum brightness.  Start - in exactly 20 seconds. <br>  At the very beginning, the user expects a friendly wizard that will help you tune in and get up to date. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dce/2cd/ec1/dce2cdec14a0e6d6be6d3ab71a2fb93a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, then comes the same purebred android, which distinguishes this google phone from many other android phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/380/34b/a7d/38034ba7d3cca0cf6ce68a4d65276f7f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Like everywhere else - 5 desktops, moving between them by strokes or rolling a trackball - as convenient (with your finger, of course!).  All sorts of icons and widgets are unusually small - on two desktops it is generally empty.  But when you press the "menu" in the center of the screen, you understand that everyone just hid.  Although not ... after collecting the scattered eyes, comes the realization that there are really few things.  So it's for the better - less clean! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f06/d3c/e76/f06d3ce76c4b5e4b562a91313271f241.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/781/6f0/ad8/7816f0ad8cd3f1b5739e052bd0857a82.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Icons can be moved as you like, but within reasonable limits - everything will be ‚Äútied‚Äù to the invisible grid.  Ie, for example, to build icons with a heart will not work.  On one of the desktops - a weather and news widget: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/736/bab/e38/736babe3865c631d6f658286803a0f15.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b6/c0c/d1a/6b6c0cd1af17c068ca5cc925cb4e6c59.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/758/9e4/394/7589e43943ea0bb648a12965cb643b56.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b16/04a/96e/b1604a96ecf6d333e83a52b7792a8e93.png" alt="image"><br><br>  While I was writing the paragraph above, the phone managed to ‚Äúblock‚Äù - the unlock screen is very functional.  There are two ‚Äúslider‚Äù on it - one unlocks the phone, the second mutes the sound.  Slightly higher is the clock, all notifications in the taskbar, and even a button for emergency calls.  During the call, in addition to the subscriber's number and his photo, there are also two sliders - a red tube and a green one (all this is accompanied by a light indication of the trackball). <br><br>  A couple of clicks and earned wifi.  After another couple of clicks on the virtual keyboard buttons, you‚Äôll see the contents of your mailbox on Gmail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf6/d55/9ff/bf6d559ff3523368e7b75bcc2980479f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ddf/c92/2c1/ddfc922c155827dd53152cbd90308bc9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, there is no Russian language on the keyboard initially, but this issue is easily solved.  In my case, I completely arranged the ‚ÄúRussian keyboard‚Äù from GameWarrior. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71f/63a/ca5/71f63aca5b41a73c204b4784d7ec785f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/342/5a8/480/3425a8480f22c5326adacb2499629fb1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It was also not immediately earned GPRS (although everything worked on HD2 without a file) - the instruction <a href="http://googphone.ru/">from here</a> helped (Settings - Wireless networks - Mobile networks - APN - New access point - Enter operator data - Profit!). <br><br>  As for Google services, the main functionality is in full.  The built-in Youtube player allows you to comfortably watch videos (however, similar functionality also goes to HD2 initially), Gtalk to chat (when the phone is inactive, messages come with sound and icons from them appear in the notification area), and Gmail fully works with mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95f/c6f/001/95fc6f00170cca7f8b9bd2034fab6ffd.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58e/c5d/000/58ec5d000f865762bc967412cceeefd8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By full-fledged work, I mean not only reading-creating-deleting letters, but working with all sorts of chains, file attachments, integration with other services. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a0/efd/1fd/6a0efd1fd98b6eab74966e044335489f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/879/b36/db8/879b36db839c50b7bc99583a65a5c929.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With regard to integration, you can note the work with the calendar, for which the main menu has a separate application.  You can lead it both from the device and from the computer - it is synchronized immediately, which is very convenient (I saw an article somewhere that told how to drag the dates of DR to all my friends from VK to the calendar - I did not try it, but it would be useful ).  Surprised. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60f/371/74e/60f37174e88a6411858b6e50a0853d97.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e2/5a2/b28/2e25a2b289666e1dcb6d4fbbf3465fbe.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0a/afc/755/e0aafc755be4b14208db359dd2430d5b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As a navigation software on the device, it is proposed to use maps in which there is the possibility of laying routes depending on the type of vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b68/353/a68/b68353a684590801daf14a833a8030b1.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21b/593/ff1/21b593ff11da28513efc462f647b6b64.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As in the "adult" version, there is a view from the satellite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9b/bbf/7aa/c9bbbf7aa35723192970405457529027.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03f/4ef/1f8/03f4ef1f8ab92c4a9afc0f259899a6df.png" alt="image"><br><br>  True, the drawing of maps is much slower than on HD2) There is a Car Home application that displays a finger-optimized menu for the driver (there is a search, contacts, map view, navigation, and voice search). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c41/ea7/8f5/c41ea78f56eec62f13c6be617e085162.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a Facebook client - after entering the login and password, all contacts are in the address book (with avatars).  Again surprised (despite the fact that many in the address book I do not need)).  Tape messages (statuses and twitter), work with the profile, photos - the main functionality is present and works like a clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/124/e51/012/124e510128c9bfd0e40be12c9e8338cd.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32f/79c/445/32f79c445d2f9c5820d1f6ec15791a65.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61d/0fb/6c1/61d0fb6c1fa9c832088bb97320b1d058.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d8/bcd/956/8d8bcd956bbe861c6386ea2c344f02bc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The functions of voice search and dialing are also there, but for now they are adapted only ... well, you understand) Instead of ‚ÄúBumburum‚Äù, at best, the ‚ÄúBoom boom‚Äù was searched, and instead of ‚ÄúDinova Ij‚Äù - ‚Äúgiveaway huge‚Äù.  Do not be my speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f3/4dd/5e1/5f34dd5e19d623920b7869771e3b932f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d2e/e24/839/d2ee24839a7966338cb4c3bb4c33c655.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Appendix Goggles - despite its dampness, impressed.  According to the engineers, the program is designed to give the built-in camera serious functionality, such as: recognizing information from business cards (with entering data into the address book), determining the name of the object that is in front of the camera (based on geographic coordinates) and something even still.  The idea is excellent, but as long as the program works at 5 percent of its capabilities, which is a pity. <br><br>  The rest of the search function is where only you can imagine it) On the desktop, too, it was not done ... by the way, the search even has an unwanted content filter. <br>  When I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/84499/">wrote</a> about the Highscreen Zeus communicator, there was also a need to take screenshots from the phone screen.  On WM, everything is simple - click-and-click and ready, and on android, as you know, you need root or sdk for these purposes.  And if I had to tinker with Zeus (I couldn‚Äôt manage to set up sdk for him at all, I decided to install my own firewood for him, which I didn‚Äôt even know about at first), then in the case of non-cousin everything is much simpler.  You can also via sdk, or you can download a small program from w3bsit3-dns.com and turn on the phone with the trackball clamped.  By the way, after the "unlock" when loading on the screen all the time will be drawn open the lock, symbolizing the loss of warranty. <br><br>  For taking screenshots I used the program <b><a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D147026">drocap2</a></b> , which, for obvious reasons, is not on the official market.  Blowing by the wind blew out on the alternative <b>Androlib</b> , where the software is perhaps smaller ... but something else surprised (I would be ashamed further) - after going to the application page, I looked for a button for about 10 minutes to download!  Try unknowingly to do it yourself - <a href="http://www.androlib.com/android.application.com-gmail-nagamatu-drocap2-znCz.aspx">click</a> .  Okay, hint - you need to click on the green android in front of the name of the program) You see how everything, it turns out, is obvious.  The official market is really very convenient - in addition to a targeted search, it is easy to stumble upon just a good program or a toy - almost everywhere there are Russian comments, ratings, screenshots.  Very nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17e/cee/534/17ecee534bba5fa91a1f7ae3c48d2f43.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a2/10c/84b/9a210c84bf5246dd5b12a60852877d59.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A little later, I put the file manager <b>ASTRO FileManager</b> , which later rescued me a couple of times (initially there is no file manager).  In general, the software is just a sea, there is for every taste (really high-quality IM clients and navigation remain problematic places) and color - it would be time to try it all, study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef3/d88/1cc/ef3d881cc05f488715e5607dfcf9d69c.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65c/fcd/bee/65cfcdbee764327590733831b1756613.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A standard application is used as a player - I think you should not pay attention either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec6/a36/350/ec6a363505f772005147a494aa5fc92d.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53b/16c/263/53b16c2637f424fcacc247b471a66b81.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I note only that the speaker is very quiet - even at home.  On the street it is better to combine it with a vibrating alert - in order not to miss the call. <br><br>  Suddenly I liked the camera - I thought that it would be just for show.  First, unlike the iPhone, there is a flash, but comparing with HD2 (where there are two flashes, count as many), there are almost no flashes, even if you shoot very close.  For example, in total darkness: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6bc/447/17a/6bc44717a3c11e1fc9a55b3ad6dede87.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a1/161/c38/2a1161c389642a1460c251b1de9f438f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecf/696/04d/ecf69604d377b1513ab9e9a3442c0982.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78f/ca7/69a/78fca769a7d04385ec7060df89263adb.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Secondly, the camera is quite tenacious in terms of autofocus (it also leads to the place where you tap on the screen) - everything is fast and accurate. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6b/bf9/442/a6bbf94421136e441446f4605403f641.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1a/820/254/e1a820254d65fd19f072e1190362da2c.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff0/200/db6/ff0200db6a21cb2ecab6a3db7eccfc06.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eef/2c0/71b/eef2c071b0786dd929c19d640946aa41.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/983/783/ca3/983783ca39091b8d80910ba52d9d4643.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/547/457/50c/54745750ca17de790552f8aae8fbe9d8.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/214/bd1/9cb/214bd19cbdf25d909ec9e5507badac9a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ac/fac/8b7/4acfac8b794858908134826340d2515b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd4/50e/d8a/bd450ed8ad93b3305fdf5ae26c65c2d0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b90/083/6dd/b900836dd3a928ff8bd866b00382bdb7.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3e/de9/026/d3ede9026fb6f0165f2ef2456433832a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78c/eec/a72/78ceeca72cbe018d0b29e8c8e7b2c036.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  It is a pity that there is no hardware button for the camera, and the menu (where the flash is selected, etc.) is not very conveniently called up.  Well, the sound of the camera shutter is unpleasant.  But initially there is a multitouch - everything is like in adults. <br><br>  Another paragraph I want to give the buttons below the screen.  As I said, they are not entirely hardware, but they are not virtual, i.e.  This is not part of the screen.  There is no tactile sensation of their pressing, as such, but there is a slight vibration ‚Äî this is very convenient.  After WM-systems, there is some discomfort - we are constantly looking for a settings button in applications, which is sometimes hidden behind this very ‚Äúnon-hardware‚Äù button.  But you get used quickly enough, and this is important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a70/af3/150/a70af3150e53c924c1e1a269d2ef1576.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in the end - a huge number of various settings, shoved on the shelves in the menu.  Enumerate all do not see the point. <br><br>  After connecting to a computer, on the phone in the notification area, you need to click the "Mount" button - after a couple of seconds, a new disk will appear in the system, with which you can work as with a regular USB flash drive.  WinXP, Win7 - there were no problems.  In standby mode, the phone quietly lies 2-3 days, but in a more or less familiar to all rhythm of use - no longer than a day. <br><br>  Well, on the final note.  For clarity, here is a <a href="http://bit.ly/bfy9LQ">comparison of the</a> characteristics of HTC HD2, Google Nexus One and iPhone 3GS (perhaps there are some inaccuracies in the table).  Well, taking this opportunity - this is my review of HD2: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80508/">one</a> + <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80913/">two</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/80508/">times</a> .  Well, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtuVyExV8SYo">another</a> detailed comparison. <br><br>  Reading w3bsit3-dns.com, I understand that I am not aware of even 1% of all events) Therefore, to some extent, I regret that I am joining this android party as one of the last.  Actually, I just started to merge into Google services - for a long time its excessive obsession only frightened me.  So, perhaps, I considered some core and non-core capabilities not to the extent that it would be worth it - bow for understanding;) <br><br>  And, taking this opportunity, I express gratitude to Artolt and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/geburah/" class="user_link">Geburah habrap users</a> for their help in knowing the android elements. <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  * - trifle |  *** - never a trifle <br><br>  <u>Virtues</u> <br>  * All is well with the package bundle; <br>  ** Excellent image quality from the integrated camera;  there is a flash; <br>  *** Pleasant and practical case materials, flawless assembly, conveniently in the hand; <br>  *** Large AMOLED screen, bright and saturated;  high resolution and multitouch; <br>  *** High performance, lots of memory; <br>  *** Google services are really good and convenient. <br><br>  I think the same OS with the three stars could be noted and the current amount of software for it.  Hopefully, it will be even better. <br><br>  <u>disadvantages</u> <br>  * Sorry, but again microUSB; <br>  ** Quite quiet speaker; <br>  ** The screen is blind in the bright sun; <br>  *** The time of work in the operating mode will hardly be enough for a day; <br>  *** No hardware "green" and "red" buttons; <br>  *** Price. <br><br>  <u>The better communicator HTC HD2</u> <br>  ** Android vs WM :) <br>  * More familiar sizes; <br>  * More tenacious camera and capacious battery; <br>  *** AMOLED screen with 16M colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b0/ffe/7f9/3b0ffe7f97f44c688ef7bc0bb7769d1e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Part of the readers, seeing in the minuses the word ‚Äúprice‚Äù, will grin evilly, others will sigh hopefully.  The difference in position is that for the first (over the hill) the price of a device starts from $ 500, which is comparable to the price of a Hero.  In our cold lands, thanks to all the same pumps and pumps, the price at the time of release reached 40,000 rubles per device! <br>  Now the hype has fallen a bit - you can become a happy owner of the device by paying a little more than for the HTC HD2.  On the top crust there are options from 25 thousand for an apparatus of an unknown breed, on the Internet a bit more expensive.  I advise the <a href="http://googphone.ru/">Googphone</a> site - they are fine with a guarantee and have their own service, checked personally. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Google has long since threatened to make a ‚ÄúGoogle Phone‚Äù - you will agree, better late than never.  And even in this kitchen they are still interns, but under the watchful eye of the chefs from HTC, they managed to cook ogogo.  They did not hurry and did not laugh people - even, perhaps, they showed everyone "as it should have been."  And this, damn it, deserves all respect! <br>  The first pancake was definitely a success.  A modern platform, the performance of which is really enough for a long time;  a comprehensive platform is also a significant plus.  A huge number of competitors - especially valuable.  Wherever you look - almost all the thick predicts these initiatives bright future) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36f/cf8/7cb/36fcf87cb61d806fefde197bb401b8c5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you really wanted a thoroughbred guglofon, perhaps now it makes sense to wait until the robbery of cows settles and the price of the phone becomes really affordable.  But if you talk like that every time, looking ahead at the release dates of more modern devices, you can never wait for anything.  The device is never raw - you can already use it.  Moreover, to any person (in need of the potential of the device).  Well, for those who tied up in social networks and services of the giant - it's just a godsend. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ae/c96/27e/2aec9627e640173b391032d28d7f8ee2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I really liked the device - I really like this;) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84974/</a></p>
