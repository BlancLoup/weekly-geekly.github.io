He carries somehow yellowness per kilometer, and it is clear that the author has absolutely no idea what he is writing about.  The main thing is that there is ‚ÄúAdobe Flash‚Äù and a negative subtext, on the combination of which, like in Pavlov‚Äôs dogs, a very active part of the Habrasoobshchestvo begins to salivate. <br><br>  And I‚Äôm sure that most of the commentator‚Äôs comrades don‚Äôt know that <br><ol><li>  This is not a bug. </li><li>  This is not a flash vulnerability. </li><li>  This is an extremely bearded vulnerability in fact </li></ol><br>  But no, all the same ... AAAA NEW BAG FLASH ISN'T BE CORRECTED AS SO PANIKAAAA !!! 11 <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am looking at people like you, gentlemen, with affection.  For your knowledge is insignificant, and you are in happy ignorance.  A person in his life at some point understands the meaning of the saying ‚ÄúYou know less - sleep better‚Äù.  This ‚Äúfundamental flash bug‚Äù is not even the tip of the iceberg, you may not know about the underwater part of it, but you want to shout. <br><br>  If you spend half a day and surf the Internet / special literature, you will understand that danger is in fact at every step, most simply do not know about it, taking the hardware and software behind a stone wall without holes and cracks.  This vulnerability is only part of a huge family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a> vulnerabilities, which have already closed a million and as many as there are left, just no one particularly spreads about it.  XSS is prone to almost everything that runs on the client.  First of all - JavaScript, through which other client technologies penetrate through the holes: flash, java, savelott.

      Do you know about the 101m way to trick checking uploaded files on the server?  For example, that you can combine GIF + JAR (aka zip), PDF + JAR and this file will be a valid pdf and a valid jar at the same time?  Did you know that in your browsers drafts still walk through huge security holes?  Not to mention the heap of sites that are made by newbies and are also leaky from all sides, and you trust them with your personal information and credit card numbers.  Do you know that there are plenty of ways to deceive even Google and even get your passwords from the corporation of <s>evil</s> good?  Did you know that saved passwords in firefox are simply pulled out? <br><br>  Did you know that this is still not even the beginning of that huge list of vulnerabilities that we live with?  Why are you then still alive?  Yes, because you do not need anyone.  Not needed yet. <br><br>  Why all?  I think it is possible to discover the root of all problems somewhere at the origin of the network as such, because the main protocols that appeared to be afraid to tell lies about which bearded year are completely unprotected.  What for?  But who would say what online banking would do, they would have laughed there right away.  And then, as needed, they began to sculpt the patches and invent all sorts of policies. <br><br>  PS As for the flash part of the vulnerability, I was doing the same theft of cookies in the bearded 2000 a year on the forum where you could download a flash.  There is nothing new here. <br><br>  <b>PPS Asked to explain how the vulnerability works.</b>  In short, XSS vulnerabilities are based on the execution of someone else's malicious client code in the protected zone of the attacked domain.  The security system considers that once something is executed from the example.com domain, then it is native to it and can easily have access to all the infe from this domain.  It remains only to slip in some way the malicious code.  Read about XSS on the Internet. <br><br>  What we have in the article and how it relates to flash.  It treats the same as everything else, just for the ears just for the flash.  So, I upload SWF to a site that allows this.  If it doesn‚Äôt allow, then pretending to be something else I‚Äôll fill in the same SWF (I‚Äôm not going to pretend exactly how to pretend, because I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm telling you a lot and need to experiment).  Accordingly, if this SWF goes to the example.com domain in the uploads daddy, then it is considered native to this domain, since  Someone once suggested that if the content is publicly accessible from the example.com domain, then only the admin site could put it there (haha).  We get that my malicious SWF has access through the javascript to the whole environment.  If it also appears somewhere on example.com without allowscriptaccess = never and allownetworking = never, then immediately gg.  But the author of the aforementioned article shows that SWF is on example.com and is kind of native to it, but it is called via the left URL.  That is, Vasya sends you a link of the type go here, you poke and see this SWF, which has access to your cookies on example.com.  Is the idea clear?  We replace example.com for anything your heart desires and panic.  But all you need is to load junk into the domain barahlo.example.com and this will not work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75307/</a></p>
