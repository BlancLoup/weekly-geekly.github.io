Some of these problems can be deadly.  The authors of the new study <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160921095237.htm">claim</a> that the cause of 3.8% of all deaths is a sedentary lifestyle and its consequences.  A person who spends at least 3 hours a day without a break in a sitting position already puts himself at risk of premature death. <br><br>  Reducing the harm of a sedentary lifestyle can exercise.  But few do.  In fact, 31% of the world's population leads a way of life that does not meet the recommendations of specialists, as stated in the results of a study conducted in 2012 and published in The Lancet magazine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even if a person does not sit for a long time, the lack of physical exertion still harms the body.  The reason for 9% of deaths in the world of their total number is insufficient physical exertion.  It is believed that if a person leads a sedentary lifestyle and performs physical exercises, then still the health of such a person is in greater danger than the health of people who do not spend many hours sitting on a chair or chair.

      In particular, David Alter, head of the research team at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, said: ‚ÄúThe average person spends more than half of the day motionless ‚Äî sitting at a TV or computer.  According to the results of our study, even healthy regular exercise alone is not sufficient to reduce the risks. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/sitting-for-too-long-can-kill-you-even-if-you-exercise-study-1.2918678">researchers from Toronto</a> , in sedentary workers increases the likelihood of death from the effects of diseases by 15-20%.  If we analyze the increase in the probability of getting various diseases, then the risk of type 2 diabetes increases by 90%.  At the same 20% increase in the risk of heart disease and cancer.  In order to reduce the negative impact of a sedentary lifestyle, it is not enough to exercise for an hour or two a day.  You need to regularly get up from your seat.  At least once every two hours you need to spend standing, and not just stand, and warm up. <br><br>  To reduce the risk of getting diseases, you also need to eat right, plus sleep, it is the time you need to feel good (you need to sleep <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">at least 5 hours</a> a day). <br><br>  A new study, published in the authoritative scientific publication "American Journal of Preventive Medicine", shows that every year a sedentary lifestyle leads to the death of up to 433 thousand people.  The scientists used data on the deaths of residents of 54 countries of the world.  As it turned out, the greatest number of deaths caused by many hours of sitting in a chair or on a chair were recorded in Lebanon (11.6%), the Netherlands (7.6%) and Denmark (6.9%).  The lowest level of sedentary mortality is found in Mexico (0.6%), Myanmar (1.3%) and Bhutan (1.6%). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is necessary to increase the level of human activity, this will reduce the number of sedentary deaths worldwide,‚Äù said Leandro Resende, a research participant from the University of S√£o Paulo (Brazil).  Of course, many of us would be glad not to spend such amount of time sitting, but this requires work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/777/d35/872/777d3587277daa7d869bdcd0f1266325.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  According to the authors of the study, reducing the number of hours that we spend in a sitting position for two hours will lead to a decrease in "sitting" mortality by 2.3%.  The calculations of scientists are based on statistics; it is not possible to verify this statement in practice. <br><br>  The results of another study, <a href="https://auth.cardiosource.org/EasyConnect/Integration/Post.aspx">published</a> in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, indicate the negative impact of too active lifestyle.  This refers to excessive exercise.  The fact is that they can cause calcification of the coronary artery.  This is one of the causes of atherosclerosis.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/245390/">There is also a risk</a> of diastolic dysfunction and arterial wall thickening. <br><br>  This study is based on a fairly extensive sample of data collected over twelve years.  During this time, the authors of the work observed the state of two groups of people.  Participants in the first group, which included 1098 people, constantly engaged in running.  The participants of the second group, which included 3,950 people, led a sedentary, sedentary lifestyle.  Twelve years after the start of observations, 28 people died in the first group, 128 people died in the second. <br><br>  As it turned out, the death rate of those study participants who ran more than 4 hours a week at a speed higher than 11 km / h with a training schedule of 2.5 hours three times a week was approximately equal to the death rate among participants in the second group. <br><br>  Physical activity and its impact on people's health is a complex topic.  Despite the fact that a large number of studies were conducted on this topic, not all were carried out correctly.  And more research is needed in the future.  According to experts from the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2590%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">University of Iowa</a> , ideally, all research should be conducted under constant control, the only way to make unambiguous conclusions about how physical activity affects human health. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397845/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397845/</a></p>
