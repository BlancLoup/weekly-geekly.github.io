Then go to the systems upgrade: what to do, what to look for.  And in article about cinemas which we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/277036/">published on Geektimes</a> , there were many questions.  On him, too, it would be interesting to walk. <br><br>  Let's start with the new home cinema sound technologies: Dolby Atmos, DTS, Auro-3D.  What is the difference between these technologies?  Which of them, in your opinion, the most interesting? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> It is worth paying attention, first of all, to the most popular technology now Dolby Atmos.  This is definitely a leader.  DTS released its DTS: X format with some delay.  Although we can not say that late - just later than Dolby Atmos. <br><br>  Honestly, for now, according to the data that goes to the press, and according to what DTS publishes, there are no radical differences from Dolby Atmos.  Most likely, they will compete in the field of portable sound - to create a virtual surround sound in headphones or in game consoles. <br><br>  As for cinema and home cinema, Dolby Atmos is now the leader of the race.  Although it all began quite smoothly: there were two technologies Auro-3D and Dolby.  Auro-3D is very different from Dolby Atmos, a completely different principle of creating phonograms. <br><br>  If Dolby Atmos is a virtual sound environment, where the sound engineer himself creates virtual objects, moves them in space, then Auro-3D needs to create a phonogram with a vertical dimension.  There and the location of the columns is different. <br><br>  But Auro-3D did not go to the masses.  She lives at the expense of one huge market - the Indian - the largest film market in the world.  There Auro-3D caught on.  Equipped with many cinema halls, and Bollywood makes films with Auro-3D soundtracks.  In our, Western world, Auro-3D mainly produces music programs.  And this is understandable, because it is easy to record even the vertical dimension in a live concert. <br><br>  If we are talking about immersive sound formats, as they are now called, then naturally this is the future.  And, if we smoothly move on to the topic of upgrading the system, then you already need to take this into account.  Do not buy products that are not ready to play Dolby Amos. <br><br>  Dolby Atmos is the most popular format, [in it comes out] the most films, in the west [TV-] broadcasts are being prepared.  Maybe soon it will all come to us via satellite.  So buy immediately modern equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee1/b09/e16/ee1b09e168064b02bcbbbd4c3ca1d779.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/home_theater_set/onkyo/onkyo_ht-s5805.html">The complete set for creating a home theater Onkyo HT-S5805</a> allows <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/home_theater_set/onkyo/onkyo_ht-s5805.html">you</a> to play sound in Dolby Atmos, in configuration 5.1.2.</i>  <i>The supplied receiver is equipped with a 4K Ultra HD output.</i> <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> If we talk about different areas, then, rather, Auro-3D is about the Indian market and Bollywood, and about music, and DTS is about games ... <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes, but Dolby is also connected with games, there will be competition.  It is not clear what happens in the movies with DTS. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> To provide immersive effect in home cinema, you should pay attention, first of all, to Dolby Atmos. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes, it is easier to do, because on any box of the device that is related to the movie, there is a label Dolby Atmos.  So do not miss. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Will immersive formats continue to evolve somehow?  Are there any assumptions about this in the industry? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Wait for more.  They are not rooted yet to grow.  Now, if we are talking about Dolby, this format is more or less formed, it remains to gain content.  More and more studios and cinema halls are provided with special equipment.  Therefore, we must get a lot of content, then it will be clear where to go next. <br><br>  The multichannel history of the surround sound to which we are accustomed existed for more than a dozen years before something new appeared.  Here, apparently, there will also be some changes of a more fundamental nature.  Because where else to add columns?  In the floor mount? <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Yes, if you go to the Dolby website, it is clear that they have a fairly large list of films that are released in this technology.  Every year their number grows. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> 350 "big" films have already been shot.  Until the end of the year will be released on Blu-Ray 100 releases with Dolby Atmos.  It is the original film with the track in this format.  Now some movies are being rewritten in Dolby Atmos.  You can remaster any movie. <br><br>  Dolby says that if there is an original saved soundtrack, original tracks, and not a mix-version that goes on recording, then they can be converted into Dolby Atmos.  Therefore, we are waiting for good, interesting discoveries. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> This is how a black and white movie becomes color? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Not exactly.  The colorization of black and white cinema is completely artificial.  And here, since the medium itself is directed at Dolby Atmos, no separate elements are recorded. <br><br>  The sound engineer selects some sound and processes it in the program in such a way that it moves in the right direction, so he can take the old mix of the film, if it is saved in a multi-channel recording, take any sound and process it in the same way with a modern processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bed/8c5/2fd/bed8c52fd41d49d4b95fa40a1b5a834a.jpg" width="700"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collins_family/22704524291/in/photolist-dZ8MSX-dZeuB1-AAjC4n-w2CaMZ">Photo by Christian Collins</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">/ CC</a> <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Interesting.  Are there any new video formats in home cinema? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Now the video is developing in two directions.  On the one hand, this is an increase in resolution in pixels.  Now increasingly on products noticeable UHD-logo.  This is Ultra High Definition, that is, 4K. <br><br>  On the other hand, there is also an increase in the dynamic characteristics of the image, the so-called HDR function appears in video devices.  We know from the iPhone, other wearable gadgets, video cameras that such a function exists.  Now she will be on TVs.  If you want to buy a modern TV, see if it is compatible with HDR. <br><br>  It is still not clear how this will look.  So far there are only test films, videos, because in the concern that it promotes, there are different views on how everything should be standardized.  When this is agreed, you can upgrade your device at the software level. <br><br>  Usually all modern TVs that support 4K are HDR compatible.  Here [on your part] there should be no additional investment [in the equipment].  If you bought a modern TV, it is suitable for HDR.  This is a major breakthrough.  Anyone who has seen technology at trade shows, is delighted with the image quality.  It is incomparable with what we used to see on the screens - the dynamic range of the picture is very high. <br><br>  Our eye is a sensitive device.  When we see natural phenomena, we can very clearly determine their color and brightness.  When we watch TV, everything is averaged there.  Now the dynamic range will be expanded, and we can see the brightness of the sun.  Of course, it will not blind as much as the present, but nonetheless.  We can see different halftones, shades.  All this will shine and sparkle. <br><br>  Dynamic range is one of the parameters that affects the perception of the entire picture.  If the resolution affects how closely you can watch TV, then the quality of the picture will not depend on the distance.  If you have a TV of medium diagonal and high resolution, then from a distance of 3-4 meters you do not care, be it 4K, or 2K, or Full HD. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Not so important. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> It is important to be able to get close to him.  This is the advantage of high resolution.  You can watch a larger diagonal from a closer distance, and, thereby, dive more into what is happening on the screen, because peripheral vision is involved here. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> That is, now [when choosing a technique] it is important to pay more attention to abbreviations and logos such as UHD, HDR, Dolby Atmos.  Regarding peripheral vision: A few years ago, backlit televisions were popular - they could often be seen in advertisements.  They said that illumination also affects peripheral vision, greater immersion.  Is this topic popular right now?  Is there an interest in the industry for such things? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> They don‚Äôt say anything more about her.  In my opinion, one manufacturer of all of them did.  This is Philips.  He probably continues to do something.  It has the right to life.  But what I saw looks very artificial. <br><br>  Although you know what it is for?  If you watch TV in a completely darkened room, you need a backlight so that your eyes do not have a sharp transition from dark to bright.  It went from the old big projection TVs in which the projector was inside.  They were very dull.  There were still dull old ray TVs that people watched in blackout. <br><br>  To avoid contrast, it was necessary to highlight the back.  Philips made backlit TVs, and now TVs are so bright, they can be watched in a not quite darkened room, and the backlight remains for beauty. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> On the contrary, it is often said that it is hard for the eyes to perceive a bright screen in a very dark room when it comes to TV. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Previously, there was no other way.  Brightness at the TV was not.  Now their brightness has greatly increased. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> How popular is home theater now with the ability to watch 3D video? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> This topic is an amateur.  All modern TVs support 3D.  There are projectors that can play content in 3D.  Hype, which was before, is no longer there.  But for the amateur 3D will always be in demand.  Many people like to watch in 3D, and especially play 3D games.  This movement in the event, close to real. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Already close to augmented reality.  If a backlit TV is a bit outdated, 3D will always find its enthusiast and fan. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Of course.  In the movie, people go and watch.  Many films come out and be filmed in 3D.  From the big movie, he does not go anywhere.  And if they shoot it with a 3D camera, they will release it on a 3D carrier, on Blu-Ray.  Accordingly, through the TV, which shows 3D, a person will be able to watch it. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> It turns out that over the past 10 years, the technology in home theaters, in general in the theater industry, has changed quite seriously.  And at the same time it is impossible to say that we are on the eve of some kind of new breakthrough, which will abruptly cancel everything that is already there, and everything will be different. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> No, there won't be such a dramatic breakthrough.  Everyone will notice that something has changed, as it always happens. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> You can smoothly upgrade your system and not be afraid that something will happen? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes.  The main thing is, if you are interested in having something modern, it is better to buy modern things at once.  There are people who do not care.  They may buy something obsolete or in the secondary market.  Everyone has different approaches to the formation of their systems, so it‚Äôs hard to give one piece of advice. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> And there are still people who once bought a new cinema, which is now obsolete.  What should such buyers do?  What should they pay attention to?  Is it possible to leave something from the old equipment, but at the same time update the system? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Of course you can.  First of all, you need to leave 5 or 7 surround speakers.  If the processor and the amplifier are separate, you can leave a 5 or 7 channel power amplifier.  You can leave the screen, nothing will happen to him, he will never become obsolete. <br><br>  It will be necessary to change the sound processor, which will be equipped with a Dolby Atmos recorder, and a projector.  Modern projectors are very different from those that were 10-15 years ago.  Still need to purchase the missing column.  To hear the full vertical height effects, you will need to buy special speakers that play on the reflection from the ceiling. <br><br>  They are installed on existing systems, and the sound in them is directed upwards.  The sound is reflected from the ceiling and enters the listener as if from above.  The effect is wonderful, I heard it myself.  It can easily be confused with when the speakers are at the top. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> It turns out that in this case it is not necessary to pull wires over the ceiling? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> You can avoid this.  If there is a possibility, and the level of the system is high enough, you can buy built-in speakers from the manufacturer, whose speakers you already have, and make a discrete Dolby Atmos system. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> As for the image: the modern projector has changed quite seriously compared to what it was.  And when they say that the new projector is expensive, but there is some old one, you need to understand that the difference between them is dramatic. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> The difference is dramatic.  They used to be expensive.  Only now they are several times cheaper, but they show several times better.  Now there are expensive projectors, but they exist to solve certain problems. <br><br>  There are personal cinema halls of 80-90 square meters.  m., they have nothing to do with a small, even medium-sized projector, you need a large, powerful and bright projector that will light up the big screen.  Of course, such a projector can not be cheap, it will cost tens of thousands of dollars. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> I asked about the projector, because there are many people among the readers of the Audiomania blog who are interested in this topic.  Is it possible to use an ordinary office projector in a home theater system?  This is one of the questions asked. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Of course you can.  You can use everything that shows.  But if you want to get a high-quality picture, from the model range of manufacturers you need to choose projectors that have the words ‚Äúfor home theater‚Äù in the title.  They are specially made to show a dynamic moving picture, rather than presentations and graphics. <br><br>  The main purpose of an office projector is to see a graph in a bright room, without obscuring it.  The cinema projector is not so bright, but it shows more natural colors and movements without jerking. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> So, there is a completely fundamental difference between ... <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> A completely fundamental difference, but, of course, an office projector will show you a movie.  You can hang a white sheet instead of the screen, or simply project it onto the door, as you did before. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> This is an extreme case.  Quite often there is a question about all sorts of Chinese projectors worth about 500-600 dollars.  They, most likely, have some kind of designation that they can watch movies.  People are interested in what expensive projectors can differ from Chinese ones. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> I can assume that they are very different.  Probably, in the Chinese projector, besides the inscription that it is suitable for home cinema, there is nothing that is needed. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> That is, the best solution in this case is to come somewhere, where there is a showroom, and see how a special projector behaves? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Exactly.  The fact is that in these projectors there are a lot of expensive parts in production.  Therefore, it cannot cost less than a certain amount.  If you want to save money, you need to look for cheap among large projector brands. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> What are the brands? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> JVC, Sony are leading companies.  There are also universal companies that make office and good cinema projectors.  This is Epson, BenQ, VITEK.  You can also consult with large companies that sell, experts, specialists in sales salons.  $ 500 for the projector is still a pity if it does not show. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9f8/116/601/9f811660167d415c95c5c7fb0cf9653d.JPG"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4.html">Our showroom on m.Elektrozavodskaya</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Not so little money, by the way. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> If you want to save money, it's better to buy in the secondary market, but something that is proven. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> First of all, one should still pay attention to the brand, and secondly - the price, because projectors can be slightly cheaper than brand-new and advanced models as part of a good brand. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Another quite interesting question that caused a lot of controversy and discussion.  A person after viewing a picture from a projector states that in 15-20 minutes his eyes begin to hurt. <br><br>  Moreover, according to people, it all depends on the specific model.  From one model, all is well, from the other - my eyes hurt.  How much is this frequent case in the practice of viewing pictures from projectors? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> I did not come across this.  Maybe the picture is slightly blurred or the image is not focused, people do not pay attention to it, because there is no viewing experience, it seems to them that everything is fine: big, colorful, moving. <br><br>  With 3D it often happens, many people simply do not perceive it, cannot directly watch it and leave the cinema.  It is easy.  But about the usual picture I hear this for the first time. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> If a person has encountered such a problem, he bought and cannot exchange this projector, maybe it is worth checking whether everything is well tuned.  This is not necessarily some kind of physiological incompatibility. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes, it should not be. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Another interesting point, just a cry from the heart.  The person wrote that it is very important to emphasize everywhere that the projector should be turned off correctly.  He had almost two crashes, two serious incidents with projectors.  What is it about? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> The fact that the lamps inside the projector are hot.  If it is pulled out of the socket, the lamp can melt what is inside the projector.  Therefore, it is necessary to press the shutdown button twice, it just does not turn it off. <br><br>  Press the button once, and he writes: ‚ÄúAre you sure you need to turn it off?‚Äù You press it a second time, and then it turns off smoothly.  That is, the ventilation system continues to operate and cool the lamp to the desired temperature.  Then he turns off.  If you pull it, hitting the wire with your foot and turning it off, the case may melt.  I saw it. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Serious thing.  Attention must be paid to this. <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes.  But this is not a warranty case, this is incorrect operation. <br><br>  <b>Alina:</b> Therefore, we must also know how to properly exploit it.  We have already talked a little about screens.  They said that the screens morally, practically, do not become obsolete over time.  You can talk about different types of screens.  Screens with a matte and glossy finish.  What is the difference between these types? <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> There is no glossy finish as such.  There is a reflective coating.  ,    .    .    ,          .          . <br><br>     .   .   .   , ,     ,   - .         , ,  ,     . <br><br> <b>:</b> ,  -  . <br><br> <b>:</b> ,   .    ‚Äì   .    - .     ,   ,     .      ,       . <br><br> <b>:</b>         :   ,    ,    . <br><br> <b>:</b> ,  . <br><br> <b>:</b> E  ,   , ‚Äì     ,        . <br><br> <b>:</b> ,   ,      . ,          ,      ,     . <br><br>      .         .    , ,  ,     -    ,     ,     .    .   ,      . ,   ,  Goo. <br><br> <b>:</b>  ,     ,     ? <br><br> <b>:</b>  . ,   ,  ,    .   ‚Äì      .      :   , .       . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/201/aa4/b18/201aa4b18c8d4b3281a41197d4c69790.jpg" width="500"><br><br> <i><a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/proekcionnye_ekrany/digis/digis_electra.html">   Digis Electra</a></i> <br><br> <b>:</b> , ,     ,   ,   .   :              ,     ,   ,    ,      20-30 ,   .  -  ?     ,    ? <br><br> <b>:</b> ,  ,   ,      .    ,  - ,     .      ,    . <br><br>  ,     .     ,  .  ,   -     .      ,    . <br><br> <b>:</b> ,    ,      . <br><br> <b>:</b>  ,   . <br><br> <b>:</b>    ,    ‚Ä¶ <br><br> <b>:</b> ‚Ä¶      !         ,        ,    .    ‚Äì     . <br><br> <b>:</b>      -  . <br><br>  <b>Kerim:</b> Yes.     ,     , ‚Äì   .     . </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396145/</a></p>
