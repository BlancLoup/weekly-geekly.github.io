Devices that collected millions of dollars at one time on Kickstarter, are about to appear on the virtual shelves of online stores.  Finally, the broad masses will receive the acclaimed Oculus Rift for the whole world, Microsoft is going to release its Hololens glasses to the world in the near future, while LG and Blu are advertising their flexible screens.  However, first things first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db4/477/7a7/db44777a74e24f02b0592f2937d91e78.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Oculus rift</b> <br>  First on the list is the company Oculus VR, now adopted under its wing by the social network Facebook.  The developers are going to make a real breakthrough and release the first commercially successful virtual reality helmet Oculus Rift.  In the world there are already more than 100 thousand helmets for game developers, but the release of the device for mass use is scheduled for early 2016.  Announced price: $ 200-400.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4be/c1e/d7b/4bec1ed7b97d4f4fafcb69e0c256e1d2.jpg"><br><br>  The helmet is connected to the computer via USB and HDMI interfaces, has a viewing angle of about 100 degrees and Full HD resolution.  More detailed technical data can be found on <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/">their website</a> .  Before acquiring Oculus Rift, it is recommended to upgrade computer hardware, because the toy consumes a lot of resources. <br>  Intended gadget primarily for the entertainment industry.  Many modern engines began to hastily prepare for the release of a new toy.  Already, besides game developers, Hollywood, simulator manufacturers, social networks, and even NASA are interested in helmet.  It is possible that with the release of the Oculus Rift, most of the content will smoothly move to 3D. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft hololens</b> <br>  Microsoft is working hard on its Hololens augmented reality glasses.  Unlike Oculus Rift, these glasses do not just show an artificial image, but impose it on the real world.  Now there is a similar product - Google Glass, but Gates is determined to beat the competitor on all counts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27e/311/6fd/27e3116fdbf444159cd38faa49e09576.jpg"><br><br>  The exact list of Hololens features is still unknown, but the opportunities shown at the 2015 exhibition shocked the public.  The device allows you to design a video image on any surface, launch applications directly in the air and control it using holographic buttons.  Designers and planners get the most powerful tool - the ability to create a three-dimensional plan right on their desk and edit it by hand or voice by moving virtual elements. <br>  The final specifications, release date and estimated cost of the company are not consecrated, but there is a rumor that the release of points is going to coincide with the release of Windows 10. For more information about the product, please visit <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">Microsoft</a> . <br><br>  <b>Robotbase</b> <br>  By the end of 2015, Robotbase plans to launch a personal robot for various daily tasks.  The assistant will recognize the speech and mimic of the interlocutor, keep the conversation going and skillfully imitate emotions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/836/b1c/319/836b1c3194ce4ffca3fc6d83a5317159.jpg"><br><br>  The robot does not know how to do anything extraordinary, but you cannot call it useless.  Robotbase can wake you up in the morning, take a picture (while recommending a successful posture), order a pizza or tell a child a fairy tale.  Add to this the ability to remotely monitor, control the "smart home" - and get a very useful device in the household.  On <a href="https://www.robotbase.com/robot">the manufacturer's website,</a> you can watch a video presentation and read about the other functions of the robot. <br><br>  Cicret <br>  The next device is an extremely unusual smartphone.  The whole filling is compactly packaged in a wrist bracelet, and the image is projected on the forearm.  The control is no different from the classic models, except that the screen is located right on your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db4/477/7a7/db44777a74e24f02b0592f2937d91e78.jpg"><br><br>  Bracelet promise to make waterproof, that is, in the toys you can play right in the bathroom or pool.  Cicret will not have any unusual features for smartphones: calls, games, navigator, watching videos, messaging.  Of course, there will be no photo and video.  More information about the product can be found <a href="http://cicret.com/wordpress/">on the website</a> .  The release date of the device is not yet known, but it will cost about $ 470. <br><br>  <b>Blu</b> <br>  Another interesting smartphone is Blu, originally from Australia.  This device is interesting primarily for its flexibility - Blu can be bent.  You can even turn it into a ring and put it on your hand like a bracelet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/c23/65d/bdec2365de3b4a92a283c7e4d29a01e0.jpg"><br><br>  The smartphone has good technical data: an eight-core processor, 2 gigabytes of RAM, 128 GB of memory, a 5.3-inch Full HD display and a camera with a resolution of 13 megapixels.  It all feeds from a lithium-ion battery at 2400 mAh. <br>  In addition to flexibility, the gadget is interesting for its impact resistance and water resistance - it can really be worn around the clock as a fashionable bracelet.  If the manufacturer manages to collect $ 470,000 on Kickstarter - the product will see the world in the next couple of years.  There is no information on the official website of the company, but a detailed overview is presented <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/blu-the-wearable-smartphone">on the page</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pebble time</b> <br>  Pebble Time is a new generation of smart watches, this time with a color E-Ink display.  The device is equipped with a waterproof case, a microphone for voice commands, Bluetooth for connecting with a smartphone, an accelerometer and a compass.  Hours without recharging - a week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/f26/8d3/a61f268d35e0487b8176bf931b2aa2a2.jpg"><br><br>  The watch case is made of plastic with a metal frame, on the sides there are 4 buttons to control.  The belt at Pebble Time is removable, detachable with just a couple of movements.  The display does not fade in the sun and has a soft backlight for use at night. <br><br>  In fact, the watch is disclosed to users of Android devices  After synchronization via Bluetooth, you can display calls, messages, notes and alarm clocks on your watch.  And with the help of buttons and voice commands you can manage all this functionality.  Read all the details <a href="https://getpebble.com/pebble_time">on the official website</a> . <br><br>  <b>Highscreen verge</b> <br>  How did a standard smartphone get here, you ask?  It's very simple: after buying all the listed gadgets, you simply will not have money for an iPhone :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/448/860/39e/44886039e2f2495f92a56bcd76000f30.jpg"><br><br>  Smartphone Verge - state employee (only 7000 rubles) with good performance and original design.  All modern devices are becoming similar to each other like two drops of water - the screen and the matte or glossy back panel.  Here we decided to add originality and made the plastic relief, as if it was laid out of mosaic or tile.  By the way, there is a little white one, for girls. You can learn more about the new product <a href="http://highscreen.ru/news/verge_incoming/">on our website</a> . <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  In the review, far from all the new items awaiting release are considered, a lot is left overs.  It may well be that some of these projects will not collect the required amount on Kickstarter and will not live to see the release.  However, we can already say with certainty that the future is already near, it is steadily advancing and carries with it many incredible and impressive devices. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365741/</a></p>
