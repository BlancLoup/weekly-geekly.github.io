  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online IDE - a tribute to cloud fashion or the inevitability of the development environment?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's talk about cloud mania.  It seems that soon, rising from bed in the morning and heading to where you usually go in the morning, you will find that all the amenities are now in the cloud.  Offline things are not in fashion now.  But seriously, the last few years have become quite productive for the cloud industry, Amazon and others like them.  And if the majority of sane users have safely forgotten about Word documents in emails, having switched to Google Docs for a long time and forever, then the situation with development in the cloud does not look that unequivocal. <br><br>  No, of course, it is clear and obvious to everyone that sooner or later cloud IDE will surround us and take us prisoner.  But what is interesting is that not all programmers and other representatives of the coding industry speak positively of the IDE in the browser.  And it's not about the chips, the possibilities and convenience of work, but, rather, in certain internal fears and unwillingness to abandon the offline development environment.  Actually, what am I doing? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Not so long ago, while chatting on abstract topics with a brother-programmer, quite unexpectedly, I heard the following phrase: ‚ÄúIDE in the browser so far does not fit into my worldview‚Äù.  And you know, if I heard such a statement from the eternal Junior-Padawan, you would hardly be surprised.  But, I heard it from a programmer with 15 years of experience developing under various platforms and in various languages, including many of the forgotten Assembler.  And the closest relative seems to be no different, too, because in IT the closeness to all new death is similar.  Interested in the reasons for almost aggression towards the online IDE, asked him a couple of questions, which he later discussed with a couple of experienced programmers.  Below is a compilation of very curious answers.

      <b>You do not hide your skepticism towards cloud development environments.</b>  <b>What is the reason?</b> <br><br>  A programmer is a lazy creature, and if something works well, then why improve it and ‚Äúfix‚Äù it?  There is a time-tested mechanism.  What reasons should make me switch to a cloud IDE, spend time on mastering a new environment and risk putting projects on time? <br><br>  <b>That is, the position of the category "I do not know, good or bad, but I still do not want to try"?</b> <br><br>  In a sense, yes!  You know, programmers rarely want to look stupid, and that is how many of them look when they first get into a new online IDE. <br><br>  <b>Yes, it seems that you are really skeptical!</b> <br><br>  Hmm, well, judge for yourself.  Who needs this Internet addiction?  Yes, of course, now there is coverage almost everywhere.  But what if I want to ‚Äúguide‚Äù on the way?  Mobile Internet does not offer!  Well, even if there is a stable Internet, then the IDE servers are often located in the USA, and we are in Europe ... and from latency, well, you cannot go anywhere.  Plus, the online IDE is often written in Java, and it loads my beech a lot.  The system becomes less responsive.  Do you understand what I mean? <br><br>  <b>More than!</b>  <b>It turns out that there are no conditions under which you would think about using "IDE in the browser."</b>  <b>The same <a href="https://c9.io/">Cloud9</a> and <a href="https://www.cloud-ide.com/">Exo IDE</a> offer quite a good set of tools and features.</b>  <b>Maybe you risk?</b> <br><br>  Risks nothing to do with.  I want everything to work perfectly, and compromises do not suit me.  Show me an online IDE in which I can easily switch from PHP, CSS and Java Script to Android and iOS development, and I will be at the forefront of IDE fans in the cloud.  In the meantime, these environments remind me very much of Google Docs, where you have to wait a couple of seconds after almost every operation. <br><br>  <b>I am tired of criticism!</b>  <b>Let's look for positives.</b>  <b>Really, you do not see those?</b> <br><br>  Well, you do not think that I am an ‚Äúold bastard‚Äù who does not want to discover anything new for himself.  There are advantages.  For example, I use 4 machines in my work.  Office, home, laptops on the road.  Synchronization and other "charms" are present.  And when the machine ‚Äúflies‚Äù on Ubuntu, the day, to put it mildly, goes downhill.  Therefore, of course, the ability to work with projects from any machine and on any ‚Äúaxis‚Äù is a tempting thing.  How would you be more correct to say ... I am not that against online IDE, but rather I do not see behind them the real prospects for tomorrow.  That is, sooner or later, I think, all our programmer‚Äôs brethren will be code-in-the-cloud. <br><br>  <b>It is quite another matter!</b>  <b>So there are chances?</b> <br><br>  And then!  Cloud IDE - great options for developing web applications.  But, alas, so far web applications cannot satisfy all the demand in the market.  We continue to write applications for specific platforms, and best of all - devices.  But, as I said, sooner or later, the development of web applications that are compatible with all platforms will become a reality.  Already everything goes to this.  So this will be the golden times of online IDE. <br><br>  ************** <br><br>  This conversation reminded me of trying to ride a car with an automatic gearbox.  "It is not," said the test at once.  "Why?  Worry about saving gas or don't like it when there is no control over the engine? ‚ÄùI asked.  ‚ÄúNah!  I used to pull the handle. <br><br>  Does online IDE have a future?  My opinion is definitely there!  Why is online IDE convenient?  Perhaps these two videos will partially answer a rather difficult question.  Happy New Year, IT community!  Allow innovations to disturb the rest of your life, habrads! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4SscNHNr5g&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhTJmqiVfCmnddeZEpNPM6CbxaSnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCNa5t6rHuc&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-h-0k7FpkmF47NBC_CiVP7IVcng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164497/</a></p>
