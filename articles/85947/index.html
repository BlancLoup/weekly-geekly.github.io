It was necessary to buy a digital camera, and our retailers did not want to overpay a lot, so the model we were looking for was based on the ‚Äúlow price‚Äù principle in online stores.  What was surprising when it did not appear in 10 of 12-13 stores, although on the website it was marked everywhere as ‚Äúin existence‚Äù.  Having spent on this task indecently a lot of time, the idea came to create such a resource.  The main idea: it is an opportunity to throw off routine tasks to the side, paying a small amount of money for their implementation and save your time. <br><a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      I place the task, where I ask to tell me which stores have this model of camera and at what price.  For good information, I am ready to pay 500 - 1000 rubles, but after I buy it.  Those wishing to earn an extra 1000 rubles.  2 hours time - send me this information!  Setting such a task immediately creates the need for a performer.  These can be students or people with an unstable financial situation who urgently need money.  All you need to do is to perform a simple order, and a small amount of money will fill your personal fortune. <br><br>  The project was launched immediately after the new year, and now it is being promoted.  Difficulties encountered immediately.  The main one is the absence of such a market.  This is not freelance, but more specific tasks.  Most people are not ready to delegate such nonsense to someone.  They live according to the principle: ‚ÄúLet me lose time, but I will do everything myself!‚Äù And they continue to lose! <br>  Another problem was the performers.  People are not eager to perform such tasks, apparently, the money is not needed at all.  Now the site lives thanks to the fact that the creators solve their own routine tasks.  It‚Äôs not possible to attract new customers, and it‚Äôs almost the same amount of time to search for an artist as to complete this task on their own. <br><br>  It has already become clear that there is a long, tedious and difficult work to create this market.  Free-lans.ru also did not immediately become famous and successful.  We appeal to you, because I would like to receive a comment about the idea and implementation.  Very interesting whether you are ready to act as a customer: yes / no / why?  And are you interested in a similar resource, as performers? <br><br>  P. S. Publish this article at the request of a friend, because it is not on Habr√©. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85947/</a></p>
