  <section class="page js-page"><h1>File sharing service Nekaka</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, habrdruzya! <br>  Since <a href="http://nekaka.com/">Nekaka</a> first appeared on the pages of this resource as a free xtrafile script, almost a year has passed, and we want to show you the current results. <br>  The main goal of the project is to make the most convenient file service in the world, and the goal of this post is to get feedback from habrcomyun, whether we are on the right path. <br>  The file service should include the functionality of backup, convenient sharing of files between devices and people (as in Dropbox), one click no registration sharing (as in usendit, rapidshare etc.), should not have restrictions on bulk downloads (unlike Dropbox) and do not have ads (unlike rapidshare &amp; Co). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42c/a88/e97/42ca88e979e2b2443b476b7e8ce4fb7d.jpg"><br>  We have replaced the complete lack of design with minimalism outside and functionality inside.  In all modern browsers, you can drop a large number of files onto the page at once.  Test 10 files on 3Gb - poured without problems.  I can not imagine that someone needed to fill more volume through the browser.  But I assure you that if you reach the limit, our team will be happy to upgrade the service in this direction. <br>  The My Files page is constantly being updated, and the main usability efforts are focused on it.  A completely new version of this page is being prepared right now.  For now you can see how easy it is to rename, encrypt, or move any file to another folder via drag &amp; drop. <br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  The main emphasis in the functionality of the resource is placed on various ways of downloading files to the system.  Consider them in more detail. <br><br><h5>  E-mail </h5><br>  In My Files&gt; upload&gt; e-mail you will see the username@u.nekaka.com attached to your e-mail account (you can rename it to any free one). <br>  All attachments that came to this box will be folded to the root;  in the subject line you can specify the name of the folder into which you want the file to be stored.  If the folder is synchronized with your computer, then in fact attachments will be sent immediately to your local disk.  Letters without attachments are dropped by the server. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/333/e2c/9a7/333e2c9a7a7fc2ba85ed749854584311.gif">

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  Torrent </h5><br>  The torrent is downloaded by the server on a gigabit channel and is added to your account (or, again, to the local synchronized folder). <br>  If this torrent has already been downloaded to Nekaku, the file will immediately appear in My Files and will be available for download.  It looks funny torrent a few gigabytes, downloaded in a couple of seconds. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7c/a65/980/c7ca65980f150f85031cfa8f3b38b968.gif"><br><br><h5>  HTTP (s) / FTP download link </h5><br>  The service can be fed direct links to files, and they will also be available on all synchronized devices upon completion of the download. <br><br><h5>  FTP / WebDAV / Windows shared folder </h5><br>  You can also upload and download your files (for premium accounts) using any FTP or WebDAV client or connect the storage as a shared Windows folder. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  SuperMicro 846E1-R1200B 2XE5620 / 32GB / 24x2TB was added to the DellR210x3430 / 8GB / 2x2TB, the channel was expanded to 2 Gbit / s and there is an agreement to expand to the ten, when the time comes.  Site <a href="http://serverclub.com/">ServerClub.com</a> did not change. <br><br><h4>  Perspectives </h4><br>  In the near future we will release a client for Windows.  And if among the readers of these lines there are smart MacOS developers, we will be happy to talk to panic@nekaka.com on creating a client for this system.  We are not sure yet whether it makes sense to make a client under Linux - we will be glad to hear opinions in the comments.  Clients under Android and iOS are also in the plans, but with a slightly lower priority. <br>  Be sure to make the public API, which is now used by us for interserver interaction. <br>  Connecting a CDN is also one of our next steps.  Now all the infrastructure is in Amsterdam.  Be sure to add a point of presence in the United States and the Russian Federation. <br>  The legal future of the torrent functionality is not yet clear.  If we decide to develop, we will definitely make a selective download of files from large archives. <br><br><h6>  Bonus Game </h6><br>  If you write a comment in the form ‚Äúupgrade please login‚Äù, then the login account will receive an upgrade in the form of 100GB premium for three months.  The proposal is not limited in time, and I think that we will even write a script for this case that will check for new comments.  One habrazhitel can upgrade one account once. <br>  Attention: your login is an inscription at the top right, next to the Logout link. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  <a href="http://nekaka.com/">Nekaka.com</a> team </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149990/</a></p>
