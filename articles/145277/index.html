It is advisable to use the official names ( <i>you can see in the wiki, if you do not remember</i> ). <br><br>  I recommend the results of the survey to all startups who have not yet decided on the first program, I recommend the new Steam (y) for Linux, as well as to everyone who is engaged in porting for everyone and everything.) <br><br>  Links to test and results:

Neverhood <br>  2. Full Throttle <br>  3. Machinarium <br><br>  Cyberia and Myst are a bit behind. <br>  The rest is far behind.  I think, whether to rename the Top-10 to the Top-5.  )) <br><br>  But the trends on the face.  As a startup, you can safely take Nevervhudo, do a repartition on Android / iOS or 3D, add the 4th alternative ending, negotiate a commission with DreamWorks Interactive and be confident in good sales.  And further on the list.  =) <br><br>  <b>Thinking out loud.</b> <br>  Looking at the top three: Neverhood, Full Throttle, Machinarium, I understand that it was all very, very long ago .., and now the 21st century and the Clouds.  Dates benefit of games 96, 95 and 09, respectively, the first two quests came out almost at the same time with a difference of just over a year.  The machinarium came out much later, but its appearance in the top three seems quite natural - this is perhaps the only modern quest, so reminiscent of the style and execution of the game of those distant nineties, the time of the appearance of the first Pney and the transition from DOS to Win95 and on. <br>  And it seems that for writing a masterpiece game, the multicore percent and gigabytes of RAM with 3 coolers on vidyuhi were completely unnecessary.  And the analogy is seen immediately - with the immortal works of artists who wrote their work in the century, when the paint was mixed on the egg yolk, and there were no filters in Photoshop or printers with a drop of 2 picoliter.  And there were no synthesizers with Cooledit (om) and SoundForge either. <br>  There was only a desire to create, 25 hours a day, thinking about the sn, marketing campaigns and the target audience, now divided into PC, console and mobile ... <br>  Where are you, visionaries and enthusiasts who made Myst and Space Quest? <br>  Where are all those who truly worked on what brought spiritual food, and optional working on bread and sometimes toys for his wife and children? <br>  How to revive this culture of dedication, without which the appearance of truly great works is impossible? .. Can money be canceled? .. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145277/</a></p>
