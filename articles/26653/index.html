  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows with Gnome interface (SharpE manual)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past, I described my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/habraware/43601.html">topic</a> an alternative shell for Windows - <a href="http://www.sharpe-shell.org/">SharpE</a> .  Someone liked this environment, maybe some even switched to it.  Some are interested in setting up SharpE.  This topic is addressed to them.  Here I will describe the subtleties of setting SharpE.  Just do not judge strictly, because I myself understood everything and there is no manual in the network.  My view is not professional, so I ask for additions and corrections in the comments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  1. Installation </h2><br>  The first step is to download SharpE from the official site.  This <a href="http://trac.sharpe-shell.org/wiki/TDSetup">link</a> is the download page.  If there is nothing to unpack 7z archive I advise <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> .  You can unpack it in any place.  Next you should run SetShell.exe from the program folder and select SharpE there.  After the reboot, everything should work. <br><br><h2>  2. First look </h2>

To be honest, I liked the interface, but not really.  ‚ÄúAnd everything is wrong, and everything is not that ...‚Äú ¬© V. Tsoi.  Gnome is not yet similar.  I will describe the main elements of the interface.  In pink, I circled a small, almost imperceptible button.  These are panel options.  Until we do not need them, they are needed after the basic configuration.  I will return to them later.  This shell does not work as an explorer from one file.  Here is the modular structure.  There is SharpCore, which launches separate processes for panels and desktop. <br><br><h2>  3. Customize panels </h2><br>  First, run SharpCenter, the link to which lies on the desktop.  There are sections: Desktop, Menus, Services, Themes, Toolbars.  Let's start from the end, i.e. from the toolbars.  Obviously, we only need two panels.  Delete the last one.  A bit of explanation to the SharpCenter.  Above there are buttons Add and Edit.  They are for adding a panel and changing the name and location of the panel.  After removing the third panel, you need to stretch the remaining panels to full screen.  To do this, select the panel and click Edit (the one on top).  We name the top bar TopBar and the bottom BottomBar, and in Horizontal Align choose FullScreen.  To set up the panel content, click Edit on the same line as the panel.  At first I decided to customize the bottom panel.  It lacks only desktop switches.  Click Add, select VWM and Position: Right.  If you click Edit on the module, you can configure it.  Go back and set up the top panel.  Delete the first three menus and VWM.  Re-create three menus, add Clock, KeyboardLayout and SystemTray.  I advise you to uncheck the Display Icon in the settings of KeyboardLayout, and in the settings of the clock with Two Line Display, and generally configure everything for yourself.  Here is everything. <br><br><h2>  4. Setting up services </h2><br>  Go back to the beginning and select Services.  Set up keyboard layout switching.  To do this, in the settings of the Hotkeys service we will add a new element with <br>  Name: SwitchLayout <br>  Hotkey: Alt + Shift + <br>  Command must be selected using Browse or simply enter! KLCycle <br>  Also, I don‚Äôt like their cursors, so I suggest stopping and deactivating the Cursors process from the service.  Windows cursors will return.  In the VWM settings you can set the number of virtual desktops.  In the Exec settings, you can assign aliases for the command line.  And in Shell you can set the desktop area.  So everything seems to go further. <br><br><h2>  5. Menu setting </h2><br>  On the Menus tab, select Menus Options.  There you have to remove the tick from the Warp Menu.  This division of the menu into several with a large number of elements.  Dame, you don't need this.  Let's go back to the Menus.  Here you need to delete everything EXCEPT MENU.  And add three more: Applications, Places, System.  And edit them.  Here already customize, I will not instruct.  If you are done, then go ahead.  We have a menu (location of elements) that need to be adapted to the menu (On the top panel).  To do this, press the smallest button on the panel and in the Settings submenu select Show Mini Trobbers.  Now, next to each object appeared the same little button.  Click on it and select Settings.  Here I think you will understand. <br><br><h2>  6. Themes </h2><br>  There is only one topic in the topic submenu.  In its settings you can change icons, fonts, wallpapers, skins and their themes.  Skmny lie in the folder SharpE \ Skins.  You can draw them yourself.  I think on the example of past settings you can figure it out. <br><br>  Fuh like everything.  He highlighted all the questions that I asked in the comments.  Do not judge strictly, this is my first, I hope not the last, manual on Habr√©, and indeed.  I hope that you are interested in SharpE, if you have problems, ask in the comments. <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> And the <a href="http://trac.sharpe-shell.org/">manual</a> turns out to be there ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26653/</a></p>
