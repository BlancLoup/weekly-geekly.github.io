I, from Russia, offered him my feasible assistance in paying for a couple of months of access, all the more so that, by intracadet measures, the amount is not very large - about 1,300 rubles. <br>  This amount of money, translated into Belarusian rubles, will be enough for 2 months unlimited on the tariff on which it is now.  Then I did not know that this is a quest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Provider: <a href="http://www.byfly.by/">www.byfly.by</a> <br><br>  I asked a friend that he would learn about the possibility of payment by webmoney.  Their website does not describe this feature.  This process took him several days!  No, he is adequate, an adult.

      In the beginning he could not get through (1 line in the caliper).  Then the caliper fell into a stupor from the issue of webmoney.  They promised to clarify and asked to call back in a couple of days (!). <br><br>  A few days later he managed to get through and ... he was asked to wait another day! <br><br>  A day later, he got through again and was told with unconcealed joy that you could pay, but nobody knows how to do it now.  Asked to call back the next day. <br><br>  The next day, he was told the WMB wallet number, which he threw to me, along with the number of his contract. <br><br>  I sighed with relief, created a WMB wallet, transferred money to it, and in the end I got a little more than 12,000 Belarusian rubles.  With undisguised pleasure that now all these sufferings will end, I started filling out forms for transferring money, clicked the "transfer" button and received an error message stating that I was not authorized by the recipient to carry out such transactions.  It surprised me a little, but I sent a standard authorization request and asked a friend to call the provider and speed up the authorization process a little.  He was promised to do it within 3 days! <br><br>  At the end of the second day, I could not stand it and through the webmoney I wrote a letter to the recipient, asking me to authorize my wallet, so that I could transfer money to him. <br><br>  Today I received a reply from him that he was not at all aware of what it is and what I would write to the webmoney support service in Belarus. <br><br>  I have a slight shock.  I answered him about what the authorization of the wallet is, but it seems to me that this will not end the matter. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> how else can you transfer money to Belarus, with minimal losses on both sides.  As far as I know, if you make an ordinary money transfer, then serious interest will be withdrawn from the recipient. <br><br>  Tell me please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77106/</a></p>
