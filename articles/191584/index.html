  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dream office: what is it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© there were a lot of articles about efficiency ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/38434/">personal</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">team</a> ).  And this question does not disappear anywhere, because  There are more and more tasks that modern people have to solve, and less and less time to solve them (about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC">where our time goes</a> , there were also many posts).  One of the components affecting the efficiency of labor, of course, is the workspace. <br><br>  At the workplace in the office, many of us spend about a third of our lives ‚Äî 8-9 hours a day.  Separate "lucky ones" reach 10-12 hours.  And very few of the experts can, without wryly, call their workplace perfect.  Of course, people's requirements for the workplace are determined not only by personal tastes, but also by the characteristics of the profession.  And today we would like to touch on the theme of an ideal workplace from the point of view of IT specialists. <br><br>  In late July, Mail.Ru Group and HeadHunter conducted a small study.  We interviewed 691 IT specialists and found out what is most important for them in the office space.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/eec/7c3/04d/eec7c304d61236b30e843c199368e1a1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is not a secret for anybody that a comfortable workplace can significantly increase the efficiency of work of both a specific employee and the team as a whole.  For employees of the IT-sphere is characterized by intense mental activity (thanks, Cap!).  And despite the pronounced "technicality", it is often impossible to solve the tasks set in IT without a creative approach.  All this determines the special requirements for the organization of the workplace, which will favorably influence the intensity of mental activity and increase creativity. <br><br>  Evaluation of the effectiveness of the work of IT-specialists is often difficult.  This is not a production where the efficiency of an employee can usually be estimated by the quantity of the finished product.  Simple quantitative-temporal evaluations often cannot be applied to the result of the work of the same programmer or web designer.  That is why the organization of workplaces in the field of IT needs a special approach. <br><br><h5>  Sleep </h5><br>  The brain is the main tool for IT pros.  Whether or not the brain has had enough rest during the night, whether it has received enough glucose and vitamins necessary for its work depends on the quantitative and qualitative result of the employee‚Äôs work.  The need for adequate sleep of sufficient duration is known to all, not only from books, but also from personal experience.  Of course, the concept of ‚Äúsufficiency‚Äù is individual for each person, but in general it is possible to apply the empirical rule: <i>how much time is spent on work, as much time is necessary to spend on sleep</i> .  This is due to the physiological features of our brain. <br><br>  Alas, the realities of very few people are allowed to observe this rule in life.  In addition, the brain is arranged in such a way that not only the duration, but also the number of sleep sessions per day is important for it.  This is associated with daytime sleepiness, falling at 13-15 hours.  Scientists have long confirmed the need for a break for daytime sleep, which allows you to restore performance and vigor.  Even just a break in a quiet room with a muffled light, where you can relax, close your eyes and distract from the bustle of the office, calls, plans and colleagues, can help rejuvenate, clear your head and lift your spirits. <br><br>  The experts interviewed by us confirm this, 52% of whom would like to have in their office a recreation area with a sofa or even a bed where you can take a nap, and 33% would be happy to have a massage chair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9ff/285/8ba/9ff2858ba55e21a424f701e9bde958a6.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Motion </h5><br>  Blood plays a crucial role in the brain.  It supplies glucose and oxygen, and even a small decrease in their amount instantly affects the brain. <br>  An increase in the concentration of oxygen in the blood by the effects on the brain can be compared with an increase in the octane number in gasoline.  It is possible to saturate blood with oxygen by means of physical activities in the form of aerobic exercises, for example, jogging or swimming.  In addition, sport is a good rest after an intense mental activity.  It is indicative that all of the above was reflected in the preferences of the IT specialists we surveyed: 56% would not refuse the gym in the office, 34% would be glad to have a swimming pool. <br><br><h5>  Nutrition </h5><br>  We have already noted above the importance of glucose for the full operation of the brain.  However, this issue is not limited to the mere presence of chocolate and cookies in the office.  Yes, and to live a whole day on some sweets is not only harmful (because one day the time will come when employees will need to change the chair to a wider one), but also quickly get tired of anyone.  The need for food lies at the base of Maslow's pyramid; on an empty stomach, one does not think too much about anything at all, let alone what is high.  Therefore, the most unanimous experts interviewed by us showed a desire to have a kitchen in the office with free food - 66% of respondents.  Of course, this does not mean that it is enough to fill the back room with boxes with doshirakom. <br><br>  By the way, in the office of Pixar studio, Steve Jobs made a whole bar with sweets - Pixar's Cereal Bar (in which there are more than 100 different kinds of snacks), about which they even made a small <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5rkfp1zTPWc">film</a> . <br><br><h5>  Emotions </h5><br>  The influence of the emotional state of a person on his work activity is minimized by many employers and by the employees themselves.  Another feature of our brain is the drop in its performance during emotional outbursts.  And the "sign" of emotion does not matter.  However, in general, the duration of such bursts is small, so far more important are such depressing thinking of a person's emotion as fear.  Alas, modern life is far from measured, and all sorts of fears somehow penetrate into the life of every person: we are afraid for our health and the health of loved ones, are afraid of being left without means of subsistence, are afraid of bosses, price rises, Gopniks in the yard, darkness and millions other things.  You can fight with fears and negative emotions, not only hindering work, but also poisoning our life as a whole, in a variety of ways.  When applied to an IT office, these are various ways to relax and generate positive emotions.  For example, 44% of our respondents would like to have a shower in the office, 27% preferred computer and board games. <br><br><h5>  Reality </h5><br>  In addition to recreation, food and sports, the IT specialists we surveyed highlighted such important moments for them as ergonomic chairs, the latest computer equipment and components, peripherals that meet the latest market trends and, of course, licensed software that meets the needs of the fastiest IT-manager. <br><br>  In addition to receiving information about the preferences of IT-specialists, we also decided to find out how their current jobs correspond to the ‚Äúdream office‚Äù.  Alas, today only 8% of IT specialists can boast of such a complete set.  The rest of the majority (63%) say that, perhaps, the workplace is equipped and not with the latest technology, but in principle they have everything they need.  28% of respondents feel significant discomfort, who claim that the workspace is organized inefficiently: some lack the necessary second monitor, others have errors due to the use of unlicensed programs by the company, and someone complains about a low-powered computer, the capabilities of which are effective Work is not enough.  Only 7% of the respondents reported that the company organizes free meals for them in the dining room or cafe, as well as snacks in the form of fruits, sandwiches, drinks or sweets in the kitchen. <br><br>  Someone the above wishes may seem unreasonable.  However, most of this will be true for the vast majority of office workers.  And we can not say that IT-specialists are distinguished by capriciousness.  Despite the impressive wish list, 37% of IT people claim that they do not need a fancy office - they would be completely satisfied with the usual, but comfortable and cozy.  Nevertheless, 27% would not refuse high-tech office space, 24% - from the office in Zen style, and 10% see their own apartment or house as an ideal place to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/044/aab/c54/044aabc5455121582628e8d0fc50098b.jpg"><br><br>  The survey was conducted by the HeadHunter Research Service on July 15‚Äì30, 2013, among 691 IT specialists. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to ask you to leave the monitor and look back (if you are at work) and answer the question, are you satisfied with your workplace and would like to change something in it? <br><br>  We hope that this post will allow you to make a "revision" of your workplace and, who knows, maybe the reason that you did not meet the deadline is the banal absence of a shower room?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191584/</a></p>
