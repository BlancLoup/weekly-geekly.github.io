  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accreditation of freelancers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26227787/akkreditacia.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Remote collaboration is becoming more and more popular: recently, an increasing number of different specialists have been coming to freelance, respectively, and the level of competition between freelancers has also increased.  On the remote exchanges, the number of accounts is growing, among which it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate, especially to an inexperienced employer.  But the ultimate goal of any customer is to attract an experienced and qualified specialist to the project.  Experts, in turn, try to allocate their page in various ways and attract the attention of employers.  Of course, today many freelance exchanges offer their users to highlight a questionnaire using special accounts and rating systems, but often such assessment methods are not objective, since there is a possibility of receiving them for money.  As a result, such situations arise when the customer receives poor-quality work even from a highly rated specialist. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>PROhq skills accreditation system</b> <br>  The remote work exchange PROhq offers its users a system of accreditation of skills that will allow an objective assessment of the knowledge and experience of a freelancer in their field.  An accredited freelancer receives a special badge in his public profile that allows an employer to learn about the level of a specialist.  Accreditation at the PROhq exchange can be carried out in two ways: using documents and using special tests. <br><ol><li>  <b>Paid accreditation of freelancers on the basis of documents.</b>  This type of accreditation is carried out on the basis of documents submitted by the freelancer.  These may be diplomas, certificates, certificates, certificates of completion, etc.  To pass this type of accreditation, the freelancer sends the exchange copies of documents in electronic form (scanned), and service specialists make requests to educational institutions to confirm the information.  Accreditation is carried out in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity that is determined by the administrator of the PROhq exchange during the verification of documents.  It is obvious that the accreditation of a freelancer with the help of documents will allow the freelancer to confirm his education, thereby drawing the potential customer‚Äôs attention to the fact that he is facing a professional remote specialist. </li><li>  <b>Free accreditation based on testing.</b>  Each remote worker can be tested on the PROhq remote job exchange with the help of special tests.  To date, 54 tests are available to users, and their number is constantly growing, expanding the possibilities of accreditation.  Test results are also becoming available to customers, which allows them to see the freelancer‚Äôs objective assessments based on his real knowledge and skills.  Testing can be carried out in various areas, so that the freelancer can constantly improve their professional level, thereby making their profile more attractive. </li></ol>  <b>Features of accredited freelancers</b> <br>  The PROhq accreditation system expands the possibilities of cooperation between freelancers and employers: a remote employee gets the opportunity to add information about himself, drawing the attention of a potential customer to his professional level, and the customer gets the opportunity to choose a specialist among remote employees whose qualification is confirmed officially and is suitable for performing one or another project.  Thus, PROhq accreditation significantly improves the quality level of remote collaboration.  This practice today is widely used on freelance exchanges around the world, because accreditation is a modern way to confirm the qualification of a freelancer. <br><br>  <b>Benefits of accredited freelancers</b> <br>  The accreditation system gives an advantage to novice professionals who do not have a portfolio yet: an aspiring freelancer with confirmed accreditation will undoubtedly cause more trust in the customer, thereby having the opportunity to quickly find an interesting job with decent pay.  Accordingly, the <a href="http://www.prohq.ru/users/search/%3Fakkreditacia%3D1">freelancer, having both accreditation</a> and portfolio, has all chances to become more successful, attracting the attention of employers with quality work and official status. </div>
