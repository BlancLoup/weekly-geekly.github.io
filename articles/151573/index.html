  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We disassemble the Lenovo IdeaPad U300s ultrabook to the base</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week ago, I decided to do a preventive cleaning ultrabook Lenovo IdeaPad U300s.  It would seem that what the problem is - took a screwdriver and go.  But upon closer inspection, it was found that this model has no visible screws.  Under the rubber leg torn off abruptly, an empty spot was found.  Considering that no instructions for analyzing the U300s on the web could be found, I neatly glued the leg back and went to a fellow repairman.  The results of our meeting turned out to be so informative that the material gathered for the whole post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b27/514/512/b275145128b588dc30533d7b0490866a.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Start over.  To get inside the case, we need to gently pick up with two sharp rubber feet, located near the hinges of the top cover, with something sharp.  In the photo they are marked by arrows.  The legs are not glued, and then they can be easily replaced.

You can count on five hours even with a serious load, and in Word + ICQ mode you can hold out for more than six.  For the ultrabook on the Core i7 of the past generation (Sandy Bridge) this is almost a record.  In other matters, taking into account the size and capacity of the battery is not surprising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b06/173/5bc/b061735bc63131c3d9dee822691d201f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this, you will not believe, SSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d46/957/08b/d4695708b3390271247fdccf961de357.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It looks as if he was hastily soldered right at the factory.  The breed could not be determined - I just know that this is something based on the JMicron JMF616 controller.  The interface, as you can see, is not a standard mSATA, but a more sophisticated one.  So it‚Äôs not a dream to use a computer or other ultrabook.  Yes, and upgrade will not be easy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d1/179/6da/2d11796da32ed041f25076e3f897e567.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the next photo we see the ultrabook without battery and SSD.  Not without surprise, we learn that the motherboard is made in Japan itself.  It is also impossible not to notice the two coolers of the Taiwanese company Sunon.  Honestly, I was sure that he was alone there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/286/1e8/f96/2861e8f96f43d1f7fbb92fa879cfb4c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further disassembly slightly slowed down.  It turned out that the unit with the motherboard is firmly attached to the lid with the screen.  And you need to disconnect the part where the battery and keyboard.  The result was an interesting letter Z. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b6/0ea/a1e/7b60eaa1ed69147288752f2dafa3b7ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here we were waiting for another useful discovery.  It turns out that this model's memory is not soldered directly to the motherboard, but is inserted into a standard slot.  And if the available 4 GB is not enough, you can double the volume.  For many, this is important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/340/8ba/10a/3408ba10a1e917e64f4547217baea3fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The WiFi adapter is quite standard, and Centrino is even written on it.  I don‚Äôt see any reasons to change it, but if you suddenly need it, this is not a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/comment_images/abc/d4d/1c5/abcd4d1c5bcc0391fcee205e6c0bc995.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The chipset (also known as the south bridge) is devoid of a radiator, apparently it is not required in such systems.  Enough secondary cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ea/192/fb3/2ea192fb36229a38c4b23feaf0389d90.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But two heat pipes lead to the processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df4/9a4/473/df49a4473b34a6ccaa1a164d13feaed6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This model can not be called noisy, but coolers are turned on often and they are heard.  It is worth noting that the ultrabooks on Ivy Bridge, originally designed for this platform, are easily managed with a single propeller. <br><br>  Let's look at the same fragment from a different angle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/656/9b7/4c2/6569b74c2ff5e73b8b185ec2f5a1b821.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And these are connectors on one side.  They are made on a separate scarf, which is made not in Japan, but in China.  Such is internationalism in one system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/722/43d/9be/72243d9bed99b36c2a3ff520a8c5bbd4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is worth noting that during the parsing process, master Alexander constantly said: ‚ÄúWell, of course, everyone copied from the first generation MacBook Air!‚Äù.  And with a close look at the keyboard from the inside, he did say that it was her, dear - from Air. <br><br>  Well, judge for yourself.  Here is the Lenovo keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/980/d80/0fb/980d800fbcb1d9045cd8189557eb2471.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But from the Air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c9/7c6/ff3/6c97c6ff305fb48cc75efe6d0589e748.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Indeed, the similarity is present.  In general, I have a theory that on the MacBook Air, the production technology of ultrabooks was being worked out, and then, by agreement of Intel and Apple, they were transferred to other companies.  Nobody confirmed it to me, of course.  But, on the other hand, only the blind can overlook the similarities between the first generation of ultrabooks and the Air.  And the silence of Apple lawyers seems to hint ... However, let us return to the digging in the gland. <br><br>  Having removed one of the radiators, Alexander noted the presence of a ‚Äúladder‚Äù on it (an arrow points to it).  According to him, there is nothing good in it, because dust is always collected in this differential, reducing the efficiency of the cooling system and making it more noisy.  Indeed, there was a lot of dust there, and then I realized that, in general, I didn‚Äôt have to clean it for a photo ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eae/241/ee3/eae241ee3b8316af2ac80af29ab9fa60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here is the last generation Core i7 with the cooling system removed.  What is he still small!  Against its background, the notebook memory slot looks like a real giant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3a/312/4fd/e3a3124fd8a0a1841add13b202705a23.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, another small example of internationalism: the Taiwanese Sunon cooler is made in China.  Twenty years ago this would have been very difficult to imagine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03f/349/c57/03f349c57d1527caee7c8eedf6c2927a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another farewell look at the disassembled ultrabook ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/907/69d/ede/90769dede33defc93eaf58c900d3dce9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... and begin the reverse process.  To Sasha's honor, everything was collected the first time and works no worse than before.  To its credit - because once I had to open it again :) <br><br>  At the same time with the Lenovo IdeaPad U300s, we disassembled the new ultrabook on the Ivy Bridge Acer Aspire S5 with a very interesting exit platform with connectors.  But I plan to write about him a separate post. <br><br><h5>  <i>Many thanks to Alexander Levchenko ( <a href="http://www.tech-town.ru/">Tech-Town.ru</a> ) for help in preparing the post.</i> <br></h5></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151573/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151573/</a></p>
