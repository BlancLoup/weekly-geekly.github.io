  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to write emails no worse than CEO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  CEOs think about many things, but one of the most important is their time.  Whether they run a Fortune 500 company, or a startup, they have a lot of problems - and every second counts in the global economy. <br><br>  When I first started a startup, I wrote huge letters to my team members.  All this resulted in long chains of answers that took a huge amount of time from everyone.  I learned to filter out the excess and concentrate on the key points that I wanted to convey. <br><br>  <b>TL; DR: Be Short</b>

      Spending time reading chains of letters is unproductive.  Spending time on the phone is even less productive.  I have only a few years of company management behind me, but my directors and chairman have over 30 years of experience as a CEO or CEO.  Communication with them taught me to change the style of writing and make it compact - sometimes relegated to letters from one word. <br><br>  Here is an example of how there is too much ‚Äúwater‚Äù in letters: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Hi, Andrew, I just wanted to write to you and report an interesting opportunity (water! Don‚Äôt talk about what you‚Äôre going to say. And don‚Äôt say hi, this is not a messenger). <br><br>  Nice to meet you, my name is John Smith, I'm from ABC Inc.  (have we met?) I have been following your work for a long time and I think that we might be able to make an excellent deal (water! I already spent 5 seconds on this letter, and I delete it).  Our company is located in New York, and we are financed by companies a, b, c (water! It doesn‚Äôt matter - why are you spending my time, then?) We want to do X (finally).  We will do it better than Facebook, because 1, 2, 3 (water! I will decide myself what will be better).  Many people think that X, but personally I think that Y (water! What can you offer me, or what can I do for you?).  I would like to agree on a telephone conversation with you (this is unlikely). </blockquote><br>  We write as CEO: <br><blockquote>  Andrew, <br><br>  I would like to help you solve problem X. I practice Y and Z advised me to contact you.  Do you have the opportunity to talk this week? <br></blockquote><br>  And that's all.  Directly, briefly, solves my problem, and everything in the case. <br><br>  There are many more examples, such as the letter in the picture below, taken from my correspondence - there are almost no words at all.  You can pretend that your email has a limit on the number of characters, like on Twitter.  The more you try, the better you refine your choice of words and save many hours, because you will not have to answer long letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f7f/a64/86e/f7fa6486ee6135c55a3fd21e5917b851.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>"$$$$" is never water when you are chatting with your co-founder</i> <br><br>  If the letter requires a detailed response, arrange a call.  If the call does not take more than 5-10 minutes, do it right away.  If it takes more, make an appointment for lunch. <br><br>  And try to climb the communications ladder slowly.  Do you really need a ten minute call, or can you put your thoughts in a few brief tweets?  Force yourself to think critically and efficiently at the moment when you are writing an email or communicating in some other way.  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a time-saving CEO or you‚Äôre unemployed trying to get the CEO‚Äôs attention: you‚Äôll soon find out that the speed of responses and the time saved will increase very quickly. <br><br>  Do you think you have the makings that allow you to communicate as well as the CEO?  If you think that I can help you with something, send me your best letter ‚Äúin the style of the CEO‚Äù and see if you can get my attention: Andrew@Kuhcoon.com. <br><br>  And the winner of the letters sent to me: <br><blockquote>  Andrew, it seems to me that the email address of the CEO is poorly written.  Did I get your attention? </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295924/</a></p>
