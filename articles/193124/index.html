  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kinect 3.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We live in an amazing time in which tons of new technologies are becoming available to humanity.  We can invent almost everything that we only think.  Many platforms for crowdfunding allow you to bring ideas to life at relatively low costs.  So what are we sitting at?  We are all here, practically, engineers by training! <br><br>  It was a somewhat rhetorical question, but ideas always hover around us.  It often happens that when opening in the morning to read news, we see exactly what we thought about recently, but did not leave a single record about it.  So this article is exactly this small post that I would like to share with the community. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c97/26a/902/c9726a902034b8604383661c4dd8f0e1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It was originally intended to begin the story with the history of the development of user interaction with the game console, however, having written a couple of thousand characters, it came to the understanding that all this is not the main thing.  The main thing is to show that everyone has already noticed many times, something that may seem obvious, but has not yet been realized.  Captain Handsight in action. <br><br><h5>  You are the controller </h5><br>  Do you still remember this slogan, <a href="http://youtu.be/V22uKKUr_T0">shown</a> in 2009?  Microsoft first introduced Project Natal.  He impressed everyone, and even Sony <a href="http://youtu.be/qiX-26VL4bM">dragged a</a> PSMove prototype into their conference.  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãSony turned out to be somewhat closer to me, because I immediately saw the main drawback of all Microsoft technology.  No, this is not an input-log, which the journalists in the early stages of the project could not keep silent about, and not even that just a huge free space in the room is needed for it.  The main thing is the interaction with the user, and here we completely lack the immersion - where is at least a simple return feedback?  Remember your feelings when you first held the gamepad, which literally tried to escape from the hands.  Let the accessory be worth the extra money, but I want it.  And here we remember the vortex-gun, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/187298/">shown not so long ago</a> , but something we digress. <br>  Sony immediately put the controller as the main part of its technology.  In fact, to the usual gamepad, albeit not too ordinary form, adding accurate tracking of its position in space.  It seems that in PS4 similar functionality is built directly into the DualShock.  As a result, playing with PSMove was, subjectively, more pleasant - we felt the buttons at hand, felt the vibration from the actions taking place on the other side of the screen.  By the end of this year, we will also receive from Sony in addition to this level of immersion also the speaker on the gamepad itself, which is obviously peeped by the Wii, but this is not the main thing - the main thing is how everyone will use it.

    <h5>  Kinect 3.0 </h5><br>  Accumulating everything that was said above, you have long imagined something that I would like to share with you.  Let me show you the picture right away. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/3e9/073/cec/3e9073cec8267663f2737d82238fad07.png"><br>  This is simply a diagram on which vibromotors are marked with blue ‚Äî one for each finger, plus two differently directed vibration motors of higher power directly on the arm.  Today for the first time I looked into the specifications of these motors and chose more or less suitable ones intended for haptic feedback.  Yellow - battery.  Red - speaker. <br><br>  In fact, this scheme is exactly what I want to see as a new accessory to Kinect.  It has rough edges and flaws, yes, but I like the idea.  Dive into the game will become even deeper.  Imagine that you are playing with a basketball, you feel a vibration when conducting, and with each finger in different ways, thanks to which you feel even its rotation.  Through the built-in speakers, you hear the ball hit the parquet, and then you hear the slap of your hand on it, plus the speaker on each hand can also produce independent sounds of the environment depending on our position in space.  Even the volume of the ball becomes quite tangible, using maximum vibration with impossible compression and acceptable light vibration while holding it in your hands.  I do not know why the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbasketball came to my mind, because I never liked sports, but I would like to try even what I described above.  Indeed, you can use the device in a huge amount of interactive entertainment.  Suggest your ideas!  It seems to me that if you add simple things to Kinect, such as vibration and sound, right in the hands of the user, it will give a lot of new sensations. <br><br><h5>  Pros and cons </h5><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Adequate user feedback and applicability in a wide range of tasks - honestly, even considered a similar device for visually impaired people. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  Kinect still doesn‚Äôt recognize fingers - I closely followed new presentations, but apparently this is not possible with the standard Kinect 2.0 SDK.  This is not <a href="http://leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> .  I really want to make mistakes on this subject, and correct me if you heard other information. </li><li>  Expensive - some motors cost from 5.6 pounds apiece, and we only have 6 of these in one hand, plus a battery, a speaker, the implementation of a wireless interface - all this will rise 50 pounds per hand, do you want to experience new sensations? although, on the other hand, it is a full-fledged accessory, which is many times better than dummies of plastic steering wheels and rifles in which we have to invest a couple more controllers. </li><li>  Convenience - how convenient it is to move with vibration motors attached to your hands is a question, but completely solvable, just like the question on which phalanx of a finger will still be more convenient.  Again, even the form factor is somewhat confusing.  Because if you make a glove - you will have to release several sizes, which is, in fact, a big minus.  As an option - clamping straps that allow you to conveniently put on the accessory on any hand. </li></ul><br>  Personally, despite all the flaws, plus this idea inspires me! <br><br><h5>  PS </h5><br>  As a result - a small render of the last voiced version. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/20a/725/6ed/20a7256ed25f7bff7945a8137bb1b6c5.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/193124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/193124/</a></p>
