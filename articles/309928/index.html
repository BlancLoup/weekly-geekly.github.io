  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customize Windows Store for Business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since the creation of Windows 8.0 and 8.1, Microsoft has focused on upgrading its Internet portal Windows Store.  I think many would agree that, compared to the Apple Store, the Microsoft Store was rather underdeveloped in terms of application availability and usability of the store interface. <br><br>  With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, Windows Store has undergone a radical change regarding the availability of applications, games and tools.  All this is good for the consumer market segment, but how about adding functionality to business users?  Microsoft has done it!  Since there was no previous integration of Windows Store in a domain environment, this led to problems with managing purchases and licensing potential applications, not to mention many other problems. <br><br>  Previously, commercial enterprises were faced with the provision of financial and accounting statements when an employee of the company needed an application from the Windows Store.  How to control access, ownership and licensing of the current application?  In short, all this was not controlled.  In addition, it was not possible to reassign the license.  For example, if an employee leaves, the application, so to speak, ‚Äúleaves‚Äù with him. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Since users previously purchased applications from the store using their personal Microsoft Live ID accounts, users can now buy the application using their main work accounts, which administrators can set up and manage in their personalized Microsoft Windows Store for business.  This requires that the users who are granted access have accounts in <a href="http://www.comparex-group.com/web/ru/ru/resheniya-po-litsenzirovaniyu/spetsialnye-predlozheniya/microsoft-azure.htm">the Azure cloud</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">A few words about the benefits</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  Organizations can purchase large amounts of Windows Apps </li><li>  Procurement based on the example of organizational identity.

To assign certain privileges, a user with the role of a global administrator on the portal will need to assign the necessary rights in the Windows Store. <br><br>  Please note that at present it is possible to assign permissions only for each user individually from the physical portal.  In order to assign a group affiliation, you must use Microsoft Azure or SCCM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5f/5cb/6ca/f5f5cb6ca3dd4e56b862470f134ccbb3.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Global administrator</b> - this role assumes full access to the store for business.

Usually applications in a private store become available within 12 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66e/058/cb4/66e058cb45bd4c118c08bd09ce77b5e5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7bb/261/8d5/7bb2618d571249d68750cd751dd14c3f.jpg"><br><br>  Private Store is a Windows Store for Business feature that organizations receive during registration.  When administrators add applications to a private store, all employees of the organization can view and download them.  Here the user has an overview of all the applications that were directly assigned to him and he will have the opportunity to download them. <br><br>  If the user decides that he would like to choose his own application, he will receive a request to enter his personal data: the name and password of Microsoft Live. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Distribute offline applications</font> </h3><br>  With stand-alone licenses, organizations can download applications and licenses to deploy them on a network or on devices without an Internet connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf5/2c8/844/bf52c88442ef47bdabb5568a74d52fc3.jpg"><br><br>  Distributing offline applications is an alternative option to network applications.  Deploying standalone applications may be a worthwhile solution in the following cases: <br><br><ul><li>  Users have no Azure accounts </li><li>  No internet connection </li><li>  Imaging is used to control devices. </li></ul><br>  Your master data management tool (MDM) must be configured in the Azure Ad Portal portal and listed in the Windows Store for Business in the Management tools section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae3/41a/9c2/ae341a9c2e0447328615eb42f6c1b1cb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8c/3f4/411/d8c3f4411eee4da6a63c88e6e0fa6305.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Personal Business Application Line (LOB)</font> </h2><br>  Through the use of personalized Windows Store for Business, your organization has the opportunity to develop and publish its own custom applications in a private information store to speed up distribution within your organization. <br>  The application developers in your organization or the external suppliers you invite can become publishers of business applications and submit applications to your company.  The application becomes available only for your company. <br><br>  Applications are requested through the Windows Dev Center (Windows Dev Center) and can be managed and deployed using the same methods that were illustrated earlier. <br>  However, before initiating, you must fulfill some requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  Your organization must be subscribed to the Windows Store for Business </li><li>  Business Applications Publishers Need Active Developer Account </li><li>  Business application publishers must have an in-store application or one application ready for publication. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">And in conclusion</font> </h3><br>  Windows Store for Business offers medium and large businesses the benefits of a portal of flexible distribution of applications according to individual customer requirements.  Additional benefits include the ability to publish their own custom software on their own portal. <br><br>  Bulk purchases and license reassignment allow companies to reduce costs, since the software remains the property of the organization, in contrast to what it used to be when individual users who needed the application had to use their personal Microsoft Live accounts. <br><br>  Local use also remains an effective solution for the above scenarios, where a third party distribution solution is used.  Microsoft will continue to add functionality to the store and a variety of versatile applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309928/</a></p>
