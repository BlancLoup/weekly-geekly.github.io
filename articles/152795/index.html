      This option will first of all be inappropriate for people who work at home (fully or partially) and do not have a normal workplace or who want to increase the free space in the room by replacing the bulky old workplace with such a compact one. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you do not want to read, as I spread out water in the text in my thoughts - go straight to section ‚Äú2.  Purchase" <br><br><h4>  0. Lyrical digression </h4><br>  It all started with the last redecoration in the room.  Then it was decided to abandon the large (huge) desk with drawers.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need him that way,‚Äù I thought then, and my repair took place under the division ‚ÄúDown with furniture, giving space.‚Äù  From the flat horizontal surfaces there was only a coffee table (actually for magazines, coffee, every little thing).  The computer moved under the TV as a media station, and his place was taken by a small 13.3 "ultrabook. Visually, the room had 2 times more free space and I was happy until the needs of working at home began to arise. After a couple of days, it became clear that working in a pose of shrimp on the couch at a coffee table does not bring any joy, and after an hour or two brings pain in the back and ‚Äúeyes in a handful.‚Äù This was the beginning of the process of creating a ‚Äúworkplace of no place‚Äù <br><br><h4>  1. Options </h4><br>  Since  One of the main conditions for me was the preservation of free space - I considered the option of a small table within 60x100 cm and about 70-80 cm high. <br><br>  I had a small space near the wall <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40e/a82/d20/40ea82d202a194a0a9214db183185a67.jpg"><br><br>  There were two options in general - either stupidly buy such a table and put it against the wall, or hang the table directly on the wall, getting some advantages (which I will discuss at the end).  Suddenly, the idea came that a hinged table can be made not just bolted to the wall but also removable / foldable.  I stopped at this, deciding to start to rush to the nearest Ikea / Obi. <br><br><h4>  2. Purchase </h4><br>  The idea was to buy a tabletop in Ikea, and then in OBI to purchase various fixtures and to remove the structure itself.  But it turned out that IKEA already has a suitable table ready-made for a reasonable 2500 rubles.  Realizing that my dream is closer than I thought - I bought it (by the way, therefore, the title "do it yourself" is in quotes - my hands were involved at least, but the article moved from the category of "wow, I wish I could" to "hmm, and so can I, I'll go do it ") <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/214/598/1e7/2145981e7da54f2c858b186ee44857e5.jpg"><br><br>  The table has dimensions 50x90 cm. Of the 50 cm - 12 cm is a fixed shelf and another 38 cm is the folding table top itself.  In disassembled form, an identical surface of 50 cm is obtained without a tangible gap.  The table is made of dense chipboard and is covered on top with a film under a dark tree (black-brown classical Ikeevsky coloring).  Folding-unfolding the table takes about two seconds and is not inconvenient. <br><br>  On the Russian IKEA website this table is <a href="http://www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/products/20217522/">www.ikea.com/ru/ru/catalog/products/20217522/#/80217524</a> <br><br><h4>  3. Assembly and installation </h4><br>  For assembly, besides the table itself, you need: a good screwdriver (in my case, a screwdriver), a perforator, 6 dowels + screws for fastening to the wall (according to tradition, Ikea does not apply them to furniture) <br>  Like the rest of Ikeev furniture, the table is not issued with fantastic quality, but it is made quite tolerably, all the holes are prepared exactly and the design is both simple and reliable. <br><br>  First, the corners for fastening to the wall are screwed to the smaller part (shelf) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/659/4e8/a7c/6594e8a7c25aad97aa4c6db6abd75298.jpg"><br><br>  We must pay tribute to the designers - all metal parts are made of very thick metal - about 2-3mm. <br><br>  Holes in the wall are marked (here you need to think carefully about the height of the structure) <br>  As a level, for lack of present, I used the program for android <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b0/39e/854/5b039e854b45b8c0591f9602129e7c17.jpg"><br><br>  I took dowels and screws reasonably large, because  the table itself weighs under 10kg + laptop and other junk + hands on it when working.  Moreover, one does not need to be an engineer in order to understand that, relying on the edge of the table, we create a non-fig-load on fastening it to the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c3f/a86/cb5/c3fa86cb5eb7be1f547585c174502046.jpg"><br><br>  Then loops and the main table-top fasten <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b50/d6a/074/b50d6a074fcf5ca36a66dffd6812507b.jpg"><br><br>  And all this is hung on the wall, twists qualitatively.  Then hangs the central leg.  Done! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc1/d7e/172/cc1d7e172f7dfba3f0731e78e06c53e0.jpg"><br><br>  The supporting leg is made very reasonable - a thick metal of square section does not allow it to bend a millimeter, while the L-shaped design does not interfere with the legs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4c/0cf/0f0/d4c0cf0f00326993a98611f843be55bb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  4. Result </h4><br>  The folded table has a convenient shelf on which all my ‚Äúworking‚Äù things are placed.  Ultrabook is kept from rolling down small silicone "pimples" pasted on the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fa/090/43c/9fa09043cadd549da221c8c1302aa899.jpg"><br><br>  Shelf freely accommodates a lamp, a cup, a carpet for a mouse, the mouse itself, charging for it, the ultrabook itself and even a panda. <br><br>  When it is complicated - the space in the room practically does not suffer! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efa/bae/846/efabae8461a1165a30f3cf020c455e1b.jpg"><br><br>  When unfolded, the table turns into a full-fledged notebook workplace. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/411/6b0/afb/4116b0afb15aa3c49abc41c830bbc756.jpg"><br><br>  In the evening <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7f/eec/c60/d7feecc60f4490e7d27ee499a938a330.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89c/466/96e/89c46696eecf0aa4971143018399173f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  5. Pros and cons </h4><br>  Compared with the classic workplace, I can distinguish the following differences: <br><br>  Pluses of my option: <br>  + Less space occupied (in the folded state almost at all) <br>  + When folded, it almost disappears.  Classic table must be disassembled for this, so just can not hide it. <br>  = Relatively inexpensive (a similar table for the floor can even cost more due to the presence of legs, or about the same) <br>  + Very stable (I don‚Äôt know what will happen next, but now it‚Äôs a monolithic construction at all angles and in all planes that is difficult to swing even a centimeter. You cannot achieve this from a regular table of similar dimensions) <br>  + May have any height (as hang, so be it) <br><br>  And cons <br>  - Do not move (except for hanging with a punch. But even in this case, we are limited by walls) <br>  - It is limited in depth (if you like to stretch your legs - this is not your option, there is a wall. Normally, it allows you to sit correctly - the depth of 50 cm is sufficient for my height ~ 185 cm).  I would even say that this is a bit of a plus - he teaches him to sit properly and not smear on the chair. <br>  - You can sit down to the table on one side only (with tension on the sides, but this is an option for 10 minutes) <br><br>  This is probably all.  I solved my problem without disturbing the space of the room and getting a comfortable workplace. <br><br>  The article is written in the new workplace - conveniently and comfortably, without the thought ‚Äúto finish and dump as soon as possible.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84f/8d7/e0a/84f8d7e0ae0bd7fe8c327e78064fc4cf.jpg"><br><br>  UPD: for "multiple requests" (a whole one) panorama of a room in a hurry.  Sorry srach, etc. <br>  By clicking - more <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a95/c15/08a/a95c1508a7ed57b440ec86e030f16f0b.jpg"><br></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152795/</a></p>
