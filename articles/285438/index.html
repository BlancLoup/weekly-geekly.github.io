  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three words about the leader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  How many leaders we meet on the path of life.  You have to communicate with big and small leaders, kings and kings, real pros and autocrats.  But how to understand, with what person it will be pleasant and interesting to work, and with what work can turn into hell? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Selection </h4><br>  In equal conditions, it is sometimes difficult to draw a line between a normal and a good leader.  It is difficult to immediately identify a bad leader: they are very well disguised.  An excellent manager still need to search. <br><br>  But the fact remains.  It is easy for us to work with some people (the work can be quite tense and difficult at the same time), and with others every ordinary day turns into hard labor. <br><br>  To understand what a person is, you need to eat more than one pound of salt.  But you can simply choose the direction.  A good leader should be characterized by three simple words: accessibility, involvement, simplicity.

    <h4>  Availability </h4><br>  In modern computerized society, communication problems are still quite frequent.  All these problems are perfectly solved, and they must be solved!  Both on a technical level and on a psychological one. <br><br>  How many cases can be remembered when, due to the inaccessibility of the manager, wrong and short-sighted decisions were made.  Often the performer is not aware of all the problems, he does his job.  The head is the fine regulator directing work in the necessary direction. <br><br>  I foresee the question: ‚ÄúAnd how long should a manager be available?‚Äù.  Answer: "All the time while work is in progress."  If performers work in other time zones, can work at night (for developers, this is almost standard practice), then the manager should be available with at least two means of communication all this time.  And why should I get out of the flow, put off work for tomorrow, if my manager is not there, he is too busy ...?!  But all that is necessary to clarify one small detail. <br><br>  Why two?  Very simple: the first means to solve strategic issues that other people should know about (conferences, mail, chat rooms, etc.).  The second is for solving operational issues (ICQ, skype, telephone, conversation, etc.). <br><br><h4>  Involvement </h4><br>  If the leader is indifferent to the fate of the company's project or even a small module, then problems will arise with it.  Compare the motivation to do the job: <br><ul><li>  It is necessary to create a module by November 12, it has already been written by three developers.  Terms must be sustained. </li><li>  It will be cool if you join the module development.  Your skills and knowledge will help us pass it on time. </li></ul><br><br>  In the first case, the head performs a formal duty - simply distributes the work.  It seems that he does not care about the quality of the product, its convenience or novelty.  Only the deadline is important, as the manager will be able to convey the above positive report. <br><br>  In the second case, a certain ‚Äúinformality‚Äù (and it always occurs with close interaction of people) simply delays the employee to get to work.  He feels responsibility not to the authorities as such, but to colleagues. <br><br><h4>  Simplicity </h4><br>  To be simpler is a quality relationship motto.  The leader must be closer to the employees, communicate with them on the same level and language.  The willingness to accept the offer of the employee, to conduct constructive criticism of the existing solutions, and not just the proposals, gives only benefit to the common cause. <br><br>  Sometimes managers are so closed by a bureaucratic wall consisting of various obstacles that it is easier for an employee to find another leader who knows how to listen. <br><br>  The hierarchical structure of the enterprise should be more flexible.  A manager must have greater ‚Äúinformal coverage‚Äù.  This will make better decisions. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Of course, you can formulate many more criteria for a good leader.  But it seems that for each artist, this list will be different.  For myself, I developed a list of three criteria: accessibility, involvement, simplicity.  Any great leader must satisfy them. <br><br>  It is not necessary to include the material position of the company, existing relationships, hierarchy and policy in the criteria  In a good leader, first of all, personal qualities are important, everything else is just a husk.  We choose who to work with. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285438/</a></p>
