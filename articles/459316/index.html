These are two days and two tracks of reports devoted to distributed computing.  Reports are the best scientists and engineers who came to St. Petersburg from around the world.  The conference is aimed at experts in the field, no introductory reports! </p><br><p>  You can watch a completely free online broadcast.  It will be only the <strong>first day and the first hall</strong> + online interview between presentations.  What kind of reports - discuss below. </p><br><p>  It is important that the broadcast will begin at 9:45 am (Moscow time), 15 minutes before the opening, and will end closer to 8 pm.  All this time you will be able to listen to the reports with short breaks.  The link will work all day, so you can open it only on the reports that are most important to you. </p><br><p>  Link to the site with video and program - under the cut.  In the same place, we will discuss a few things that will not be in the broadcast, but which are available to participants who came to the conference live. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/48/0t/en/480tenllbz1zjgexyyarnz3rbwe.png"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="gde-brat-translyaciyu">  Where to take the broadcast </h1><br><p>  The broadcast page is waiting for this green button link: </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/qt/3g/aaqt3glurqc8l4ug4itzcdyrhou.png"></div><p></p><br><p>  In the presence of a video player and the program of the first hall.

Cliff is a Java world legend, the father of JIT compilation and the wizard of low-level performance.  We did with him a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/458718/">great habrointerview</a> , I recommend reading.

Ori is engaged in the study of programming languages, formal verification, especially all that concerns multithreading.

We will see that Paxos, in fact, is only one of the options among the vast range of approaches to consensus and that other points of the spectrum are also very useful for building good distributed systems.  Heidi's specialization is consistency, fault tolerance, performance, and distributed consensus. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="100" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/c5f/287/bfcc5f287809d663bf04f87b1371dcf6.jpg">  <a href="https://hydraconf.com/2019/talks/6eb39udg8bxsgmimkexd6j/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D459316">‚ÄúReduce your storage costs with Transient Replication and Cheap Quorums‚Äù</a> is a report by Alex Petrov about how you can reduce the load on the storage, if you keep the data only on parts of the nodes, and use special nodes (Transient Replica) for failure handling scenarios.  In the course of the report, we will look at Witness Replicas, the replication scheme used in Spanner and Megastore, and the implementation of this concept in Apache Cassandra called Transient Replication &amp; Cheap Quorums. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="100" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa6/3a8/df3/aa63a8df336c3c7062423ce6159367ac.jpg">  Roman Elizarov from JetBrains company will tell about <a href="https://hydraconf.com/2019/talks/68l5ztovlf0xm9aindouzr/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D459316">Structured concurrency</a> .

We did a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/458936/">lot of habro interview</a> with Maurice, which is worth reading before visiting the report. <br clear="all"></p><br><p>  Total: six reports, transactional memory, memory models, distributed consensus, structured concurrency, and even blockchains.  Everything you need to have a great day. </p><br><p>  If you want to get access to all reports in general (not only the first hall) on Thursday and Friday, then you can <a href="https://hydraconf.com/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D459316">purchase an Online ticket</a> .  In fact, this is the only opportunity for those who learned about the conference only now and no longer have time to get to St. Petersburg.  In addition, so you will have all the videos of what happened.  Difficult reports differ in that they will most likely have to be revised. </p><br><h1 id="ne-vsyo-dostupno-v-translyacii">  Not everything is available in the broadcast. </h1><br><p>  If you have time to buy a ticket at the last moment and come to the conference live, then there will be some more interesting things: </p><br><h2 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h2><br><p>  After each report, the speaker goes to a dedicated discussion area, where you can talk with him and ask your questions.  Formally, this can be done in a break between reports.  Although speakers are not required, they usually stay much longer - for example, for the duration of the next report.  Sometimes it makes sense to skip the report from the main program (if you bought a ticket, you will still have records after filling out the feedback) and spend it on focused communication with an important expert. </p><br><h2 id="dve-bof-sessii">  Two BOF sessions </h2><br><p>  BOF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> .  There is no division into a speaker and a participant: everyone participates on a par. </p><br><p>  Currently, <a href="https://hydraconf.com/party/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D459316">two topics are</a> planned: "Modern CS in the real world" and "Trade-offs in concurrency".  Both BOF sessions are conducted in English only, as are many presentations and discussion areas at the conference. </p><br><h2 id="vystavochnaya-zona">  Exhibition area </h2><br><p>  The exhibition is a zone of stands of partner companies of the conference.  Here you can learn about interesting projects, technologies and work in a team of leaders of the IT industry.  This is the place where you and the company can find each other.  At Hydra with us the <a href="https://www.db.com/russia/ru/content/rdc.htm">Deutsche Bank Technology Center</a> and <a href="https://kontur.ru/%3Futm_expid%3D196386536-92.0Y9L19TTRuGk6W279BSlWg.0">Contour</a> . </p><br><h2 id="vecherinka-s-pivom-i-muzykoy">  Party with beer and music </h2><br><p>  In parallel with the BOFs, a party starts at the end of the first day.  Drinks, snacks, music - all at once.  You can chat in an informal setting and discuss everything.  You can move from bof to party.  You can move from a party to a bof. </p><br><h1 id="sleduyuschie-shagi">  Next steps </h1><br><ul><li>  If you are watching a free broadcast: you need to <a href="https://hydraconf.com/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D459316">follow the link</a> on Thursday, July 11th.
