TechCrunch in this category asks questions to significant figures from the world of technology, startups and hardware. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ef8/a1b/f93/ef8a1bf93ce72666a25aae9c6c55f993.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1) A few simple questions: Android or iOS?</b> <br><br>  No comments.

      <b>2) Super Nintendo or Sega?</b> <br><br>  Games on MSDOS. <br><br>  <b>3) Your first car?</b> <br><br>  Jeep Commando 1973. <br><br>  <b>4) Who was your hero in childhood?</b> <br><br>  My parents had a company developing software for Apple II +, Commodore 64 and Acorn computers.  They hired teens who programmed software, and these guys were real hackers who squeezed more colors, animation, and sound from these computers.  They were my heroes, and they helped me crack the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry">Wizardry</a> and get unlimited gold. <br><br>  <b>5) What are the earliest memories of technology?</b> <br><br>  My father was a desperate radio amateur, and I remember the brilliance of Hammarlund‚Äôs vacuum tubes.  I remember when I was watching Star Wars at the age of five, and I thought that R2-D2 was talking like interference in that receiver. <br><br>  <b>6) Which teacher influenced you the most?</b> <br><br>  When I studied at <a href="http://evergreen.edu/">Evergreen State College,</a> I met <a href="http://tribes.tribe.net/8cf5630b-8d7d-4576-899d-6c1d96ab8dfd/thread/be43535d-c454-4209-aa12-2388e0aa9071">Doraine Crable</a> , and she was so dynamic and interesting that I immediately decided: I will teach everything that she did not teach.  For several years I studied Butoh dance and worked with the Kagami dance troupe.  Butoh is a post-apocalyptic form of Japanese art, for which you need to shave all the hair, paint the body with white color and drool on people. <br><br>  <b>7) Without which application on a smartphone you can not live?</b> <br><br>  I have a passion for old cars, so I constantly read <a href="http://bringatrailer.com/">Bringtrailer.com</a> .  But I'm smart enough not to have old cars. <br><br>  <b>8) Which company is moving the DIY community forward?</b> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt think that only one company does this, so I‚Äôll call Adafruit, Evil Mad Scientist and MakerBot, because each of them, including the one I founded, is designed to provide customers with tools for innovation. <br><br>  In addition, I will mention Make: Magazine, because they actually help people find new ideas and because it is through them that my passion for production originated. <br><br>  <b>9) What mistakes would you like to correct?</b> <br><br>  Throughout my life, I made mistakes, learned from them, and struggled to make mistakes only once.  Looking back, I regret only one thing: while MakerBot took off, I found too little time for my friends. <br><br>  <b>10) Who influenced your life the most?</b> <br><br>  It was not a man, it was a community.  When I was a teenager, I didn‚Äôt feel very well at home and realized that I could spend the whole summer at Bar 41 <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bre/sets/72157594227285698/">Dude Ranch and Summer Camp</a> working there.  I went there right away, as soon as the school was over.  I took on all kinds of work, from washing dishes to digging into the ground.  All the people in the camp gave me the desire to explore who I am and build friendships.  I rode horses a lot, mostly bareback - as a special kind of freedom.  This experience, which sometimes allowed me to be alone or to be with other people who believed in a bright future, gave me more than all the 12 years at school. <br><br>  <b>11) What would you like to do before you die?</b> <br><br>  I hope to relax in the unmanned car. <br><br>  <b>12) What gadget will you buy next?</b> <br><br>  This spring I'm going to do my little garden.  Now I think how to automate it. <br><br>  <b>13) If you did not live in New York, where would you live?</b> <br><br>  There are several places that I would like to visit and live from six months to a year in order to experience life there and get to know friends better.  Kobe, Japan.  Berlin, Germany.  Reykjavik, Iceland, and Tallinn, Estonia. <br><br>  My favorite place in the world is the Orkney Islands in the North Sea of ‚Äã‚ÄãScotland, because I love megalithic monuments.  But this is too far away for me to think about life there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283792/</a></p>
