Before this conference, I believed that I had a strong medium level in design. <br>  After the conference, I think that I overestimated my skill, but I think that all the same <br>  I am down to low level.

      2. There is a good field for 3D activities not only for people. <br>  with artistic skills, but also for programmers.  There is a need <br>  in writing scripts and plug-ins, simplifying the exchange of data between <br>  various three-dimensional packages. <br><br>  Now my impression is on several of the reports heard. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Best game at KRI-2007 - Disciples3 (.dat) Secrets and technology.</b>  <b>Anry, Nikolay Kovalev, Maxim Tkachev.</b> <br>  The most important thing noted in this report is the preliminary development of images, <br>  Reasonableness of each game character.  The guys did not save time on the details <br>  went to museums, studied heraldry. <br>  The second favorite feature of their work was using Zbrush to create shaders, <br>  which allowed the characters to make a low poly, and all the small details to make the shaders. <br>  Nevertheless, all the characters in the game looked flawless, the detailing was at the highest level. <br><br>  <b>3D trends and a little bit about the 3D future.</b>  <b>Sergey Cyptsyn</b> <br>  Sergey is right - any universal thing, including universal 3D packages, <br>  does almost everything, but does everything badly.  Professionals choose highly specialized <br>  programs, and 3D platforms like Maya or Max are used to convert <br>  and matching the data. <br>  In general, it is worth noting that this report was extremely useful to me for general development: <br>  before that, I thought that only Maya and Max exist, but it turned out that there is at least <br>  4 more software packages of this level (XSI, Houdini, Lightwave, Cinema4D). <br><br>  <b>MENTAL IMAGES GmbH Paolo Berto</b> <br>  Very intuitive program interface for generating shaders. <br>  I didn‚Äôt like the program itself, but the interface concept: <br>  Different shader properties are located on an infinite workspace. <br>  in the form of a flowchart.  Arbitrarily complex flowcharts and relationships between elements are possible. <br><br>  <b>Discussion Positioning and targeted use of modern programs for compositing.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Nuke, Shake, After Effects, etc. Ilya Shutov, Konstantin Kharitonov, Cinematheque Studio, with the participation of Sergey Cyptyn</b> <br>  From this report, I learned that AF is not the best tool for non-linear video editing. <br>  and create video effects.  Unfortunately, I have experience only with Pinacle Studio, <br>  and, to be honest, there are no more opportunities than Pinacle laid out for me ... <br><br>  <b>Concept art for the gaming industry Alena Klementieva</b> <br>  The report is weak, vague and uninformative, many repetitions. <br>  The only thing that he introduced the listener into the kitchen of concept art creation <br>  but there are more questions than answers. <br><br>  <b>Render learned, what next?</b>  <b>Denis Shershunov</b> <br>  Indistinct philosophy without support for modern postmodernists <br>  and in general the entire philosophical tradition of the 20th century. <br>  One phrase of the speaker: ‚ÄúPain is necessary for man‚Äù - scares with his fanatical masochism. <br>  I agree that the level of culture in the Russian Federation is not high, but it is better to raise <br>  cultural level through joy than through suffering. <br><br>  <b>The use of three-dimensional scanning technology in film production Sergey Kotelnikov, Mikhail Anikushkin, NPP Navgeokom, Konstantin Bushuev, studio Trigraph</b> <br>  A cool device - a three-dimensional scanner, really works, <br>  but the material could be livelier and more colorful. <br><br>  <b>1: 1.618 - The Divine Measure of Beauty.</b>  <b>Mikhail Menzelintsev.</b>  <b>(studio Lunokhod)</b> <br>  Very weak preparation for the report.  We still have to rehearse the report once <br>  or at least read the text a couple of times.  And in no case can not drink for <br>  courage  The subject is completely unrevealed.  Many theses of the report were controversial. <br>  modern scientific view on this aspect of aesthetics. <br>  The speaker had to get acquainted at least with the works of S. Kotina. <br>  By the way, here you can find a detailed bibliography, knowing that the speaker <br>  could look more worthy: <br>  <a href="http://www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/21291">www.humanities.edu.ru/db/msg/21291</a> <br>  One last thing: one cannot talk about symmetry in nature without having even a distant <br>  ideas about group theory :) <br><br>  <b>Creature technical direction.</b>  <b>Characters in CG - Ideological and technical side of the issue.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Mikhail Aizenberg and Dmitry Novikov, Lunokhod Studio</b> <br>  Very good and informative report. <br>  After it, I understand why when creating a character, you need not only <br>  skeleton, but also anatomically accurate muscle building for <br>  motion modeling. <br>  I will try to definitely watch the film ‚ÄúDo not think of white monkeys‚Äù, <br>  special effects in which the report was devoted. <br>  I look forward to the release of this film. <br><br>  <b>Cinema4D for egoists.</b>  <b>Dmitry Karpov</b> <br>  Very good report.  Minimum technical details, the report is rather a conceptual one. <br>  An important thought: do not shoot a gun on the sparrows. <br>  For example, Maya is a great tool for animation, but it‚Äôs primitive <br>  The tasks are completely not optimal. <br>  After this report, I wanted to learn Cinema 4D <br>  The most remembered phrase: ‚ÄúIn two years, Illustrator will turn into Corel‚Äù <br>  It meant that the user prefers friendly interfaces, <br>  which have competitive advantages even with the worst functionality. <br><br>  <b>A single art concept of the project and the search for a golden mean.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Mikhail Ivanenko With the participation and support of Wacom.</b> <br>  The quality of the report is weak.  Basic thought: useful to present <br>  not only what the character of an art concept looks like, but also to pretend its history, <br>  explaining his visual image. <br><br>  For the rest of the reports I will not write ... <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7479/</a></p>
