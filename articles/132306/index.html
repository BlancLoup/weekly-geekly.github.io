      Most workers are confident that the loss of confidence in them should be pronounced or scandalous in order to greatly influence their relationships with colleagues.  To such statements, Denise and Michelle Reina (Reina), one of the leading experts in the development of trust relationships in the company, respond with ‚ÄúThink twice!‚Äù.  Denis and Michelle Reyna are founders of the Reina Trust Building Institute, a consulting company, and co-authors of the books Rebuilding Trust in the Workplace (Russian edition) and Trust and Betrayal in the Workspace (Russian edition). .  The Reins argue that ‚Äúminor‚Äù breaches of trust over time acquire great importance.  These violations, like the death of a thousand paper cuts, kill productivity, quality and morality. <br><br>  Experts list seven reasons why your colleagues may stop trusting you and indicate how to avoid the most common mistakes. <br><br><h4>  1. You do not trust other people. </h4><br>  Trust is a two-way street.  If you want people to trust you, trust them yourself.  To get started, stop pushing on your colleagues.  Instead, give them the opportunity to display all their talents. <br><br><h4>  2. You do not mark the contribution of colleagues to your work. </h4><br>  When your colleague helped you a lot, how would you react to this?  Do you take the time to personally thank him?  Or just send a formal ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù By email and proceed to the next task? <br><br><h4>  3. You break deadlines </h4><br>  In life, anything happens and you missed deadlines here and there.  Not so scary at first glance, right?  No, it is not.  Every time when you break deadlines, you slowly lose confidence, because your colleagues depend on you. <br><br><h4>  4. You are late for meetings </h4><br>  When you are constantly late for meetings, your colleagues begin to feel that you are wasting their time.  They may also think that you do this only because you think your time is more valuable than the time of your colleagues. <br><br><h4>  5. You do not recognize your mistakes </h4><br>  By acknowledging your mistakes, you not only show your humanity, but also allow your colleagues to recognize their mistakes. <br><br><h4>  6. You distort the truth </h4><br>  Do your colleagues know that they can trust your words or should they think that you are not talking enough?  Try to say it as it is.  Distorted truth in any case will cause suspicion, people understand that you are "cunning" and sooner or later this will lead to a loss of trust. <br><br><h4>  7. You do not interact constructively. </h4><br>  Watch your behavior.  Instead of swearing at a colleague because of missed deadlines, try to figure out why something went wrong.  Find out for the future what your colleague needs from you to do your job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132306/</a></p>
