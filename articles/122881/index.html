  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera 11.50 - what everyone has been waiting for</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In fact, it is almost three months at the current rate of release of new versions of browsers.  But any wait someday ends with a final release.  Therefore - we meet the new version of Opera 11.50.  At first glance, there are not so many innovations, as perhaps someone would like to, but everything is simple: firstly, there are still innovations, and very interesting ones, and secondly, users may have noticed that we have they were very closely involved in fixing bugs, improving the stability of the browser, in general, they were actively working with reviews and bug reports of users.  And - of course, I almost forgot: the new version is again faster than previous versions, and much more advanced in terms of support for you-know-what web standards.  So let's start with the most noticeable changes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Password synchronization</b> <br>  You asked - we did.  Now you can forget about manually transferring wand.dat from machine to machine after each browser update or adding new passwords.  It is enough to turn on synchronization and tick the necessary checkbox. <br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/img-1.png" alt="image"><br>  I understand that there are quite a lot of people who relate to the security of their data with the utmost care.  Anticipating their question I will say: yes, it is safe enough.  You can read more about what and how happens during password synchronization <a href="http://my.opera.com/operalink/blog/2011/05/03/security-of-synchronized-passwords-with-opera-link">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>Express panel extensions</b> <br>  You know - we do not like boring work (and who loves her?).  Often, the popular and habitual functions here acquire a new life or completely change, transforming into something new.  And when it is possible to make a certain mix of various convenient gizmos - the result can be very interesting.  It happened this time.  We already had an Express panel (who had forgotten - by the way, also our invention), relatively recently we added extensions (this is not our idea, I will not lie).  And in Opera 11.50 we decided to combine them.  And why not?  As a result, we ... i.  you received: now you can place any cool or useful data directly in the Express panel, of your choice.  It can be a weather forecast, a clock (oh, those hours!), News broadcasts, whatever - everything is limited by the imagination of the developers.  Web developers, to be more precise, because these extensions, like widgets, like regular extensions, like Unite-applications, like ... well, three magic technologies - HTML / CSS / JavaScript.  Here‚Äôs how it might look like: <br><img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/img-2.png" alt="image"><br>  For the Russian-speaking audience will be interesting extensions Express panels prepared by the developers of <a href="https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/vkontakte-3/0.1/%3Fdisplay%3Dru">VKontakte</a> and <a href="https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/ria-novosti-2/0.1/%3Fdisplay%3Den">RIA Novosti</a> . <br><br>  As it should be, extensions for Express panels are also placed in our catalog, you can access them either from the Add Cell dialog, or simply by clicking on <a href="http://addons.opera.com/">the extension catalog</a> .  For those who are interested in a new function for purely professional purposes - welcome to the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/">pages of documentation</a> .  By the way, Express Panel extensions use the same cookies that are installed in the browser.  In other words, re-authorization is not required.

      For clarity - a video dedicated to the new features of the Express Panel: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjYQRru46-I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNZx2TFhM4HZ302Z9aI5xdzwAYXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/BjYQRru46-I%3Fversion%3D3%26amp%3Bamp%3Bhl%3Dru">look big</a> ) <br><br>  <b>Hardware acceleration</b> <br>  ‚ÄúOMG, did they do that ?!‚Äù you thought.  Surprise: no, not yet done.  More precisely, they did it, but until we show it - we leave it for dessert for the next browser versions.  Maybe someone is very sad this news, but it is in vain.  Remember that the best accelerator for websites and services is quality written code.  Only in this case, not only the owners of powerful / popular / expensive (you can emphasize everything) video cards will be able to enjoy your creation, but also owners of noname computers equipped with an ‚ÄúAll inclusive‚Äù motherboard. <br><br>  <b>Web standards</b> <br>  Well, there's nothing to say.  For the ordinary reader, it‚Äôs all up to the bulb, and it‚Äôs more convenient for the interested reader to look at the pages of technical documentation - what is new in the new version of the kernel (and it‚Äôs still new) <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/presto29/">Presto 2.9.x</a> ? <br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br>  Yes, we do design again.  In fact, this is logical: the work on the design is like a repair in an apartment, it cannot be finished, it can only be stopped.  Well, suppose, we are not going to stop, because there are many ideas, but they are still inclined to be fruitful in the heads of designers, and these designers are such inventors ... In general, see for yourself, evaluate, send your comments and suggestions - our designers love it.  I think.  Well, at least I hope they love.  By the way, if someone suddenly gets bored without a modest triangle in the address bar that opens the list of entered addresses - do not despair, he disappeared without a trace.  You can return it to its place in the settings here - <b>opera: config # UserPrefs | Show Dropdown Button In Addressfield</b> . <br><br>  <b>I want it already!</b>  <b>Where to get?</b> <br>  Yes, in general, in the same place, where always - on the <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">official site</a> .  Although - no, not so. <br><br>  <b>CITIZENS, BE ALERT!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>REMEMBER THAT ALL OPERA BROWSERS ARE EXTENDED FOR FREE!</b>  <b>IF YOU ASK FOR MONEY - THIS IS A DIVORCE!</b> <br><br>  Yes, and for dessert - a small Live Show for those who like to chase the results.  Go to the main page <a href="http://www.opera.com/">www.opera.com</a> , to see the dynamics of downloading a new version of Opera-11.50.  At the same time learn some pretty interesting statistics from the crazy world around us.  Really insane, judging by the information ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122881/</a></p>
