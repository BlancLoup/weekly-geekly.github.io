The company is in the TOP 5 of the largest Russian content aggregators, mobile payment market operators.  In more detail about our main activities, in particular, such interesting for many directions as micropayments, etc. the following publications. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Now closer to the topic topic - we certainly plan to expand our activities and above all we consider Internet projects as the main and closest direction for us to expand the scope of activities. <br>  To do this, we are looking for courageous independent people with extraordinary ideas and determination to translate them into reality.  One of the first and most important criteria in evaluating a project is how confident the author is of success, but of course, it is equally important that the author adequately assesses the prospects for his project, the project‚Äôs market niche and competitive environment.  It is desirable that the author of the project could give a clear description of the target audience, create a plan for the development and promotion of the project.

      We are waiting: <br><ul><li>  Talented developers, authors of original ideas who see themselves </li><li>  In the role of the lead programmer in the team and / or project manager responsible for the implementation and development of the project. </li><li>  Independent small groups of developers with the concept of the project at the initial stage or ready-made software developments, a pilot version of the original project in any area. </li><li>  Large teams of developers, including those interested in creating a joint venture to implement a large-scale project. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, we consider each project individually; therefore, it is rather difficult to identify a clear framework of projects of interest to us, however, the general indicators of projects of interest to us are as follows: <br><ul><li>  Small Internet projects with a development period of 1-6 months, a budget of 1-5 million rubles, in the areas of: social networking applications, selling services, content projects, online games.  In this category, projects with micropayments payment are especially interesting - via SMS.  Wishes on financial indicators: Achieving a positive profitability within 6-8 months, return on investment up to one and a half years. </li><li>  Medium and heavy projects with a development period of 6-10 months, a budget of up to 25 million rubles.  Any original projects are interesting. Wishes according to financial indicators: Getting to a positive profitability during the first year, return of investments up to 2 years. </li></ul><br><br>  As for the methodology of working with project authors, we are trying to make it as transparent and dynamic as possible.  Movement to launch the project in steps: <br><br><ol><li>  You send a description of your project to the address invest@incoremedia.ru or fill out an application online or write me directly if you have questions about the description. </li><li>  We get a presentation, we consider it within a week.  Regardless of our decision, I reply to your letter. </li><li>  We meet with the authors of interesting ideas, discuss the concept of the project, approaches to implementation and promotion, planned economic indicators. </li><li>  After the meeting and exchange of views, we analyze the financial model, the budget of the project (business case), if necessary, we involve specialists of our company to draw up an understandable business case, which later in any case remains in your hands. </li><li>  If analysts of the company recognize the business case as positive from an economic point of view and feasible in practice, then proceed to discuss the terms of the joint work on the project, including mutual obligations, cost-sharing and profit sharing schemes. </li><li>  In case of success on all points, we approve the plan of work on the project and start. </li></ol><br><br>  I understand that this post can hardly be called an exhaustive description, at the moment I set the main task for myself to inform the Habrasoobshchestvo about giving my projects the necessary impetus for development. <br>  I am sure that there are talented, willing to take risks, responsible and self-confident specialists, I‚Äôm looking for just such people, I confess so far it‚Äôs not very easy to find such people.  I haven‚Äôt yet come up with a reliable way to do this, so I‚Äôll be happy for your comments, suggestions and suggestions.
