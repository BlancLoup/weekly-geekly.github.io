Businessmen, companies and organizations are less and less thinking about the social benefits of a new project.  The interest for new beginnings is profit.  It is difficult for a young team at the very beginning of the journey to present any data on profits.  Start-upers themselves often do not know what will come out of their project and whether anything will come out at all.  Naturally, there are teams that believe in their idea from and to, but the result does not always meet expectations. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A large company that is able to help a young project, as mentioned above, is experiencing hard times.  The company is partly a living organism, but to be imbued with ideas is not its peculiarity.  For this reason, developers need to be very careful at the stage of finding partners.

      Large-scale bombardment by letters of all large companies on your subject is most often the wrong decision.  Why?  Because your project is not needed a priori, unfortunately, it is.  I repeat, they are interested in profit in the first place.  Do not forget that a large company may be interested in your project if and only if you have a certain database, for example, users (or subscribers, or preorders).  Even mutual PR is built on the fact that partners can offer each other.  What can your project offer mega-corporations if you have 50 users?  Nothing.  The most important thing is not to hurry, because having been refused cooperation at an early stage of development, it is far from a fact that something will turn out in the future. <br><br>  Pay attention to small and medium-sized companies, they are often just like you need to advertise.  And most importantly, they just like you do not have large advertising budgets, if there are budgets at all.  Cooperation with small firms does not have major obligations.  Thus, it is much easier to find points of contact.  The main question is what the company can offer you.  We must not forget about the main goal - advertising / public relations, not friendship. <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to note that it does not matter with whom you cooperate, the figures that you have reserved for meetings and negotiations are important.  Most recently, the company B * lizzard reported on the reduction in the number of subscribers to their online game.  And after the report stated that this is the last year when they publish the report.  The company refers to the fact that these statistics do not reflect the real state of affairs, they say, they still earn more.  And rightly so, only those data that raise the price of your "shares" should be published. <br><br>  Until the next article, gentlemen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296240/</a></p>
