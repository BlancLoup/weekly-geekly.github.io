      Huawei has already refused to cooperate with Microsoft, Google, Qualcomm, ARM chip maker and other companies. <br><br><h3>  Tesla Model 3 did not notice the truck and got into a fatal accident </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/838/ffd/aa9/838ffdaa9469b843a73c8f94817a012a.png"><br><br>  The other day Tesla Model 3 electric car had an accident, crashing into the trailer of a truck that had left to intercept.  The autopilot of the vehicle did not notice the trailer, as it already happened in 2016.  It seems that Tesla has not been able to solve the problem of recognizing objects that are high relative to the car, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/452650/">against the backdrop of the sun</a> .  At the same time at the time of the accident the autopilot was turned on - the driver did it just a few seconds before the incident. <br><br><h3>  Experts estimate the effect of Zombieload on processor performance </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a64/f22/de8/a64f22de863ed9e5b26114105b504b9e.jpg"><br><br>  Last week, Intel recognized the presence of vulnerabilities in its latest generation of processors.  As it turned out, the protection of chips may lead to a decrease in their performance by several tens of percent.  To test these numbers, third-party experts conducted experiments and studied how processors from different manufacturers work with enabled hyperthreading.  For AMD chips, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/452814/">performance</a> drop <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/452814/">was 3%, for Intel - 16%</a> . <br><br><h3>  A new version of Windows has a zero-day vulnerability. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc8/059/44d/cc805944db77e20ac1ba32824701d8e5.jpg"><br><br>  An independent information security specialist discovered a zero-day vulnerability in the new version of Windows.  It is related to the task scheduler, which allows the hacker to obtain additional rights in the system and open files with the System access level. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/337646521" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  From December, the Russian electric car will be on sale at a price of 450 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/0b0/22b/cfd0b022b185adf03d9d6ae901d2d7d4.jpg"><br><br>  Zetta CEO announced the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453040/">imminent sale of the domestic electric vehicle</a> .  This vehicle will cost nearly half a million rubles and have a cruising range of 200 kilometers. <br><br>  Zetta is a compact three-door electric car with two or four wheels.  All components manufactured in Russia, except for the battery manufactured by GE Power Technology (China). <br><br><h3>  Electronic key can be issued to any person and re-register the apartment </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d67/eea/fe8/d67eeafe8f6d1fb3c45c38897fccffe4.jpg"><br><br>  Journalists of the 47news edition found out that an <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453208/">electronic key that allows you to carry out tax transactions</a> , arrange an apartment for yourself or another person, and close companies can be obtained in someone else's name.  Make it surprisingly easy.  It takes about 15,000 rubles and a couple of days of free time. <br><br>  The input data of the person who comes to make out the key is checked poorly.  The organizations that certify the identity of the person who came to issue the electronic key are private companies and are practically not responsible for anything. <br><br>  The certificate that these companies receive gives the right to sell a digital signature, but they are not obliged to control the actions of the signature owner.  The employees of the certification center are not controlled by the FSB, the Ministry of Communications, or any other bodies. <br><br><h3>  Domestic SIM-cards will be released with Russian cryptography, but on a Samsung chip </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/100/117/3e2/1001173e2cb5bd8ab605c529c8234c5d.png"><br><br>  In December 2019, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453244/">trusted sim cards with domestic cryptography</a> should appear in Russia.  This was told by a source in a company that manufactures telecommunications equipment.  These SIM cards will work on chips of a South Korean company, but will support domestic encryption standards, in full compliance with GOST. <br><br>  The cost price of the new card will increase by no more than $ 1.  Since now it is 15 ‚ÇΩ, it will grow to about 80 ‚ÇΩ. <br><br><h3>  SpaceX launched 60 satellites of the global Starlink Internet network </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f3d/037/37f/f3d03737f848c2bc2f3c8032a86670ca.jpg"><br><br>  The company Ilona Mask still launched a Falcon 9 launch vehicle with 60 satellites of Internet connection on board.  This is only the first test batch of devices.  The total number of satellites that are planned to be launched into orbit is almost 12,000. They will communicate with ground stations using phased antenna arrays and with each other using a laser. <br><br>  Initially, the rocket put them into orbit at an altitude of 440 kilometers, and then the vehicles rise themselves using their own engines.  SpaceX has not yet reported anything about the satellite entering orbit at 550 km.  These engines will be used to adjust the position of satellites in orbits.  In particular, in order to avoid collisions with space junk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453392/</a></p>
