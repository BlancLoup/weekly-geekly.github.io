Without a doubt, it was one of the best letters he had ever received.  He thought that it would be interesting to post it on a blog and see what thoughts Vero readers will have.  For you - translate this article about <b>e-mail marketing and its nuances</b> .  This kind of ‚Äúdebriefing flight‚Äù will allow you to understand the general spirit of the letters that are sent to their customers in this company, which today is estimated at an amount in <b>excess of $ 10 billion</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is remarkable about Airbnb?  This is a real winner. <br><br>  <b>1.This is personalized and triggered emails (according to the user's behavior on the site)</b>

      Airbnb (like most commercial and SaaS websites) invites users to register or login when they visit.  After logging on to the site, Airbnb can track human behavior.  So, the visitor reviewed the results of searches, read the photos, read some reviews.  By his actions, he showed that he wants to book a place to stay.  The result was not long in coming, and the next day they sent him an email with a detailed list of what was viewed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e5/5a0/c59/1e55a0c59a004d11ba11d61a21ea33e8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It was not a shot in the dark.  This list was not a mailing list for everyone.  They sent him to one and only one person, which was the direct result of his behavior.  This is personalization! <br><br>  <b>2. Visitors have access to a bold button in the conversion language.</b> <br><br>  Using this button eliminates the possibility of the user passing on a further call to action, and the inscription ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù is a direct way to move it through the conversion funnel.  Clicking on this button, the visitor understands what will happen next - he just learns more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ea/cdd/454/5eacdd454b6b45a89bd980c83fa2fec5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If they used the words "Book" or "Take a Vacation," they could frighten the user away.  What is behind the button that says?  Order page?  Is it time to give a credit card number?  It would look scary if there were no 100% certainty.  The idea is to move the person to the next stage, and not to break the deal. <br><br>  <b>3. They have a backup plan.</b> <br><br>  A backup plan is not always a good idea.  Surely you want the letters to be focused on one thing in order to avoid the loss of conversions due to absent-mindedness or analytical paralysis.  But Airbnb was offered not only what interested a particular person, but also that he was not going to book.  From this he is not happy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f8/f03/8d5/8f8f038d52dc465f9c3eae4b42e40c57.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Since they closely monitor user behavior on the site, they know where the potential client wants to stop and they know how much he expects.  And this means that for them it is not only an opportunity to carefully offer ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù, but also a great way to attract attention.  One of the proposals in the list may be tempting.  When a user clicks (or does not click) on one of them, they continue to collect even more data about his upcoming trip. <br><br>  <b>4. This is a focus on user alerts.</b> <br><br>  A quick look at your Airbnb account will show that it‚Äôs really not a person who has booked a place to stay through their website.  This is not a hotel, but someone‚Äôs residence or country house.  Based on the feedback from other potential customers, they know that at first customers are afraid to try something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/c06/e55/861c06e5531d473a80be478043c18e80.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The links direct the client to security articles - this is in the first place for them - and to the help center where you can download information about how and why to use Airbnb.  This is an excellent response to the concerns that might arise when using the service. <br><br>  <b>5. These are micro-calls to action.</b> <br><br>  We have already talked about micro-calls to action and effective ways to increase conversion.  In essence, these are small conversions that keep customers interested in your brand before they are ready to buy.  If Airbnb can get a customer to follow them on Facebook, Twitter, Google+ or Pinterest, then they have opened a new channel for communication with their potential customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c78/db0/744/c78db07443d24368b5f0dc6cff444bb5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  They take a step forward by linking an email preference page.  Despite the fact that you can unsubscribe, there are also opportunities to receive even more letters, text notifications, download mobile applications and invite your friends. <br><br>  Do you think Airbnb can be improved? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283620/</a></p>
