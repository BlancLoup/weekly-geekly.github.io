In an interview, Wong <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/12155804/New-10-minute-test-for-cancer-developed-by-scientists.html">assured</a> that one drop of saliva can accurately indicate not only the presence of the disease, but also localization. <br><br>  A professor of <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306562.php">about 10 years</a> with a team of scientists working on this method, which they call ‚Äúliquid biopsy‚Äù, and to date, researchers <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/859128">insist</a> that most common cancers can be identified by saliva.  One way or another, the work of Wong was closely monitored by the press over the past five years, and each release and statement was covered by major publications: DailyMail was one of the first to tell about the medics <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2815077/Saliva-test-cancer-hailed-holy-grail-early-detection-deadly-disease-Analysis-used-spot-diabetes-dementia.html">back in 2014</a> .

      Wong is not alone.  Mention that saliva - ‚Äúinformative tool‚Äù can be found in the profile press <a href="http://www.oraloncology.com/article/S1368-8375(09)00849-5/abstract">from 2009</a> .  However, in early studies it is only about oral diseases. <br><br>  So in fact, for the first time, Wong spoke to the broader possibilities of saliva with a group of authors, in an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4425103/">article from 2015</a> .  He clarified that, to date, until today, saliva was considered only as a means of clarifying or identifying local diagnoses: in the mouth. <br><br>  However, by the current time there are a number of confirmed studies (to which he refers), according to which neck cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, as well as other diseases (hepatitis, diseases of the cardiovascular system, etc.) can be identified in this way. .). <br><br>  The first tests of the test were positively completed with an accuracy of 100%, write publications.  The task was to detect lung cancer. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The diagnostic device operates on the principle of electric field-induced release and measurement (abbreviated EFIRM, literal translation: ‚Äúinduced by the electric field release and measurement‚Äù), detecting biomarkers of non-small cell lung cancer in saliva. <br><br>  The EFIRM device analyzes the contents of exosomes - tiny bubbles that the cell periodically releases into the external environment.  The device simultaneously causes exosomes to release their contents and recognizes biomolecules that have come out. <br><br>  In the course of the study, Professor Wong and colleagues described the use of EFIRM in order to demonstrate that saliva contains exosomes secreted by tumor cells that were previously found in the blood. <br><br>  Professor Wong says that the EFIRM technology has high speed and accuracy.  The analysis takes only 10 minutes, the result can be obtained directly in the doctor's office during the reception. <br><br>  Saliva testing may be included in the diagnostic program.  For example, if a suspicious node was found during a radiography in the lung, the doctor could immediately schedule an analysis and be more likely to detect lung cancer. <br><br>  The test is based on the detection of mutations in a specific protein, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).  It helps cells grow and divide, but in the tissue of non-small cell lung cancer this protein is present in too much.  In this case, a special group of chemotherapy drugs are used for treatment - EGFR inhibitors that block protein. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.euroonco.ru/science-news/test-slyuny-dlya-diagnostiki-raka">A source</a> <br></div></div><br>  Then, in 2016, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/test-salitest.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsalitest%26utm_campaign%3Dsalitest">Salitest saliva oncology test</a> appeared in Russia. <br><br>  The project was launched on Boomstarter, and <a href="https://boomstarter.ru/projects/544181/salitest_rannyaya_diagnostika_raka">ended with the fact</a> that out of 3,000,000 rubles more than half were contributed by the authors of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dfe/bb0/476/dfebb047664747beadae3e83cbf6e3ac.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that references to the studies of the aforementioned professor in the campaign description are not given, the creators were probably familiar with some materials in this area.  Leading medical oncologists of the Omsk region were involved in the Omsk Salitest project, and according to the authors, it took about 5 years to develop a completed project. <br><br>  The team rightly notes that for the task (identifying oncology in the early stages), which they sought to solve, blood is not very suitable, although it is the most common type of diagnosis.  Saliva, on the other hand, changes its biochemical composition with minor pathologies, so it is logical to find at least suspicion. <br><br>  In just 2 days (test timeframe) about 30 tumor markers will be analyzed in the laboratory to identify the presence / absence of predisposition or disease. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/adc/de4/215/adcde4215f23438da62cdd37d12eb617.png"><br><br>  Total declared the possibility of determining cancer: <br><br><ul><li>  Lungs </li><li>  Stomach </li><li>  Colon </li><li>  Breast </li><li>  Body and cervix </li><li>  Ovaries </li><li>  Thyroid </li><li>  Kidney </li><li>  Bladder </li><li>  Prostate </li></ul><br>  Included the user receives detailed instructions with a list of recommendations, compliance with many of which is critical!  For example, from the moment of collecting the sample to the time of transfer to the courier should not pass more than 24 hours. <br><br>  The analysis itself is performed in the laboratory.  It also clarifies that this test is not intended for persons under 18 years of age. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtYtoSKWv2s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Currently, Salitest is sold <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/test-salitest.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsalitest%26utm_campaign%3Dsalitest">at a price of 6000 rubles</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/404063/">https://habr.com/ru/post/404063/</a></p>
