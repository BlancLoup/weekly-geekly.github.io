Then I did not think about the cooling system and thought that it would be impossible to do without a fan that drives the air. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over time, I began to notice some strange, hoarse, hooting sounds that occur at certain angles of the netbook.  It was they and a fair amount of curiosity that made me open the test subject, despite the possibility of losing the guarantee.  And what do you think I saw there? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7a61b359/44be74a4/5b091f24/903bbd60.jpg">

      Aluminum plate, on top of which stood a motor with impeller.  ‚ÄúWhere are the fins, where is the increase in the radiator surface area?‚Äù I thought.  No, just a plate that blows air.  All right, I look at the engine - 5 V, 0.3 A - it is the whole 1.5 W. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a8974e80/2b7a356d/dc0393c7/ee0a3e94.jpg"><br><br>  That is consumption.  I decided to unscrew the heatsink and look at the processor.  What I saw next was shocking to me: Thermozvachka 2 mm thick?  What for?  Why so fat?  Is it impossible to adjust the radiator to the minimum clearance?  I decided to replace the thermocouple with a thin aluminum plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/94cb6082/9af6b126/f2b2a6da/ff82eb19.jpg"><br><br>  But the effect was insignificant.  I was not limited to this and decided to increase the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe radiator by sticking a small radiator onto the plate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c6b5d1c3/75105c86/92d30c14/fcca3c15.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f822e7c1/39dcbafe/69a673fd/c6554cf4.jpg"><br><br>  This also gave a slight effect and a decrease of 1-2 degrees.  This radiator rather obstructed blowing than dissipating heat.  Googling a bit, I found out that the permissible temperature for the N450-100 C, the power that the radiator (TDP) should dissipate is only 5.5 watts.  Having quickly calculated the required area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe radiator, I received about 0.001 square meters, i.e.  The 10 by 10 cm plate should have been quite enough.  The next step was a homemade radiator.  First, the choice fell on a copper radiator from a laptop.  It took a long time to adjust and use a copper plate gasket, because  the radiator did not get to the native mount.  Eventually: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6b87bca4/7deca683/e43536ce/8ed5e32c.jpg"><br><br>  Prots heated up to 60-70 C. And pretty much warmed up the left side of the netbook, it didn‚Äôt suit me a bit. <br>  Googling again, I came across a Dell Inspiron Mini 9 netbook on the Intel Atom N270.  TDP has 2.5 watts.  This is more than 2 times less than that of my processor.  What did the Americans come up with?  Oh yeah!  Passive radiator!  They designed the radiator as a large plate located directly under the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1398d4ed/23202009/70dd2aee/263226ea.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/85c5d7d8/13510556/1e7d5ba4/a8d07be7.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8d065c3a/172d7225/deaf62f3/aba2e3b1.jpg"><br><br>  The next step was to increase the surface area.  I used aluminum sheet because  similar copper was not found.  It was not possible to locate it under the keyboard because of the design of my device, so I placed it under the bottom cover.  As with the previous version, we had to use a plate-gasket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6a5d6af0/24e3f3f2/7fe34660/f027f3bc.jpg"><br><br>  Now the percent heats up to 50-60 degrees.  The only drawback is heating the bottom of the netbook, and it may be a little uncomfortable to keep it on your lap, but for our northern winters this is even a plus. <br>  All connections of the processor, radiator, plate-gaskets were smeared with good old <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%259F%25D0%25A2-8">KPT-8</a> .  Of course, it would be a plus to avoid the use of gaskets, but it was not possible to adjust the radiator using other methods and materials available. <br><br>  Since now the fan does not need to drive, we get energy savings.  And the battery netbook runs for half an hour longer. <br><br>  This article was originally written for the <a href="http://notebook-acer-aspire.ru/">acer aspire one</a> netbook site.  Here I publish an article, because I believe that all this information is worthy of the attention of the masters, and can be useful to many.  Everything I described above, I did with my own hands and above my netbook <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> More than 5 years have passed and the processor feels fine.  The truth is that during this time the network card, the keyboard and finally the battery died :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133475/</a></p>
