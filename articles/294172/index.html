  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Import substitution policy allows Sberbank to provide a third of IBM's revenues in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúIn 2014, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ru/ru/">IBM</a> in Russia had several deals with one very large customer among the companies with state participation.  This allowed the Russian office to demonstrate a positive revenue trend in 2014.  The volume of contracts with this customer amounted to about a third of the revenue of the Russian division of IBM.  The contracts, among other things, were concluded for the supply of licenses for our software products for a period of several years, ‚ÄùAndrei Filatov, IBM CEO in Russia and the CIS, told Kommersant. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.kartoteka.ru/">kartoteka.ru</a> , the revenue of IBM BEA LLC in 2014 exceeded 9 billion rubles.  It turns out that one of the Russian companies with state participation purchased IBM products for about 3 billion rubles.  Source Kommersant claims that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">Sberbank</a> acted as the customer. <a name="habracut"></a>  This information was confirmed by a top manager of a major IT company. <br><br>  One of the major contracts with IBM concerned the acquisition of software and the services of its technical support throughout the Sberbank group for a period of five years, a representative of Sberbank said.  ‚ÄúGeneral agreements for two years were also signed for the supply of IBM Power servers, Midrange category storage systems, and software packages.  Within the framework of these agreements, the bank has the possibility of repeated one-time purchases at a fixed cost, and the volume of these agreements determines the maximum possible total amount of purchases, ‚Äùhe adds.

      In addition, IBM plans to start cooperation with <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17138/">Innopolis</a> .  ‚ÄúWe are negotiating with the leadership of Innopolis and consider the city as the second platform for the IBM service center in Kazan,‚Äù Andrei Filatov, IBM CEO in Russia and the CIS, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2801775">told</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  Former head of IT at <a href="http://www.rosenergobank.ru/">Rosenergobank,</a> Leonid Belyshkov, notes that the purchase of various computing, engineering, and telecommunications equipment is the main expense item for large banks.  ‚ÄúNext on a comparable amount of costs are licenses for software.  It is known that Sberbank in large quantities purchases Microsoft software, which is installed on employees' computers, and also uses specialized banking software from both its own developments and large Russian companies <a href="http://www.cft.ru/">CFT</a> , <a href="http://www.diasoft.ru/">Diasoft</a> , <a href="http://www.softlab.ru/">R-Style Softlab</a> and others, in addition, the bank buys a lot of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP">SAP</a> and IBM corporate software, ‚Äùcontinues Mr. Belyshkov. <br><br>  In January 2015, Sberbank also allocated a large amount (about 3.6 billion rubles) for the purchase of <a href="http://www.symantec.com/ru/ru/">Symantec</a> antivirus software.  ‚ÄúIt turned out that instead of Symantec, it was possible to buy software from <a href="http://www.kaspersky.ru/">Kaspersky Lab</a> and <a href="http://www.acronis.com/ru-ru">Acronis</a> , which would have been much cheaper and not inferior in performance.  But we cannot yet somehow influence Sberbank, ‚Äùa representative of the Ministry of Communications told Kommersant. <br><br>  The draft Ministry of Communications on the restriction of public procurement and the law on import substitution adopted in late June do not apply to companies with state participation.  Innovations regulate only the work of government agencies.  The history of Sberbank shows that while such companies can act in defiance of the policy of import substitution, directing large sums to the pockets of foreign vendors.  And while the Ministry of Communications can not do anything but shake his head with displeasure.  However, as the top manager of an IT company explained, Sberbank and similar companies fear that sooner or later there will be a ‚Äúholiday‚Äù on their street too. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294172/</a></p>
