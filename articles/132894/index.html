Lyubishchev</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear Habravchane! <br>  Not so long ago, my attention was attracted by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gtd/128034/">post</a> ‚ÄúA few words about motivation, time, goals and people,‚Äù written under the impression of the read biography of Professor Lyubishchev.  It talked a lot about achieving personal results, as a result of the application of the theory, but did not specify the principles of the time accounting system itself.  The desire to find out the details and, possibly, subsequently try out this theory on itself, prompted the reading of Daniel Granin‚Äôs novel ‚ÄúThis Strange Life‚Äù, which is a kind of biography of Professor A. A. Lyubishchev in free form.  Anyone who has not had the opportunity to read a book about the great scientist in the original, but who are interested in his system as a whole - please under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Who is he? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3c2a045c/26cab079/32d35f83/325b8054.jpg" align="right"><br>  I would just like to tell you a little about the main character and why his biography, and even more so the system, deserves attention.  It is not charismatic, not attractive appearance, poorly dressed old man had a popularity that you could only dream of.  A professor-entomologist from somewhere in Ulyanovsk, not even a laureate, gathered full audiences of institutes all over the country.  What was the secret of his success?  In deep knowledge of genetics or mathematics?  There were scientists and stronger.  In his erudition?  This is not to get mass recognition.  There are still a couple of trumps inherent in Lyubishchev - his heretical.  With much of the existing, he could go into the cut.  He could question the seemingly unshakable propositions of Darwin, Schr√∂dinger, and bring the proof from where no one had yet thought something proper to come from.  His next trump card is his life position, his striving for a designated goal, the search for ways to achieve it. <br><br><h4>  His lifelong activities </h4><br>  Lyubishchev lectured, headed the department, department of a scientific institute, went on expeditions throughout Russia.  He spoke several languages: English, German, Italian, French, with the first two studied in transport.  In the so-called free time, he was engaged in the classification of earth fleas.  The volume of these works only looks like this: by 1955, Lyubishchev had collected 35 boxes of mounted fleas.  There were 13,000 of them there. It was necessary to determine the flaws, measure, dissect, and make labels.  He collected six times more materials than was available at the Zoological Institute. <br>  Lyubishchev worked both inland and in breadth, was both a narrow specialist and a generalist.  He, being an extremely inquisitive person, could not limit himself.  Lyubishchev enjoys seemingly extraneous things, gets involved in discussions, writes treatises on extraneous topics.  He could not follow the diet of his mind and, in this regard, he sinned with ‚Äúgluttony‚Äù.  Perhaps these distractions helped Lyubishchev in his main activity?  After all, for example, Wagner valued his poems higher than music.  There is also an ancient saying: <i>‚ÄúA doctor cannot be a good doctor if he is only a good doctor</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  The range of his knowledge was difficult to determine.  It was not a memory phenomenon.  Such knowledge has arisen due to the reasons discussed below.

    <h4>  His legacy </h4><br>  The legacy left by Lyubishchev can be classified as follows: work on the systematics of earthen fleas, history of science, agriculture, genetics, plant protection, philosophy, entomology, zoology, theory of evolution.  He published about seventy scientific papers on the analysis of variance, on the theory of systematics, on entomology. <br>  Do you think that such productivity looks mysterious?  If not, maybe you have something to show similar in scale?  Throughout his life, until the very end (and he died at the age of 82), his performance only increased.  The question is how he achieved this.  It is the answer to this question that is a discovery that exists independently of all his other works and studies. <br>  He had no students, like the great Einstein and Lomonosov, but there were many admirers, supporters and admirers.  He did not teach, he learned how to live. <br><br><h4>  System </h4><br>  The principle of the system was extremely simple - to keep a detailed record of time, whether it was spent on scientific work, reading fiction or recreation, such as communicating with friends. <br>  Launching the system at the age of 26 and using it for the rest of his life, Lyubishchev seemed to start a countdown clock inside himself.  Not only did he more than anyone else realize the importance and value of every hour of human life, but also learned to feel time as something material.  Even the children of the professor later told the author of the book, in the person of D. Granin, how they came into the study to his father with a question, answering which the professor, without even noticing it, put notes on the beginning and end of the conversation in his diary.  He did it even without looking at his watch!  As if time has become something tangible for him! <br>  He could never just <i>‚Äúkill time</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  It has always been a time of knowledge, a time of creation, a time of enjoying life.  Getting to know Lyubishchev, you can‚Äôt agree with the usual statement that <i>‚Äúlife is short‚Äù</i> , because you can have so much time in it: you can earn a lot of money, travel, see a lot, hear, read, raise and raise children. <br><br><h5>  Daily entries </h5><br>  Daily diary entries were maximally compressed.  Here is a real example of one of the days of life: <br><br>  ‚ÄúSosnogorsk.  0.5  Basics  Scientific  (bibliography - 15 m. Dobrzhansky - 1 h. 15 m.).  Systematic  entomology, excursion - 2 h. 30 m., installation of two traps - 20 m., debriefing - 1 h. 55 m. Rest, swam for the first time in Ukhta.  Known  20 m. Med.  gas.  - 15 m. Hoffman ‚ÄúThe Golden Pot‚Äù - 1 h. 30 m. Letter to Andron - 15 m. <br>  Only 6 h. 15 m. ". <br><br>  Traced all day, until reading newspapers.  Observed introduced by the professor for the convenience of abbreviations, like ‚ÄúDOS.  Scientific. ‚Äù- the main scientific work.  At the end of the month diaries flowed into reports. <br><br><h5>  Monthly reports </h5><br>  Monthly reports contained the total time spent on various areas of its activities. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe main scientific work is 59 h. 45 m. <br>  Systematic  entomology - 20 h. 55 m. <br>  Additional  Works - 50 h. 25 m. <br>  Org.  work - 5 h. 40 m. <br>  Total 136 h. 45 m. " <br><br>  Each item has a more detailed time decoding.  The main scientific work and 59 h. 45 m. What were they spent on?  Again all the transcripts were lower in the report: <br><br>  "one.  For taxa - a sketch of the report ‚ÄúSystem Logic‚Äù - 6 h. 25 m <br>  2. Miscellaneous - 1 h. 30 m. <br>  3. Progress "Dadonologii" - 30 m. <br>  4. Mathematics - 16 h. 40 m. <br>  5. Current literature: Lyapunov - 55 m. <br>  6. Biology - 12 h. <br>  7. Scientific letters - 11 h. 55 m. <br>  8. Scientific notes - 3 h. 25 m. <br>  9. Bibliography - 6 h. 55 m. <br>  Total 59 hours 45 m. " <br><br>  And even on some of these points, such as ‚ÄúBiology‚Äù could be given in the form of: <br><br>  "one.  Dobrzhansky Meinkkind Evolving.  372 p., Finished reading (Total 16 h. 55 m.) - 6 h. 45 m. <br>  2. Anos Karay ‚ÄúDo animals think?‚Äù, 91 pp. - 2 h. <br>  3. Manuscript R. Berg - 2 h. 00 m. <br>  4. Nekoro Z., Osperdo ... 17 p. - 40 m. <br>  5. Ratner's manuscript - 35 m. <br>  Total 12 am. <br><br>  Although such details seem superfluous, the system needed to know all the active time.  There is no useless time.  All the time is equally expensive.  Every hour counts towards life and they are all equal. <br>  Next month‚Äôs plan is based on lessons learned from previous reports.  Example: I plan to read a fiction book next month, and I know from previous reports that I read on average 20 pages of fiction per hour.  The value of the speed of reading technical literature or in a foreign language will be different, but obtained in a similar way. <br><br><h5>  Annual report </h5><br>  The annual report, as it were, sums up.  Summarizes hours spent on all categories of activities, even such as communication, movement and household chores.  Having reports from previous years, it makes it possible to compare and analyze the delta in all categories, to consider it when planning next year. <br>  At times he sent reports to friends.  They were called ‚Äúannual messages‚Äù.  Of course, it was just a sample of what has been done and what is working on. <br><br><h4>  Why is all this necessary? </h4><br>  And by this time, probably, someone has matured the question: who needs all this reporting in writing, to whom should I report?  The answer is simple - in front of himself.  This is an elementary self-attention, an interest in oneself.  So, in one of the annual reports of Lyubishchev in the group ‚ÄúEntertainment‚Äù the figure 65 appeared. ‚ÄúEntertainment - 65 times‚Äù.  But what kind of information can give us with you?  Can we appreciate this much or little when we have nothing to compare with?  Even an approximate figure in relation to itself is difficult to name.  It turns out that we do not know much about ourselves.  Over the years, have we been reading more, how much time is spent on a particular activity, how our productivity and interests change every year?  The author of the documentary story ‚ÄúThis Strange Life‚Äù, Daniel Granin, is convinced that Time is the wealth of the people like forests and lakes, and it should be used wisely, not ruined.  The author suggests that, sooner or later, children will be taught ‚Äútime-using‚Äù at school; from childhood, they will cultivate a love of time as nature.  And it is difficult to disagree with these statements. <br><br><h4>  In conclusion </h4><br>  Of course, the Amateur system is not a ready-made universal tool.  She did not plan to be such.  For years he honed her for himself, selecting a comfortable and, at the same time, necessary level of detailing of diaries and reports, convenient alternation of activities necessary for him to work efficiently in the amount of sleep.  But at the same time, his system is not one of the next creations of the time management theorists based on loud motivating sayings.  He simply believed in the value of each hour of his life and faithfully followed the goals set by him. <br><br>  <b>Ps</b> If I, using a brief summary, managed to convey to you the main idea and make the trigger of responsibility for your time switch to the ‚ÄúOn‚Äù position, then my main task was successfully completed, and you will be able to achieve something more in your life, be it unnecessary reading books, learning a foreign language or just achieving a goal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132894/</a></p>
