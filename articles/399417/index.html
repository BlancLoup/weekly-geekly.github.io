I almost wrote a post about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282936/">Black Friday</a> , but noticed in time that you were already tired of this bacchanalia without us.  Therefore, in this publication we decided to tell about some new interesting pieces from Xiaomi, about which you might not even know (or postponed their purchase for later). <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/283026/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec0/e40/b25/ec0e40b25c1b8e278e3d203b512a361a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  This company has turned the entire technological world upside down in just four years - the Xiaomi brand was registered ... only in 2010!  For comparison - Apple was founded in 1976, and Samsung - already in 1938.  The company, whose name literally translates as ‚Äúgrain of rice‚Äù, is now one of the largest players in the global smartphone market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Co-founder and CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun worked at Kingston Technology for 8 years and, having gained the necessary experience and knowledge, he decided to act, all the more so in 2010 Google announced its possible withdrawal from the Chinese market.  Therefore, in the same year, Xiaomi releases the first version of the mobile operating system MIUI.  The name "I - you - I" was not chosen by chance: the OS was easy to use, convenient and, most importantly, it worked stably.

Users were able to see the Mi One smartphone live only in the summer of 2011 - it was running Android with the proprietary MIUI shell.  1 GB of RAM, 4 GB of built-in battery of almost 2,000 mAh - by those measures, the characteristics were quite good.  Exactly one year later, the company introduced the Mi Two: here the RAM was increased to 2 GB, flash memory to 16 GB, a version with a battery of 3,000 mAh appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a82/25c/e81/a8225ce81da2c0d629bec61445eee6c1.jpg"><br><br>  Even then, devices found many satisfied customers, only Mi Two, Xiaomi, sold 2 million units for 2 years.  The founders of the company clearly caught their own wave and began to produce every year on a new smartphone - Mi3, Mi4 and so on.  Of course, Xiaomi smartphones were not limited to only smartphones.  There was MiPad, Mi Box, and many other devices, including smart home systems and humidifiers.  Now the company is multi-disciplinary and produces a whole bunch of different devices, including the latest ‚Äúpeep‚Äù of fashion - hoverboards and drones. <br><br>  Xiaomi and this fall never ceases to please us with new products - first, the company introduced Mi5s ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282764/">reviewed at Geektimes</a> ) and Mi5s Plus (in this regard, the past generation Mi5 can be snatched <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_365119.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">at a good price of $ 259</a> ), then updated Mi Note 2, and after that broke into the frameless smartphone segment with the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282114/">Mi Mix smartphone</a> .  But most of all, Xiaomi was surprised in July when it announced the appearance of Mi Notebook Air ultrabooks with a screen diagonal of 12.5 ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/281004/">reviewed on Geektimes</a> ) and 13.3 inches - both laptops are now sold on Gearbest at very good black market prices - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laptops/pp_425390.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">$ 499</a> (don't forget the coupon <b>xiaomiair12</b> ) and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laptops/pp_421980.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">809 dollars</a> respectively.  It would seem that this year the company did not just fulfill the plan, it exceeded it, and a year in advance. <br><br>  However, the Chinese do not stop there.  While we haven‚Äôt seen a monoblock from Xiaomi, the company is trying to capture the accessories market - recently introduced a mechanical keyboard with an aluminum housing and a wireless mouse.  Both devices turned out stylish and interesting: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a99/b2a/e15/a99b2ae159d523edab933b06f010cba4.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Xiaomi Wyatt Meter - what should we do 50 million clicks? </h2><br>  At this time, Xiaomi did not go on its usual path "in the style of Apple."  Yes, the keyboard is white.  Yes, it is aluminum.  But externally, the keyboard MK01 is not at all like the same Magic Keyboard: the keys are convex and angled, moreover, it has folding legs that allow you to set the angle of inclination about 6 degrees. <br><br>  The keyboard has a shortened layout with 87 mechanical keys - they are made of polycarbonate, and covered with a pleasant-to-the-touch white ABS plastic.  A distinctive feature - the buttons are replaceable, you can replace them or change the location, if you suddenly want the A key to be in the middle of the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84b/446/652/84b446652fd7e2072af62df951298f59.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/376/2c8/69b/3762c869b85b0a55ea952aeea59399d8.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the keys are located LEDs type 3528, which provide six levels of illumination and can shine in either white or orange.  Why white is understandable (this is a classic), and the use of orange is probably a reference to the Xiaomi corporate identity, which has been repeatedly noted in its use.  The presence of illumination will be appreciated by those who like to work at night, as well as gamers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e24/e4c/6eb/e24e4c6eb0051d0fd220029497b0d725.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of gamers.  The MK01 uses special switches TTC Red Switches, which, according to the manufacturer, are designed for 50 million clicks.  The polling frequency is 1000 Hz, so the response time is approximately 1 ms.  Even if the user simultaneously presses 11 keys, the keyboard will be able to correctly process his request.  Commands are processed using the STMicroelectronics 32-bit microprocessor with ARM architecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ac/acd/5d6/3acacd5d600f81fcef8e424099e8aa7e.jpg"><br><br>  Aluminum is used as the body material - in this case, H32 alloy, which is characterized by increased endurance and long service life.  Since Xiaomi seriously focused on ergonomics, they abandoned the additional digital block of keys - this made it possible to make the keyboard compact while maintaining functionality. <br><br>  The dimensions of the device are 358x128x31.6 mm, weight - 940 g. However, the weight here is not so important, it is unlikely that you will often rearrange the keyboard from place to place.  Xiaomi separately notes a special coating of keys that prevents the abrasion of characters. <br><br>  This miracle is connected to a desktop computer or laptop (for those who feel sorry for the keys of their ‚Äúbaby‚Äù) using a micro USB cable ‚Äî USB.  Yes, it was possible to make the keyboard wireless, but on the other hand, the interface used is universal.  The micro-USB cable is always at hand, you probably have a few lying around the house doing nothing. <br><br>  Xiaomi clearly made the main sight for convenience and ergonomics, obviously, many people will like the keyboard.  Despite the fact that the keyboard was presented not so long ago, it is already <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/keyboards/pp_495111.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">in our warehouse</a> , also with a discount on the <b>XiaoMikey</b> coupon. <br><br><h2>  Xiaomi Mouse - bold and interesting </h2><br>  Following the keyboard, it would be logical to imagine a mouse - in fact, this is how Xiaomi decided to announce the Xiaomi Mouse.  The accessory seems to be quite ordinary, however, and here the company managed to make it with a twist.  Although there is a certain similarity with Apple's Magic Mouse, in fact they are completely different. <br><br>  First, Xiaomi said goodbye to plastic - here we are met by a case of anodized aluminum, resistant to scratches.  For a device like a mouse, this is especially true, because we use it most often.  Scratching nails will not work - already good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/153/895/967/153895967fb2dc0dd6fb6f9ad272299b.jpg"><br><br>  The ring-shaped area hides the right and left buttons, the scroll wheel is located in the center.  The size of the mouse is comfortable - as they say, what you need: 110.2 √ó 57.2 √ó 23.6 mm, and it weighs only 77.5 g (with batteries).  Xiaomi Mouse wireless, supports Bluetooth 4.1 technology and communication in the 2.4 GHz band with a range of up to 10 meters. <br><br>  The mouse works from two AAA batteries.  To replace them, just enough to turn the battery compartment cover.  Above it is the sensor and the power switch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f2/548/31a/0f254831ac2615e628d0504a43054785.jpg"><br><br>  A distinctive feature was the high-precision optical sensor with a resolution of 1200 dpi.  The company notes that it works with an accuracy of 95%, not only on a regular table (in greenhouse conditions), but also on paper, frosted glass, even on cloth.  In addition, Xiaomi Mouse can work simultaneously with two computers and supports both computers on Windows and Mac. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28e/51d/af0/28e51daf00d9ba96f9de116cea103a1c.jpg"><br><br>  It would seem that you can improve in a conventional mouse, what technologies should it be equipped with?  Xiaomi definitely squeezed everything to the maximum, making, as in the case of the keyboard, focus on ergonomics.  And I didn‚Äôt forget about the price, which with the <b>XiaoMiMou</b> coupon on Gearbest will become even more attractive - <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/mouse/pp_566739.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">only 19 dollars</a> . <br><br>  By the way, Xiaomi does not hide the fact that when creating a mouse, they were primarily focused on the buyers of their Mi Notebook Air notebooks.  It‚Äôs hard to argue that the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laptops/pp_421980.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">13.3-inch version of the screen</a> fits perfectly: aluminum is cool with the all-metal case, which hides 8 GB of RAM, 256 GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce 940 MX discrete graphics and almost 10 hours of battery life.  On Black Friday, it will still be available at a price of 809.99 dollars.  Unlocked even with the help of <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_362705.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Mi Band 2</a> (the low price is only in a state of emergency) when the user approaches a laptop with a fitness tracker on the wrist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c71/ca4/022/c71ca40220eea5ea5263e65184b7187b.jpg"><br><br>  Xiaomi is perhaps the only company whose list of new products this year barely fits on a piece of paper.  Therefore, in an emergency, we offer many of its devices at low prices.  Among them is the Xiaomi Yi 2 4K action camera, which can be called a worthy competitor to GoPro HERO 4. Its review <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/280174/">has already been on our blog</a> , and with the coupon YIBL5 you can <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/top-brands/yi/91.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">buy it for $ 202</a> .  The action will last until 12:00 on Saturday, so there is not much time to think. <br><br><h2>  Walk, so full </h2><br>  You cannot escape from Black Friday, so here are some more interesting offers with good discounts: for example, a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/robot-vacuum/pp_440546.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum</a> robot vacuum cleaner for $ 339 on the <b>XIAOMIVAC</b> promo code or a 1080p <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters/pp_363300.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">drone Mi Drone HD</a> with a camera?  With a price of 456 dollars something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f7/708/bea/2f7708bea08b59a92608db378ac61487.jpg"><br><br>  Well, according to the tradition, the heading of cool goods up to 10 dollars is <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/backpacks/pp_415598.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">a Xiaomi backpack</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_252757.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">woolen gloves</a> (enter the XIAOMITG promo code when ordering and be very surprised), and if you add a couple of bucks, take the new virtual reality helmet <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/vr-headset/pp_424846.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi VR</a> .  In general, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/282936/">Black Friday is</a> not rubber, and you understand what to do. <br><br>  Have a good weekend! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399417/</a></p>
