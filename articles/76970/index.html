The era of capitalism, which came in the early nineties, brought its lessons and their masters.  There are few talented specialists.  There are a lot of ideas in this environment, but what have you personally as a specialist been able to bring to life?  Think about the profession.  You bring people the first impression about goods or services, the first opinion should at least please, but since you can‚Äôt please everyone, it should evoke at least some emotions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Talking with one of the SPECIALISTS (graduated :)), we once discussed the latest advertising alpha, about aaaaaa ..., and so this specialist with the mouth of the mouth argued that this is unprofessional and sucks.  However, living in the third capital, I can say that it was even discussed in public transport. <br><br>  Why engage in the development of a media plan for an enterprise, if there is no core, the very component from which everything is twisted?  Who are you who comes up with sucks ?!  Why spend people's money on modules in magazines? <br><br>  Let's look at an example: here is a regular magazine in Yekaterinburg - full color and gloss (I will not give names), people recently placed a page module there for 30,000 rubles!  The question is why?  The circulation of the magazine is 5000 pieces / month, the page is in the middle of the magazine, by simple arithmetic calculations we arrive at a cost of 6 rubles for one advertising contact, at the very best if the whole circulation is bought.  Then you should subtract, the percentage of not sold out magazines, still take away the contacts that stupidly do not reach the middle of the magazine (simply because they did not like the first article).  Why are you doing this people ?? <br><br>  Everyone understands that everyone wants to live and sell their product, but those who distribute such advertising, in my opinion, simply throw their advertising budgets in the trash, and those who make it are amateurs. <br><br>  So, in the spring of 2007, a large shopping center was opened in Yekaterinburg, and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãadvertising on a helicopter was invented and implemented.  The specifics of the development of the city allowed the helicopter to fly over the very center of the city, we chose time intervals, mainly in the evening, when there was the largest congestion of vehicles and ‚Äúreturnees‚Äù home.  The helicopter with the cheapest ‚Äúself-adhesive‚Äù and logo flew over Plotinka (this is the most popular part of the city among residents), I can tell you this is so insanely expensive!  But better than throwing money away.  It was a sensation, people took pictures and called that a helicopter hung in the center and what was written on it.  Such advertising is worth the money.  The action lasted for four days, of course, the customer sucked a lot of money, but the whole city discussed it. <br><br>  They did everything themselves, together with UVK.  Themselves glued the film on the riveted metal, and used improvised means. <br><br>  PS: Give people a holiday and a sensation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76970/</a></p>
