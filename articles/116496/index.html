So it is, but coding can not exist in a vacuum - without managers and clients.  We talked about the work of the account in the web-studio with <a href="http://rubey.ru/">Anna Ruby</a> , the head of the department for work with clients of the web-studio Webbys.ru (Ivanovo). <br><br>  <b>- Anya, hello, thank you for agreeing to talk with us!</b>  <b>What is your job?</b> <b><br></b>  - I am engaged in attracting customers, working with them in all areas, and also trying to do everything possible so that they are satisfied with the quality of services provided.  I think this is the most important and correct, as well as natural in conditions of such competition as it is now! <br><br>  <b>- Tell me about the competition in more detail!</b> <b><br></b>  - The market today is multifaceted, on the one hand, there is a large amount of work, but many customers are not ready yet ... Despite the fact that the Internet has ceased to be strange and strange, it remains at the level of small and medium-sized cities.  From the point of view of web studios, the orders market, for example, in Ivanovo, is not ready for major serious development, promotion of SMO, business plans and in general any structured work.  He froze in the state of business cards and online stores, and - sadly - this is the situation in many small cities.  From the point of view of customers there is no understanding of the cost of development, its needs and in general, "what is it"?  I'm not talking about promotion!  In addition to contextual advertising and SEO, customers do not perceive anything.  We are left far behind in terms of development with Moscow.

      <b>- With corruption, how are things going with you?</b> <b><a name="habracut"></a></b>  <b>Any "suggestions" come?</b> <b><br></b>  - There are indecent offers, but in my practice there are not many.  We can immediately say that the amounts for services in the regions are much lower, and the studios try not to accept such offers!  Reputation is easy to spoil; it is much more difficult to restore it. <br><br>  <b>- You work with clients more: tell me, do you have any work standards?</b>  <b>Say, first fill out the brief, then hold a meeting, then develop a technical assignment?</b> <b><br></b>  - My work has developed in a certain way based on personal experience.  Initially, I prefer to meet, because  the customer does not always understand what he needs.  Further, independently or with my help, the brief is filled, then the technical task, it is always discussed what the customer will see as a result of the work, exactly where that moment can be said ‚Äúready‚Äù. <br><br>  The customer is constantly aware of what is happening with the project and if he does not understand something, then you can spend the extra 2-3 hours to tell or explain everything.  This will further add confidence to the customer in the correct choice of the artist.  It is not necessary to conduct large-scale training, it is enough just to tell the basics and help find the information of interest.  As a rule, with this approach, customers rely on such employees or recommend them to friends. <br><br>  But if this is not the rule of the entire company, but of only one manager, then customers will associate the result and work with a particular person, and not a developer company. <br><br>  <b>- Do you have standard technical documentation?</b>  <b>For example, brief, technical task, contract?</b>  <b>Or do you work with each client individually?</b> <b><br></b>  - Of course, certain standards were developed during the work.  Of course, they have not been accepted by anyone, but in our country there is no reason to talk about standardization in the field of IT.  Such documentation as a brief is already an established standard, at least for me.  The contract has the standard backbone, but each time when working with the lawyers of the customer acquires individuality.  As for project documentation, it also has certain standards, although a part will always remain individual for each project. <br><br>  I want to note that there are standards for writing technical specifications (GOST 19, 34), but few use them, because  they have long been outdated.  They were written in the early 90s, and this is too long for a dynamically developing industry. <br><br>  <b>- Anya, tell me, does it happen that clients from other agencies come to you?</b>  <b>Is it easy to work with them?</b>  <b>Would it be easier if there were some uniform market standards of service or not?</b> <b><br></b> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/webprofessionals/view/276757/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/286/257/fdf/286257fdf26426cd845a53f4ff37a4a2.jpg" width="281" height="500" title="Habr.jpg" alt="Habr.jpg" align="right"></a>  - Yes, of course, there are such clients!  It is definitely easier to work.  People who understand what they need, who are aware of pricing and stages of work - this is always a big plus. <br><br>  Difficulties cause only those moments when the question arises, why do you have a different job.  There is a lack of some generally accepted norms and rules, now everyone does what he wants and because he considers it right.  Clients at such moments are confused and do not know what to believe. <br><br>  As for web studios, few could have done a project on someone else's technical task.  Some would certainly be recycled.  And this one wants to avoid, so that the client is not tied to a specific developer, and at any time could receive a service or product where conditions are more suitable for him. <br><br>  <b>- We recently conducted a study with RAEC.</b>  <b>They polled 2,000 specialists in the web development market.</b>  <b>The result is such an infographic.</b>  <b>Can you comment on it somehow?</b> <br>  - I agree with everything that is presented, but with one reservation!  I believe that the most dishonest tenders and a greater number of kickbacks are present in the field of development for the state sector, and not business. <br><br>  <b>- Anya, is your wish in one phrase for the whole web development market?</b> <b><br></b>  - Improve the quality of services and resources produced.  Correctly communicate with all customers and make every effort to develop norms, standards and laws in the IT-sphere.  According to the laws, the question is especially acute, I wrote a post on this topic <a href="http://rubey.ru/%3Fp%3D354">on my blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116496/</a></p>
