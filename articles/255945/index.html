He summarized the results of the mapping of the main motor and sensory areas of the cortex and for the first time accurately mapped the cortical areas related to speech.  Using the method of electrical stimulation of individual parts of the brain, Penfield determined the exact representation in the cerebral cortex of various muscles and organs of the human body.  It is schematically depicted as a ‚Äúhomunculus‚Äù (little man), whose parts of the body are proportional to the areas of the brain in which they are represented.  Therefore, the fingers, lips, and tongue with a large number of nerve endings are depicted larger than the body and legs. <br><br>  <b>1950s</b> : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%25C3%25A9_Manuel_Rodriguez_Delgado">Jos√© Manuel Rodriguez Delgado</a> , professor of physiology at Yale University, invented "Stimoceiver" - a scientist developed a radio-powered stereosiver with the size of a fifty-fifty-cent coin that could be implanted entirely and controlled via the FM radio channel <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/056/ba6/f45/056ba6f451964101b32d2969223f39d9.jpg"><br><br>  The most spectacular experiment Delgado was conducted in 1963 at a ranch in the province of Cordoba, Spain.

The animal was implanted with a stereosiver programmed to receive distinct signals, called spindles, that spontaneously arise in the amygdala.  As soon as the device picked up the spindle, it stimulated the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe central gray matter in Paddy's brain, causing an ‚Äúobverse‚Äù reaction, that is, a painful or unpleasant sensation.  After two hours of such exposure, the monkey's tonsil gave out 50% fewer spindles, in six days the frequency of their occurrence fell by 99%.  This is not to say that Paddy benefited: she became ‚Äúcalmer, less attentive and less motivated when testing her behavior,‚Äù Delgado wrote.  However, he suggested that such a technique of " <b>automated learning</b> " could be used to suppress epileptic seizures, panic attacks, or in the treatment of other diseases accompanied by the appearance of characteristic signals in the brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/290/b14/890/290b14890acd6c6b8b2f1d31ac96eb70.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The female macaque (the leftmost one in the first photo) quickly realized that with the help of a lever one can calm one's neighbor in the cage, the cocky dominant male.

To do this, you just need to attach a pressure sensor to its tail and give food when the pressure exceeds a certain value.

Rhythm is associated with calmness in the body, a willingness to perform motor actions, with increased concentration of attention to the outside world, and improved memory performance. <br><br>  The first experiments were conducted on cats.  Cats were trained to increase the amplitude of brain waves in the range of 12-15 Hz.  Later, the scientist received an NASA order to study the effects of the rocket oxidizer toxin (hydrazine) on animals.  In a group of 50 cats, ten trained on the SMR amplitude.  To his surprise, cats with increased SMR showed toxin resistance.  Cats with normal SMR levels died from exposure to the substance. <br><br>  In the 70s, Sterman offered to train SMR to treat epilepsy.  His employee Margaret (Margarte Fairbanks), suffered from epilepsy attacks, because of which she could not get a driver's license.  She decided to try out early trainings only on animals.  Of course, not immediately, but the symptoms of the disease began to recede.  When the course has been completed.  She got a driver's license.  Subsequently, other scientists also received positive results.

Each phosphene in a cluster perceives a region with a diameter of a pencil located at arm's length.

After a series of tests, the experiment participants completed seven different mental tasks with the device.  The simplest actions, such as focusing on breathing or on some thought, for ten seconds, helped easily carry out successful authentication in a computer system.  The main thing here is to find a task that would not strain users so that they can perform it several times a day.

The principle of their operation resembles the practice of using radio frequency identification (RFID) chips that do not require an integrated power source. <br><br>  According to the authors, the particles of neuropyles circulate freely in the bloodstream.  Practically, this is difficult to achieve due to the complex composition of the blood, the biological mechanisms of its purification and the structure of the endothelium, but imagine for a moment that these problems have been solved.  Then the simultaneous number of microsensors in the vessels of the brain at any given time can amount to thousands. <br><br>  Each of these ‚Äúsmart particles‚Äù will be able to measure the electrical activity of nearby neurons.  During the first phase, the piezoelectric crystal converts the ultrasonic waves from the intermediate module into electrical signals and feeds the CMOS circuit.  During the second, it acts the opposite - it vibrates under the influence of the action potentials of the nearest group of neurons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e2/79b/82b/9e279b82b4a98fa9cc59d93527527a08.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Piezoelectric effect in the particle "neyropoly"</i> <br><br>  Compared to RFID, the proposed scheme has at least two important differences.  In addition to electromagnetic waves (external level), ultrasound (internal level) is used, and an intermediate module provides amplification of the response signal of microsensors, its conversion and further transmission. <br>  The latter is located under the dura mater and acts as a transceiver, allowing you to avoid strong attenuation of ultrasound and overcome the shielding effect of the bones of the skull. <br><br>  As applied to the brain-computer interfaces in the first approximation, this is equivalent to increasing the accuracy of determining a mental command tenfold. <br>  More on <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/75536/neural-dust/">Computerra</a> or <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.2196v1.pdf">article</a> <br><br>  <b>Flexible smart "tattoo"</b> <br>  For the first time, scientists from the University of California at San Diego presented this invention to the world in 2011. <br>  Components are located on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã1x2 cm.
