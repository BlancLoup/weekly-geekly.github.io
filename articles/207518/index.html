  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Very small screen from a very old PDA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In a technical society, there is a subclass of people who cannot live without the creation, redoing, and improvement of various kinds of devices.  Virtually any device by its existence makes a call to such people who will surely disassemble it, study it and, if they are lucky, they will hack it or improve it.  It is difficult for such people to throw away a device that has outlived its life but is still working, because you can use it somewhere else.  So old monitors, system units, printers, and even the abyss of everything reincarnate and continue to live another life, though not as significant as before.  People create, and to the overflowing dumps from it at least a little bit, but it is easier - and this is wonderful!  I am such a person, and for me ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible to just take it‚Äù and throw away a block or device.  Once again, going through the boxes with junk had to think long over the next part before throwing it into the garbage can, but this rarely happened. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Remember, a couple of years ago, every geek dreamed of a PDA, as now every schoolboy on a tablet?  The era of the PDA has already passed, with its QVGA (VGA for the rich lucky ones) and Windows Mobile.  For most, these symbols do not say anything, but almost everyone knows what HD (Retina is for the lucky rich) and android.  But those who understand what I nostalgic a bit about those times will agree that the ‚Äúpocket personal computer‚Äù sounds more pleasant and warmer than just the ‚Äútablet‚Äù.  Sorry - a little distracted.  So, during the routine cleaning of the nightstands, I came across a box in which the insides of the old PDA were quietly growing old.  It was a battery, a board and a screen (and it was disassembled, without a reflective layer and touch glass !!!).  It was necessary to urgently decide: to throw it away or throw it away ... But that familiar state of the brain did not allow to do either.  For two days and three nights I was thinking where to build it and how to reanimate.  I made my life easier for the Internet (well, as always, however ...), with a program (Innobec SideWindow) that turns a PDA connected to a computer into a monitor, even if it's a small monitor that could hold some kind of widget.  The benefits are of course minimal, but why not use the left eye, and sometimes look at how the downloads go, what the network card does, or how many visitors are on my site right now? <br><br>  It remains to collect the remnants of the device, run it using a touch screen from another PDA (oh and it was during calibration), and connected to the computer.  There was no case, so I had to shove it into the case from a Chinese tester.  Here's what came of it: <br>  1 - insides: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df5/3cc/204/df53cc2046f7ad94720d7ecca6e60f3e.jpg"><br>  2 - they work! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/108/ce2/f38/108ce2f38c10249cc546efc4a92a57ae.jpg"><br>  3 - junk in junk: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50c/73d/c95/50c73dc9572f6382c03dbef0a3c2c936.jpg"><br>  4 - blue screen of life: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/82d/d18/48c82dd18992ded60bd90c3713218549.jpg"><br>  5 - browser window in the WM window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1f/827/8e5/d1f8278e52d315a1d2132f1c0be8ad40.jpg"><br>  It is unlikely that my material will be useful to someone now, just want to show you what people sometimes do, good mood! <br>  KM (short manual): Install <a href="http://www.hpc.ru/soft/download.phtml%3Fid%3D11880">Innobec SideWindow</a> on your computer (unfortunately for winXP only), you also need ActiveSync (3.7) to synchronize with WM.  There is no need to install anything on the PDA, just connect it via USB (via cradle) to the computer and enjoy ... or do not enjoy. <br>  PS: by the way, this device adds a bit of techno-coolness, causing questions and bewilderment of incoming friends. </div>
