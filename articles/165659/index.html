      If you have not read the previous article, then please take a few minutes to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164623/">procrastination.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164623/">Symbolic reward system.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/164623/">Part 1</a> <br><br>  This is a must if you want to start a "treatment". <br><br><h4>  New tasks </h4><br>  We agreed that we would do small, simple tasks for a certain time, during which time they should have entered the comfort zone.  Now you have to add one new task, it should be a little more difficult, but it is aimed at development.  That is, you choose the business that you want to perform and consider it useful.  It can be both physical exercises and learning a programming language.  It is clear that if you are studying, then it is desirable to develop it in your specialty, to raise the skill.  But only if you are interested and it should be one thing, so choose carefully. <br><br>  I hope you have decided, now we will discuss some points, if these are physical exercises, then everything is simple and there shouldn't be any difficulties, problems start when the brain is required to do the work.  The fact is that we will paint because of a lack of information, from what is not quite clear how to do.  You could have little experience or not at all, but it is the fear of uncertainty that makes us put things off until later, this is how our brain works. <br><br><h4>  Plan </h4><br>  But you can easily cope with this problem, it‚Äôs enough to make a detailed plan.  Thus, each relatively difficult matter will begin with a zero point - with the preparation of a plan for its implementation.  Many people think that additional actions will complicate the work.  In fact, it is much easier to write an instruction for yourself and proceed to the first paragraph than to start an unclear matter without preparation.  In order to write an instruction for ourselves, we have all the possibilities: the Internet, books, more experienced people.  But there is one moment, always try to get the necessary information yourself, collect and systematize as much as possible, do not forget to record, this will help to keep information in your head for a certain time.  Do not contact the experts if you are not looking for information yourself. <br><br>  Do not forget to mark the completion of each step in the CER form, the completion of most of these small steps is also worth noting a more significant symbol. <br><br><h4>  Internal resistance </h4><br>  This phenomenon haunts us throughout our journey, but here it rises more acutely.  When a person meets the first obstacles, his motivation sharply disappears and he gives up his job.  To bypass it at this stage, it is necessary to consider the following points about which I have already written. <br><br><ul><li>  Do not choose a very difficult thing </li><li>  Choose what you really want </li></ul><br>  It is worth mentioning a certain approach, rational-emotional-behavioral therapy, abbreviated REPT.  According to it, the main cause of mental disorders is erroneous, irrational mental attitudes, and not the past experience of the individual.  It is worthwhile for self-development to read foreign literature on this topic, below there are names, because in the Russian-speaking segment of the network the information is incorrect and some is completely absent.  The fact is that the loss of motivation is associated with irrational beliefs, of which we have a lot.  In this case, it is: ‚ÄúI <i>have</i> to do perfectly,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have <i>to</i> succeed,‚Äù ‚ÄúI <i>have</i> to cope.‚Äù  And when a person fails something, it causes a storm of negative emotions.  In truth, negative emotions will always be there, but when they interfere with something in REPT they are called irrational.  To make negative emotions less pronounced, in the REPT they change their beliefs.  Instead of ‚Äúshould‚Äù - ‚ÄúI would like‚Äù, that is, the requirements for self are reduced and failure will cause less emotion.  As a result, your message should be something like this: ‚ÄúI <i>would like to</i> do something perfectly, but if it doesn‚Äôt work out, then everything is fine, this is normal,‚Äù this is an adequate belief that the stress of failure will be expected and less painful.  You <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> write out all your irrational beliefs and change them to rational ones. <br><br><h4>  Partner </h4><br>  Returning to the topic, I would like to say about such a thing that can bring additional motivation.  The point is that you are looking for someone to whom you can talk about your goals and achievements.  But, to find a person who will really be interested in your achievements and who occasionally will be interested in them, is very difficult.  You can of course cooperate with those who develop a certain skill or get together in a group, but this can lead to a breakdown, I will now explain.  The fact is that if such a person starts procrastinating, stops communicating, then a program may be disrupted.  If all the same it happened, then immediately change your partner.  One more thing, you may be convinced that you have to report, and if you have to, it means that it is bad.  Try to eliminate and prevent this. <br><br>  So, you are engaged in one business for about 2-3 weeks, it should already be included in the comfort zone, time to choose a second, not very difficult task for you, according to the principle described above.  All that you did before, you do not stop doing. <br><br>  Yes, if the first lesson does not want to enter the comfort zone, it means for this if the following reasons, it may not be really interesting for you or you do not achieve the success with which you would be satisfied.  If so, then you should not give up, do it for some more time, a week, for example, but do not drop it, combine it with the second case, but spend less time.  Remember if the first lesson is difficult for you, then reduce the pressure and expectations; recycle the instructions; if you‚Äôve lost it because of it, then you shouldn‚Äôt do it at all.  There is a danger in throwing, you will throw all your beginnings and will not advance in anything. <br><br><h4>  Breakdowns </h4><br>  And again about them, at this stage the chance to break even higher.  That they did not occur it is important to carry out everything that I wrote.  But if you could not stand it, the tactic of return should not be much different.  If the disruption has affected all actions, even the most simple ones, then you need to start all over again, but you should wait a little with the lessons of the second stage.  Wait a few days, and then add one lesson at intervals.  It is important to understand exactly what caused the breakdown and not to allow it anymore. <br><br>  You should feel the expansion of the comfort zone, for you all added cases should become the norm, and the internal resistance should decrease significantly.  Only then are you on the right track.  Do not forget, you are not abandoning old habits, you just have to have less time on them, but they brought you pleasure and therefore now they will please you even more. <br><br>  Most importantly, <u><b>do not rush</b></u> , do the daily amount of work, enjoy your business, everything should be measured and accurate, without haste.  <u>Do not forget the CER form!</u> <br><br>  <i>Postscript: Since many have complained about the volume of the first article, I decided to add another part, which will be the last stage and answers to questions.</i>  <i>Separately, I will write a manual on team work on the fight against procrastination and maybe about REPT.</i>  <i>If it will be interesting to anyone here.</i> <br><br>  If you have questions regarding the methodology described in the article, you have something wrong, you do not understand some things, or you have broken, <b>write</b> me in personal messages or account on Google plus.  May the force be with you. <br><br><h4>  Literature </h4><br>  The Practice of Rational-Emotional Behavioral Therapy - Albert Ellis and Windy Dryden. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165659/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165659/</a></p>
