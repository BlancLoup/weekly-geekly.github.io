      This article is written for recruiters who process their resumes from time to time. <br><cut></cut><br><h3>  opening speech </h3><br>  In today's world, everyone really appreciates their time.  Recruiters and employers do not want to spend their time clarifying information and meeting unpromising candidates.  Therefore, if your resume does not ‚Äúhook‚Äù the reader immediately, then most likely you will not get into the selection funnel.  To be able to choose from several employers and get an interesting and well-paid job, it makes sense to consciously and carefully approach the preparation of your resume. <br><br>  A good summary should be: <br><br><ol><li>  Informative. </li><li>  Selling. </li><li>  Memorable. </li></ol><br>  First, the resume should contain enough facts that characterize you as a specialist.  The facts should be presented consistently, clearly and consistently. <br><br>  Secondly, after studying your resume, an employer should understand the benefits of hiring you. <br><br>  Thirdly, the resume should create a unique image, so that the reader‚Äôs memory can cling to something and then push out your positive image in different selection situations.  It will be very good if you manage to put a charisma in your resume. <br><br>  A good resume creates a solid image of an attractive person and specialist with clearly defined competencies that can be immediately evaluated. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lm/93/80/lm9380wetprw4yjvgyr17t2-eq0.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  Next, we take a closer look at the structure of the resume and the introduction of each of these properties into the resume with examples of good and bad practices.  But first, let's talk about the physiological basis of the ‚Äúgood-bad‚Äù system, which works in the brain of every person at an unconscious level. <br><br><h3>  Reptilian brain </h3><br>  Surely you already know that in our brain there is a department responsible for the rapid reactions of the body for the sake of its safety and survival.  This is the so-called "reptile brain."  Such structures are present in most developed animals and even reptiles. <br>  <b>Reptilian brain affects all processes that occur with a person.</b>  He tells us what is interesting and what is not.  What is fun and pleasant, and what is boring.  And we want to think that we are rational and objective beings, but more often we are primitive and rely on the subconscious and emotional - on our intuition and instincts, which we consider to be the result of experience.  Experience, of course, plays a big role, but the reptile brain commands the process.  Moreover, <b>it makes decisions that very often the rational part of the brain does not dispute, but then comes up with logical excuses for the decisions made</b> .  The conclusion from this is that in order to please another person, to cause his interest and sympathy for us, we must like his reptile brain. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/ye/bd/vbyebdakj0gmld75aaal_zsgkok.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  Neurophysiologists and psychologists in the course of many experiments found that the reptile brain is sensitive to the following reasons: <br><br><ol><li>  Selfishness and self-love - when they do not speak about our interests, we are not so interested in reading and listening. </li><li>  Contrast - non-contrast information is less noticeable and interesting. </li><li>  Simplicity - specific, understandable, non-abstract information is perceived more favorably. </li><li>  Visualization - simple images are perceived better than many words and long text. </li><li>  Start and end - after a few seconds of the message, the reptilian brain calms down and is then excited at the end of the message. </li><li>  Emotions - pleasant emotions arising from contact with your message, will bring you the approval of the reader's reptilian brain. </li></ol><br>  Further, when considering good and bad summaries, I will point out some of the motives of the reptilian brain. <br><br><h3>  Summary structure </h3><br>  Usually a resume consists of the following blocks: <br><br><ol><li>  Photo, name, date of birth, place of residence, citizenship </li><li>  Contact Information </li><li>  Desired position and salary </li><li>  key skills </li><li>  Experience - where and when he worked, positions, duties </li><li>  About yourself in free form (hobbies, interests) </li><li>  Education </li><li>  Recommendations </li></ol><br>  Let us analyze the content of these blocks of resume, not forgetting the motives of our reader's reptilian brain - the employer or the recruiter. <br><br><h3>  Photo, name, date of birth, city, citizenship </h3><br>  With the date of birth and citizenship, we most likely will not be able to do anything at the time of writing a resume.  But we can find the right photo.  Your photo in the resume, as well as your avatars in social networks and instant messengers - this is the first visual image that the reptile brain of the employer or recruiter will see and which will be associated with you. <br><br>  If you need a job, please select a photo that matches your chosen position.  I also recommend at the time of job search, put the appropriate avatars in social networks and instant messengers, in which you look like a photo from a resume. <br><br>  <b>Remember the saying - "meet on clothes ..."?</b>  <b>In our time, you are greeted on the avatar.</b> <br><br>  Often there are situations when a person is looking for a new job and does not want the current employer to know about it.  Many people think it is a brilliant idea to publish a resume under an assumed name.  In my opinion, this is a bad practice, because it‚Äôs impossible to hide safely by changing only the name.  You will also have to hide the last job and specify other contact information, for example, your grandmother‚Äôs phone number and e-mail.  This can greatly reduce the attractiveness of you as a candidate. <br><br>  In such a situation, I recommend simply not putting your resume in public access, but looking for interesting vacancies and responding to them yourself by sending your resume to some selected employers. <br><br>  If you are ready to move or consider only remote work, be sure to write about it or tick the appropriate checkboxes on the job search sites.  This will increase the scope of your resume in the site search and increase your chances of being found and invited to the interview. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  Problem # 1 in this summary box is a bad photo.  You can assume that if you and your colleagues in ordinary life look like this, then this is perfectly normal.  <b>However, a recruiter may have a different opinion.</b>  It would be better to still choose a photo that is popular with a wide range of people, for example, your relatives and friends not from IT. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/58/fk/oc/58fkoc6hz2lgca2vzgkbnorcjio.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br>  It may also scare away a large list of cities where you are ready to move.  It gives the impression that you want to run away and you do not care where.  Serious people do not behave this way.  It is better to adapt this element of the resume for a specific job. <br><br>  Often employers when searching for candidates have age restrictions, but nothing can be done about it.  If you are 21 and you have a lot of experience, then just try not to specify the age, but you should not specify a false date of birth. <br><br>  <b>In general, it is not necessary to lie in a resume in such places that are easily checked by other sources.</b>  Now it is easy to collect information about a person from many sources.  First of all it is social networks, there are also other databases available to employers. <br><br><h3>  Desired position and salary </h3><br>  This block is desirable to relate to the conditions of the vacancy with each of your response to a new vacancy.  If the vacancy is ‚ÄúAngular frontend developer‚Äù, and you send your resume to ‚ÄúWeb programmer‚Äù, then you immediately feel that you are not the right person.  If you understand and carefully read your resume, your experience will probably meet the requirements of the vacancy.  Therefore, it is better to designate the desired position at least "Frontend developer". <br><br>  If you can work and are ready to consider proposals for any of several adjacent positions, for example, a frontend, backend or full-stack developer, then you should do 3 resumes, which will be slightly different primarily by the name of the desired post.  Further I will return to this idea. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  In the first place - the discrepancy between the young age of the candidate and claims for high office and salary.  For example, when at 23, a person claims to be a senior-qualified.  Such people are sometimes found, but extremely rare.  More often come across just bouncers. <br>  I also came across the fact that in some regions and countries, developers are somewhat faster attributed to high qualifications.  I heard from an employer from the Volga region that he needs a senior developer, with experience from 2 years.  In most regions of the Russian Federation, the qualifications of the Senior are still spoken after 4-5 years of intensive work in one subject or with a specific programming language. <br><br><h3>  Contact Information </h3><br>  It is advisable to specify all the contacts that are acceptable to you. <br><br>  In addition to e-mail and phone, specify Skype, VK, Facebook, LinkedIn, github, habr, messengers where you can be contacted.  The link to the profile in Odnoklassniki is not necessary for an IT specialist.  A LinkedIn profile with up-to-date information about skills and work experience is useful if you are looking for work not only in the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Keep in mind that if you seriously interest the employer, then you will still be searched in social networks.  This is a mandatory part of the final "checks" before making a proposal to the candidate.  Therefore, facilitating the task of a recruiter, you earn points in karma.  Some recruiters say they love to click on links in a resume. <br><br>  I recommend to ‚Äúclean‚Äù your pages in social networks before looking for new jobs, removing sharp political statements, racist and sexist jokes and other controversial artifacts that may characterize you as an inadequate person.  I have repeatedly received rejections of candidates with relevant skills in resumes due to ‚Äúexpressing views in social networks that do not match our corporate culture.‚Äù  You are a distinctive personality, but there are generally accepted ideas about morality and it is better to at least temporarily get rid of public manifestations of immorality.  Unless, of course, you need a new job. <br><br>  It is advisable to specify links to the portfolio and projects in which you actively participated.  For developers, it is highly desirable to provide links to personal profiles of open repositories - github, bitbacket, so that the employer can look at examples of your code and your area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest. <br><br>  It is understood that a good developer not only works, but also develops, is interested in something, and may even participate in open source projects, write articles, speak at conferences and meetings.  A variety of examples of your code will help avoid the boring test task in the selection and speed up the choice of you. <br><br>  What if you do not have interesting personal projects that should be published?  Many developers publish successfully executed test tasks from other employers in their turnips, especially if they were something remarkable.  This is a good practice.  Instead of checking a sample test, an employer's technical expert may find it more interesting to dig into your projects, come up with tricky questions about your code, and then ask them at an interview. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  In the first place - the unknown.  If, besides the e-mail, there are no other contacts, then at the initial stage of the selection of the recruiter's reptilian brain you will not immediately like it.  Little-known subjects are often unattractive and even dangerous, so it's best to pass by you and remember about you only if there are no other candidates at all. <br><br>  Of course, there are still people in the world who have no accounts in social networks, publications, portfolios and repositories, all their work was strictly classified and there was no time left for a hobby.  But these people are now few, and they look suspicious. <br><br><h3>  key skills </h3><br>  This block summarizes the description of your experience, gives a concise idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat you know and know how.  It is advisable to arrange it before a detailed description of work experience, this will allow the recruiter to quickly understand whether it is worth reading your resume further.  This unit is desirable to adjust to the desired position.  If you can and are ready to do front-end and back-end, then it‚Äôs better to create 3 summaries - a front-end, back-end and full-stack developer, which will differ primarily in the block of key skills and some accents in the experience description - disclose the relevant experience in more detail and describe the rest . <br><br>  For developers and other technical specialists, it is appropriate not only to list the skills and technologies with which you have worked, but also to indicate the total experience in several places of work. <br>  For example: Node.js - 3 years, 10 projects for 2 employers, Angular 2 - 1.5 years, 3 projects at the last place of work. <br><br>  For a front-end developer, designer, layout designer, it will even be appropriate to attach a visual representation of key skills - this will highlight you among the many other candidates.  We remember about the motives of the reptile brain. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  The absence of this block or its inconsistency with the description of work experience can cause confusion and dissonance in the reader.  By stating any skills here, make sure you mention them in the description of your work experience. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ke/yd/fp/keydfp9h4c9wprxdp1mtl7rjjaq.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  Experience - where and when he worked, positions, duties </h3><br>  The role and format of this block have recently become wider.  Instead of a dry listing of dates, places of employment and positions, employers and recruiters want to see the history of your working life.  For each place of work, it is highly desirable to describe what you did there, what benefits you brought to your employer, which projects you participated in, and which parts of the projects you did.  And also what you learned, what conclusions you made for yourself.  It is worth listing the technologies and tools that you used.  The more information, the relevant vacancy, will be in this block, the higher your chances of being invited to an interview.  This block is also appropriate to adapt for each new vacancy.  At least a fragment about your last place of work.  Enumeration of technologies and tools increases the chance to be found in the search in the database of resumes. <br><br>  Experience I recommend to describe in the following order - at the beginning of the most recent job, at the end - the first place of work.  The ‚Äúfreshest‚Äù places of work (one or two) can be given up to half a page, the rest of the places of work can be given less. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  Brevity of information == you have nothing to say about this place of work.  A typical reaction of the reptilian brain to a brief description of the experience is ‚Äúthis is very strange and therefore we will look better than another candidate‚Äù. <br><br>  Very often, employers are interested in the reasons for changing their place of work - why does the candidate leave the previous place of work?  It should be ready to answer this question, but I do not recommend to indicate this in the summary.  The reasons for parting with the employer is a very slippery topic.  And any of your answers can be interpreted negatively.  During the interview, you will have a chance to make an impression before this question is asked and the overall positive impression about you will smooth over almost any reason for changing your place of work. <br><br>  Duration of work less than 3 months looks bad - as if you did not pass the trial period.  Therefore, "look better than another candidate."  If you had an interesting experience at this short place of work - indicate that it was a design work.  If there was nothing especially there - just remove this episode by adding the time period to the previous place of work. <br>  Unpleasant letters ‚ÄúNDA‚Äù instead of describing their experience and the technologies used - this is very strange and causes rejection in the reptilian brain.  I will never believe that a non-disclosure agreement requires you to completely hide the entire content of your work.  And employers do not believe in this either. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/3b/yi/cm3byiqpxxd1masqbmn-zclahfc.jpeg" alt="image"></div><br><h3>  About myself </h3><br>  In this block you are free to write about your principles, hobbies and wishes for a new job. <br><br>  Write what work tasks you prefer, what you are interested in now, what technologies you would like to work with, what you dislike, what additional benefits you can bring to your employer. <br><br>  Also here you can detail your vision of the wage system.  How much do you want to receive at various payment options acceptable for you (with part-time employment, remote work, processing, etc.). <br><br>  Also here you can carefully ‚Äúlick‚Äù the employer, if you really want to work for him, describing your ideal job (dream job) using known information about the employer.  But the main thing is not to overreact. <br><br>  <i>What discourages an employer in this block?</i> <br><br>  Harsh, categorical statements, unconventional views, cynicism, black humor, contradiction with the previous information in the summary. <br><br><h3>  Education </h3><br>  I believe that the Education block, as well as the transfer of certificates of advanced training and passing tests, should be given at the end of the summary.  Some, in my opinion already outdated recommendations, advise writing about education at the beginning of a resume.  I disagree with that. <br><br>  Education - these are facts about you, traditionally enjoying great prestige and trust.  This is a good ending to your story about yourself.  Especially if in this block you have something to tell. <br>  At the beginning of your career, when you still do not have the opportunity to describe your work experience in a detailed and concise manner, certificates of additional education may come to your aid.  This applies to both technical skills and knowledge of foreign languages.  If you do not have certificates, try to get them.  Learn what are the online programs and tests that you could pass, prepare and pass.  Lack of certificates is normal, but their presence is good. <br><br><h3>  Recommendations </h3><br>  If you have the opportunity to attach scans of letters of recommendation and characteristics from previous jobs, you can attach them.  In my experience, certificates of passing training programs and tests in IT are valued more than the opinion of previous employers. <br><br><h3>  Let's sum up </h3><br>  Providing detailed information about ourselves, we flirt with laziness, selfishness and the reader's pride. <br><br>  If you write a resume in easy language, sometimes with humor and self-irony, you will make your resume interesting, charismatic, memorable.  You will cause sympathy and leave a mark on the emotional level of the reader.  In addition, you provide yourself a distinct contrast against the background of other lazy applicants who did not bother to prepare an interesting summary.  At the same time with humor it is worth being careful.  Do not use famous jokes.  Only joke if you are sure that your joke is original and will not offend the reader. <br><br>  By listing in simple language what you worked with and what specifically you did, you give your reader arguments in support of your candidacy before the leadership of the employer - ‚Äúsee how much he knows and can do.‚Äù <br><br>  A nice photo at the beginning and a demonstration of your regalia at the end, together with a convincing experience in the middle of a resume, make your image of an ideal candidate holistic and complete. <br><br>  Comfortable for the reader volume of the summary - 2 pages.  On the first page - photo, full name, desired position and payment, key skills, one or two of the most recently described last jobs.  On the second page - earlier jobs, education, personal projects and interests. <br><br>  Do not forget to test the resume you created for someone of your friends.  Let him read it and ask him to characterize you based on the information from your resume that he remembered.  Use the results of such an experiment to refine your resume and improve your image that appears after reading your resume. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445168/</a></p>
