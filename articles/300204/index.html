      Let's try to understand the examples of those who have already managed to get out of the situation with their heads held high. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúExplosive‚Äù strategy</b> <br><br>  If you force users to interact with your application, you are almost doomed to success.  For example, as in the case of a corrective pencil manufacturing brand. <br><br>  The subject, frankly, specific.  However, there are no boring products - there are only boring marketers.  In the given example, the marketing strategy was won due to virality. <br><br>  A series of brief videos was created around the history of the hunter and the bear.  According to the scenario, initially the hunter was supposed to shoot the suddenly appeared bear.  But he ‚Äúcrosses out‚Äù the word ‚Äúshot‚Äù with a corrective pencil (product demonstration) and invites viewers to interactive.  Users can choose an action that a hunter must perform with a bear - play football, cuddle, etc.  - Thus, there is an active involvement of the target audience. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RcGaTzFV-pw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRv8G3rzcse2DFHHlCQQfc6H2GVw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  What are the results of such an extraordinary decision for a fairly ordinary stationery?  They speak for themselves: <br><br><ul><li>  30% increase in sales </li><li>  over 46 million views on youtube </li><li>  60,000 online resources have written or mentioned videos </li><li>  mentions from celebrity </li></ul><br><br>  What is important when attracting customers in the "boring" category?  That's right, humor. <br><br>  <b>Taboo</b> <br><br>  Everyone uses toilet paper.  It's not a secret.  But how often do consumers think about its brand?  That's the problem for manufacturers.  How to draw attention to the product, which is included in the category of everyday use, talk about which in a decent society is not always correct? <br><br>  Charmin turned the tide in its favor and offered its customers a mobile application-guide to finding clean public toilets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/156/0c7/057/1560c7057cda4298b46196f4f342f1d5.jpg"><br><br>  Helpful?  Undoubtedly.  And most importantly - brings the proper marketing effect. <br><br>  <b>Custom Content</b> <br><br>  If you have enough information to fill the application - this is a ‚Äúgold mine‚Äù for marketing promotion.  But not always the material is.  In such cases, you need to show imagination and make unbanal content yourself.  For example, the company Blendtec.  They were able to promote a fairly ordinary product, a blender, in an unusual way - by shooting a video about grinding in a blender things that an ordinary user would not even think to put there.  Even the new Apple Watch has become a marketing victim.  To say that the video did not leave the audience indifferent - to say nothing (1,552,025 views on April 18, 2016). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8sxwK2pJI4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFgZ46NYiSETYG3TndF2BzlMeoqg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Inspiring Story</b> <br><br>  Kleenex paper napkin manufacturers have taken a touching video based on the story of a dog with paralyzed hind limbs to promote their products.  People helped the animal to regain a full life, making special wheels on the body to ensure freedom of movement.  Throughout the video, the characters in the video tell the story of a miraculous rescue and wipe the tears with Kleenex products.  Such a positioning not only allowed to gain a large number of views (1 571 419 on April 18, 2016), but also to create positive associations with the brand. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/juc2C5v6Z_8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgri0c35RkrnKf0jKzaA9cY8HicTQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Element of surprise</b> <br><br>  What do you associate deodorant with?

There are only marketers who do not know how to properly present them.  So go ahead!  And before you begin to develop a unique marketing strategy that will bring you a huge number of leads, do not forget about two important rules: <br><br>  1. <b>Clearly define your target audience</b> .  You need accurate socio-demographic characteristics of potential customers to make marketing appeal as effective as possible. <br><br>  2. <b>Determine the goals you need to achieve.</b>  Downloads, ‚Äúpaid‚Äù users or something else.  Details matter. <br><br>  And what marketing strategies from world practice do you find most interesting and successful?
