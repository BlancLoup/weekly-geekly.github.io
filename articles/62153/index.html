But this word has become so significant in the life of almost all applicants in our country, that I cannot fail to provide my assessment and reflections on this matter.  So please bear a little more :) <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/edu_2_0/45005/">That's what I thought about the education system before the exam.</a> <br><br>  I tried to speculate on this topic from four sides: an applicant, a prestigious university, the government of the Russian Federation and I. To make the article more or less diverse, I decided to use different styles of narration: do not be surprised and feel the transition :) I hope it does not seem boring to you and you read it to the end - it is very important for me.  Thank.  And please do not try to find any clues that could put me in an awkward position (no need to find fault with spelling, etc.).

      What is written below: the subjective one-position opinion, do not judge strictly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I apologize in advance for the lyrical digressions from the topic: without them, my thoughts would be incomplete. <br><br><h3>  I am an applicant </h3><br><h4>  A plus: </h4><br>  - Where to go?  I have no idea ... But I know exactly what I want for the humanitarian direction.  What should I donate then?  Social Studies, History.  Well, fine: I will <b>pass these two exams to the maximum, and then I will decide where to go.</b>  <b>Cool system!</b> <br>  <i>(10 days left to the exam)</i> <br>  - I hate this exam!  I hate this part C!  Why give such difficult tasks?  They want to make geniuses of us?  Or I‚Äôm just looking for an excuse ... Yes, for sure there is someone to whom these tasks do not seem difficult. <br>  <i>(10 days after the exam)</i> <br>  -Finally said the results.  It seems to be a good ball.  It's not so bad.  Somewhere yes they will take;) <br>  <i>(June 20)</i> <br>  -Watch what a passing ball.  240!  Are they bullied?  No, I'm not going to Moscow for sure.  And in Tomsk?  210?  Well, here I can already.  And in Novosibirsk?  215?  It's a pity ... One ball was not enough.  Okay, there is no choice: I'm going to Tomsk;) <br><br><h4>  Minus: </h4><br>  Yes, that this exam!  What is the difference in what format to take the exam, if in any case I write it perfectly well.  In vain did I study diligently for 11 years and received the nickname ‚Äúnerd‚Äù?  I will not even prepare. <br>  <i>(After exam)</i> <br>  - As I thought, lightweight.  Well that did not waste time on preparation. <br>  <i>(After the announcement of the results)</i> <br>  -What!  80 balls!  How so!  Just go to the appeal! <br>  <i>(After appeal)</i> <br>  - Well, as it is possible!  Made only 3 mistakes, and then all the stupid and computational and already 20 balls removed!  <b>Is it for knowledge?</b>  <b>Not!</b>  Just think, inattention.  <b>University will think that I really did not know something</b> : ( <br><br><h3>  I am a prestigious university </h3><br><h4>  1st option: </h4><br>  Good stuff - EGE.  No need to suffer and fuss with their exams, no need for a long time to deal with the rules of admission - <b>everything is already decided for us</b> .  All we need to do is to accept documents from people who scored more than the minimum.  Yes, and the content of the exam is pretty good.  Part C just corresponds to the level of admission to the Moscow universities - well, it is logical, because the teachers of these universities and invent them. <br><br>  In vain, many criticize the exam for the excessive complexity of part C in mathematics.  Such tasks <b>can test the ability to think</b> , and not the ability to use a pre-known algorithm.  Such tasks show all the "beauty" and at the same time the complexity of algebra.  Let the students understand that the derivatives formulas are not the most difficult in mathematics, and the university will have to face much more complicated problems.  If such tasks for the entrant seem terrible, but he wants to go to the mathematics department, he should think again and find himself in another, otherwise he will suffer all 5 years of study at the university.  I am convinced that if a person really likes mathematics, he will solve the task of C5 with pleasure and, as a result, with ease.  These are the students we need. <br><br>  It is a pity, of course, that there are people who, even with such serious severity of the exam, manage to write off.  But there are not many such people, and, probably, if they do this, then they really need it.  Let them come in, and then we'll see if they can turn around like this in our country too. <br><br><h4>  2nd option </h4><br><ul><li>  The Ministry of Education decides for me that my future students should be able to, putting them on a par with other universities! </li><li>  In order to teach people, entrants were taught to put crosses - in the first year they will have to re-teach what they should have learned in 10-11 grades </li><li>  Due to the USE, the significance of grades is blurred, students will not try to get a good grade in the university </li><li>  Applicants submit documents to many universities at once, which creates complete uncertainty about admission up to the very moment of submission of documents. </li></ul><br>  The second option was provided by <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kichik/" class="user_link">kichik</a> . <br><br><h3>  I am the government of the Russian Federation </h3><br>  <i>(Comment: The minimum mark for the exam is assigned after checking, and if he scored less than the minimum even after retake, they do not issue a certificate.)</i> <br>  Something is not enough now plumbers, scavengers, janitors, etc.  - some economists and managers.  We need to do something about it ... It would be nice to get thousands of fifty workers somewhere.  What ball has a fifty-thousandth student from the end?  19 out of 100?  Well, let's say, 20 thousand will retake the exam, then to compensate for this we will do a minimum score of 21. In total, we will get about <b>50 thousand people without secondary education</b> who will work as drivers or someone else for at least a year - <b>we have solved the problem of lack of labor</b> . <br><br>  <i>Comment: If someone did not understand, then I meant that now the government itself can regulate the number of people who leave school without a certificate.</i>  <i>Perhaps I am too pessimistic about this issue, but agree that there is something in it :)</i> <br><br><h3>  I </h3><br>  Up to grade 11, I dreamed of entering one of the most prestigious universities in Siberia - the Novosibirsk State University, the faculty of information technology.  It was quite realistic to enter there because of the so-called rehearsal exams, which took place in March.  In all of the previous years, it was for them that the majority came, but not in this.  This year, the Ministry of Education has banned amateur activities and forced to take only on the results of the USE.  This news was shocking to all of us, as we were already sure that we did. <br><br>  After that, everyone began to prepare for the exam at a frantic pace, as there were only 2 months left, and the passing score would be quite high.  Well, now I‚Äôll go directly to my own person, as they all prepared differently: someone watched House MD, someone read the books ‚ÄúUSE for Dummies,‚Äù someone kissed the girls in clubs, and someone did everything This together :) <br><br>  The most important thing that helped me pass these exams quite well is the understanding of the fact that my whole future life depends on this test.  And this is not the pathos, the way it is.  Indeed, I will scold myself the rest of my life for the fact that I could not try for only 2 months so that I would not suffer for 5 years, while studying in an unloved specialty in an unloved university.  Every morning I thought about it and it mobilized me for the whole day.  By the way, I would like to remind everyone a well-known truth: <b>you should always do everything so that you do not regret it in the future.</b> <br><br>  I am very grateful to the Unified State Examination for having made a real enrollment not only at the NSU, but also at Moscow State University.  It was there, at the VMK MSU (Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics), I decided to enter.  The ball is a huge one!  337 in total for 4 subjects (ICT, Physics, Mathematics, Russian) was last year.  This means that each exam I need to write an average of 85 points.  It is very difficult, as I could lose a maximum of 3 primary points in each exam.  In mathematics, if you made at least one mistake or a slip of the pen, you are given one primary ball, which in the steel scale will result in a loss of 10 points and you will have not 100, but 90 points.  And if I lost 2 points, it‚Äôs already 86. It is because of this scaling system that there are so many ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù points with 60-70 points and so few people with 80-100.  If someone is interested in a complete translation table, you can find it <a href="http://www1.ege.edu.ru/images/stories/ege2009/shkalir/tabl_perev_15.06.09.xls">here</a> . <br><br>  I often hear phrases: ‚ÄúWhy do I need biology, if I will be a programmer!‚Äù.  Or I read somewhere here: ‚ÄúWhy should I write essays if I go to a programmer.‚Äù  Einstein is the author of more than 300 scientific works in physics, as well as about 150 books and articles in the field of <b>history and philosophy of science, journalism</b> , etc. Mikhail (Michael) Vasilievich Lomonosov - the first Russian scientist-naturalist of world importance, chemist and physicist, founder of physical chemistry , <b>astronomer, instrument maker, geographer, metallurgist, geologist, poet</b> .  Only a versatile person is able to understand the problem from several points of view and resolve it;  only a versatile person will always be pleased to communicate, because he can talk with you on any topic;  <b>only a versatile person is able to achieve much in life</b> .  But I do not in any way, do not impose my opinion, although I am sure of its correctness. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  Anyway, the USE contains more advantages than disadvantages.  The USE checks not only knowledge, but also attentiveness, the ability to organize oneself, the ability to think and reason, the ability to mobilize and understand the seriousness of the situation.  Indeed, in life, a person will benefit not only knowledge, but the <b>totality of all these elements</b> . <br><br>  Most likely somewhere, I definitely argued incorrectly due to the lack of life experience, so it would be nice if you pointed out my dubious arguments to me.  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  But look at all this from the side of a person who is not yet a desktop user: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/3015/">habrahabr.ru/sandbox/3015</a> .  I hope so far :) <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62153/</a></p>
