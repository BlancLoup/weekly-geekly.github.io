So I asked this question not so long ago and began a search. <br><br>  I did not want to buy a Chinese comrade at all; I decided to study the markets of Europe and the USA for such a device, since  often "they" can be found outstanding devices for almost a penny.  Two years ago, the hit was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/115492/">Orange San Francisco</a> (ZTE Blade) at a price of ¬£ 99, but for today's time, of course, it is already well out of date.  What can it be replaced with? <br><br>  I want to present to your attention a worthy replacement for the old man‚Äôs place - Pantech Burst at the cost of about $ 120! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Pantech Burst is available for the American operator AT &amp; T and is sold only in the US market.  The model is presented in two colors - black and red.  In the US, with a contract, it costs $ 50, but ebay is littered with new phones for about $ 120.  You can also buy a locked device - the decoupling from the operator does not cause problems, the decoupling code <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D374748%26st%3D220">generator</a> is available.  Let's take a look at the technical specifications that are available to us for the money.

    <h4>  Specifications: </h4><br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 2.3, official update available to Android 4.0 <br>  <b>Display:</b> 4 "Super AMOLED (480 x 800) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> two nuclear Qualcomm Snapdragon S3 APQ8060 - 1.5 GHz <br>  <b>Graphics:</b> Adreno 220 <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Data Storage:</b> 16 GB + MicroSDHC <br>  <b>Wireless data transfer:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11b, g, n, Bluetooth 3.0, LTE (does not work in the RF), GPS <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 0.3 MP front camera, 5 MP rear camera <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1650 mAh (Talk time up to 4.5 hours, standby time - up to 10 days) <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 65.2 x 126.5 x 11.4 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 122 g <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/813/ce8/a37/813ce8a37f7d5504f06d64bf22e72a44.jpg">  As can be seen from the table of technical characteristics, the device is equipped adequately enough, many will especially appreciate the Super AMOLED screen.  In general, Burst came from the creators of a balanced creation, if ZTE Blade was often scolded for a weak processor and a bad battery, then in the case of this device there are no such flaws. <br><br>  The processor and the battery is quite on the level, the RAM is set as much as in last year‚Äôs flagships.  A 16 GB of internal memory is completely free, many do not need an additional memory card, by the way, under which there is a MicroSDHC slot, if you do not have enough internal memory, you can always stick a memory card as well.  Please note that the phone uses a microSIM card. <br><br>  A few words about the assembly - it is just great, nothing backlash anywhere, the phone feels pleasant to the touch, and it looks pretty nice (although this is of course the taste and color ...), it‚Äôs not a shame to get it out of your pocket, Pantech often attracts attention, because  Previously, this brand occupied quite prominent positions in the Russian market, but at the present time it is not represented at all. <br><br><h4>  Equipment: </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e47/a81/e4c/e47a81e4c005c104b334119559f2ddc9.jpg">  There is nothing unusual in the set - manual, charging, sync cable, 1650 mAh battery, rear compartment cover and the device itself.  Surprisingly, the manufacturer did not even put in a box a cheap memory card for at least 2 GB, in general, considering the onboard memory size of 16 GB, an additional USB flash drive is not needed. <br><br>  By the way, people write on the forums that finding a spare battery for the device is very, very problematic, neither ebay nor the Chinese practically sell spare batteries.  If it happens that the battery dies - the search for its replacement may be delayed ... <br><br>  Complete charging is universal and suitable for our electrical networks, so when buying a Pantech Burst, take care to purchase the appropriate adapter to our outlet, although of course you can charge from USB.  There are no free gifts in the form of a film or a cover, but what did you want for this money? <br><br><h4>  Interface, Android and Russification: </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/388/e8b/ca0/388e8bca0215e65d7b4e98f7a48964f2.jpg">  Pantech Burst came to me with a version of Android 2.3, after connecting WiFi, an OTA update to version 4.0 arrived.  On <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D374748">w3bsit3-dns.com</a> there is a Russified firmware Android 4.0 for our today's hero.  If you ever installed firmware on Android backgrounds and are familiar with clockworkmod, you should have no problems. <br><br>  I would like to pay special attention to the lock screen, because of its brevity, I almost immediately fell in love with it.  Firstly, you immediately see if you have missed calls or SMS, and secondly, if you pull the appropriate icon, you will immediately get to the desired application, whether it is a dialer, mail or Internet browser. <br><br>  A few words about performance - since the device has a screen that is not very high resolution (yes, yes, someone 480 x 800 already seems a little), but Qualcomm‚Äôs excellent dual core processor doesn‚Äôt have performance problems, the interface works very smoothly.  I think if the craftsmen release the firmware from Android 4.1 and the working Project Butter, you will not be able to detect any interface brakes even under the microscope. <br><br>  As I mentioned above, LTE unfortunately does not work with us, but here HSDPA + functions perfectly.  With the speed of the Internet there is no problem.  With 3G enabled and moderate use, Burst lives without incident for about 24 hours away from the outlet, the result is of course not so hot, but this is not ZTE Blade, which always by the end of the day wanted to be fed. <br><br><h4>  Total pros and cons smarftona: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/41/66412e10049d4c5a62fe54d2969dc8ba.png" alt="image">  The price is definitely the biggest plus <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/41/66412e10049d4c5a62fe54d2969dc8ba.png" alt="image">  Nice appearance and great Super AMOLED screen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/41/66412e10049d4c5a62fe54d2969dc8ba.png" alt="image">  Good specifications <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/41/66412e10049d4c5a62fe54d2969dc8ba.png" alt="image">  Excellent build quality (Made in Korea) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/66/41/66412e10049d4c5a62fe54d2969dc8ba.png" alt="image">  The uniqueness of the phone, in Russia it is impossible to buy <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/ca/b9ca47e9f3a7d39bc0a374a1d9019aba.png" alt="image">  Not the best battery, as well as its scarcity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/ca/b9ca47e9f3a7d39bc0a374a1d9019aba.png" alt="image">  Buy Burst can only be in the United States. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/ca/b9ca47e9f3a7d39bc0a374a1d9019aba.png" alt="image">  After the purchase requires a flashing if you want to be able to install the Russian language. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/ca/b9ca47e9f3a7d39bc0a374a1d9019aba.png" alt="image">  No warranty in Russia. <br><br><h4>  Buy Pantech Burst </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/788/cc5/2eb/788cc52ebfe8afac8173de4eff4a3c80.jpg">  As I already mentioned, the device is sold only in the United States.  You can buy it on the site <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Cell-Phones-Smartphones-/9355/i.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_nkw%3Dpantech%2Bburst">ebay.com</a> .  The price of a new Burst without delivery starts at $ 120, and a slightly used machine in the Mint state can be bought for less than $ 100. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not all sellers are ready to send goods to Russia, exit two, or look for a seller who is ready to send your desired Burst outside the US, or use the services of intermediaries who will send the phone to you after receiving it in the US.  The price in both cases together with the delivery will be about $ 150, i.e.  in the region of 4500 Russian rubles, for this amount, in the nearest communication lounge, you can be offered an Android-based smartphone with such technical characteristics that you will not dream of in a nightmare ... <br><br>  If the respected community has any questions about the device or its purchase - please do not hesitate to ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170953/</a></p>
