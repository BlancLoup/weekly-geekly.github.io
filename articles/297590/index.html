  <section class="page js-page"><h1>People and organizations of the future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> An essay based on the books by Frederick Lalue ‚ÄúDiscovering the Future Organizations‚Äù and Semler Ricardo ‚ÄúMaverick.  The success story of the most unusual company in the world. ‚Äù <br>  <b>Man is a social being.</b>  In a very interesting, well-written and informative book by Frederick Lahl in the first part, organizational systems are briefly and clearly organized that unite people earlier and unite them now. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d0/83a/7e6/7d083a7e60ba4e678a9f8424b7235c9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then it vividly shows how, against the background of the hierarchical management schemes prevailing today, fundamentally new schemes of organizations are already being born on a massive scale.  This new type of organization, called by the author the ‚Äúevolutionary turquoise model‚Äù, has been studied and described in detail on the example of 12 organizations of various types (from factories to medical service centers and schools). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Prevailing today (many may consider it the only possible one) - the hierarchical scheme is a multi-level management and control system, on top of which is the boss (CEO) and the Board of Directors (or similar management bodies), in the middle are several layers of managers, commissions and etc.  structures, and below the actual employees of organizations. <br>  Such a pyramid turns out here, in which most of the power, information and responsibility is concentrated on the very top of the pyramid, and the people below are reasonable cogs of a complex mechanism. <br><br>  Yes, actually, the adherents of this model of management have never hidden - that their ideal is a well-functioning system of interaction between people-cogs.  Some of the well-known personalities are even credited with the following statement: ‚ÄúWhat a pity that when I need another pair of hands for the conveyor, the head is surely attached to them‚Äù.

      In contrast to this scheme, in the new ‚Äúevolutionary turquoise model‚Äù everything is based on self-government, on the fact that all employees of the organization are fully responsible and have all the rights to make all decisions. <br><br>  In this scheme all power and responsibility is concentrated below.  The CEO (and no one else in the organization) has the authority to make binding decisions. <br><br>  But middle-level managers are not in principle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d38/f14/1bb/d38f141bb3f0443db44f7e5d6d62beef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Here is the thesis - how is the organization operating according to the ‚Äúevolutionary turquoise model‚Äù:</b> <br>  1. Organizations consist of teams.  A team is a group of 15 to 35 people.  No more - lost personal connections. <br><br>  2. The team and only she is responsible for everything that happens around her and in her.  Generally for all! <br><br>  3. There is no boss in the team. <br><br>  4. No posts and job descriptions.  Employees (in collaboration with other members of their team) determine what they do.  Yes, and they are often called not employees, but colleagues or something similar. <br><br>  5. There are no middle managers in principle.  But there are (maybe) people who train and help several teams (coaches).  However, they have no authority to order. <br><br>  6. The central apparatus is minimal (for example, it can be 30 people for a company that employs 30 thousand people).  The CEO is a respected leader, but he does not have the right to make binding decisions on any issue. <br><br>  7. It is used not direct (from top to down), but reverse delegation.  That is, powers can be transferred from commands (when they need it) from the bottom up.  And they may not be transmitted. <br><br>  8. Accordingly, all support services actually turn into support services for grassroots teams.  And they are created only then and there are exactly as much time as the teams need. <br><br>  9. No decision teams (and individual team members too) do not require approval from above.  Including decisions on the approval of the budget, the definition of salaries, admission and dismissal of employees. <br><br>  10. Each team member may initiate any decision, subject to the mandatory internal consultation procedures. <br><br>  11. Internal consulting is a mandatory procedure before any employee makes any decision that affects the interests of other employees.  The opinions of all are taken into account, but consensus is not required.  It is believed that a decision made quickly after internal consultations is much better for the organization than taken by consensus, but after difficult, tedious and lengthy approvals. <br><br>  12. Another mandatory internal procedure is the conflict resolution procedure (scheme).  It is believed that conflicts always arise in a natural way and employees themselves, according to the procedures they know in advance, are obliged to take measures to resolve them.  To transfer the resolution of the conflict to the resolution of the boss is impossible. <br><br>  13. Meetings are held only as needed.  For their effective implementation, various techniques are also being developed (different in different organizations, but always simple in nature). <br><br>  14. There must be some internal information network for sharing information and facilitating internal consultation and conflict resolution procedures (corporate social network, if you use the correct terms). <br><br>  15. The organization is built on the assumption that all employees are competent and responsible persons, they themselves know how to do their job properly.  They do not need to be controlled.  Control systems, respectively, no. <br><br>  16. It is believed that there can be no information that would be inaccessible to all employees of the organization. <br><br>  17. An organization is viewed not as a complex mechanism, but as a living organism, in which decisions are made not so much on the basis of careful planning, but on an intuitive level. <br><br>  18. Naturally, as a result of the operation of the basic principles, an organization creates instead of dominance hierarchies ‚Äî hierarchies of levels of development, talent, and experience. <br><br>  19. In all cases, the goals of the organization‚Äôs existence are compulsory.  These goals NEVER include profit maximization. <br><br>  20. Recruitment takes place without haste, the organization (team) and the candidate seem to be looking at each other - can they go on the same road, will their goals coincide.  In some cases, even such methods are used - a person is stimulated with a decent amount (several thousand dollars) to leave the organization after a trial period.  But only a few use this opportunity. <br><br>  21. Some external signs of the new organization are: <br><br>  a.  The lack of a dedicated office for the Director General, in many cases he works alongside other employees. <br>  b.  Common work space is a typical solution for such organizations. <br>  c.  There is no single "office style" design.  Naturally, there is no need for any dress codes.  Employees contribute to the workplace and their individuality and much more, which is usually associated only with individual housing. <br><br>  <i>In all cases studied by Frederick Lalu, the ‚Äúturquoise model‚Äù worked perfectly, simultaneously solving the problem of stable development of an organization with obtaining (for commercial organizations) high profits, and the task of creating high personal motivation to work.</i>  <i>Moreover, motivation, not based on the need to make money.</i> <br><br>  At the same time, as practice shows, despite the high efficiency, these models are still extremely vulnerable. <br><br>  In order for the model to work - the CEO must mature before it - and it is to mature, just to convince him of the correctness of the model is impossible.  And if, for natural reasons, he is replaced by a person who does not share the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the new model, it will most likely turn back into the traditional management model.  There are such examples too. <br><br>  New management schemes should also be either directly supported by the owner, or in the case of joint-stock companies, they should be supported (at least at the level of non-resistance) by the Board of Directors. <br><br>  These are two prerequisites: a ripe CEO and the support of the owner or owner-authorized person or body. <br><br>  <b>I consider reading the book useful for everyone.</b>  <b>I did it.</b>  <b>Immediately after that, I was recommended by Ricardo's book ‚ÄúMaverik.</b>  <b>The success story of the most unusual company in the world. "</b> <br><br>  There really is history - the history (and well written as well) of the long path of development of one traditional family company towards the organization of a ‚Äúturquoise model‚Äù of management.  The story is all the more interesting because it happens not in any calm Western European country, but in Brazil, in which periods of growth constantly alternated with serious crises. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ea/1e3/ee9/1ea1e3ee94604e1095feab9be57bab7b.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Those who are interested in, the book S. Ricardo will be able to suggest some specific techniques or emphasize some important features. <br>  Well, for example, it seemed to me quite important to emphasize the difference between the organization of this type and the family.  Special attention is paid to the fact that the personal problems of the employees are their personal problems.  Organization is not a dad or a mom or a caring nurse.  And if you think a little - it is right.  A new type of organization brings together people responsible.  He makes people more responsible.  He teaches to solve problems himself, without shifting them to anyone.  Well, such a person and personal problems easier to solve.  And of course, people working alongside will not leave their colleague alone with serious difficulties, but this will be the help of colleagues, not of a caring boss. <br><br>  Well, or as one of the directions of further development, the so-called ‚Äúsatellite program‚Äù is described, which actually means the organization‚Äôs transition from the stage - ‚Äúwe will share our profits with the employees‚Äù - to the stage ‚Äúwe will share our business too‚Äù (encouraging the creation of employees leaving their own companies). <br><br>  Those who read at least one of these books, I want to invite together to reflect on the following topic. <br><br>  Many people know the divisions of people and their social functions into such communities: <br><br>  1. <u>‚ÄúPeasants‚Äù</u> are those who work, but who need the help of other people to solve some of their problems. <br>  2. <u>‚ÄúWarriors‚Äù</u> are people who are able to solve all their problems. <br>  3. <u>"Princes"</u> - people who can solve the problems of other people. <br><br>  These are three basic communities.  Others are often added to them (‚Äúmonks‚Äù, ...), but now it is irrelevant for further discussion. <br><br>  <u>I would stress that the warriors are not those who are up in arms ... - no, they are the ones for whom there are no unsolvable problems of their own.</u>  <u>These are those who never blame others for their problems and failures.</u> <br><br>  Why did I remember this?  I got the impression that the organizations of a new type (‚Äúturquoise‚Äù organizations) bring up modern warriors and unite warriors.  And this is one of the keys to understanding their success. <br><br>  Therefore, the following conclusion from these books will be like this - our world is on the verge of change.  And we are witnessing the already begun transition to a new round of development spiral - i.e.  in other words, there is a qualitative transition to a new state of humanity. <br><br>  And if you make a bundle with my articles about new monetary systems, then new monetary systems should be more precisely attached to the new type of organizations. <br>  It is necessary to rethink the role and place and rules of the functioning of currency and stock markets (well, they are not needed in their present form, even now their usefulness for new social ties and new organizations is questionable). <br>  Already, we are actually approaching the need to modify the right of ownership. <br><br>  And then, naturally, without revolutionary upheavals, by the way, the current extensive development of the economy for the sake of the economy is transformed into the development of man himself without his abandonment of the real, convenient (what is there to be modest) benefits of civilization. <br><br>  It will not necessarily go to the skete to achieve enlightenment, it - enlightenment - will be available to everyone.  As it becomes available (I think) S. Ricardo and many of his employees. <br><br>  Perhaps (let's look a little further ahead) a reasonable person (and now it is either a reasonable cog, or a reasonable leader, etc.) will turn into a creative person. <br><br>  Is it all a whim?  How to say.  It depends only on ourselves what the future will be.  And as you know - the best way to predict the future is to create it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297590/</a></p>
