  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 to 7 and a bucket of coffee</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How many times a week do you hear the words ‚ÄúI want to sleep‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can't wake up‚Äù from family and colleagues?  How often do you moan in the morning, ‚ÄúWell, would you like an hour!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhen is the pension already?‚Äù <br><br>  Problems related to sleep in one way or another are discussed on TV and on YouTube, on forums and in public.  They talk about it in our Plarium Krasnodar.  Although the morning turn to coffee machines replaces thousands of words. <br><br>  We decided to conduct a mini-study and tell you how things are going with the igrodels' sleep.  Also, under the cut, you will find a squeeze from a lecture that was prepared by one of our employees: what you need to sleep, ‚Äúfirst aid‚Äù for lack of sleep and other tips.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ci/en/f0/cienf0aias_f9erfdfbf-36vjzy.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Normally only one third </h3><br>  The topic is really burning.  330 employees responded to a survey about a dream that we sent out to the entire studio (which is 400 people). <br><br>  First they asked the most trivial, but at the same time the most important question: how much do you usually sleep on weekdays?  More than half of the guys (58%) sleep from 5 to 7 hours.  The norm of 7‚Äì8 hours is ‚Äúpoured out‚Äù by 35%.  Not bad. <br><br>  A similar <a href="https://vk.com/wall-20629724_1186962">survey in VK</a> , conducted by Habr, has a large sample, and the results are almost the same as ours. <br><br>  How much time do guys spend on sleep, if they are not limited?  It's about the weekend, of course.  It turned out that only 8% sleep less than the norm (from 5 to 7 hours), and the rest quite give vent to themselves: <br><br><ul><li>  8‚Äì10 hours - 41%, </li><li>  7‚Äì8 hours - 33%, </li><li>  10‚Äì12 hours - 16%, </li><li>  12 hours or more - 2%. </li></ul><br>  At the same time, 7.5% of respondents constantly practice daytime sleep.  Another 36% are very rare, but still take a chance to take a nap when a free minute is given. <br><br>  What about the time it takes to get enough sleep?  Almost half of the respondents (48%) need 7‚Äì8 hours.  About 33% can be like cucumbers, only if they sleep 9‚Äì11 hours.  And only one percent of the guys need 12 or more hours for the feeling of ‚Äúsleep‚Äù, although we expected such a response from at least one third of the respondents. <br><br>  Another 1% (lucky ones!) Noted that they were getting enough sleep, having spent only a few hours in bed (up to 5).  8% believe that their rate is from 5 to 7 hours.  And finally, the remaining 9% are convinced: no matter how much they sleep, they will not get enough sleep anyway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/_b/fm/sl_bfm_tnuu6r5eb5xclscpqtym.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Movies and home worries </h3><br>  Why more than half of the guys do not reach the norm on weekdays?  Can't sleep?  Hardly.  With the duration of sleep on weekends, the order, and the question ‚ÄúDo you suffer from insomnia?‚Äù Only 5% answered with an unambiguous ‚Äúyes‚Äù, and 28% have it, but not often. <br><br>  We do not sleep because we can not lie down early, the reasons for all are almost the same.  The top five looks like this: <br><br><ul><li>  watching movies and TV shows - 155 answers out of 330; </li><li>  home cares - 152; </li><li>  striving for self-development (reading books, monitoring specialized sites, viewing tutorials) - 145; </li><li>  games - 122; </li><li>  "Hang" in social networks - 83. </li></ul><br>  Also, thoughts about work or work itself (71), partner-owl (25) and noisy neighbors (23) do not give a chance to sleep.  Among the single answers: children, late trainings, hobbies, guests and so on. <br><br>  And now about the morning.  How to find out if everything is okay with your sleep? <br><br><ol><li>  You fall asleep almost as soon as you go to bed. </li><li>  You wake up on an alarm clock. </li></ol><br>  It turned out that with the awakening of our children everything is more or less normal: 69% of the respondents get out of bed either a fitness bracelet or an alarm clock.  But 16% wake up a little earlier, and, according to them, for no reason whatsoever.  Another 4% of respondents get up due to households and pets, and 3% call the sun the culprit (not in winter, of course). <br><br><h3>  I got up, but did not wake up </h3><br>  We asked the guys to indicate that it helps to fall asleep, if not sleep, and wake up, if I didn‚Äôt sleep much. <br><br>  So, in the arms of Morpheus pushing: <br><br><ul><li>  meditation, breathing practices, self-massage; </li><li>  sedatives, teas, honey, sleeping pills, melatonin; </li><li>  reading and listening to books, audio lectures, soothing sound (mantras, sounds of rain, etc.); </li><li>  airing the room or walk before bedtime; </li><li>  changing the position of the body (head in the opposite direction, for example). </li></ul><br>  How do sleepy people bring themselves to their senses?  Coffee leads - a lot of coffee (157 responses).  Next are charging (74) and douche (70).  Interestingly, the energy was not held in high esteem, and it pleases: only 17 people use them. <br><br>  Also among the most common answers are citrus fruits, strong tea, a walk to the office, a high-carb breakfast, a short nap during the lunch break, music and ... work.  Yes, urgent tasks invigorate incredibly.  :-) <br><br>  There are those who admitted their powerlessness before lack of sleep: more than 30 people do not take any measures to encourage themselves.  Including because nothing helps. <br><br><h3>  Caffeine sleep and no alcohol </h3><br>  And now the promised squeeze out of a lecture on sleep, which was prepared by our colleague Nikita for us as Plarium Krasnodar employees (we hold lectures for each other on interesting topics). <br><br>  Attention!  We do not claim that the information below is undeniable and the only true.  Nikita is based on research data and his own experience.  We advise you to watch the video, and not just listen: some of the information written on the slides is not voiced. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUqYY2myrU4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  We hope that you have learned something new and useful.  Sleep sweetly! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449192/</a></p>
