In the New Year holidays, there was a meeting with another reader - Pocketbook Touch, also known as Pocketbook Touch 622. The same manufacturer, the general ‚Äúideology‚Äù, the same year of release (both models came out in 2012).  However, these readers differ in both cost and capabilities, and significantly.  Therefore, it is tempting to find out how the older and younger models differ, and how much these differences are noticeable in reality.  In a word - is it worth paying more;) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We define to begin with the financial difference.  The average cost of a Pocketbook Basic 613 on Yandex.Market is now around 4,300 p., With prices starting from about 3,600 rubles.  The average price of a Pocketbook Touch is approximately 6300 r., Prices in online stores start at about 5400 r.  (data at the end of January 2013).  That is, quite approximately the difference between the two models can be defined as 2000 rubles.  "Skills and skills" Pocketbook Basic manufacturer clearly described in the very name of the model - this is a basic level of features.  It is interesting to see what additional features will be at the disposal of the buyer, who paid about 2000 rubles more. <br><br>  For this amount, Pocketbook Touch offers the following advantages:

      - More modern e-ink screen - in Pocketbook Touch it is Pearl, in Pocketbook Basic 613 - Vizplex.  (However, we'll talk about the screens of these models). <br>  - Capacitive touch display with support for multi-touch gestures (non-touch display for Pocketbook Basic 613) <br>  - Wi-Fi (Pocketbook Basic 613 doesn't have it) <br>  - Built-in RSS reader <br>  - Built-in browser <br>  - Built-in audio player <br>  - The ability to "voice" the text <br>  - More customization options compared to the 613th model.  Of the interesting things, I would point out the ability to set up profiles for different users so that the reader can be used by several people, and the ability to protect the settings with a password. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55e/cf6/a96/55ecf6a96546adabc1e966b92eb549ad.jpg"><br><br>  We have to admit that there are really a lot of differences, and they are not limited to the ‚Äúnew design of the central button‚Äù;) <br>  Of the smaller differences, a slightly more capacious battery can be noted (1100 mAh instead of 1000 for the Basic 613), soft touch coating instead of smooth plastic for the 613th model, more attractive and memorable design (a matter of taste, of course, but still). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd7/654/b15/cd7654b15f0611134a85b6fb729caed1.jpg"><br><br>  A slight difference in dimensions can be attributed to neutral differences: Pocketbook Touch is a bit narrower (115 mm against 123 mm) and slightly heavier (195 grams against 180 for the Basic 613). <br><br>  In this case, both models are omnivorous in terms of book formats, both have a screen with a diagonal of 6 inches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec0/fe7/ec0/ec0fe7ec000d95f4ef2ad4e6292d02cc.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's see what are the real impressions of using the reader.  Along the way, we will not just remember the 613th model.  Like last time, let's start with the pros. <br><br>  1. The reader is thin, light and compact.  Behind - soft touch plastic, hold nicely and does not slip out of hands.  On the ‚Äúface‚Äù there are big black buttons: ‚ÄúHome‚Äù, ‚ÄúForward‚Äù, ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù.  They are also with a soft rubber coating.  Buttons like it - soft pressing, clear and precise move, convenient size.  It feels like an order of magnitude better, more convenient and more pleasant than the control unit of the 613th model.  In fact, you can flip through the pages of a Pocketbook Touch by simply swiping your finger across the screen.  But I noticed that basically I just flip through the buttons.  So that, despite the habit of touch screens, the hand itself reached for the buttons, they should be made really well and conveniently. <br><br>  2. The touch screen is very touch-sensitive;) It responds perfectly - quickly and very obediently.  Access to the desired item is faster than when working with a joystick.  Rush it please, I think.  True, the deepening of the topic showed that sensory power provided this model with its own drop of tar, but more on that later, in the ‚Äúminuses‚Äù.  The reader is not only touch-sensitive, but also with multi-touch support.  I would not call this opportunity fundamentally important for the reader, but in general it is convenient.  For example, you can literally increase or decrease font size with two fingers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/1b1/6ba/49a1b16bad31c81ad778d431913a0f92.jpg"><br><br>  3. The settings of the Pocketbook Touch are really very wide.  This applies to both the organization of the "Library" and much more.  If the capabilities of Pocketbook Basic 613 can be called sufficient for reading, then these possibilities are very advanced.  Traditionally, for Pocketbook there is a wide choice of fonts, letter size, line spacing and indents.  In addition, books can be sorted in different ways - this is especially useful for those who are used to keeping a large library on the reader.  It is possible to customize profiles for different users - then everyone will see "their" books on the right page.  The settings you make can be password protected if desired - a touching concern for those who don‚Äôt even trust themselves;) Actually, this is a really useful function - probably everyone accidentally knocked down the settings, sometimes it is ‚Äúhelped‚Äù by other users.  Some nice little things are also thought out - for example, you can turn off the flashing green diode on the front panel.  It flashes when the state of the system changes - for example, when flipping through, or during some kind of ‚Äúinternal‚Äù process.  This is annoying to many, as it turned out.  However, I rather liked it - it shines softly, it goes out quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c2/65c/f04/7c265cf04896218c857b148251c6e0e4.jpg"><br><br>  4. <b>Very fat plus</b> .  For all the time of using the reader (a little more than a month) there were no glitches, not a single freeze.  The exact and predictable work of the software means its thorough preparation, which is worthy of all respects;) The battery charge, by the way, was also displayed correctly (see the review of Pocketbook Basic 613) - it was possible to navigate to these readings. <br><br>  5. Just about the battery.  With daily reading (from half an hour to a couple of hours), intermittently turning on Wi-Fi and using (occasionally) additional functions (browser, player), the reader spent a little more than three weeks on one charge.  Perhaps, if you only read, you can hold out for a month or a bit more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7de/2dc/339/7de2dc339654ffcb5c2793c6687a7f12.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/414/484/13f/41448413ff048dfaaf470a2c5e1b890d.jpg"><br><br>  6. Omnivorous - copes with any modern formats.  This advantage of Pocketbooks is noted by everyone, even those who do not see any problem with the conversion of formats (I, for example, do not see it).  This is really a plus, and it should be noted.  By the way, poketbooks are omnivorous, regardless of the reading room level - the Pocketbook Basic 613 budget reader is exactly as omnivorous as the advanced Pocketbook Touch. <br><br>  7. I liked the ability to read RSS on the reader - Wi-Fi is enough for this, and everything is downloaded by itself.  It turned out to be convenient.  The firmware can also be updated via Wi-Fi (the device itself offers to do this if it finds a new firmware). <br><br>  8. Everyone knows that reading a PDF on a reader with a 6-inch screen is very inconvenient.  It‚Äôs not that Pocketbook Touch solved this problem fundamentally, but it‚Äôs a little easier to do: it can rebuild PDF text (for example, you can make a larger font).  He does not touch the graphics.  If the document goes beyond the screen, you can simply move your finger - in this regard, the touch screen is more convenient than the usual one, and the finger is more convenient than the joystick;) But it must be noted that the process is rather slow, requires considerable meditativeness and ‚Äúwarrior will‚Äù. <br><br>  9. Already ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù the reader has built-in Lingvo dictionaries (those who read in English or other languages ‚Äã‚Äãknow that in full, ‚Äúuncoupled‚Äù version these are very good and convenient dictionaries).  And using them on a touch reader is much more convenient than on a reader with a joystick.  When reading in the right word, just poke a finger, and the translation will appear in the dictionary window (the dictionary must be previously started).  User interests are more or less taken into account: if a word is selected at the bottom of the screen, the translation will appear at the top, if at the top, the translation will appear at the bottom (see photo).  If you have to read special literature, you can install additional dictionaries - thematic, with special vocabulary, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/25a/ff2/5b6/25aff25b6ed2ab07c719de7786d2c03d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43f/54a/245/43f54a2453c165e6495bd5d1bede37e5.jpg"><br><br>  10. "Patter" let's go over other advantages: a memory card of up to 32 GB is supported.  Standard audio jack. <br><br>  11. And - finally - quite an ambiguous plus.  The presence of a browser.  I‚Äôll say right away that the browser on the e-ink screen didn‚Äôt provoke enthusiasm: it works slowly, the Internet through it looks scary, sometimes it is very (the degree of horror depends on the layout of the site and the font used).  With some sites, the browser could not work normally.  For example, he didn‚Äôt succeed with the wonderful book site ManyBooks.net - the site was loaded, but it wasn‚Äôt possible to use its sorting and book selection capabilities, as well as searching.  But this result was quite expected.  Nevertheless, I think the browser is more of a virtue, because in most cases it still WORKS, which means that if it is very necessary, you can use it.  Apparently, finishing the browser is a matter of the future;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b87/482/bd7/b87482bd7f864bbc1058be2899645553.jpg"><br><br>  From the laudatory ode we turn to fables with morality;) Simply put - we will describe the minuses. <br><br>  1. In the review of Pocketbook Basic 613 I already wrote about the inconveniently located power button (on the bottom).  Apparently, this is something genetic.  At the Pocketbook Touch, the manufacturer used the same solution, and the button is the same - even with the surface and small.  The same option is offered by Sony and Amazon readers.  Of the major manufacturers of originality, only Barnes &amp; Noble distinguished themselves - they placed the power button on top and made it big and comfortable. <br><br>  2. Perhaps, I will begin with a question.  Below is a photo of two readers (Pocketbook Touch and Pocketbook Basic 613).  Specially shot in natural light, without flash, and made sure that the lighting conditions were the same for both readers.  Whose screen is whiter?;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d4/b4a/555/3d4b4a5551c2f9e0f31fab4147c03b07.jpg"><br><br>  The photo rather correctly conveyed the feeling that arises when comparing ‚Äúlive‚Äù: the screen of the 613th model looks noticeably lighter, the screen of the Pocketbook Touch seems more gray.  But for the 613th reader, the screen of the old generation is Vizplex, and for the Touch, the Pearl screen, which is considered more modern, brighter and more contrast.  That is, everything should be the other way around. <br><br>  On this subject there are two versions, and it is quite possible that both are true. <br><br>  <b>The first version</b> found "on the Internet."  The screen of the Pocketbook Touch looks darker because the manufacturer used a different touchscreen technology than other manufacturers of e-readers.  For example, Sony and Amazon use infrared sensors.  Pocketbook went the other way and added an extra layer above the matrix, which uses the same technology as the capacitive touchscreen displays of tablets and smartphones.  Therefore, the screen turned out to be sensitive, but darker than Pearl allows. <br><br>  <b>Version two</b> .  Among the designers, artists and printers, the optical effect is well known: the perception of color strongly depends on the neighboring color.  This effect is also seen in the photo: the dark gray case of the 613th model helps the ‚Äúold‚Äù screen of the 613th model to look better, making it visually brighter.  The bright white Pocketbook Touch case underlines the grayness of the screen, although it is a more modern Pearl.  And the difference between the color of the case and the screen itself is striking every time you take the reader in hand. <br><br>  In general, we must remember that a smartphone / tablet in a white case and a snow-white reader on electronic ink are not the same thing.  In the first case, a bright glowing screen will, in any case, look attractive, and it will be comfortable to use it.  In the second case, choosing a white case, we end up with a ‚Äúdirty paper effect‚Äù.  At least, at the modern level of development of e-ink technology. <br><br>  Hence the conclusion and advice: although the little white readers themselves look very nice, you shouldn‚Äôt look at the appearance;) The main thing for which we love e-ink is a comfortable reading, eye-pleasing screen.  Therefore, the impression of the screen is more important than the ‚Äúsingle‚Äù cute color of the case.  Ideally, the case color should ‚Äúhelp‚Äù the reader's screen to look better.  It is best to cope with this task reading room in a dark case, or at least darker than the screen itself (from light gray and silver to black).  By the way, there is a choice - Pocketbook Touch is available in two versions - white-black (it was he who came to me for testing) and black.  The reader in the black case, the screen is likely to look better. <br><br>  If you still really want a reader in a white case - try to watch the device live before buying, and in different colors.  On the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù photos of readers (of any manufacturer), the screen almost always looks snow-white - at least it is always whiter than the case.  That's why they are ‚Äúofficial‚Äù photos;) In reality, the color impression is somewhat different. <br><br>  If the second version (the optical effect) works together with the first (an additional touch layer under the screen), then the undesirable effect is further enhanced.  As far as this critical flaw is concerned, I don‚Äôt presume to judge unequivocally, it all depends on individual perception. <br><br>  3. Some icons turned out to be small.  The screen is touch-sensitive, and it is designed, as I understand it, just for touching it with your fingers, not with the stylus.  But getting into the icon with your finger, not hitting the next one, does not always work.  It is necessary to clarify that the main menu items do not cause difficulties.  But the deeper you go, the smaller the icons become.  For example, inside the dictionary window they are already quite small (see photo). <br><br>  4. Connecting to a Wi-Fi network here is implemented rather peculiar.  I would say, nostalgically - something reminded the Internet setting on the Siemens S45, about ten years ago.  This was surprising, given that the modern ‚Äústandard‚Äù has long been set by tablets and smartphones (the user sees several detected networks, ‚Äúpokes‚Äù into the necessary and, if necessary, enters a password).  Pocketbook Touch process looks more solemn.  You can‚Äôt call it difficult, but it does require some awareness.  Below - a couple of photos from the interface to connect to Wi-Fi.  However, re-connection to the same network is already fast and almost on the machine. <br><br>  Here, in general, that's all.  More nothing bothered, and the reader actually liked it, there were more pluses than minuses. <br>  Although the text began with a comparison with the younger model - Pocketbook Basic 613, competing in the Pocketbook Touch market will be primarily with more expensive and similar in functionality readers of other manufacturers. <br><br>  In my opinion, the group of direct competitors includes: <br><br>  - <b>Amazon Kindle Touch</b> , <b>Amazon Kindle Paperwhite</b> .  Amazon's readers are not officially sold in Russia, but you can buy them.  The average price of a <b>Kindle Touch is</b> now about 6,000 rubles (for a <b>Pocketbook Touch</b> , about 6,300).  The second model is somewhat more expensive, but at the same time its average price for Yandex.Market is just close to the average Pocketbook Touch price and is about 6400 rubles.  Out-of-the-box Amazons, without additional manipulations, cannot read all those formats that Pocketbook reads and do not have official service in the territory of the Russian Federation, but <b>Kindle Paperwhite</b> has a built-in backlight and a higher screen resolution (768x1024).  Everything else is, by and large, a matter of taste. <br><br>  - <b>Sony PRS-T2</b> and still selling <b>Sony PRS-T1</b> .  The average price for both models is about 5,900 rubles.  Like Kindle, Sony works with a smaller format compared to <b>Pocketbook Touch</b> (to be fair, with the more recent official firmware, <b>PRS-T2 has</b> now learned to understand fb2, there is information on this on Sony‚Äôs official website).  Sony readers have been officially delivered to Russia for some time.  Sony has more limited software features (for example, customization options) than Pocketbook Touch. <br><br>  - Two models from Barnes &amp; Noble: <b>Nook Simple Touch</b> and <b>Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight</b> .  The first model is much cheaper (the average price now is about 3600 r.).  The settings are more ascetic, there is no audio player, but everything you need to read (including good ergonomics) is there, the touch screen and Wi-Fi are also present.  <b>Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight</b> , as the name implies, still has a highlight, the average price is about 5,200 rubles (end of January 2013). Both models, like readers from Amazon, are not sold in Russia officially, not all formats are understood (if needed something other than ePub, you will need a converter).  Conversion is a simple and fast process, but, after all, this is an additional step. <br><br>  In general, there is a choice, and a good one - each of these readers has its own peculiarity.  Personally, I like all these models - each in its own way.  For us, readers and buyers, you can rejoice;) Some models take more price and quality performance, some - with wide possibilities, models with backlight will be appreciated by those who have to read in imperfect lighting conditions - in the evening / morning, in transport, in the train ... <br><br>  Finally, let us return once again to the main character of this post.  In general, Pocketbook Touch made a very pleasant impression: an interesting model with good software, a sensitive touch screen and rich personalization options.  There are also disadvantages, of course, they are noted above.  But, if you are interested in readers with a touch screen, you should pay attention to the Pocketbook Touch. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168965/</a></p>
