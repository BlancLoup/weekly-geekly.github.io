  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How custom application development can be interesting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just over a year ago I opened <a href="http://smartr.ru/">a mobile application development agency</a> .  This topic was very fascinating to me, and I understood that this was the future.  In addition, I saw that the demand for the development of mobile applications is already huge, and so far very few people can do them.  The IT experience was quite large, so I quickly assembled a small team of developers and began to make custom applications.  There were no customer problems right from the start.  Practically everyone was interested in mobile applications, and we were one of the few companies in Moscow that carried out custom development. <br><br><h5>  We received a huge number of potential orders. </h5><br>  A lot of companies wanted a mobile application for themselves, without realizing that it may not be necessary for people at all.  Any manager of any company who had an iPhone or an Android wanted to order a mobile application for their company.  There were also a lot of funny startups who dreamed of changing the world by creating a mobile application - the Foursquare killer.  We tried to train people, tell them how and why people use mobile apps, and how they need to be done so that people like them.  We tried to be creative for our clients, to invent something interesting and useful.  We tried not to take up boring and uninteresting projects.  But unfortunately, most orders were just that. <br><br><h5>  The first really interesting project </h5><br>  The first really interesting project of ours turned out to be <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/id474006538%3Fmt%3D8">the Auto-Lawyer application</a> .

    <img src="http://smartr.ru/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/01-avto.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  We were approached by a law firm specializing in automotive situations.  They had a lot of useful material, but they understood that the information on the site is too academic in nature, and people really do not have the opportunity to use the information in practice. <br><br>  We realized that the application can become really popular and useful for people, and it became interesting to us!  We ourselves developed not only the design of the application, but also participated in the preparation of the material.  We had to process and structure it in such a way that it was really convenient for people to use it on a mobile phone.  The application turned out really beautiful, convenient and understandable.  We also engaged in the promotion of the application, with the result that it received about 100,000 downloads.  From a technological point of view, the application was very simple, but it turned out to be really interesting to do it. <br><br><h5>  And we liked to do interesting projects! </h5><br>  We liked to make not just custom-made applications, but really useful and interesting projects that will help people!  We liked to take part not only in the creation of program code, but also in the invention of the product itself.  Since then, we have understood that we will take only those orders that we like ourselves and which can become popular!  We are currently developing three very interesting projects that really have a good potential, and which are unique in their kind.  I really hope that in the next posts I will have the honor of writing about one of them. <br><br>  Of course, now they will immediately ask me if we want to do our projects in this case.  Of course, we want and plan.  But the truth is that it is very difficult to make a purely mobile application that will become very popular without additional resources (for example, a serious content base).  Therefore, we combine our resources with the resources of our customers, and together we strive to create cool projects. <br><br>  Well, we, of course, are looking for iOS and Android developers, especially in Moscow :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137359/</a></p>
