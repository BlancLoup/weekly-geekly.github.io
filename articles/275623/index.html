So, problems with user empathy and loss of conversion are inevitable.  After all, evolution did not prepare us for the era of digital at all, as we would not want to curse the opposite loudly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef5/47c/c3d/ef547cc3dd5213498322bc5412eea20f.jpg" alt="image">

      Therefore, the problems with UX will not go away from us, until the moment when the design finally turns from fashion trends and guidelines to the customer. <br><br>  Almost all of human history. Travel was considered a curse.  Ask your grandmothers: in their ‚Äúchurches,‚Äù they still pray about traveling just as much as about very sick people.  Unfriendly weather, robbers on the roads, issues of food and personal hygiene, and a lot of unpredictable surprises - all this made some 50-100 years ago travelers only the most desperate and super-passionate people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1db/18e/b6b/1db18eb6b3d07461f3a48a29142fc86c.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not think that with the development of technology, services and passenger aviation, all people would instantly outlive this irrational centuries-old fear of traveling.  Judge yourself, despite the fashion trends, to take and move your workplace from the expensive and stuffy Moscow office to the warm sea coast was decided on by a dozen Russian IT companies, despite the complete absence of problems with the Internet and communications.  But the very ancient fear of unnecessary movements is still too strong, this fear is very deep and primitive.  Let us not forget that the problems of traveler discomfort did not disappear even in the 21st century: this is both laying the ears in flight, and the smell of socks with Doshirak on the train, "seasickness", etc.  And the mathematical probabilities of disasters have not been canceled yet ... <br><br>  However, it is possible that the matter is not only in fear.  Perhaps the question is also the expediency of rest.  Let's be frank, each of us will always have a homely sofa three times more comfortable than any hotel bed, and grandma's / mother's food is guaranteed to be tastier than exotic restaurant delights.  The fact that wi-fi in the hotel is sure to be worse than the home Internet is not worth mentioning. <br><br>  So what is for the sake of the average, pragmatic and thrifty citizen suddenly becomes ready to sacrifice his annual salary for the sake of transferring his physical body beyond the limits of the comfort zone that has been accustomed and developed over the years? <br><br>  For the sake of impressions and emotions, of course!  For the chance to see something unusual and survive the release of endorphins in the brain.  For the sake of a chance to try on a new role - from a slaughtered clerk for a whole month to turn into an Eastern Padishah with a whole army of servants and service personnel.  This is similar to the role-playing game ‚ÄúWhat if I had a lot of money and would never have to work?‚Äù When a person can drastically change his internal value system and way of thinking in a couple of days, sometimes making completely unexpected purchases and actions.  Speaking very briefly, an acquaintance psychologist formulated the human craving for travel as a desire to temporarily feel that the whole world revolves around him alone. <br><br>  As a person who adores strategic games, I will say it easier - for many people it seems that their visit to the country is akin to military conquest, that is, the conquest of new territories.  To visit a new city / country for our subconscious with you means ‚Äúto mark the city with your own‚Äù, to declare your right to the territory.  Some tailoring shops have already captured this trend of the human soul and competently make a lot of money on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/3fa/0ed/a283fa0ed272e7dba4f75ee2ae5dc405.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let us now turn our attention to the interface of issuing available options for obtaining emotions from the ‚Äúseizure of new territories and servants‚Äù on one of the well-known resources: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f97/8c6/844/f978c68445d0bd28e2b4400b8abf17f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It looks like the next accounting plate, but everything is ‚Äúclean‚Äù and quite in trend.  Well, where are the emotions, the bright colors of life, endorphins, in the end?  Where is the whole universe of servants, concubines, and conquered powers revolving around Petit-padish?  Where are the enemy merchants, trembling under the iron heel of his spouse?  Where is the symbolic handing over the keys to the city \ 's number to the great warrior?  Where is the plot, which then to old age with pride will store the memory and album of photos? <br><br>  Okay, let‚Äôs reduce the intensity of pathos and, let's say, simply: each person sees the world only from within his own physical prison, and the whole Universe for him is only a small loophole in his subjective inner lock of being.  Therefore, in order to sell the service of moving all this complex body-mental construction from point A to point B, that is, from a home sofa to a Thai hotel bed, you just need to show this to a person.  Show him himself in the new image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/194/700/35e/19470035ec138adb9f53a6d704ea9770.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If it is not very clear, then I will say even simpler: here the sellers of clothing have long cut through such a piece as lukbuki, when not so much the clothing itself is sold, but the appearance, the image of the buyer entirely.  A person makes a purchase not of rags, but of a new self and his new place in life, to fill in a new space-time in the Universe. <br><br>  Therefore, the issuance of the results of hotels for the male conqueror, for the invader of new resources and amenities, should look like this in order to meet the demands of the subconscious mind formed over millions of years: <br><br>  For women, everything is about the same - the most beautiful images and the most successful future photographs and memory casts, which will then accompany our client to the deepest old age, occur in the head.  And because with the background and the correct color of the sunset, suitable for a new dress - absolutely can not be mistaken.  And if a wedding is planned, then the stakes for getting the maximum likes of future photos with her husband on Instagram simply grow to the skies. <br><br>  And that is why human-oriented interfaces will start only there, when tables and numbers will be replaced by live and life priorities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b8/7d4/811/5b87d481147d31de2360947dfb210a84.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But a simple man in the street can only wait, who will be the first to risk turning his entire system to face his own client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275623/</a></p>
