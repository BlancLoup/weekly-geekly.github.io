  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 27</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><habracut text="  #27">  If you are reading this text, then you are incredibly lucky!  Congratulations!  First of all, you can read, and this is very rare in our time.  Secondly, you can write.  Surely you will be noted on the forum of your favorite intergalactic newspaper and praise me.  Thirdly, every Thursday in the sky-blue huts with the inscription "Belsaydzdruk" a new issue of "KV" appears, in which an uncharted world of blogs opens up to readers.  And this means only one thing - stability.  So, I want to raise this glass for our dear readers, you health and happiness! <br><br>  In the last issue I told you about two new services that have begun work on the expanses of the Belarusian Internet.  I would be a bad hamster if I hadn‚Äôt contacted representatives of tut.by and Akavita to comment on these events.  This is what Fedor Korolenko, creator and ideological mastermind of Akavita, responded: <br><br>  <em>- What is the main difference between the Akavita service and similar ones provided by Yandex and Google?</em>  <em>Of course, in addition to the focus on Belarusian blogs.</em> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - The main difference is that the service has just started :).  And, accordingly, the functionality is significantly inferior to both Yandex and Google.  However, as far as possible we will develop.  And just to list the opportunities that Yandex and Google services have, but Akavita does not have it ‚Äî I don‚Äôt see much point. <br><br>  <em>- Which ‚Äúengine‚Äù is used by your service - original or purchased?</em>  <em>If it's original, how difficult was it to create and what difficulties did you encounter?</em> <br><br>  - The engine is used the same as for the main search on sites, namely, built on the basis of some open-source solutions, taking into account its vision of the problem.  Fully original engines in retro-search (retro.akavita.by), search in the catalog and news. <br><br>  <em>- Are you going to further develop blog search?</em>  <em>Add new features?</em>  <em>Will the ratings of blogs, messages and services appear, as it already exists on <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> ?</em> <br><br>  - Of course!  Ratings, as well as various statistics of Belarusian diaries and communities will be published at <a href="http://blogs.akavita.by/">blogs.akavita.by</a> .  First of all, the statistics will relate to LJ (it‚Äôs most convenient to integrate with it), then other popular systems will gradually be added.  Statistics has long been collected and systematized, you only need to decide what and in what form it is worth publishing. <br><br>  <em>- The appearance of your blog search and service for managing your own blogs on <a href="http://blogs.tut.by/">tut.by</a> - a simple coincidence or carefully planned enslavement of the world?</em> <br><br>  - Is the enslavement of the world going through the service blogs.akavita.by?  Hmm, original ... Yes, no, just a coincidence.  After all, blogs.tut.by has not opened yet, just someone leaked information. <br><br>  In parallel, there was a correspondence with tut.by CEO Kirill Voloshin, but he did not allow it to be published.  Perhaps in the next issue you can still read tut.by comments, which will shed light on the future of their blogging service. <br><br>  Russian-speaking users of LiveJournal have been fiercely discussing the deal between Six Apart (owner of LiveJournal) and Russian online media company Soup (funny name, yeah) all last week.  The meaning of the deal is that now ‚ÄúSoup‚Äù is receiving a license from Six Apart to service Russian-speaking users.  This concept refers to all LJ users living in the former Soviet Union, as well as users from other countries who write Cyrillic languages ‚Äã‚Äãin their diaries (for example, residents of Bulgaria, Serbia and Mongolia).  Naturally, immediately in almost all blogs, there were reports of a worldwide conspiracy and the imminent enslavement of LJ users.  The Soup company is owned by American and Russian financiers - Andrew Paulson and Alexander Mamut.  Nothing that tells us the names.  But Anton Nosik, a man who will deal with LJ in the Sup company, bloggers with experience know very well.  One of the first Russian users of LiveJournal, the ideologue of blogs, leading his own blog - here is a brief description of Anton.  Naturally, many were alarmed, for some reason they began to recall Stalin, the 37th year and total censorship.  Many people think that Nosik will first of all begin to settle scores with his long-time opponents, as if the Internet is such a nursery-garden, where the owner of the sandbox beats other kids with a spatula and drills kulichiki.  I will definitely try to get the comments of Anton himself by the next issue of ‚ÄúThe World of Blogs‚Äù, but for now I will write a banal truth - time will tell.  In my opinion, the emergence of a Russian-speaking partner will only benefit livejournal and soon interesting innovations await us. <br><br>  <strong>And at this time ...</strong> <br><br>  ... The jury of the worldwide competition of Internet diaries <a href="http://www.thebobs.com/">Best Of Blogs</a> , organized by Deutsche Welle, has identified 150 nominees in 15 categories, according to oreanda.ru.  Among the main nominees were two Russian-language blogs - ‚Äú <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_woodarch">Wooden Russia</a> ‚Äù in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Best Blog‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="http://sivilia-1.livejournal.com/">The Journal of Vera Vasilyeva</a> ‚Äù in the nomination ‚ÄúReporters without Borders‚Äù.  The best Russian-language blog will also be selected.  Anyone can vote for the best, in their opinion, diary on the contest website. <br><br>  ... the Sudanese government announced that it is sending UN envoy Jan Pronk out of the country for <a href="http://janpronk.nl/">posting</a> several messages on his personal <a href="http://janpronk.nl/">Internet blog</a> that expressed his opinion about the violent clashes between the troops of the country's pro-Muslim authorities and the South Sudanese non-Muslim rebels .  This news on gzt.ru continues the topic of humiliated and abused bloggers.  Personally, I think that a blog is not a symbol of permissiveness, and sometimes it is worth thinking carefully before posting pictures of your boss, negligee, in your diary.  And the point here is not that they can fire you, but in ordinary human decency.  Although in this particular case, I fully support Yana. <br><br>  ... Chinese authorities may force blog authors to indicate real names, excites the public gazeta.ru.  The state-owned online community in China called on the government to oblige blog authors to indicate their real names when registering online diaries.  I would have forced them to donate blood, semen and organs for transplantation.  After all, if they have time to run their blog blogs, then the more useful work for society should be.  Let sweep the area, serve in the army and collect rice!  Intellectuals, damn it. <br><br>  ... bybanner.com made an interesting selection of bloggers in the style of " <a href="http://bybanner.com/index.php%3Fshow%3D3144">I haven't written for a while, because ...</a> ".  Some excuses are able to plunge into nirvana.  Recommended for self-study. <br><br>  That's all for today!  I remind you that every citizen must oblige to grow and raise at least one hamster!  Hurry up, perhaps you will be able to feed the first hamster blogger! <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/179474.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/179474.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006430601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 43, 2006)</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288536/</a></p>
