We are a master distributor of Red Hat, Zimbra, EnterpriseDB and other Open Software (OPO) in Russia and the CIS. <br><br>  Here I will mainly write about the solutions we offer to create reliable, scalable, secure, and cost-effective IT solutions based on professional software for corporate use: problem statement ‚Äî proposed solution ‚Äî functional, non-functional, and economic benefits.  If possible, emphasis will be placed on the economic indicators of the use of open source software, including TCO, ROI, payback, etc.

      I will not enter into discussions of the advantages of OP / OPS over other software ideologies and any manifestations of holivarism will be ignored or suppressed.  Any abstracts cited in the discussions should be corroborated or logically explained. <br><br>  <b>OPO vs.</b>  <b>SPO</b> <br><br>  In my understanding, open source software differs from free software (open source software) by the fact of a price, since  we sell support services for open source software. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The service is sold as a certificate (contract) for a period of 1, 2 or 3 years.  Standard support includes the obligations of the software vendor, such as Red Hat, to provide the customer with a phone number and / or email address that can be addressed with a question about how the software works.  The reaction time of the manufacturer is dependent on the level of the contract and the criticality of the problem.  For example, <a href="http://vdel.ru/redhat/support/policy">Red Hat support terms are described here</a> . <br><br>  In general, the scheme of support work looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c6/8ed/be7/9c68edbe7eae6ce9c10ef4e688c5be43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Level 1 is served by Red Hat certified technicians (Red Hat Certified Technicians), who answer customer questions based on their own general knowledge and information documented in the Knowledge Base.  Problems solved at Level 1 can be described as ‚Äúcommon questions / known answers‚Äù. <br><br>  Level 2 is served by Red Hat certified engineers (Red Hat Certified Engineers).  Problems that could not be solved at Level 1 (i.e., those for which there is no well-known answer) are transferred to this level.  The task of Level 2 specialists is to: reproduce the problem, characterize it and, if possible, resolve it by changing the settings.  If a Level 2 group does not cope with the problem by changing the settings, as well as in cases when making changes to the program code to correct the error, the problem rises to Level 3. <br><br>  Level 3 is serviced by a group of escalation of problems, which includes experienced technical specialists, whose tasks are exclusively to solve customer problems.  They get a description of the problem from Level 2 and begin the process of completely eliminating error conditions.  If a change in the program code is required, these specialists write the necessary code, check it for error resistance, conduct a regression test specifically for the configuration of the client‚Äôs machines and, in some cases, issue an intermediate patch specifically for the client. <br><br>  Thus, the term GCO, hereinafter, implies an ACT, which has a price due to the occurrence of a specific contract to support the manufacturer's RESPONSIBILITY.  For corporate clients, the thesis ‚Äúfree of charge means irresponsible‚Äù is well understood, and this largely explains the success of Red Hat in the world. <br><br>  <b>Portfolio solutions</b> <br><br>  We offer quite a lot of products on the basis of OPO.  With their help, you can solve various IT problems, for example: <br><br>  Reduced cost of ownership of IT infrastructure <br>  ‚Ä¢ A wide range of mature and functional products for small, medium and large enterprises. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Services are cheaper than licenses <br>  ‚Ä¢ Server and PC Virtualization <br><br>  Compliance with the requirements of 152-FZ <br>  ‚Ä¢ EAL2 / NDV4 for use in ISPDN to K1 <br><br>  Support for critical business applications <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1C, SAP, Oracle, Lotus, DB2, WebSphere safer, more productive and safer work on Red Hat / MSVSfera / EnterpriseDB <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ensuring high availability and resiliency <br>  <a href="http://mkozloff.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D1ED809F4FFA9136!4040.entry">http://mkozloff.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D1ED809F4FFA9136!4040.entry</a> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Collaboration and corporate communications <br><br>  Application Integration and SOA <br>  ‚Ä¢ middleware, development tools and integration of cross-platform applications based on Red Hat / JBoss <br><br>  High performance computing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Messaging, Real-time, Grid (MRG) on any equipment <br><br>  A detailed description of the proposed solutions and IP architecture based on them are here: <br><br>  Portfolio solutions VDEL based on commercial open source software (OPO) <br>  <a href="http://cid-d1ed809f4ffa9136.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5/VDEL/Solutions/VDEL%255E_Solutions%255E_Overview%255E_Web.odp">http://cid-d1ed809f4ffa9136.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1% 89% D0% B5% D0% B4% D0 %BE% D1% 81% D1 ‚Äã‚Äã%82 % D1% 83% D0% BF% D0% BD% D1% 8B% D0% B5 / VDEL / Solutions / VDEL% 5E_Solutions% 5E_Overview% 5E_Web.odp</a> <br><br>  VDEL's view on distributed open source software architecture <br>  <a href="http://mkozloff.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D1ED809F4FFA9136!4047.entry">http://mkozloff.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D1ED809F4FFA9136!4047.entry</a> <br>  <a href="http://avasyukov.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-post.html">http://avasyukov.blogspot.com/2010/01/blog-post.html</a> <br><br>  Case Studies for HIF <br>  <a href="http://cid-d1ed809f4ffa9136.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5/VDEL/Solutions/Open%2520Source%2520Case%2520Studies%2520VDEL.pdf">http://cid-d1ed809f4ffa9136.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/%d0%9e%d0%b1%d1%89%d0%b5%d0%b4%d0%be%d1%81%d1%82 % d1% 83% d0% bf% d0% bd% d1% 8b% d0% b5 / VDEL / Solutions / Open% 20Source% 20Case% 20Studies% 20VDEL.pdf</a> <br><br>  Comparing the cost of owning a Red Hat-based PC.

The conditions of the affiliate program include the growth of the partner margin depending on the level of competence and the additional margin for registering deals with VDEL.  The terms of the new affiliate program are published on <a href="http://vdel.ru/vdel_program_release">http://vdel.ru/vdel_program_release</a> <br><br>  <b>Where we go and what we want?</b> <br><br>  IMHO, the market for GRO in Russia and the CIS will be in the coming years the most rapidly growing and active.  This is due primarily to the fact that, until last year, despite the heat of discussion of some open source software projects, no one in fact actively engaged in this market.  The existing sales volumes (otherwise, by definition, there is no market) still make the business on HIFs of little interest for most system integrators and other participants.  Our task today is to offer customers a serious solution for their tasks not only on the basis of the OS, but also on other necessary tools, and also to teach resellers and integrators how to develop a new business for them. <br><br>  A good help in this work is the growing interest of the state as a customer in OPO and the desire of most customers to reduce IT operation costs in order to free up funds for investment in their development.  As is known, about 70-80% of any IT budget is spent on maintaining the efficiency of information systems (operation) and only 20-30% on projects for their renewal and development.  Following the fall in the ruble exchange rate and a large dependence on software and equipment imports, the ruble IT budgets on average decreased by 30‚Äì40%, which practically halted investments in IT development in 2009.  Using virtualization and OPO allows you to reduce the cost of ownership and operation, for example, server infrastructure up to 10 times!  The savings can be directed to the development and new projects without increasing the total costs of the enterprise! <br><br>  There is a lot of work to be done, but we will be interested.  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80999/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80999/</a></p>
