Android OS <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/236027/global-smartphone-os-market-share-of-android/">now occupies</a> about 86% of the market of mobile operating systems.  If a corporation is not a monopolist in this market, it is close to that.  Google rarely attempts to enter the market with its own smartphone or tablet, so third-party vendors mostly work with Android. <br><br>  All of them install different applications, shells, update OS and applications at different times (some never bother at all, ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to update the software of their devices).  There is an opinion on the network that if Google released its smartphones, there would be no terrible additional applications or delays in updating the software.  "Clean" Android and timely software updates of their devices.  Now we have the opportunity to check whether this is true - after all, Google introduced its mobile phone in October, calling it Google Pixel.  Let's see what this miracle of technology is, and what features and functions the developers have equipped it with. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The smartphone, in fact, is available on the market in two versions: standard, with a 5-inch display and a slightly larger version with a 5.5-inch screen.  The configuration of both versions is absolutely identical.  The only difference is in size, battery capacity and, of course, price.  So, the basic version of <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/google-pixel/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle_pixel_obzori%26utm_term%3Dgoogle_pixel">Pixel</a> with 32 GB of internal memory of Google is estimated at $ 649, and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/google-pixel-xl/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle_pixel_obzori%26utm_term%3Dgoogle_pixel_xl/">Pixel XL</a> with 128 GB - at $ 869.

      The price may well be called high, and many fans of Google products were surprised at the cost of the devices.  Previously, the corporation has already released its mobile devices, for example, Nexus.  But their cost was not too high, rather, the market average or even lower.  All this can now be explained by the fact that Google Pixel is different from the "nexus".  The corporation decided to compete with the latest models of smartphones from Apple and Samsung, so it equipped the phone with top-end electronics and modules.  In this case, a low price could not be done.  As far as you can understand, the developers, creating the phone, pursued the goal of creating a powerful smartphone, the design of which would be familiar to the buyer. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI admire battery life, I tested Pixel XL for a week and a half.  Last Sunday, I conducted a broadcast from the match for two hours, worked with the phone and actively read Twitter.  At the end of the day, I still had a third of the charge, ‚Äùsaid Dieter Bon, a journalist for The Verge. <br><br>  As for performance, let's talk below, but design can be discussed now.  The fact is that many elements of Pixel are similar to those of the iPhone.  In general, now all smartphones are alike, almost like twins.  But there are more similar elements than usual. <br><br>  The display frame, the rounded corners of the case, the antenna lines and the location of the speaker are all familiar.  It is clear that Google has a sufficient number of talented industrial designers who could create something unique.  But here, apparently, the goal was not to frighten the user off by uniqueness, but to create the impression that the phone was ‚Äúhis own‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e8/f51/ad4/6e8f51ad4547453183959daa52175e83.jpg"><br><br>  But, of course, there are more differences than similar elements.  It is clear that the purpose to copy the design was not and could not be.  The original element is an insert made of glass in the upper third of the phone.  Perhaps this helps to improve the reception of the signal, and maybe the designers just wanted to select their phone from a number of others.  In addition, the phone is not completely flat, its back side is somewhat wedge-shaped and tapers from top to bottom.  Most likely, it is because of this feature, the phone seems more subtle than it actually is when you hold it in your hand. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="798253203242553345"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551362055526201716="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  New Video!

On the rear panel, the developers have placed a fingerprint sensor.  And it is very convenient, because the phone can be unlocked with just one touch of a finger.  This is probably more convenient than the same sensor, combined with the main button. <br><br>  The disadvantage of Pixel can be called the lack of protection against water.  This is somewhat strange for a phone of this level, but what can the developers do? <br><br>  Charges the phone pretty quickly via USB-C.  The phone has only one speaker - at the bottom of the screen.  It is relatively loud, the sound is reproduced qualitatively.  At the top of the case is a headphone jack. <br><br><h3>  Characteristics of Google Pixel, briefly </h3><br><ul><li>  Network: GSM / GPRS / EDGE, WCDMA / HSPA, LTE </li><li>  Platform (at the time of the announcement): Android 7.1 Nougat </li><li>  Display: Pixel: 5 ", 1920 x 1080 pixels, 441 ppi, AMOLED, glass Gorilla Glass 4 | Pixel XL: 5.5", 2560 x 1440 pixels, 534 ppi, AMOLED, glass Gorilla Glass 4 </li><li>  Camera: 12.3 MP, Sony IMX378 sensor, 1 / 2.3 ", 1.55 microns, f / 2.0, dual LED flash CRI-90, phase autofocus, laser autofocus, video recording in 4K @ 30fps, 1080p @ 120fps, 720p @ 240fps </li><li>  Front camera: 8 megapixel </li><li>  Processor: 4 cores, 2.15 GHz, Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 </li><li>  Graphics chip: Adreno 530 624 MHz </li><li>  RAM: 4 GB LPDDR4 </li><li>  Internal Memory: 32/128 GB UFS2.0 </li><li>  Memory card: no </li><li>  GPS and GLONASS </li><li>  Bluetooth 4.2 </li><li>  Wi-Fi (802.11a / b / g / n / ac) 2x2 MIMO </li><li>  USB Type-C </li><li>  3.5mm audio jack </li><li>  NFC </li><li>  Three microphones, adaptive sound amplifier </li><li>  Pixel Imprint Fingerprint Scanner </li><li>  Battery: built-in, 2770/3450 mAh, quick charge Quick Charge 3.0 </li><li>  Dimensions: 143.84 x 69.54 x 7.31-8.58 mm |  154.72 x 75.74 x 7.31-8.58 mm </li><li>  Weight: 143 g / 168 g </li></ul><br>  If we compare Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, we will see that there is no noticeable difference in the characteristics.  Of course, there are differences, but they cannot be called striking. <br><br>  Walt Mossberg of The Verge said: "This is the best Android phone I've ever worked with." <br><br><h3>  Work speed </h3><br>  If you compare the response speed of the phone to the user's actions, then Pixel is faster than the Samsung Galaxy S7.  As for performance, here Pixel is also among the first.  Perhaps the phone‚Äôs reaction to user actions can be explained by the fact that there are no ‚Äúbuns‚Äù that are usually added by smartphone developers to the original Android.  Pixel is the case when Google fully controls the software and hardware of the device.  Previously, the corporation announced that it intends to optimize the response time of the phone interface to user actions.  I must say that the developers have succeeded, and they managed to optimize the work of almost all elements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/017/7a9/039/0177a9039965434eabdf6fb14eb45eda.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Battery </h3><br>  Regarding the battery, you also need to say a few words.  The fact is that the company managed to optimize the power consumption of the phone.  Pixel withstands several hours of watching videos or streaming, working with social networks, instant messengers and browsers during daylight hours.  And in the end there are still a few tens of percent.  The Google Pixel XL battery has a large capacity, and it can work a little longer than a regular Pixel. <br><br><h3>  Camera </h3><br>  In Pixel, not only with energy efficiency, but also with other elements and parameters.  For example, the camera here is set quite good, and the pictures are of high quality.  No worse than the pictures that can be taken with the Galaxy S7 or iPhone 7. By the way, there is a laser autofocus here, although there is no optical image stabilization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/003/02a/ac7/00302aac7eb54bcaa173610b7c91eeb5.jpg"><br><br>  But the main thing for the user here may not even be the excellent quality of the photo (after all, other phones also make good photos), but the speed of the camera and the response to the user‚Äôs actions.  Camera app opens instantly.  Similarly, the situation with the receipt of images.  The smartphone takes a photo immediately after the user has clicked on the corresponding button.  There are no delays.  If a user made several identical photos, Google Photos will advise you to choose the one that turned out to be more qualitative.  The software will also make animated gifs of user-received photos. <br><br>  Camera settings are not so much, although it is typical for almost all smartphones. <br><br>  Google also added video stabilization, special software tries to level the user's hand shake and other negative effects using gyroscope data. <br><br>  Probably, if you compare the camera Pixel, Galaxy S7 and iPhone 7, we can say that their capabilities are approximately equal.  And everything else is a matter of taste of the user. <br><br>  ‚ÄúPixel is almost a perfect smartphone, I believe that Android should have been like this from the very beginning,‚Äù said Business Insider spokesman Steve Kovac. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEulTCmc700" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Review from Rozetked</i> <br><br><h3>  Digital assistant </h3><br>  It can be called up by long pressing the center button.  You can also just say "OK Google", which does not always work if it is noisy around. <br><br>  Interface Assistant (Assistant) is like a chat.  The user asks a question, the system answers.  The entire list of questions and answers is saved, if necessary.  According to the head of the company Sundar Pichay, the digital assistant communicates with each user in his own way, that is, it is an individual approach.  It is clear that Google to collect such an effect collects a lot of information about users.  But any technology company in one form or another does.  This approach can be praised or abused, it all depends on the views of the user.  But Assistant is really good and can help in some cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/f1d/ede/f97f1dede63e4b558482d75375d566ab.jpg"><br><br>  Voice can request the necessary information, and almost always the assistant will find exactly what you need.  He can also read what is now displayed on the screen, and, for example, advise TV shows that have something in common with what is currently viewed.  During cooking, you can request a recipe, while reading a book - information about the author, etc. <br><br>  Assistant has its own characteristics that make this assistant a really convenient means of obtaining information.  The user may, for example, reserve a table in a restaurant for a specific date.  True, the full force of the whole system will work only in December, when the corporation will add "Actions".  Then the integration of the assistant with the calendar will be almost complete. <br><br>  In addition to the above-mentioned functions, the assistant can do all the things that should: call the user‚Äôs command, send messages, change the phone settings.  And Assistant can find the right photos in Google Photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/593/8e2/792/5938e2792a53499d8d0b4692b5f94e43.jpg"><br><br><h3>  What is the verdict? </h3><br>  Google doesn‚Äôt have much experience with smartphones, but in this case, the company tried.  The phone is good for everyone - and high performance, and the lack of lags, and the camera.  The digital assistant surprised many experts from the world of technology - it works really well.  Battery life is great too.  You can wish for the best, but soon no one manufacturer will be able to realize the hopes of users for a longer period of work of smartphones in standalone mode. <br><br>  By the way, the protection of the phone is not too good.  The Chinese team of hacker whites Qihoo hacked protection in just a minute.  They <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2016/11/12/googles-pixel-phone-hacked-in-under-a-minute/">conducted an attack</a> using remote code execution. <br><br>  <b>pros</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Not bad while working offline; </li><li>  Fast and productive smartphone; </li><li>  Smart digital assistant; </li><li>  Good camera. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses</b> <br><br><ul><li>  No protection against water; </li><li>  Boring design </li></ul><br>  According to a number of journalists of technology publications, Google Pixel is the best Android smartphone at the moment.
