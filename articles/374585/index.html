      The study, which was <a href="https://auth.cardiosource.org/EasyConnect/Integration/Post.aspx">published on Monday</a> in the journal of the American College of Cardiology, is not the first of its kind, opinions against too intense physical exercises were voiced before it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Previous studies suggest that people engaged in physical activity, are 30% less likely to die ahead of time compared with those who lead a sedentary lifestyle.  However, the optimal intensity and volume of loads are still not defined. <br><br>  Long-term overloads can cause calcification of the coronary artery, which is one of the causes of atherosclerosis, as well as lead to diastolic dysfunction (a decrease in the ability of the ventricles of the heart to pump blood) and thickening of the arterial walls. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to the available data, no one has ever conducted research on the lifespan of athletes: marathoners, half-marathoners (twice the marathon distance) or athletes involved in triathlon, but they would clearly be informative,‚Äù said research colleague Peter Schnorh, a doctor at Copenhagen Hospital, with colleagues. Fredericksburg. <br><br>  The basis for the findings was a cardiological study conducted at the hospital where the speakers work.  For <i>twelve years,</i> doctors observed the condition of two groups of people.  The first, consisting of 1098 people constantly engaged in running.  The second group consisted of 3,950 people and its members were sedentary.  By the end of the study from the first group 28 people died, and from the second 128. <br><br>  It was found that the part of the first group, which was engaged in light and moderate in intensity run, has a lower mortality compared with those who lead a sedentary lifestyle.  However, the death rate of those who ran a total of <i>more than four hours a week at a speed higher than 11 km / h with a training schedule of 2.5 hours three times a week</i> equaled the death rates of the second group, whose participants did not run at all. <br><br>  This study does not allow to make unambiguous conclusions, and doctors recognize that the issue requires further observation.  The future results of the work of researchers from Copenhagen can be a pleasant surprise for those who run slowly, ‚Äúbarely moving their legs‚Äù (running at a normal / slow pace suggests an average speed of about 8 km / h). <br><br>  In an editorial to the study, the authors noticed that the work of the researchers was limited by a number of factors. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe study involved white men and women aged 20 to 93 years.  During the observations, besides the work, the doctors did not take into account other forms of physical activity that participants were subjected to, ‚Äùalong with their colleagues from Iowa State University, noted the kinesiologist ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Biomechanic</a> ) Duck-Chul Lee (Duck-Chul Lee). <br><br>  Lee and her colleagues note that since information about her habits and lifestyle was provided by people on her own, she may have errors and inaccuracies.  It is also alleged that a group of 127 people who were identified as ‚Äútoo zealous‚Äù runners is too small to get correct statistics on increasing mortality. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is necessary to continue research in the future in order to sort out this controversial issue.‚Äù - note the authors of the editorial article.  ‚ÄúIdeally, you need to do all the research under constant control, because our goal is not to intimidate people who want to train more intensively.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374585/</a></p>
