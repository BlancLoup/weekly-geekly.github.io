This is my first video, and it‚Äôs not entirely clear if you need such content here.  Consider this a closed alpha test, only for visitors to the Java hub :) </p><br><p>  Below is a full text transcript, who does not want to spend time viewing. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="vstuplenie">  Introduction </h1><br><p>  Hi, Habr!  The evening has come, and it's time for us to seriously talk.  I want to discuss with you a shame.  Singletons </p><br><p>  The fact is that I constantly hear from acquaintances in the drinking bouts, how they destroy singles on the review code and mow down the spring because Spring is slag.  And now my strength is no longer tolerated, let's clarify for all the garbage. </p><br><p>  First about why singltons are embarrassing. </p><br><p>  The oldest book in which it is said about singlton (well, at least, the oldest, which I saw with my own eyes) was written in 1994.  This is the book Design Patterns of the Gang of Four: Gamma, Helm, Johnson, Vlissides. <br>  Just think how old it is.  What did you do in 1994?  Some of our colleagues have not yet been born this year. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/038/1f3/126/0381f3126c9444e0b991a7d98a9e3361.png"></p><br><p>  Or, the second love of my life is the book ‚ÄúTest Driven Development‚Äù by Kent Beck, written in 2002. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/56d/f35/190/56df3519091a4c66aa6d1d85b68278b5.png"></p><br><p>  And this is what is written about singletons there: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/509/618/0b9/5096180b9cd04f5898b652fa83783f54.png"></p><br><p>  I‚Äôm not telling this to shake the old days, but to show what a monstrous button accordion is the whole theme with singlet singing.  Singles are hatile, when you were not yet born, or you were in elementary school. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d15/5b8/f37/d155b8f37575498582faef948b22ff57.JPG"></p><br><p>  Therefore, in principle, it seems to me that it is a shame to discuss singletons in public.  You can talk about this only with your closest friends, with your beloved woman / man, and with you, dear Habr. </p><br><h1>  Bright side </h1><br><p>  It is clear that there are all experts, and the ass feel the danger of singletons.  But the bum is not the best indicator, let's somehow verbalize our anxiety.  What exactly are bad singltony? </p><br><h2 id="globalnoe-sostoyanie">  Global state </h2><br><p>  Singleton is primarily a global state.  You get one indivisible, poorly managed global skoup.  This lack of control is a problem in itself. </p><br><p>  To illustrate this somehow, imagine that you have some kind of state machine or communication protocol hiding inside your singleton.  And if you want to automatically test it, then it turns out that a) you need to simultaneously test everything that touches the singleton and b) the worst thing is that these tests must be performed in a certain order. </p><br><p>  If tests are obliged to be performed one after another, the unnecessary cannot be thrown out of them, then very quickly we arrive at a situation where one test run is done in at least 12 hours, and this is very bad. </p><br><h2 id="yavnoe-i-neyavnoe">  Explicit and implicit </h2><br><p>  There is a well-known principle that the explicit is better than the implicit.  This principle, by the way, is incorporated in PEP 20, better known as "Python Zen". </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/40f/704/944/40f70494479144df9bc0acffc063b5f3.png"></p><br><p>  When you transfer objects not exactly to the address, but transfer them to the global state, you thereby hide the connections within the code.  This is super implicit.  As a result, the code quickly turns into magic.  He somehow works, but by itself, and he is no longer in your power. </p><br><h2 id="the-single-responsibility-principle">  The Single Responsibility Principle </h2><br><p>  The principle of sole responsibility.  That is, it is the letter S in the abbreviation SOLID.  This abbreviation is the most important in the life of any javista.  I respect her so much that I want to do a tattoo with her. </p><br><p>  This principle was once introduced by Robert Martin (better known as Uncle Bob). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/956/2d8/b00/9562d8b006a841e4b0a3b4f476ab7646.png"></p><br><p>  He argues that each object must have one responsibility and this responsibility must be fully encapsulated in a class. </p><br><p>  If we do a singleton, then in addition to his immediate responsibilities, he assumes another task: managing his life cycle.  It is no longer the calling code that decides how and when an object appears, it is not the usual environment that organizes access to it, but all this is pushed inside a singleton class.  In a sense, he really performs this task, but it is crooked and wretched.  Actually, like any code that tries to keep up with two hares. </p><br><h2 id="silnaya-svyazannost">  Strong connectivity </h2><br><p>  All components using singleton, or God forbid - communicating through it, instantly turn out to be rigidly connected.  Bound often have to unleash - for example, to write tests.  And, to test the code, thickly smeared with singletons, is very unpleasant.  Even a single singleton can seriously strain everyone: testers, TDD programmers, and podgadit on demonstrations of isolated functionality. </p><br><h2 id="specifika-java">  Java Specificity </h2><br><p>  In Java, there is no special way to record singleton.  Therefore, there are many ways to write it, and they are all ugly. </p><br><p>  First, everything can be crammed into a static field or enum. </p><br><pre><code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">Singleton</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">final</span></span> Singleton INSTANCE = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Singleton(); }</code> </pre> <br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">enum</span></span> Singleton { INSTANCE; }</code> </pre> <br><p>  But it will not be a lazy option, we do not need it. <br>  Although enum can still be made lazy, if you want. </p><br><p>  You can shove everything under synchronized: </p><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">Singleton</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span> Singleton instance; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">synchronized</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> Singleton </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">getInstance</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (instance == <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">null</span></span>) { instance = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Singleton(); } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> instance; } }</code> </pre> <br><p>  But it will be the brakes, which actually symbolizes synchronized, in the most typical use case. </p><br><p>  Or you have to use the double-checked locking option: </p><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">Singleton</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">volatile</span></span> Singleton instance; <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">static</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> Singleton </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">getInstance</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ Singleton localInstance = instance; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (localInstance == <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">null</span></span>) { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">synchronized</span></span> (Singleton.class) { localInstance = instance; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (localInstance == <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">null</span></span>) { instance = localInstance = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Singleton(); } } } <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> localInstance; } }</code> </pre> <br><p>  He looks even more disgusting.  Plus, the developers of the Java language expressed their attitude to this form of writing: </p><br><p>  "There exist a number of common but dubious coding idioms, such as the double-checked locking idiom, that is, the proposed semantics. " </p><br><h1 id="temnaya-storona">  Dark side </h1><br><p>  And, as it were, all these considerations in plain sight.  But there is another, dark side of the issue.  There are other people more practical.  They have their own standard answer: developers who are scrambling away according to Solid, on the Liskov principle, etc. are just theorists.  In real life, everything is wrong, and in fact singletons are needed.  And for this they have a special philosophy.  Counter-philosophy. </p><br><h2 id="globalnoe-sostoyanie-est-vezde">  Global state is everywhere </h2><br><p>  It is difficult to come up with a system that is not a helloWorld or a theoretical illustration, where a global state would not occur in the subject domain itself. </p><br><p>  At a minimum, a global variable is our real world in which we all live.  If we have some kind of computer game, MMORPG, we write it, then the single virtual world of the game is also a global state.  We will not have another life and another world. </p><br><p>  More locally, if you have a single database in the system, and this is part of the domain, then it often makes sense to attach to its uniqueness.  Otherwise, there will be no time left to solve an applied problem, and everyone will start writing a management system with an infinite number of databases. </p><br><p>  The argument about the order of the tests here also does not work: it is obvious that during execution, our only base should be raised first (and tests should be performed on the base), and then the application code.  If you raise the code before the base, then everything will fall.  Most of the projects that I saw, explicitly launched the database before the code, and did not see any practical problems in this at all. </p><br><h2 id="it-just-works-luchshe-yavnogo">  "It just works" better than explicit </h2><br><p>  Modern software projects are extremely complex.  Maybe these are the most structurally complex things, of all that humanity has done in its entire history. </p><br><p>  And sooner or later, in your project there are thousands of classes, hundreds and thousands of dependencies on external libraries.  Starting from a certain moment, you can‚Äôt manage them manually, smart build systems like Maven appear.  Maven appeared, as far as I remember, from the horror that the developers met when building projects on the Turbine web framework. </p><br><p>  Sooner or later, you realize that the system is becoming comprehensible.  Its complexity is too great to fit into the brain of one person, even if it is the most important important architect.  And you begin to look for such an automatics, which will itself think about internal connections, about indication and tracking errors, about automatic dataflow, and so on. </p><br><p>  Obviously, such a system largely consists of magic.  And in this case, magic is not something worth running from.  On the contrary, it is worth striving for.  But it must be good, high-quality, reliable magic. </p><br><h2 id="zhestkoe-luchshe-myagkogo">  Hard is better than soft </h2><br><p>  If the project is large and difficult to understand, direct hard links simplify the understanding of the code.  In case of an error, the location in the frame will be exactly where it originated.  Opportunities for building very simple graphs that reflect the structure of the code are opening up.  Compare this with really weak code relatedness based on queues, when an error that took off in one place of a system actually needs to be searched on the other side of the queue, or several queues ‚Äî such searches can take hours. </p><br><p>  As for testing.  If you look at how it is in reality, then in many projects testing is either not done at all, or done in a very reduced form.  The project may be thousands of classes, but only a few dozen tests.  And for the sake of this tiny amount, there is no point in worrying at all, and rewriting the system in a special way.  This concerns not only singletons, but in general everything - the real full-scale testing draws a lot of additional conditions.  In practice, putting testability at the forefront is not always a good idea. </p><br><h2 id="specifika-java-1">  Java Specificity </h2><br><p>  Yes, writing singleton looks ugly.  But in the IDE, you can always create a template of the "ugly" class, and forget about writing this unpleasant code manually forever.  As they say, darkness is a friend of youth. </p><br><h1 id="reshenie">  Decision </h1><br><p>  And so, we are on the verge of a real conflict: some people want singletons (in fact, just a global state, they just call it singleton), and others - on the contrary, strongly against it. </p><br><p>  An excellent solution is the transition from real singletons to smoker sigltons ... oh.  Singleton Beans from Spring.  What is the point: using <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/component/" class="user_link">Component</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/scope/" class="user_link">Scope</a> annotations (SCOPE_SINGLETON) you mark some classes as singltons. </p><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.stereotype.Component; <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">@Component</span></span> <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">@Scope</span></span>(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">Greeter</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> String </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">hello</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Hello World!"</span></span>; } }</code> </pre> <br><p>  Then in any place you can make a field, mark it as @Autowired, and at the start of the application in this field the required instance will appear. </p><br><pre> <code class="java hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">@RestController</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">HelloWorldController</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">@Autowired</span></span> Greeter greeter; <span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">@RequestMapping</span></span>(path = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"/"</span></span>) <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> String </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">home</span></span></span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> greeter.hello(); } }</code> </pre><br><p>  Note that this option solves all the problems listed above. </p><br><ul><li>  It allows you to use a global state, but it does not lock you up within the same context.  You can do as many contexts in Spring.  If you need to make a separate context for testing, it is done in a few lines of code.  Moreover, it provides convenient tools for working with the context, for example, you can get a list of all currently existing singletons.  How to do this in pure Java - probably nothing. </li><li>  It allows you to explicitly describe all currently existing singletons.  But do not waste time on manual dependency management.  That is, there is great magic in the code, but this magic is completely controlled if needed. </li><li>  It does not violate S in SOLID, because Spring controls the life cycle. </li><li>  It looks nice and concise, as it comes down to several annotations, and does not generally force the boilerplate code to be written. </li></ul><br><h1 id="rezyume">  Summary </h1><br><p>  The issue of singletons has long been resolved.  It is surprising that there are people who still do not know about it.  The solution is Spring and other systems of inversion of control and dependency injection.  Singletons do not need to mow, there is no need to het people who write them - they need to be translated into Spring and converted into our Spring-religion. </p><br><h1 id="i-esche">  And further </h1><br><p>  And since you have not only watched the vidos, but also read it to the end.
