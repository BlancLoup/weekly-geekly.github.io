Also, the task was to develop a mechanism for registering biometric samples and quality control solutions for the NBP, as well as launching the system into trial operation, including with the help of credit organizations that could connect to the system and start testing it. <a name="habracut"></a>

      NBP is a complex of specialized IT elements that provide for the collection, processing, storage, provision and verification of biometric data. <br><br>  One of the main stages of the project is the creation of legal grounds for the use of a remote identification mechanism.  According to the current legislation, the initial opening of an account for an individual is possible only with his personal presence in a bank branch. <br><br>  The State Duma has already introduced a draft law ‚ÄúOn Amendments to the Federal Law‚Äú On Counteracting Legalization (Laundering) of Proceeds from Crime and Financing of Terrorism ‚Äù, aimed at improving the mechanisms for providing banking services without the personal presence of a client using state information resources.  The draft law was developed to ensure the availability of financial services for citizens, including in remote regions and for people with disabilities, as well as to reduce the cost of providing them. <br><br>  The draft law contains a number of regulations that require the adoption of relevant by-laws, which are being developed by the Bank of Russia, the Ministry of Finance and Rostelecom, with the involvement of a wide range of experts and the banking community. <br><br>  The text of the resolution <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects">is located at</a> . <br><br><h3>  Unified personal data information system </h3><br>  On April 24, 2018, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation presented for discussion a new draft government decree, which provides for the operator to provide a unified information system of personal data that provides processing, including the collection and storage of biometric personal data, their verification and transmission of information about their compliance with the citizen‚Äôs biometric personal data Of the Russian Federation, the federal executive body that performs the functions of developing and implementing state policies  and legal regulation in the sphere of internal affairs and the federal executive authority in the field of security of information contained in this system. <br><br>  The document says that Rostelecom will be obliged within one day at the request of the police (MVD) and the FSB to transfer all the requested data to them.  This information will allow to establish the identity of a person, and the company is obliged to provide information free of charge "free of charge," the document says.  We are talking about images of the face of each citizen of the Russian Federation, as well as data about his voice, which can be used for personal identification, including when making phone calls. <br><br>  Fully implement a unified system of personal and biometric data of citizens is planned in the next 8-10 years.  It will be used in the financial sector, as well as for obtaining municipal and state services.  With its help, citizens of the country will be able to refuse to use the usual paper documents, because each organization will be able to identify the person by obtaining data from a special registry, for the storage and operation of which Rostelecom will answer.  It is him who will be obliged to transfer all data from there to the power structures of Russia so that they can ensure the security of the whole country and its citizens. <br><br>  The text of the decision is on the <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects">link</a> . <br><br>  This will be done "in order to ensure the defense of the country, the security of the state, the protection of the rule of law and the fight against terrorism." <br><br>  The decree comes into force on June 30, 2018. <br><br>  In early March, Rostelecom was appointed the operator of the unified system of personal and biometric data.  The introduction of a single biometric system in commercial operation is scheduled for July 1, 2018. <br><br>  In fact, in line with the implementation of the NBP, the Bank of Russia, together with the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance, is working on a ‚Äúpass-through identifier‚Äù solution within the framework of the ‚ÄúMain Directions for the Development of Financial Technologies for 2018-2020‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  "Pass-through ID" </h3><br>  At the moment, it is planned that the data of the passport, pension and insurance certificates will be tied to the pass-through identifier in 2019. <br><br>  Combining data will greatly simplify the interaction of citizens with government organizations and banks.  However, the introduction of a single number increases the risk of data being compromised.  But experts also note that the security of the pass-through identifier from hacking will be higher than the data protection of different departments separately. <br><br>  Over time, pass-through identifier will replace citizens with other documents.  By identifier it will be possible to receive financial services. <br><br>  A pass-through identifier will allow a citizen to find information about himself in any database.  For example, on the website of the Pension Fund of Russia for a passport number you can get the number of SNILS. <br><br>  This innovation will also allow combining the databases of various departments, and bringing together the information that customers often have to provide in the workflow process with the authorities, investment companies and banks - especially when starting relationships or depositing and withdrawing funds. <br><br>  <b>PS By the link you can download our <a href="https://goo.gl/MQ9pMm">White Paper on the Federal Law No. 152.</a></b> <br>  This is a book that was published to help eliminate confusion in the processing of personal data and clearly describe the process of bringing personal data to IP in accordance with the laws of Russia.  The topic is revealed from scratch.  It helps to meet the needs of a wide range of readers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358524/</a></p>
