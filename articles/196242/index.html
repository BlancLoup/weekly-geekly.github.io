She does not pretend to any categorical conclusions and moralizing.  And the truth in the last resort.  Everything considered in the article relates to the helpdesk-system administrator-system engineer profile.  I admit that programmers and middle managers are a little different.  But I am writing only about my experience. <br><br>  Those who are interested in the experience of building a career without a diploma in HE, welcome to the cat.  There will be many words and a bit of nostalgia. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f76/fb8/e57/f76fb8e57df70226e9a503a3c249244c.png" alt="image"><br>  A little about myself: I am 38 years old, my entire adult life, I work only in IT.  Yes, there were attempts to change the type of activity, but they were not successful.  He started his way with the usual twisting of nuts and wearing printers, getting to the head of the IT department, but now again just an engineer.  I like it, I love my job.  There are also separate directions ts  personal start-up business (again in IT), but the income from them is variable.  Therefore, I take it only as a hobby.  Yes, the hope is that sooner or later the hobby will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù into something more, it does not leave me, but ... But still it is a hobby, because  work (albeit without flexibility for creativity and uncle) has the main advantage - I can clearly be sure that on certain dates of the month my card will be replenished.  For a family man and with children, this is important.  Therefore, you have to keep your song pressed down a little ... But about everything in order. <br><br>  So, is it necessary to have a higher education in the IT field in modern Russia?  First of all, in my opinion, it is worth separating education and diploma.  Education is the level of personal development.  An educated person stands out.  My childhood was spent with relatives who were very educated personalities.  Several higher educations, scientific and management work, a certain worldview and an incredible ability to work while the burden of new knowledge continues unabated.  It all formed in me what an educated person should look like.  A diploma is just a diploma.  Especially in modern realities.  But these realities are such that sometimes the hair stands on end.  I had in practice two clinical cases ... But more on that later.

      So why did I just finish school and did not go to college?  Here the phrase ‚Äúdashing 90s‚Äù just fits.  But they are connected not with bandits, but with hard money.  So, two points that have had an impact.  The first time I ts computer  felt back in 1987.  It was the legendary Radio-86RK.  And from that moment I did not part with the computers.  In 1989, I learned about the ZX Spectrum (the so-called version of Zonov).  I was lucky (I learned quite by chance) and there was a circle near the house that was supervised by a well-known NGO, where schoolchildren were taught computer literacy on the basis of the Sinclair.  There we were given programming lessons, the basics of circuit design and, of course, we could play.  On three common specs.  But all is not limited to theory.  We were given printed circuit boards of the Spectrum and a bit of ‚Äúcrumbling‚Äù.  There were provided soldering places with the tool in the class of radio installers of the CPC.  Everything else was bought at their own expense (more precisely, the parent).  But one way or another, we were taught and we were helped to collect our Spectrum.  I still remember that boyish envy of a comrade who was the first to solder the Sinclair in our circle.  After all, now, I thought, he can play at home whenever he wants.  In general, an indescribable feeling.  But some time passed and I became the proud owner of my own toy.  Which after some time decided to sell, because  I wanted the option "Pentagon", i.e.  version with the drive.  Sale hit income.  Therefore, the purchase of the "Pentagon" was postponed, and the money raised bought components to build a few more spectra, which are also scattered like hotcakes.  And so it began ... What kind of study is there (moment 1). <br><br>  A small digression: there were also ‚Äúadults‚Äù of the Pravets PC at our circle, and it was possible to ask them to ‚Äúwork‚Äù.  So there was a little DOS skill and everything connected with it.  Plus turbo pascal 4th version.  A little later it helped me a lot ... <br><br>  I soldered up to thirty spectra a week, went to the market at the weekend and sold it.  Then he began to sell through the advertising newspaper.  There was a lot of money.  For 17 years, even too much.  I succumbed to temptation.  No longer interested in studying.  Switched only to the extraction of funds.  He slept until the middle of the day, then sat down at the soldering and setting.  It was enough to say that getting out of the house only for extreme reasons and for entertainment, having a free schedule, at that time I earned significantly more than my father, who worked as a welder and left home every day at 5 am, and came at 16 pm and was far from full of strength.  In general, I thought it would always be like this.  But 18 years and the agenda in the army.  Here it is necessary to note one more.  For some reason, I'm a person somehow honest.  Or as some people call me ‚Äúnon-commercial‚Äù.  So the agenda came and I, having no reason to postpone and conscience, to buy off (money was), I left for a year and a half to some exotic land. <br><br>  On return, the prioritization has changed somewhat.  The inertia of the ‚Äúlearn, learn, and learn again‚Äù school for 10 years has disappeared from my head.  A healthy pragmatism "must work and earn."  Especially since at that time boys-majors appeared in drape coats, with white scarves, purses and ‚Äúbenefon‚Äù tubes.  It seemed to reach out and everything will be with you.  What kind of study here (moment 2). <br><br>  Spectrum as a market for the 95th year, died almost completely.  Therefore, hinging on attempts to find my skills two years ago, I began to look for work on the side. <br><br>  It should be noted here that in the army I accidentally pulled out a lucky ticket.  Who served at that time, will understand how it was possible.  More precisely, impossible.  Calling in 93, at the assembly point I was asked what I know, I can.  I said that I know computers and all that.  They laughed "well, well, it will be very useful for you."  But it was prophetic.  When I served 8 months, several computers were brought to the regiment's management.  They found one civilian, who began to serve all this economy and needed ts  "Nanopisar".  And it turned out to be me, as the only soldier on the whole regiment, who not only knew how the monitor was different from the mouse, but who could load DOS and give the command DIR.  And the skill of working with Norton Commander and a clever look at the text editor Foton (at that moment I saw him for the first time in my life) made me a local guru <s>(and how I played virtuoso at Dandy)</s> .  I ended the soldier‚Äôs service (although it didn‚Äôt matter so much, since I had plowed off the year and was already in the status of ‚Äúgrandfather‚Äù).  I moved to the management of the regiment, where I began to study the IBM PC closely using the example of a game of Doom, Heretic, etc.  Surprisingly, the PC in the regiment were from 386DX to 486DX.  With a civilian guy, we quickly resolved and there was no friction.  Another 8 months spent in such a place gave me knowledge of the IBM PC, MS Windows 3.11 and MS Word (Excel) devices and touch typing skills.  Those.  skills were pumped at that time, God forbid everyone. <br><br>  And among all these computers, there was an unprecedented device of that time - a modem for 14400. The civilian guy said that the modem is such a thing, which ... Then there was a revelation ... So I met FIDO and BBS.  And smiley * here smiley *. <br><br>  So, by transfer to the reserve, I already had the basic capital of knowledge for finding a job in a profile.  But there was a first acquaintance with "without a paper you - ...".  Nothing confirming my knowledge, except the certificate of secondary education, I did not have.  Nothing at all.  And began the ordeal, which ended with the device in the guard in the office for a whole year.  I sat on the gate for a year and put off my salary on a computer.  For a whole year, I kept myself only for travel.  And now a year has passed and I have 486DX100, 4 MB of RAM, 630 MB of screw and ch.b.  11 inch monitor.  There was no more money.  I begged a modem from a friend.  I connected to the FIDO and began to monitor ekhi for work.  But everywhere was already familiar "you have no education."  And suddenly, here it is - good luck (well, how not to believe in it?).  An IT department was created at the factory and a helpdesk was needed.  The announcement appeared in the FIDO.  The phone number and surname of the contact person.  IT department is new, face is new.  No one knows anything about him.  Find - the whole quest.  But I'm even harder.  One and a half hours of naming, whining, threats, pleading and the right person was found.  ‚ÄúCome back tomorrow for an interview,‚Äù a tired voice answered me (this was my future boss, and as it was said in one film, ‚Äúhere is such a guy‚Äù).  "I will come now," I protested.  "And you will not have time before the end of the working day," answered the same voice without emotion.  "I have time," I exclaimed.  "Ok, try."  I jump out of the house, catch a taxi and fly a bullet for potential work.  Two young guys meet me there (we are still on friendly terms with one of them, although almost 20 years have passed).  I carry all such nonsense, to any questions "and you can ..." I answer "I can, I know, I can."  In general, it all comes down to "well, take me, please."  As one of them then told me, a quick arrival and a burning look were decisive.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear the guy really needs this job.‚Äù  And they took me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/d81/489/6a2/d814896a2175e12050db80ce819dda1a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Cheers, cheers, cheers.  I broke this line of defense and I had his majesty a real experience.  Those.  I now had a real resume.  More precisely, it has just begun.  But it was that very important moment.  After several days of agonizing expectations, the bell rang and the same tired voice (as I later understood, just a voice like that) said ‚ÄúCome, check out‚Äù.  It was funny and alarming at the same time (and suddenly they wouldn't take it?) It was in the personnel department, when I was given a bunch of questionnaires to fill out and almost everyone was taken back empty when ‚Äúyou have an institute?  - no.  Part of the paper is removed.  ‚ÄúWhat technical school?  - no.  Another part disappears.  ‚ÄúVocational school that is?  - not".  M-yes.  Well, write a job application and that's it.  Left one sheet. <br><br>  Well, after that everything became a matter of technique.  I learned about the Internet, about local and global networks.  About certification.  Here it should be noted that the delivery of the first certificate was the whole event.  And an incredible responsibility.  I then rented an apartment for $ 50 a month, and the certification cost $ 35 for the exam.  What are dumps, I at that time did not even suspect.  And I had no right to fail.  When zp  at 140 dollars and 90 dollars for a living the price of the exam was very significant.  And in the current work no one paid.  I myself have invested in my future. <br><br>  Then everything was more or less evenly.  From the helpdesk, I switched to a new job as a system administrator, from an administrator, to the head of IT department.  But since  I don‚Äôt really like to shift papers, I returned to the position of system engineer, where I still enjoy working in one of the largest integrators to this day. <br><br>  Have I encountered problems that I do not have?  Of course.  And what.  But I found a life hack to do this.  I do not speak on the phone and do not write in the resume that I do not have IN.  I write what is.  And only then, in an interview with a profile specialist (or as it was the last time, with a whole brigade of engineers and managers), I say that I don‚Äôt have a BO and I went to a conscious lie in the resume, because  otherwise I would have exactly zero chance of getting here and talking to you.  Personnel departments work on the "yes-no" pattern.  And if BO is not, then no one will look at your resume.  But I'm not going to work in the personnel department.  In general, in most cases it works.  But there were two points that I mentioned earlier.  Clinical.  First, when I was told ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care what you know and can do.  We need your diploma. "  Second‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Here it is necessary to make another lyrical digression. <br><br>  When I finished school (I repeat that it was in 1991), the topic of bribes in higher educational institutions was, let's say, not so acute (hereinafter referred to as information from friends who studied in the period 92-97).  Yes, then it seems like you could buy a test (not an exam).  At the same time, it looked like the transfer of money to an intermediary, the arrival at the credit and its ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù.  You bought it, or you actually handed it in, and the mediator simply appropriated the money - who knows?  But it was in the early 90s.  In the middle, it looked like this (hereinafter quoting) ‚ÄúI come to take the exam.  I go to the audience.  Only a teacher - you wanted something?  ‚ÄúI came to pass the exam.‚Äù  So - says the teacher - $ 50.  ‚ÄúHmm, but I came to pass, not to buy.‚Äù  And I have a voice from the table, "but you do not have time."  Those.  if at the beginning of the 90s the bribe for admission and surrender was on the level of legends and epics, then in the year 96-97, the price lists on the doors of the audience were not hung.  The question arises: who needs a similar diploma?  Yes, and a similar "specialist"?  However, rhetorical questions ... <br><br>  Once, when I was already the IT chief, I ran into a certified system administrator who came from the institute, was dumb as a tree and had no idea even about ping. <br><br>  And some time ago I was out of work.  Some coincidence, the company closed and I was on the street.  Well, it happens.  I know each other.  Who knows, maybe you need someone.  And here is the offer.  Need admin  OK.  I check with my prot√©g√©, did he accurately convey to the people that I am without VO?  Still, I don‚Äôt want to waste time (both my own and someone‚Äôs), when everything is fine, but when we get to the diploma, then immediately the interest is lost.  I avoid such patronage interviews right away.  But the man assured me that everything is fine. <br><br>  And here I come at the appointed time at the appointed place.  State office.  All solid.  People in jackets, security and tricolors.  Long interview.  The joyful faces of my interviewers at the end "this is what we need."  Well, everything seems to have shook hands.  And then, as if in between, ‚Äúwhat is your diploma specialty?‚Äù Well ... I told you (I call the name of the link) that I don't have a diploma.  On the other side, the disorder ‚Äúalas, we have a state-owned company, they demand it will not work,‚Äù etc.  sighs  Okay, I say rising, I was glad to meet you ... But what is it?  The look of one of the potential colleagues is becoming clearer.  He pulls out the phone "now, now.  I will give you the phone of one person.  He sells diplomas.  Buy from him and come.  We will even lend you money. ‚Äù  To say that my jaw fell out is to say nothing.  I fell and broke off everything that could fall out and break.  Yes, I was refused due to lack of a diploma.  Yes, I ran into different opinions about myself and about my approaches to life and education.  But so that, right at the interview, in the state-owned company I was offered to buy a diploma ....  Sorry, but for me it is beyond good and evil.  Moreover, this moment very clearly characterizes the need for a diploma.  Interestingly, then the representatives of this office for some time called me asking if I had solved the problem with the diploma.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Here I must mention my relative honesty a second time.  I always have the opportunity to buy a diploma.  Moreover, in the late 90s, mid 2000s, it was possible to purchase a crust for relatively little money without any problems.  But I have an approach - I am an honest person.  May I lose the potential work, than begin with the deception.  Who knows what?  Suddenly a career will trample and then my ‚Äúdiploma‚Äù will come out?  Or something else?  No, really.  It is better to let them accept me as I am, than my enemies (voluntarily or involuntarily) will have a chance. <br><br>  So what is the result?  Do I need a higher education?  Having traveled far from completion, from helpdesk to manager, having a pack of certificates, experience in leading large projects, teaching experience, experience in conducting seminars and public speaking, I can answer the following ... <br><br>  I can answer categorically - education is extremely necessary.  I would love to go back in time and correct this error.  And I would unlearn.  Yes, I did not experience problems in most cases.  Moreover, people are extremely surprised when they learn that I do not have IN.  But the feeling of some understatement remains.  Some inferiority, or something ... Ie  Higher education makes it possible to properly adjust the head.  Teach to think.  Teach to speak.  Makes you thinker if you want.  A person with a broad outlook and a flexible approach.  But do not confuse education and diploma.  A diploma is in many cases nothing more than a pass ticket for an interview.  In most cases this will be the first and last time you need it.  Unfortunately ... But do not go by deception.  I know not one and not two stories, when normal and competent people competent in their field and position, lost their jobs because of fake diplomas.  Right, it's not worth it.  It is better to make an effort and have patience than to constantly experience the feelings of walking through a minefield without pointers.  Who knows when and where it will ‚Äújerk‚Äù?  But patience and work, as they say, will grind everything.  Believe a person with 17 years of experience in the field of IT - perseverance and knowledge opens a lot of doors.  Moreover, stubbornness is sometimes more important ... I tried to get a job for eight years for the job where I work.  Yes, as it turned out, the reason was all the same diploma.  More precisely, its absence.  But still I work where I wanted.  And I don‚Äôt have a diploma ... <br><br>  And, of course, good luck to all ... It helps a lot ... <br><br>  Good luck. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196242/</a></p>
