I decided to share my observations about the quality of work and the speed of setting up some systems. <br><br>  So, the task is the following: to make so that an individual can accept payments from users of his site automatically.  I will not consider the situation with a legal entity, due to the lack of the latter, I will just say that you need to add time to conclude an agreement with the payment system, but the number of such systems should increase.

      In general, the technical connection is as follows: the user is issued an invoice for payment.  He chooses a payment system, after which he generates a form with payment parameters for sending to the website of the payment system.  When the payment is completed (or failed), the payment system server requests a specific store URL, and the store, in turn, credits the payment to the user's account.  After this user throws on the page with a comment that the payment has passed or has not passed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br>  <b>Webmoney</b> <br>  To organize automatic acceptance of payments using this system, you need to get a personal passport, and then add your site to the megastock.ru directory.  In my case, this process took a lot of time, since I received my certificate with the help of Russian post office and sending a notarized statement.  The store is added to the catalog (which is equal to the connection of the possibility of accepting payments) within 1-3 days.  Judging by the number of sites in the directory, this does not cause any special problems.  Prior to adding a site to the catalog, it is possible to test sending payments to your address.  In reality, money does not go anywhere, but you can catch errors in your code.  This is a definite plus of this system.  Who cares, <a href="http://wiki.webmoney.ru/wiki/show/Web%2BMerchant%2BInterface">here</a> you can see the description of the connection process.  There are no frills, the connection process can be considered quite simple. <br><br>  There are a couple of inconveniences: when registering a store in the catalog, you need to indicate on which of the wallets I want to accept payment.  When changing the list of wallets, you need to write to the support with a request to change this list. <br><br>  With the withdrawal of money problems will not arise: the funds immediately go to your wallet, so you can withdraw them and spend anywhere that takes WebMoney. <br><br>  There is no commission as such (there is only a commission for making a payment, but it is charged to the user). <br><br>  <b>Yandex money</b> <br>  Unfortunately, this payment system does not work with individuals.  In addition, I read a lot of reviews about the fact that they have a certain minimum amount, after which they consider the possibility of working with the store. <br><br>  <b>RoboCassa</b> <br>  Connecting the store to this payment system also did not cause any special problems: simple registration on the site, specifying store data and setting up a form on my site.  As in the case of WebMoney, robocash offices have moderated stores.  They require that the WebMoney logo and a link to the certificate verification be placed on the site and the store contact details are indicated.  However, there is a small minus, before testing moderation is not fully available: the payment interface shows the server's response and allows you to send a request for a successful or unsuccessful payment.  On the one hand, it's good that you can see the answer of the store, but you always want to see how everything will work in reality. <br><br>  By the way, the robocash desk has one drawback: after moderation, it is impossible to change quite a lot of parameters on your own: wallets for withdrawal, settings for the payment method for users and others.  Also, to activate the merchant, a WebMoney certificate is required not lower than a personal one. <br><br>  You can withdraw money either automatically (immediately or upon reaching a certain amount) or manually.  As I understand it, for individuals, the output is available only on WebMoney and only on those wallets that were specified before account moderation. <br><br>  Difficulties in configuring the store to work with this system also did not arise, here is a <a href="http://www.robokassa.ru/ru/Doc/Ru/Interface.aspx">link</a> to the technical documentation. <br><br>  The commission of this payment gateway is different for each of the payment systems and can reach 12%. <br><br>  <b>Qiwi Wallet</b> <br>  There were no problems with registration, a letter with passwords and attendances came immediately.  Two hours later, another letter arrived informing me that such a manager had been appointed.  Apparently Kiwi has a lot of managers and they arrange some kind of auction for the right to serve the store. <br><br>  Technical interaction at Kiwi is very unusual.  In addition to the necessary data for payment (account number, amount, description, etc.), the user's phone number must be sent to the Qiwi payment gateway.  That is, in the process of payment, the user must ask the phone, check it for validity, and only then forward the user to the Kiwi payment page.  To be honest, I don‚Äôt quite understand why this is done: it is much easier to make this option optional and, if the store doesn‚Äôt fill it up, then offer the user (or pull out cookies) right on the payment page.  I do not know about you, but I don‚Äôt really want to shine my number on a large number of sites, so this thing would be very useful.  Support promised to think about solving this problem. <br><br>  At this dance with a tambourine when connecting this system does not end.  Kiwi has three store connection methods: HTTP, XML, SOAP.  Moreover, in the first two methods there is no Qiwi server auto answer about the status of payment.  You need to independently poll the Qiwi server about the status of the payment.  Sapport suggested combining these methods: using the HTTP method for billing, and SOAP for feedback of the Kiwi server with the store.  To be honest, I have not worked with the SOAP protocol before, so I thought for a long time why there was not a single GET or POST variable in the request.  Link to documentation: <a href="https://ishop.qiwi.ru/docs/OnlineStoresProtocols_HTTP.pdf">ishop.qiwi.ru/docs/OnlineStoresProtocols_HTTP.pdf</a> <br><br>  By the way, note to kiwi programmers: if in the links to send the user to the page of successful (or unsuccessful) payment, there is a ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù sign, then the link is incorrect: the link is cut to the ‚Äú&amp;‚Äù sign.  Replacing &amp; on &amp; _amp_;  did not lead to anything. <br><br>  By the way, Qiwi support is slow enough: I received the answer to the question about the feedback from the store only at 7 pm (although I sent it at 2 am), and the response to the error message in throwing the user through the link did not receive an answer. <br><br>  Commission: Kiwi takes a commission of 1% from each transfer.  Funds are credited to the account instantly, they can be spent in the same way (and with the same commissions), as well as through the usual kiwi-wallet. <br><br>  <b>Sprypay</b> <br>  Registration takes place immediately, you only need to activate your account by clicking on the link from the letter.  As far as I understood, the moderation of the store occurred automatically, at least I did not receive any letters about this, but the status of the store was accepted. <br><br>  The connection process is quite standard, there are no such problems as for kiwi, however there is a small flaw: the payment system‚Äôs feedback to the store about the status of the payment does not happen immediately, but once a minute, so users should be warned that money will be credited to the balance over time. <br><br>  Of the shortcomings I found the following: if you pay not from your SpryPay account (for example, from a kiwi wallet), the notice of payment does not come immediately, but after a while.  And the user does not throw back to the store.  Documentation is available at <a href="https://sprypay.ru/sppi.manual.html">this</a> link. <br><br>  The service allows you to organize payment acceptance through a fairly large number of payment systems, however, there are some limitations: for accepting WebMoney, you need to have a personal certificate and submit an application so that they manually check it.  Some payment systems have a clause that the payment may be withdrawn within a certain number of days. <br><br>  Commission: you can configure with whom it will be charged: from the seller or the buyer, it starts at 4% and ends at 7%.  There are no problems with withdrawal - you can display manually a fairly large list of payment systems with a commission of 1% to 3%. <br><br>  From the advantages I can note the following: when my IP address changed, the system notified me about it by mail with an indication of the possible reasons for this situation. <br><br>  <b>W1</b> <br>  There were no problems with the registration, the registration takes place as for a regular user, you just need to go to the ‚ÄúOnline Store‚Äù section and adjust the parameters for yourself. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, there were no problems either, however, when verifying a digital signature, it is necessary to sort the received parameters in alphabetical order.  I did not find other shortcomings.  <a href="http://merchant.w1.ru/checkout/site/develope/">Here</a> you can see the documentation. <br><br>  Commission for payment (if it occurs through another payment system) starts at 5% and is charged to the user.  I tried to pay the kiwi wallet from the balance - the money came to the account after at least 2 hours.  Although they have written about this on their website, this is still very strange.  Perhaps, when paying with another currency, there will be no such problem. <br><br>  The withdrawal commission is available on a fairly large number of systems, starting at 3%. <br><br>  Unfortunately, these are all payment systems known to me that allow working with individuals.  It took a little more than a day to connect all these payment systems, the main problems were with Kiwi and the SOAP protocol.  By the way, of all the payment aggregators described above, only robokassa can accept Yandex.Money. <br>  If you know any other system that does not participate in the review, I will be glad to hear its name.  Also I will be glad to correct all inaccuracies that I could admit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126016/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126016/</a></p>
