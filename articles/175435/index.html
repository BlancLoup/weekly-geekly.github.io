    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After one project, I still have a board with a resistive touch screen based on the Freescale iMX28 module - <a href="http://zao-zeo.ru/catalog/sbc/118-tion-pro28">Tion28</a> .  Payment of Moscow development, the company "Electrical Equipment Plant".  A little bit about the stuffing: the core of the board is not the fastest ARM 454 MHz percents, but a rich selection of peripherals - several rs485, USB host, client, RS232, TWO Ethernet channels, 2 CAN interfaces, in short, a normal industrial computer.  The cost on the manufacturer's website - 3500 rubles + screen is about the same (I got it for free, because I did the project) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fc8/036/45b/fc803645b71c53fc8b2908d93223dfb3.png"><br><br>  The board itself is 10x10 cm in size, with a 12.5x10cm screen attached to it.  The OS installed WinCE 6.0 on it, offered by the manufacturer, the software was added personally, the file manager made its own in C #.  Next was to take the hub for 300 rubles, disassembled, the USB wire was bitten off and soldered to the USB host from the side of the Tion board.  Thus, the distance between the flash drive / wi-fi adapter / 3G modem remains between the board and the hub. <br><br>  <b>Now about the monster build</b> <br>  For starters, I took 4 racks for REA, sawed them so that the Tion28 board could stand on the surface exactly, and the gap between the board and the surface was minimal.  Then, using a glue gun, glued the board to the back of the screen.  The disassembled USB hub was placed on its side with the edge of the board, so that the USB connectors stuck out as little as possible, then glued the USB hub with a glue gun, additionally spilling the connectors so that they would not be loosened. <br>  So that the punk smartphone could be ‚Äútuned‚Äù on the go, I decided to make a quick-release cover.  To do this, screw the other racks onto the boards' racks (the board itself is clamped between the racks), a cover is attached to them on the screws. <br>  The cover is made of thin PCB, which can be cut with scissors.  I cut out the base of the cover, there are several sides to it, in the sidewalls there are slots for USB connectors.  Then I adjusted all parts to the size of the device and glued it with a thin adhesive layer on the outside, waited until the glue grabbed, and then turned the lid over and glued everything with a glue gun with a thicker layer.  Then the resulting box stuck with the remnants of a black vinyl film under carbon.  In places where racks fit the lid, drill two holes diagonally across the Tion.  The bolts holding the lid are screwed into these holes. <br><br>  <b>Operating system.</b> <br>  You can choose to install the OS WinCE 6.0 or Linux.  I chose Windows because  I have already put it under the project, and of course she gave one strong plus ‚Äî a ready-made Yandex.Maps service, for which I wanted to use a super-smartphone in the car.  As a modem, you can use a modem via a COM port, but it was more convenient for me to use a regular whistle like Huawei, which I use for a stationary PC. <br>  A set of software is small, but the most necessary is still there.  I threw on the board TotalCMD, Opera, FTP servers, several toys.  Toys went far from everything, doom, for example, refused to run for an unknown reason.  However, the device coped with web surfing perfectly, which is what I needed.  From under Opera I downloaded the Yandex.Maps device, they started right away and the image quality is very good.  Then I thought about connecting the GPS module ... In general, it will not be difficult, because  There are 2 derived RS-232, to which you can hook the GPS-modules, exactly like a modem, well, or some kind of card reader. <br>  About connecting a USB modem HUAWEI to WinCE6.0, there is a lot of information on the Internet, everything has been hooked up to navigators for a long time.  Wi-Fi was promised by the manufacturer, but it didn‚Äôt work for me, maybe there wasn‚Äôt just a client to set up a Wi-fi adapter on the device side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16a/c38/6ce/16ac386ce29315e53ba11754d45d27f0.png"><br>  From pleasant things: a wireless mouse and keyboard are connected to the device, i.e.  can be used like a normal pc.  Word and pdf-reader on it too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/925/fb0/5c3/925fb05c33f285646838331556cf5f21.png"><br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  What did I get on the way out? <br><br>  Heavy large (size 13x10x4 cm) slows down the smartphone, for which his friends called it "Soviet". <br><br>  The device turned out to be remarkable in that it was designed in Russia almost completely, although the ideas and basics were taken from a foreign site of the manufacturer Freescale.  The cost of this toy is well over 6 thousand, which makes it completely unprofitable, and the resistive screen with the power of the "reader" is also not particularly warm.  But the Yandex.Probki service went just super, it does not slow down, it loads very well, web surfing went off with a bang.  It is also nice that you can pick up a bunch of all peripherals on the go: LEDs, power outputs, etc. <br><br>  There are two obvious drawbacks: there is no sound and batteries.  In order to make the sound you need to make a scarf with an external IC codec.  Nevertheless, all problems are solved, the microcircuit can be obtained and the expansion card is not very complicated, it consists of 2 mini-jack connectors, one microcircuit and a capacitor.  BSP with sound support was given to me by the manufacturer. <br><br>  With battery power everything is much worse: the iMX28 has a special outlet for charging the battery, but it‚Äôs not on the board, and power consumption is not the biggest plus of this board.  As an option, it is possible to use universal chargers for 5 volts (the entire board is powered by 5 volts), although the efficiency will be very low. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, I recall " <b>Soviet calculators - the world's largest calculators</b> ." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175435/</a></p>
