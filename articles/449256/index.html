You need to go through 3 steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Send a resume, the programmer will look at it, like if everything is fine.  The recruiter will call, ask a few questions. </li><li>  Meet or phone us.  Find out what kind of specialist you are. </li><li>  Come on a test day.  Meet the team and work together.  Talk with the technical director, discuss salary and get an offer. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zk/ae/_q/zkae_qmkoa3gteriqrj0njm90e4.png"><br>  For three months I was the programmer who evaluates the resume.

    <blockquote>  The most important thing is that your resume is one of dozens; you have to be someone special to stand out.  If I accept the resume, then we both spend a few hours and can come to nothing, so the screenings are strict.  There is a myth that a recruiter looks at a resume for a minute, but with each resume I spent 10 to 40 minutes reading and trying to understand what kind of person in front of me.  Almost never worked.  There are reasons for this. </blockquote><br><h2>  Let's talk about your resume </h2><br><h4>  1. Headhunter template </h4><br>  Hh.ru proposes to fill in the typical form of the candidate: education, where he worked, what is his name.  It is a chore, takes time and has almost no result. <br><br><blockquote>  I can find out what your car is, but I do not know what kind of person you are. </blockquote><br>  It's all kosyachat.  The man spent two years on the project, made a bunch of tasks, worried, angry, blissed out by the result.  And he writes: ‚Äúrepaired bugs, sawed features‚Äù.  Let me list the templates, and you delete them from your resumes: <br><br><ul><li>  Finalization of the finished functionality. </li><li>  Development and implementation of new functionality. </li><li>  Identification and correction of errors. </li><li>  Releases and downloads on the App Store. </li><li>  Participation in every stage of the development life cycle. </li><li>  Work on agile methodology. </li></ul><br>  So after all, everyone works, there is nothing new here, it does not single out you among the candidates.  But that's half the text in each resume. <br><br>  You can write stories from each work, you did wonderful things on them.  What were these tasks?  What part of the program is written by you?  What rewrote?  What was difficult?  What have you learned?  Where zafafapili?  What was offered?  What failed? <br><br>  <b>For example:</b> I tried to implement Kotlin Native, wrote podspeki and integrated the build, but the team did not adopt the technology: they avoided risks and infrastructure complexity.  Six months later, they introduced a smaller project: they saved on development and better covered with tests. <br><br>  For some it will be a difficult task, for someone simple, but it has something to discuss. <br><br><h4>  2. Technology </h4><br>  This is my favorite.  Write a set of frameworks and external dependencies and pass them off for your knowledge - wow!  These are terribly common things that don't say anything. <br><br><blockquote>  UIKit, AutoLayout, Foundation, MapKit, CoreData, Realm, Alamofire, Git, TDD, CI. <br>  These are frameworks, not your knowledge. </blockquote><br>  List useless, tell us about a few, but in detail.  Maybe you write awesome scripts or know how to write a tricky layout for the collection.  You cannot guess what is important to me, but the level of your immersion will tell you a lot. <br><br>  I wonder if you are fundamentally avoiding any technology.  Never draw an interface in Interface Builder?  Thrown out Alamofire and rewritten to NSURLSession?  Tell us about the causes and results, discuss it at the meeting. <br><br>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are a viper in our architecture or not, those decisions that were behind the choice of technologies and conclusions after their application are important. <br><br><h4>  3. Tell us about yourself </h4><br>  It is a pity that in Russia there is no cover letter culture: this is when you write about yourself, telling what you are good at and why you are suitable for this job.  Hh offers a couple of paragraphs to tell about himself, everyone thinks that's enough.  Not!  Do not submit your resume until you have written an A4 sheet. <br><br>  What to write about?  Introduce your colleague.  What do you know about him?  What tasks can he do only?  What does he do badly?  What does he want to do better?  How did he come to the profession?  What experience did he have before?  Why do you enjoy working with him?  What is he annoying?  What does he want?  What task would you be assigned to him?  What is he: sociable, persistent, modest? <br><br>  So write about it, but about yourself.  You are my future colleague and I want to understand why you should be chosen.  I want to imagine how you will complement the other guys and what the team will be like. <br>  Find in yourself and cons, but I do not believe it. <br><br><h4>  4. Do not write short </h4><br>  On the Internet they write that the summary should be one page.  But this is nonsense, write as much as you need.  Do not write the obvious things, remember unusual stories and tasks.  Look for value in your experience.  Let me spend 10 minutes longer, but you have a chance to go further.  If there is nothing in the resume, then there‚Äôs nothing to talk about. <br><br>  The summary may be on 4 pages.  This is a lot, but it can be done conveniently.  On the first page the most important thing: a story about yourself, the same cover letter.  So I will know who you are and what will suit us.  On the second - all work projects.  On the third - personal.  On the fourth left what is not important for work, but it can be interesting.  Maybe you did not speak at conferences, but you want to.  Or previously worked in sales, and therefore can understand the problems of users.  This will read the most stubborn, but the text is optional. <br><br><h4>  5. Projects </h4><br>  Minimum project hygiene: clickable links, the essence of the project, your role and achievements. <br><br>  Sometimes projects are no longer available or closed.  Describe as you can: attach screenshots, tell by text.  If the contract can not talk about the project, then tell us about your contribution, because you somehow grew up during the work. <br><br>  Without a description of your development, I can not evaluate the project.  You have been working on it for a long time, but I see that the swipe to go back does not work in the navigation.  It is easy to find problem areas, but it is difficult to feel good.  Tell us how long the project was done, how much it was supported, what unusual problems you solved.  It is interesting to know how many users you had and how you worked with them.  You can write a small project with 100 downloads, but grow insanely on it. <br><br><blockquote>  How do I know about your height on the screen in the upstate? </blockquote><br><h2>  What if you are new </h2><br>  Yes, all the same.  But instead of projects you may have read books, completed tutorials, test tasks done.  It is not so important where and how you are now, like how you have grown over the past six months and who you will become after a year. <br><br>  It makes no sense to write a vacancy in 200+ thousand ‚ÇΩ without a mark that you do not need so much, but really want to work with us.  Tell me why, otherwise I will not believe.  Infect with energy.  Maybe we do not have junior vacancies, but your energy will bribe. <br><br><h2>  A good resume is a long job. </h2><br>  Writing a good resume is always difficult.  It is difficult to remember tasks, collect projects, write text.  It may turn out that nothing strong has been done.  Most likely, the tasks seem ordinary only to you, for other people they will be a wonder. <br><br>  I caught this designer, he did not know what to say.  At the same time, he was making apps for China in WeChat: a different interface, a different approach, a different language, a different culture.  But for him it has become commonplace.  But it's hoo! <br><br>  Maybe you are not looking for a job right now.  But then you have to write something.  What story will be in the summary depends on your actions today.  Make the task so that later it would be interesting to tell about it.  Maybe you write about it in the summary, and maybe it will become an article or you make a report. <br><br><blockquote>  I once heard advice: write an application for dismissal on the first working day in order to feel free at work.  It may lie in a desk drawer, but without a date and signature it is invalid.  If everything gets tired, then it will be very easy to finish the case. </blockquote><br>  The advice was not useful to me, but I liked the way of thinking.  The summary is the same: let it always be with you.  Made an interesting task - write down a fad, and then you will forget. <br><br><h2>  You are invited to chat.  What's next? </h2><br>  Put the program and find out what you have to work with!  Obvious advice that no one follows. <br><br>  Close those gaps in knowledge about which you know.  It is unlikely that you will have time to learn something new, just polish what you are good at.  It‚Äôs better to say that we didn‚Äôt work with technology than to scatter on questions about it. <br><br>  If you are refused - be sure to ask what you lacked and what can be improved.  Not all companies will respond, but this can be a good point for your growth. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  Many questions "why am I a janitor and easily refused to 52 people." <br><br>  We had a vacancy on iOS signor, a lot of big and complex tasks.  From unusual interfaces to acquiring.  Experience 3-6 years. <br><br>  On the other hand, we can take with simpler skills, if the candidate is impressed.  I watched everything they send us, so as not to lose a potentially good candidate. <br><br>  As a result, 5 resumes were in the spirit of "I can not do anything, but I want to program."  15 resumes were from people whose experience is less than a year.  18 programmed less than two years, but definitely did not reach.  14 more from the middle level of different levels, but not enough skills.  All who went further were strong midla, but there were doubts about someone.  HR fears were confirmed.  As a result, we had two who are approaching the position of the signor, but they did not find the middle one.  2 signora 80 candidates - a normal figure. <br><br>  This is not an instruction manual, just a different way of looking at a resume.  I am not an expert in this field, but an ordinary developer who just wants people to pay more attention to their resumes and find the most suitable job for themselves. <br></blockquote><br>  Subscribe <a href="https://tlgg.ru/dodoMobile">to the mobile development channel in Dodo Pizza</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449256/</a></p>
