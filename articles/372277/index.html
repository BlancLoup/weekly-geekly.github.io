  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sat.tv: TV program with an individual approach for free satellite TV channels HOT BIRD + interview with the developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A television program in the form of a newspaper or a magazine today is bought, perhaps, only by the most devoted viewers of paper.  Those who do not want to spend money and accumulate waste paper, prefer to learn the program through the Internet.  The most advanced download special mobile applications.  One of them is Sat.tv, created for users of the satellite channels of the HOT BIRD package.  The release of the application took place at the end of April 2016.  Its main features - a personalized approach to each viewer, as well as very detailed information provided on the channels and broadcasts. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85d/1c7/5e5/85d1c75e5e0845ac83402cfca58f6111.png" width="600"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's take a closer look at how Sat.tv works, estimate how comfortable it is to use, and determine how it differs from its peers.  Well, as a bonus - right after the review - you will find an interview with Nicolas Mulin-Fornier, head of the Eutelsat Connected TV Program division.  HOT BIRD satellites belong to the latter.  The company broadcasts 1,100 TV channels, more than 300 of them are free.  More than 66 million families around the world use the services of the satellite satellite HOT BIRD.  And the Sat.tv application itself reviews just those more than 300 free TV channels in 34 languages.  It is very easy to get lost in such a variety.  Therefore, in the subdivision of the Connected TV Program, they also attended to the creation of the Sat.tv guide.  It was developed by Wiztivi by order of Eutelsat, which provided the concept of the application and its wishes for its development. <br><br><h2>  Installation </h2><br>  Sat.tv is available for free download on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/sat.tv-eto-teleprogramma-dla/id1090009259%3Fmt%3D8">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.eutelsat.sattv.programmeguide%26hl%3Den%26utm_source%3Dglobal_co%26utm_medium%3Dprtnr%26utm_content%3DMar2515%26utm_campaign%3DPartBadge%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">Google Play</a> .  In this review, we will look at how an application works on iOS.  If you want, you can even get a link to download via SMS - to do this, go to the official website of the application <a href="http://www.watchsat.tv/">www.watchsat.tv</a> .

After the application loads the basic data, the application prompts you to register on the site - in other words, simply create an account.  It also explains in detail why registration is generally needed. <br><br>  To register, you must specify your e-mail and come up with a password to login.  After that, a letter with an activator link comes to the mailbox, clicking on which the user saves his account.  The principle of activation is exactly the same as in most other applications from the App Store.  After all these procedures, you can enter the program under your login. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91f/3a3/3ac/91f3a33ac18dec2a9a35de2c127e039f.jpg" width="500"></div><br><h2>  Personal settings </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f50/849/6b8/f508496b89d80bd1cafc29726690e61b.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Working in Sat.tv under a personal login is really much more interesting than as a guest.  In the personal account (the icon with the person in the upper right corner of the application) we see two tabs - ‚ÄúPersonal data‚Äù and ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù.  In the first you can change the username, year of birth, country or password. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c71/57e/3bb/c7157e3bb2ef7d771b3c289df641a096.jpg" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b0/56b/58b/5b056b58bc8a09268390b9d8f507554d.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  It is much more interesting to ‚Äúdig‚Äù in the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù tab menu.  Here you can customize the language of the application (there is a huge variety of them - HOT BIRD broadcasts almost all over the world), the language of the channels, enable or disable alerts, define your own prime time (in different countries and on different channels it can be yours) and so on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33c/2e3/5a9/33c2e35a9c67de9ea5952fb4f57d5db9.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  But that's not all.  It is more interesting to put ticks in the items ‚ÄúSelected program types‚Äù and ‚ÄúSelected program genres‚Äù.  And there, and there are plenty of options, so that the most demanding viewer will find something for himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/983/e17/ac4/983e17ac474b29dd841b9bb19ed3533e.jpg" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43d/f52/c11/43df52c11a4d5a6e2288e15cb8eaea13.jpg" width="400"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/282/6a6/580/2826a6580c1592273138a947b5f25f10.jpg" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46c/18b/e41/46c18be41d9cc71a05957de75abbad7b.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  Marked genres and types of programs will be taken as the basis for the selection of television programs for the user.  That is, those programs on the TV channels of the package that meet the tastes of a particular person will be offered for viewing - this is the very individual approach.  We advise all the same not to be lazy and scroll through all the options to mark the maximum number of interesting. <br><br><h2>  Navigation and useful "chips" </h2><br>  Using Sat.tv is extremely simple - even an absolute kettle would do it.  This is because from the very first launch of the application, hints and tips pop up on the screen, clearly showing which icon is responsible for what.  Developers call this the fast learning mode - and it will take less than a minute to learn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/834/203/b2b/834203b2bb1468dc79979db3af4cbc45.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7c/52f/52a/e7c52f52a8c4d99c966cfe86a79cdf3d.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/200/610/9a6/2006109a6ac7f4fdbd2bf060c89ab3aa.jpg" width="250"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the program helps the user in every possible way not to get lost, we will focus on its main functions.  So, the first thing on the screen appears "TVHID", the corresponding tab is active at startup.  Here, a tape of channels in the specified language and with the specified parameters is displayed (if there are none, the tape consists of the transmissions of all channels, of which, we recall, about 300). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/189/466/292/189466292f7b586f5b5a2bbfed76dade.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  A prompt immediately pops up that tells you that moving your finger across the screen vertically shows a list of channels; horizontally, an opinion about the programs of the channel. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12b/caf/896/12bcaf8960ff89091b7d707cbc99ba95.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Opinion (or a brief description) about the programs of the channel is easy to find by clicking on a given program.  In the new window, the expanded information about the transfer will appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96f/267/66c/96f26766c2d2531df04f1d3625c32a68.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/028/f56/c6c/028f56c6c70f72682c2e9617a98bf765.jpg" width="250"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e0/11a/802/0e011a8022f54347624a3d3ed3c2c167.jpg" width="250"><br><br>  You can view the list of all channels by clicking on the tile icon to the left of the ‚ÄúTV Guide‚Äù icon.  A list of channels with company logos will appear on the screen, the list is scrolled horizontally.  To learn more about the channel and watch the TV program of the channel for today, you just need to click on the logo.  Information here is in the language of the broadcast channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c3/70c/677/5c370c677aeae5c63c1bab2368da3d8e.jpg" width="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/023/60c/f3c/02360cf3cec78d3a90b84c6dd0889bb5.jpg" width="400"><br><br>  In the ‚ÄúSelection‚Äù tab (to the right of ‚ÄúTV Guide‚Äù) a selection of the most interesting programs for the user is offered, not only for today, but for several days in advance.  The list is based on the specified types and genres of programs. <br><br>  The tab, marked with an asterisk (to the right of "Selections"), is a list of TV programs that are marked by the user as favorites.  To do this, again, having selected the gear, press the asterisk. <br><br>  In addition to this option, there is also a reminder (a kind of alarm clock) about the release of the selected program on the air. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d09/003/1e5/d090031e590b9bccc8b8ccd8179a555f.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  In order to receive a notification, you need to make the bell icon active, as shown in the photo.  And at the right time, a warning about the beginning of the program will appear on the smartphone screen.  The Share icon sends us to social networks where you can express your opinion on the program and learn the opinions of other viewers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24b/93b/237/24b93b237d6e5a460df16b2930a75022.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Let's go back to the main menu sections in the upper right corner.  Next to the personal settings icon there is an icon similar to a funnel.  Under it hides the menu of quick change of program selection parameters.  Here you can see which types and genres are selected, as well as select new ones. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5d/0b3/e96/c5d0b3e967baae69fe372759c31e1f3c.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  Under the magnifying glass icon traditionally hides the ability to search for programs. <br><br>  As you can see, the navigation is extremely simple.  The main actions with the application are performed by clicking on one or two icons.  The TV program scrolls by simply sliding your finger across the screen.  At the same time, the possibilities of Sat.tv are quite wide.  The main advantage of this application is a personal approach to each viewer: a lot of settings where you can limit the type and type of broadcasts so as not to flip through the good hundred channels.  Plus program reminders, it's hard to miss your favorite TV show now.  It is clear that the channel list is limited to the HOT BIRD package.  For example, the widespread Russian channels here will have about five of them.  In this regard, there is room to grow, although this is more likely to relate to the entire Eutelsat satellite broadcasting service, and not specifically to this application.  In general, this TV guide is a great helper for anyone who really wants to spend time with the TV. <br><br>  And now, as promised at the beginning, an interview with Nicolas Moulin-Fornier, head of the Eutelsat Connected TV Program division.  We asked Mr. Moulin-Fornier about future plans, integration of Sat.tv with domestic social networks, application launch on other platforms, and much more. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1dc/c54/cba/1dcc54cbabbd8b52c9a24440cb3ede4e.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  <i>1. The Sat.tv application is a guide to more than 300 free TV channels from the Hot Bird package, while it includes about 440 free TV channels.</i>  <i>Are there any plans to integrate data on all 440 TV channels into the application?</i>  <i>By what principle are 300 channels selected in it?</i> <br><br>  The goal of the Sat.tv application is to support all open-access TV channels on the HOT BIRD satellite, as long as they provide comprehensive information about their programs. <br><br>  The application is ready to support several hundred TV channels.  And we are pleased to note that already now in Sat.tv there is information about the broadcasts of 7 Russian-language channels: Channel 1, TNT, CTC, Channel 8, Euronews, Russian Musicbox, Soyuz.  There is also support for the TV5Monde Europe channel, whose programs are broadcast with subtitles in Russian. <br><br>  <i>2. Are there any plans to release Sat.tv for other operating systems?</i>  <i>For example, for Modern UI Windows operating systems?</i>  <i>In my opinion, it would be quite convenient: to view data on upcoming programs, for example, on a working computer, to know in advance what program can be watched in the evening.</i> <br><br>  In the near future - within a few weeks - the Sat.tv service will be launched in the browser version.  And this means that PC users will be able to access it. <br><br>  <i>3. Are there plans to create Sat.tv versions for Smart TVs?</i>  <i>Such an application would look very appropriate, not only on a smartphone or tablet, but also on the TV itself.</i>  <i>Meanwhile, TV developers - Samsung, LG and so on - offer catalogs of applications in which Sat.tv could be placed.</i> <br><br>  We are sure that exactly mobile devices - for example, smartphones - are the best option for working with the Sat.tv application.  Because it is very convenient: you watch TV, and in your hands you hold a small tablet, on the screen of which information about programs is displayed.  Nevertheless, we are also considering the possibility of creating versions of the Sat.tv application for smart TVs.  True, the task is complicated by the fact that all TV manufacturers have different software and service platforms.  In addition, it will be quite difficult to navigate through our broadest catalog of TV channels using a regular remote control from the TV.  However, we are still working in this direction, considering various options.  Perhaps this issue will be solved with the help of HbbTV technology. <br><br>  <i>4. Are there plans to further localize the application?</i>  <i>It is very well Russified, but I'm talking about something else: Sat.tv has integration with global social networks, for example, Facebook.</i>  <i>However, in Russia, television audiences are much more popular than VKontakte and Odnoklassniki.</i>  <i>Are there any plans to integrate with them?</i> <br><br>  The main problem we encountered while creating Sat.tv is the focus of this application on a huge number of users from different countries speaking different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand belonging to different cultures.  Currently, Sat.tv supports 5 languages ‚Äã‚Äãand is available in 70 countries.  Therefore, initially we integrated the application with the most popular global social networks, and then we will take on the local ones.  By the way, next week an advertising campaign will be launched on VKontakte, the purpose of which is to tell Russian users about the existence of Sat.tv and the benefits of this application. <br><br>  <i>5. It would be very nice if at Sat.tv it was possible to watch at least a short video preview of the shows - to understand the presenter‚Äôs style, transmission structure, sound, translation quality, and so on.</i>  <i>Is there a technical possibility to create such an option?</i>  <i>Or maybe it is already scheduled for the next Sat.tv updates?</i> <br><br>  The principle of Sat.tv is the collaboration of the company: the owner of the satellites - Eutelsat - and the TV channels that provide the content. <br><br>  The preview of the programs can be found in the information about the programs of TV channels in Sat.tv.  In a word, there is a technical possibility for this, moreover, it is implemented in Sat.tv.  Then the word for the channels - and some of them already use this option.  For example, TV5Monde Europe provides relevant links to movie promo videos.  We hope that in the future their number will grow. <br><br>  <i>6. The site watchSat.tv, on which information about channels from the Hot Bird package is also available (it is, in fact, more convenient and provided by the application Sat.tv) is available only in French and English.</i>  <i>Are there any plans to translate the site into Russian?</i>  <i>in a press release on the release of the Sat.tv application, it was stated that the site is a kind of alternative to applications, but in Russia not everyone knows English and French.</i> <br><br>  Already everyone has access to an updated version of the site, which is also offered in Russian (a total of 9 languages ‚Äã‚Äãare supported).  In the coming weeks, we will update the site again, adding presentations from TV channels, and they will also be available in several languages. <br><br>  <i>7. What are the plans of Sat.tv developers for the next application updates?</i>  <i>What features are planned to implement in these updates?</i>  <i>What platform are you going to give preference when releasing updates - Android or iOS?</i> <br><br>  Currently, we are equally focused on Android and iOS, because these are the most popular mobile platforms in the world.  As for the plans for the development of the application, there are a lot of them: we are working on ways of interaction between the TV and mobile devices (for example, on using the latter as a control panel);  displaying personal recommendations not only on the smartphone, but also on the TV;  the ability to view content from a satellite on mobile devices and so on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372277/</a></p>
