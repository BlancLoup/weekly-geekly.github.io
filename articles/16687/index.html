  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hi, carriers.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In fact, I really love and respect all kinds of musical carriers and not only information, which does not negate the fact that they definitely stopped playing some of the roles that were played the day before yesterday. <br><br>  I won‚Äôt recover what was the first audio cassette I bought, but still lives in the boombox and from time to time plays Fugees "The Score".  The first CD I bought was Alanis Morisette "Jagged Little Pill".  I remember the last one, the Children's Panadoll "AM".  This album was once on my tape, but I just could not get past the disc.  And at the time of purchase there was from somewhere a certainty that it was from this disc that I would play these songs in clubs.  As it turned out, it‚Äôs inconvenient to carry around a disc box, and I don‚Äôt want to stuff it into the pockets of this thing, in which the discs are worn, because I won't see the box after that.  So I play songs in clubs from time to time, but from copies, and not from the original disc in general.  The very first vinyl in my hands was obviously not bought by me, whence the six-year-old money was for vinyl, but those records with Beatles and Alice in Wonderland were played at home quite often.  The first vinyl bought was Snow "12 Inches Of Snow".  This is the very record on which the same ‚ÄúInformer‚Äù, which in 2007 turned into ‚ÄúChori, Chori‚Äù.  The last vinyl today is Pendulum "Streamline".  Moreover, vinyl, unlike other formats, will definitely be bought from time to time. <br><br>  Due to the fact that I bought music a lot and often in my time, I quickly realized that, apart from cases with all sorts of rarities that would never appear in more than one point in the city, it is not necessary to pay the retail price.  Pretty quickly, practically all the Minsk wholesale warehouses were found, which, fortunately, almost all hid in the basements in a couple of blocks from my university.  And in a wholesale warehouse it is not at all necessary to buy something in bulk quantities.  Therefore, the tapes cost so ridiculous money that you could buy an album only to listen to it once, make an impression and never come back to it.  Well, the disc was collected, too, not one hundred.

      Then it came to the release of his music.  Well, if not quite yours, then the music of friends and acquaintances.  Given that the volume of the market in the country is not so great, even almost pop projects were released on CDR, not to mention the pirated releases.  Somewhere on the second groan of discs sold, it became more than clear that a small proportion of deductions to the musician in the price of the carrier is more than deserved.  It is still possible to predict the efforts to record your music, the efforts to design, print, cut and pack the discs themselves are generally very insignificant, but the task is to ensure that the disc with the music and the person who wants to buy this music are in the same a place at one time is already something from the field of higher mathematics and the science of rockets.  In Store A, Drive B may wait for the buyer for several months, in Store This drive will be purchased 15 minutes after it appeared there.  It is impossible to send more than 7 discs in one package outside the country.  There are practically no methods for obtaining money from buyers beyond the same limits.  Mail well, never in a hurry.  Sometimes it even seems that it would be faster to sail to that very Canada on a raft.  Received 3 dollars from a neighboring country - if you please spend a week in tax.  When sending within the country, cash on delivery is possible, but you can only fill in the form by hand.  It takes at least 20 minutes to fill out one form, so that everything is correct and without errors.  Well, and so on. <br><br>  So when the music stores began to gradually abandon the music CDs itself, I was almost happy.  And I can‚Äôt wait until the disks die out completely and in the nearest countries they will put electronic payment systems and content distribution for money on their feet. <br><br>  Yes, discs and vinyl will not die at all.  Only they will not remain as a way to bring this music to every home.  It will take quite a few years, and each disc will be a collectible edition.  He will be incredibly beautiful and will be indescribably pleasant to hold in his hands.  Only here, after familiar collectors who bought every rare release that my efforts turned out to be in this city, set themselves the last.fm, I was surprised to find that they absolutely-do not listen to music from their collection at all. <br><br>  And I'm sorry, interested in music.  And to listen to this music.  But not at all beautiful plastic stacks in beautiful packages that are gathering dust from someone on the shelves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16687/</a></p>
