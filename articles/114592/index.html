  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new type of legal content store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings, Habrovchane! <br><br><h5>  Prehistory </h5><br>  In the light of all the latest (now a bit subsided) events related to legal content, as well as my professional activity related to licensed software, I had a certain idea for a startup back some time ago. <br>  This idea was hatched in the head for some time, then it was voiced by several familiar people associated with web-site building, and then laid in the far corner of my memory with the hope of ‚Äúsomeday doing something‚Äù. <br>  But time is ticking, but these forces have neither the power nor the opportunity, so I decided to give it to anyone who wishes, if suddenly realized, I will be happy to use such a resource.  (although it may already have such, but have not met) <br><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  So imagine a large online store of any legal content: music, movies, books, software, etc. <br>  In the role of sellers, right holders are registered on the site, with an emphasis on the fact that it is desirable to register with the authors of the content themselves and receive money from sales themselves. <br>  In the role of buyers - any physical and legal persons. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By registering as an author, we are able to: <br>  1) add your content immediately in good quality <br>  2) add demo version <br>  3) choose from the list of licenses (more on that later), which will be distributed by <br>  4) set the desired price. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Logging in as a buyer on the site can do the following things: <br>  1) get acquainted with the content in the demo version for free: music with reduced bitrate, excerpts of video, book chapters, demo software, etc. <br>  2) read the content license terms (more on this later). <br>  3) to purchase content for a set price in good quality with payment online or offline (important for lawyers) <br>  4) download the content immediately after purchase, or even receive a physical carrier by mail. <br>  5) obtain an electronic license with confirmation (on). <br><br>  so, all this is tied to any social components - profiles of authors and customers, reviews, comments, likes, etc. <br><br><h5>  The two main features of the site: </h5><br>  <b>Chip times</b> <br><br>  Pre-compiled several types of license agreements for content sold. <br><br>  For example: <br>  a) for personal use in 1 copy / listen only on PC <br>  b) for personal, unlimited copying / listening on any device <br>  c) for indirect commercial purposes, temporary / for example, cafe music for 3 months <br>  d) for indirect commercial purposes unlimited / also music, but forever <br>  e) for computer clubs / games <br>  f) for further processing / music for mixes <br>  g) and any other kind of use <br><br>  Here, of course, the initial work is for intelligent lawyers, but this is only for one time. <br><br>  For each license, the author himself assigns a price to his content, i.e.  Having downloaded a new album, the group can set prices for a personal 100 rubles, for a commercial 100 thousand, or for a commercial one not to sell at all, etc. <br>  Perhaps it makes sense to change licenses at the request of major authors, but this is again a job for a lawyer. <br><br>  Accordingly, when choosing to purchase this or that license at will and having paid the required amount, the buyer can dispose of the content in one way or another. <br><br>  <b>Chip two</b> <br><br>  In addition to the text of the license with which the buyer will familiarize himself with the purchase and receive himself as a pdf-file (and in some cases can be signed physically), a universal confirmation of the right to use the content is not the presence of licensed media (as is the case with audio / video) or an activation code (software when buying via the Internet), and the presence of records in the database on the site. <br><br>  Those.  at any time, during any ‚Äúverification‚Äù, it is enough to go to this site in your personal account and see that these users have purchased these works / films / software under the terms of these licenses. <br><br><h5>  Where's the money? </h5><br>  The method of monetizing the site is quite understandable - it just gets a small percentage of all these sales. <br><br><h5>  Total </h5><br>  What is convenient for such a site for both parties, I think it is not worth explaining. <br>  For authors, this is a fairly simple way to distribute their content with a fairly large profit (as a percentage relative to any record company, etc.) <br>  For users, this opportunity is <b>convenient</b> (many now complain about it) to buy exactly for the purposes <b>they</b> need.  Plus, the lack of binding to the media / device when buying for certain licenses. <br><br>  Plus convenience in the absence of a temporary limitation of content sales, do you want to buy an album last year?  This is as easy as it was yesterday, and the author will also receive his money for it.  (everything depends on the disk space) <br><br>  After conducting a survey among their familiar network users (~ 30), almost all of them expressed a desire to use such a resource. <br><br>  Questions and comments are welcome, maybe they will help someone to make such a site even better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114592/</a></p>
