Private opinion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  First of all, I note that with this post I express only my opinion, which, again, in my subjective opinion, could somewhat improve the situation with the reception of the latest Windows operating system.  You agree with him or not - you decide. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://alexsparks.ru/sites/all/themes/alexsparks/images/blogs/win8better_a2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Used on a stationary desktop computer and tablet "Eyser."  In general, the system liked the speed on the face.  Conveniently, however, the speed of development depends entirely on what type of device you will use this OS on.  Despite the fact that ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù tried very hard to make a universal product, so far two concepts of the user interface (by which an ordinary user first of all judges) do not get along well with each other.  And should be.  If only because one of them is part of the other and replaces with itself (attention!) The contents of the Start button. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The discord caused by the lack of integrity is the main problem of ‚ÄúWindows 8‚Äù.  Otherwise, it's all the same "Windows". <br><br>  The ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button itself, the lack of which users most often blame, has not disappeared anywhere.  As already mentioned, it has undergone significant changes, becoming a full-fledged start screen.  Although the corporate flag that causes its contents is also present, it is only hidden in another area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe screen. <br><br>  And so, when using this OS in the current state, users will always be divided into those who use it on a mobile device and those who use it as a desktop application. <br><br>  The former, by definition, do not use desktop applications - they are more than enough to have a ‚Äútouch interface‚Äù and corresponding applications.  Even if they are going to do this by installing the classic ‚ÄúDesktop application‚Äù (the possibility of one version of the system allows it), this decision will be conscious and will remain solely on their conscience. <br><br>  The second, on the contrary, in most cases, this newfangled interface will be useless. <br><br>  It would be better if different types of devices received, if not their own versions of the OS, then at least rigidly fixed interfaces and the restriction of a number of functions.  For example, using only the ‚ÄúWindows RT‚Äù version for mobile devices, and full-featured ‚ÄúWindows Pro‚Äù for the desktop, where the Metro interface would be only one of the disabled features, would be more logical.  This, by the way, is also one of the solutions, which, moreover, would allow mobile devices to significantly improve their performance characteristics. <br><br>  But, since ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù, I absolutely wanted to please everyone at once, then, I will write my vision about what should be changed and added to OC, so that it would become convenient for ME.  Perhaps, for someone, it will seem inconvenient or impossible, but in my subjective opinion, such an approach would soften the introduction of a new concept, which is actually very interesting. <br><br>  So what needs to be changed?  In my opinion - not much at all. <br><br><ul><li>  In short, then generally get rid of the concept of the start screen and the unnecessary transition from one view to another. <br><br>  Namely, to make the "Desktop" thus the starting screen, represented by a tiled interface.  In this case, the list of all programs, access to which requires a couple of additional clicks (touches) and a transition, can be displayed immediately on the "Desktop".  It would not in the least interfere with the user, since initially it would be outside the screen (on the right side), plus there is always the possibility of expanding the necessary space to accommodate "live" tiles. </li><li>  Also lacks the usual taskbar and the ability to drag and drop objects and files (at least between applications).  This will be especially true when launching desktop applications in the Metro-interface, especially since in the proposed conditions this is the only Desktop view.  The existing area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplications visited is a rather useless function of the system, even on mobile devices, provided that the described features are present, it could have become so necessary a taskbar called, just as it is now pointing to the corresponding area.  Its placement is a matter of individual preferences, however, the position at the bottom of the screen, in this case, looks more advantageous.  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe commands produced on tile labels will not be affected. </li><li>  On top of that, you can safely get rid of the display of the user account located in the upper right corner of the screen and place it on the right panel.  In practice, switching between accounts is not often used, especially on mobile devices, since the tablet or ultrabook is personalized.  The efficiency of the procedure call, in this case, does not play a role.  Instead, it is better to display the current time - this is much more familiar and relevant information! </li><li>  Some of the tools from the ‚ÄúParameters‚Äù of the right panel are best displayed immediately on the pop-up panel itself, right when you call it.  Such ‚Äúremote‚Äù functions should be at least ‚ÄúTurn Off‚Äù, perhaps, but not necessarily ‚ÄúVolume‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnect to the network.‚Äù </li><li>  In the presence of these changes, the appearance and presentation of information on the screen will hardly change and will correspond to what we have initially available! </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://alexsparks.ru/sites/all/themes/alexsparks/images/blogs/win8better_b.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <strong>Additionally.</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  You can add features that will work (or not) depending on what type of devices we use on the system.  For example, return the context menu invoked by the RMB to ‚Äúdesktop users‚Äù. </li><li>  To enable users to place files within a tiled interface, or at least within a separate storage. </li><li>  Provide the start screen with scroll zones located on the left and right edge of the screen.  When you hover over them with the mouse cursor, the screen will scroll automatically. </li></ul><br><br>  In my opinion, such changes will not only make working with ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù more convenient on all types of devices, but also make the transition of unprepared users to the new system less painful. <br><br>  Perhaps it was conceived, however, within the framework of the new ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù development cycle, simply did not have time to fully develop or implement this idea?  Perhaps future versions of ‚ÄúWindows‚Äù will achieve harmony and appear before us in the form of more holistic and complete products.  Moreover, it is, so to speak, a pioneer. <br><br>  The general impression can be expressed by a phrase from a famous film: ‚ÄúI put the invention in five, and in the subject, two!‚Äù :-) <br><br>  Well, all right, all right ... not ‚Äútwo‚Äù, but ‚Äúfour plus‚Äù!  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169419/</a></p>
