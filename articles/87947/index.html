  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems of higher education</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have no doubt that such topics were raised here more than once ... but I wanted to present an opinion on this issue and (more importantly) to hear for comparison the opinions of others. <br><br>  It's no secret that most students are dissatisfied with the level of education they receive.  And not always the phrase ‚Äúwe are not taught in the university, we must study ourselves‚Äù is an acceptable explanation. <br>  I will present some, in my opinion, negative points that significantly spoil the attitude towards the university (based on personal observations): <br><br>  First, one of the most important problems is the lack of a concept of a future specialty, not to mention a narrower specialization.  And this is not the first year, where inexperienced students come to, who are answered with all the questions: ‚ÄúWait, you haven‚Äôt had any specials yet.  subjects, you still do not know anything to understand ", but in the middle of learning.  The most annoying thing is when you run in search of a teacher who can at least help to decide something, or tell at least about the directions you can go to, but you come across or lack a desire to talk (although it often takes 10-15 minutes) or the words that ‚Äúyour specialty is not needed by anyone, the specialists come out bad and no one works in the specialty‚Äù.  Why, then, to learn from it?  and is it not better to try to change something if both parties are dissatisfied with the quality?  You can talk a lot about a huge number of books, forums and websites on any topic, from which you can try to get interesting information, but you will agree, it does not compare with the opinion of a teaching / working specialist who roughly represents the conditions in which you are and can advise something sensible.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Secondly, the level of education itself leaves much to be desired.  Of course, no one will argue that it‚Äôs great to pass everything without especially straining, but when, besides the third year, you don‚Äôt remember subjects that were difficult (not from a teacher, but for objective reasons), it becomes unclear: why go to university, if everything that is given there can be studied independently, and even at a higher level.  I do not argue that the complexity of education is important for the preparation of a specialist, and, on the one hand, it‚Äôs even good that they don‚Äôt load much on secondary subjects.  But, when it comes to subjects directly related to the specialty, it becomes insulting. <br><br>  Third, there is a lack of practical application of knowledge.  There are many universities proud of their fame and reputation, they have connections with many firms and enterprises.  And it‚Äôs not even about helping universities to get the same practice or agree on work (even if it‚Äôs practically free, to get knowledge), but at least to report on them (because there‚Äôs little information about small firms, but any recommendations with students will not even talk). <br><br>  Communicating with friends who receive similar specialties, I come to the conclusion that this situation takes place not only in our university.  So, there are students who experience the same problems and solve them.  The purpose of creating a topic is the desire to get the opinion of students (especially computer specialties) from different universities on the considered problems of education, and also, perhaps, the history of definition with a specialization.  Are you satisfied with your education and do you regret your choice? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87947/</a></p>
