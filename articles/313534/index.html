This system can do a lot, so that the capabilities of Watson are used in many areas. <br><br>  For the first time, Watson‚Äôs advertising opportunities were tested in June.  Then the IBM division, The Weather Co., released its own mobile application that displayed blocks of advertising.  The advertiser, Campbell's SoupCo., Used the capabilities of the cognitive system to promote its products depending on a number of factors: user location, weather conditions, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Business Campbell's SoupCo.  is strongly dependent on weather conditions.  With extreme cold snaps, for example, some products sell well and others are not sold.  Warming affects sales just as much.  Jeremy Steinberg (Jeremy Steinberg), the head of The Weather Company, recently announced the company's intention to prepare various business models for cognitive advertising created by IBM Watson.

      Campbell was the first to agree to participate in an advertising campaign developed by our cognitive system.  In the future, similar advertising will be tested by companies such as Unilever and GSK.  Toyota also showed interest in ‚Äúcognitive advertising‚Äù.  In the next quarter, major retailers and financial organizations will work with us.  ‚ÄúWe are trying to determine the long-term business model, with what it should be.  Subscription is one of the options, just like the ‚Äúadvertising as a service‚Äù model, Steinberg said.  So far, our company has not given preference to any of the proposed options. <br><br>  The important point is that such advertising will be offered mainly to consumers of advertising content.  Moreover, advertising materials will not be focused on clicks or CPM.  Their main task is to encourage a potential client to act, to engage in the scope of the company, whose advertising is shown. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fc/7a4/fdf/9fc7a4fdf02b4b4bbf706e41ac1ee20b.png"><br><br>  For example, Watson may show recipes based on Campbell's experience.  Not so long ago, the cognitive system became a cook, so in the culinary field, IBM Watso can give odds to many chefs-people.  As mentioned above, all these promotional materials will focus on target groups of various sizes.  Advertising will be as individual as possible according to the needs of each category of potential consumers. <br><br>  The pharmaceutical company GSK (Glaxo Smith Kline) plans to promote its products to a point.  For example, the most active advertising of medical goods will be promoted in regions where it is cold, raining or snowing.  Or where Watson recorded outbreaks of colds.  Unilever plans to advertise different products in different regions, and the species composition of the advertised products will also be influenced by seasonal and even daily factors. <br><br>  Some of our partners representing the interests of advertising agencies will help IBM Watson in the advertising field. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313534/</a></p>
