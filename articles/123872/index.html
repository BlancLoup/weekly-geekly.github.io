My main goal was to see KDE4. * Live, for which the openSUSE 11.3 distribution was chosen.  Actually, there was not much to choose from, because  I can only get this amount of data from the Hacker DVD magazine, and all the other distros I have got from Gnome. <br>  A couple of months ago, in exchange for a long-lost laptop, I bought a netbook, naturally, without a DVD-drive.  And it didn't bother me too much: I installed Windows using a 4-gigabyte flash drive, and I simply copy the files from another laptop using a cross-over cable. <br>  But then it's Linux time ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Many fail and one success </h4><br>  Well ... Copying to my hard file, opensuse-i386-11.3.iso, I could not even imagine how many hours I would spend on installing the ‚Äúchameleon‚Äù. <br>  Naturally, the easiest way was the first to go into action: <br><h5>  Flash-drive + ISO </h5><br>  Armed with my own combat, which had seen dozens of images, thousands of files, a couple of controller flashing, and an incredibly buggy Kingston DT100 and UNetbootin drive, I set about putting the chameleon on the chip. <br>  The image did not fit on the disk.  There is nothing more to say.  Fail. <br><br><h5>  VirtualBox + real partition </h5><br>  In the magazine "Hacker" was published allegedly a very common way to install different operating systems from under Windows: connect a real hard disk (or a separate partition) to a virtual machine. <br>  So, what we need: <br><ol><li> go to the folder with VirtualBox and command: <br> <code>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename d:\realhd.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PhysicalDrive0</code> </li> <li>  Create a new VM.  allocating more resources to it, and connect the resulting <code>d:\realhd.vmdk</code> as a hard disk; </li><li>  we connect the image we have with the distribution kit; </li><li>  we start. </li></ol><br>  Works.  But this feeling remained exactly until I remembered that the Atom was inside my calculator, even the N550.  Moving the cursor - with a huge delay, about the reaction to pressing silent. <br>  In the end, by hook or by crook, the installation comes to partitioning the disk into partitions and mounting them.  Here it is plugging.  Up to this point I reached and failed on it 3 or 4 times: <br><ol><li>  error mounting NTFS partitions; </li><li>  check the previous one; </li><li>  canceled mount.  Got an error when cutting the disc. </li></ol><br>  In general, I began to sin on VirtualBox and its crooked connection to the physical disk (and in vain, and further experiments confirmed this). <br>  On this patience ran out, the disc lay down on the shelf, the image went to the basket, I climbed with the ‚Äúman‚Äù to create more productive ways to implement my evil plans ... Ah, yes: fail.

    <h5>  GRUB4DOS + ISO </h5><br>  Shoveling the folder with the distributions of various programs, I came across WinSetup.  But now it's not about the ‚Äúsetup‚Äù, but about the magic thing that is for him official - GRUB4DOS. <br>  I already read that he was able to directly load the OS from ISO, but the first attempts did not succeed - and it was hard to reboot each time (then I did not connect the VM to HD, nor did I know about the command line in Grub) .  Let's apply a more scientific method - reading configs templates. <br>  But first, using <code>grubinst_gui.exe</code> install the bootloader on the disk. <br>  In order not to interfere much with the life of the OS, I had previously prepared a hundred-megabyte partition (as it turned out, so later there was less fuss and more tasty buns). <br>  So: <br><ol><li>  choose a hard disk; </li><li>  update the Part List using the ‚ÄúRefresh‚Äù button, select the required section in the list that is full, focusing on the file system and volume size. </li><li>  check the box ‚ÄúGrub 2‚Äù and install (‚ÄúInstall‚Äù); </li><li>  Copy the coarse files to the root of the tortured section and get down to the menu, in my case the following items were added: <br><br> <code>#        (hd0,0)      <br> #   7,     . <br> title Windows 7 <br> rootnoverify (hd0,1) <br> chainloader +1 <br> <br> #      "d:\sys\Images\openSUSE11.3.iso" <br> #    Win- ()  *nix- () <br> title Install openSUSE 11.3 <br> map (hd0,2)/sys/Images/openSUSE11.3.iso (hd32) <br> map --hook <br> chainloader (hd32)</code> </li> </ol><br>  Another important point: the image must be contiguous, without holes, or, more simply, defragmented.  Take the advice of Grub and call on the contig utility from the Sysinternals kit: <br> <code>contig d:\sys\Images\*</code> <br>  Reboot, select the second menu item.  Installer.  Textual.  Requests to insert a disc by number one.  Let's play the fool and click "Cancel".  Settings ... let's send him an isosnik as a repository ... It didn't work out.  Well, okay.  Fail. <br><br><h5>  Smoke break and thinking </h5><br>  I hear, I hear the whistles of the venerable and not very linuxoids and the hooting command line gurus.  The cries of ‚ÄúGoogling!‚Äù ... <br>  Of course, it would be possible, but ... deep Adygea, Beeline modem, speed 32Kb / s ... It‚Äôs better a scientific tyk. <br>  In general, additional methods formed by poking a finger into the screen and the brain. <br><br><h5>  Flash-drive + ISO trimmed </h5><br>  I come back to the first point, take the ISO and set UltraISO on it - yes, only rpm chips are flying.  The image of "losing weight" by half a gigabyte and now fits perfectly on a flash drive. <br>  This time I wrote the disk using WinSetup (detailed instructions are attached to the distro), because  a recording made by UNetbootin "did not play." <br>  Reboot.  And the chameleon YaST refers us to the 4th item, namely the text installer and not a hint of the connected distribution.  Fail. <br><br><h5>  GRUB4DOS + ISO + unpacked image on ntfs partition (hope for success) </h5><br>  We turn to the next milestone of distortions - unpacked images. <br>  Since the text installer allows you to connect a folder to yourself, we will use this. <br><ol><li>  using an archiver (7Zip, WinRAR) or by mounting a virtual CD drive, extract the contents of the disk to a folder on the HDD (I have an NTFS partition), for example ‚Äúd: \ suse‚Äù; </li><li>  We will achieve the appearance of a text loader - I loaded using the 3rd method. </li><li>  we start virtualka and we try.  The face is blurred in a contented smile - after the text, the graphical installer was immediately loaded, even without questions (well, why did it not alert me?), - the crash of the VM and restart the poor netbook. </li><li>  Download our installer and smile slowly slipping: the same question ‚ÄúWhere is the drive?‚Äù doesn't respond to the specified folder.  The most disgraceful file. </li></ol><br>  And all because some people <s>(hands would tear him off)</s> did not unmount the ISO from the VM during the test!  It's a shame, comrades! <br><br><h5>  GRUB4DOS + ISO + unpacked image on ext2 partition (new hope) </h5><br>  Patience is running out, the brain is boiling.  Boils and does not know that success is so close ... <br>  To me, apparently, the insight descended, and guessed to put the distribution on the linux section.  But here it was not so simple. <br>  PartedMagic refused to run.  For all the above reasons. <br>  It's good that I already had Ubuntu in VirtalBox.  In principle, it does not matter what kind of distrib, if only it can be configured sections. <br><ol><li>  we connect to our <code>realhd.vmdk</code> our real-virtual disk <code>realhd.vmdk</code> ; </li><li>  we divide our unpartitioned area into additional sections - I did not bother and made two - for / and for swap.  Format in ext4; </li><li>  mount our future root directory (let it be <code>/media/suse</code> ); </li><li>  we connect the ISO image and copy the contents to the <code>/media/suse/suse_inst/</code> ; </li><li>  Reset, because the hot restart forces no longer exist.  Joke, you can't do that <s>:)</s> ; </li><li>  We do everything as in previous times - a text installer -&gt; folder (now on ext4, not on NTFS) -&gt; a graphical installer appeared -&gt; agreement and initial setup -&gt; disk partitioning, here you need to give up everything.  selecting manual settings and mounting our sections.  Swap, naturally, picked up without problems.  But the root ... It turned out that it is impossible to mount and, accordingly, install on the disk where the installation files are located - so as not to accidentally damage them.  That's it.  Fail. </li></ol><br><h5>  GRUB4DOS + unpacked ISO on a separate ext2-section </h5><br>  We do everything the same as in the previous attempt, except for points 2,3,4 - we have to create another additional partition (I did ext2), on which we place the distribution kit, which we specify when installing as a repository. <br>  Success. <br><br><h4>  Additional Kosyachki </h4><br><ol><li>  Watch carefully what openSUSE offers to do in automatic mode.  I, for example, he wanted to wipe all existing partitions and zayuzat the entire disk to fit your needs (although this was not under the virtual machine). </li><li>  The chameleon couldn't create entries for himself in the existing Grube, so I didn‚Äôt install a bootloader for him at all.  To do this, you need to write down all the info that he wants to put in the loader - the kernels and their parameters, and after installation, attach them to Grub.  I did this: <br><br> <code>title openSUSE 11.3 Desktop <br> kernel (hd0,6)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.34-12-desktop root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HM321HI_S26VJ9FB404025-part7 resume=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HM321HI_S26VJ9FB404025-part5 splash=silent quiet showopts <br> initrd (hd0,6)/boot/initrd-2.6.34-12-desktop <br> <br> title Xen <br> kernel (hd0,6)/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.34-12-xen root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HM321HI_S26VJ9FB404025-part7 resume=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HM321HI_S26VJ9FB404025-part5 splash=silent quiet showopts <br> initrd (hd0,6)/boot/initrd-2.6.34-12-xen <br> <br> title openSUSE 11.3 Failsafe <br> kernel (hd0,6)/boot/vmlinuz root=/dev/disk/by-id/ata-SAMSUNG_HM321HI_S26VJ9FB404025-part7 showopts apm=off noresume nosmp maxcpus=0 edd=off powersaved=off nohz=off highres=off processor.max_cstate=1 nomodeset x11failsafe <br> initrd (hd0,6)/boot/initrd</code> <br> </li><li>  When installing, do not mount NTFS partitions - this led to an error for me. <br></li></ol><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It was such thorny paths that I became the owner of openSUSE 11.3.  There were many questions, and even more appeared.  But that's another story ... <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I apologize for the lack of screenshots, but I could not get through this hell again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123872/</a></p>
