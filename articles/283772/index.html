The name symbolizes the step-by-step ascent to the mountain tops - set goals. <br><br>  To use it, follow these steps. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Make a list of things that you definitely need or would like to perform today.  It is desirable to be limited to 10-15 the most important.  The main thing is to think about why they are to be carried out, what benefits they will bring, what goals they will achieve, how they will affect self-realization, etc.

      2. Determine the priority of affairs, for example, using the Eisenhower matrix.  It is conditionally possible to designate low-, medium- and high-priority matters. <br><br>  3. Determine the approximate duration of each case in hours, and preferably in minutes.  For simple cases, you can set the full duration to completion.  And for complex cases, you can specify the time you are willing to spend on them today, but not necessarily complete them.  The sum of these values ‚Äã‚Äãwill give the total time for business today. <br><br>  4. Then you need to determine how much real time you can spend today.  For example, if you wake up at 8 o'clock, and go to bed at 24 o'clock, then there are 16 hours left.  From this time, 30-50% can be immediately deducted for buildup, breaks and rest, i.e.  6-8 hours.  Of the remaining 8-10 hours, 20-40% is better to reserve for unforeseen, urgent matters that may appear during the day, i.e.  2-3 hours.  Total remains 5-6 hours to do things.  To more accurately determine how much time per day is allocated to cases, you can use the timekeeping of personal time. <br><br>  5. In the received general time it is necessary to contain first of all the most important matters.  For this, it is better to use a graphical representation of the plan, for example, a Gantt chart.  At the same time, the most effective time according to the biological clock is better to allocate for high-priority cases. <br><br>  6. If the total time is not enough, then you can think about what matters can be delegated and to whom, which ones should be put off until later, and for which ones you can apply some technology to perform it faster. <br><br>  7. It is important to note cases that have a deadline or that need to start at a certain time, for example, meetings, meetings, negotiations, etc.  For such cases, it is better to add a reminder to the phone. <br><br>  8. It is also desirable that things change in dynamics, for example, to do active and complex cases first, then passive and simple, then active again, etc.  This will reduce fatigue. <br><br>  9. Particularly unpleasant things can be divided into intervals of 20 minutes, i.e.  20 minutes to perform them, then switch to more pleasant things.  After some time, again perform an unpleasant business for 20 minutes, and so on until it is completed. <br><br>  10. You can also make a separate list of "patches" - small and not very important things that can be done during unexpected breaks, for example, while waiting before a meeting or a meeting. <br><br>  The result of using this method will be a thoughtful plan for the whole day.  And its main advantage is the low uncertainty of what needs to be done, in what sequence, and most importantly, why.  It increases motivation, reduces stress, gives confidence and energy for quick execution of tasks.  And writing down all the urgent matters eliminates the obsessive and unpleasant feeling that I have forgotten something. <br><br>  By drawing up this plan is better to take seriously and responsibly, because  he will determine how a person will live another day, what will create, what benefits will bring, what problems will solve, who will help, how close to the goal of his life. <br><br>  If a lot of unplanned changes happen during the day, then it‚Äôs best to quickly adjust the plan.  This will allow you not to get lost and maintain a high level of efficiency. <br><br>  It may seem that such a plan is difficult and time consuming.  And at the first attempts it will be possible.  But the more often it is compiled, the more will be the experience and skills for this.  Then morning or evening planning of the day will take no more than 10-15 minutes, it will be simple and pleasant. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283772/</a></p>
