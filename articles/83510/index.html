  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We collect materials before designing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When creating a new site, special attention should be paid to the collection of materials before the design stage.  What do you think, what technical assignment will be carried out faster: according to a dry description of the functionality of each section, or according to the same description, but filled with concrete examples?  When the designer does not need to invent fish text and look for pictures on Yandex, or can you just make a copy-paste from the TK?  When the coder will have a rough idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe volume of texts planned for publication because they are in front of him?  When the programmer, working on the fields in the database, will have before his eyes the actual catalog element with all its parameters? <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúCan't you design a site without these materials?‚Äù</i>  <i>I told you that I want to see him, and what tasks he should perform, this is pronounced with genuine surprise on his face.</i>  <i>And with a light amberness of uncertainty in the competence of the contractor.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúOf course, we can,‚Äù the designer responds with a shrug.</i> <br><br>  From this point on, the time to create a site increases two, two and a half times. <a name="habracut"></a>  The reason for this is simple.  The designer only assumes what content will be put on the site.  Keyword - suggests. <br>  - Give five examples of products from your catalog; <br>  - Write a test news for your future site; <br>  - Please provide up-to-date contact information for your company. <br>  I chose three very simple and obvious things.  The site can be designed without these materials.  Each of the three points listed above can be replaced with a pile of questions that reveal the theme of boobs. <br>  - How many categories of goods will be in your catalog? <br>  - Each product will be accompanied by one or more images? <br>  - Do you have your own studio to photograph six thousand items of goods from three sides? <br>  - Do different product groups have repetitive characteristics? <br>  - How often do you plan to write news? <br>  - Who will do this? <br>  - Will there be news from other sites with sources? <br>  - Are you ready to look for thematic pictures that illustrate each news? <br>  - How many offices in your company? <br>  - How many departments are there and which ones? <br>  - Does each department have their own phone number? <br>  - Extension numbers? <br>  - Who will check the mail? <br>  And so on and so forth.  And well, if the customer is really ready to lay out a round sum for the development and "fully rely on the professionals."  In fact, due to limited budgets, he is trying to save on anything, and he calls you ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù in this context: <br>  - You are professionals.  Why do you need all this information for the development of the site? <br>  And it turns out that by the time the project is submitted, endless series of adjustments, amendments, then corrections of errors in connection with the introduction of corrections begin.  After that the technical task rises and it becomes clear that it does not coincide with what is at the output.  By this time, all possible man hours have already been spent.  The text on the main page is too bulky and the fact that the design fit without a scrollbar is now scattered three pages down.  In the section with contact information there was only an e-mail address, lonely and unhappy, and in the catalog instead of six thousand items there are only a few dozen, filtering by which gives us an average of one result per page.
