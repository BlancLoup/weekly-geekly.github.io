  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why does the Ministry of Industry and Trade reduce the program of import substitution of electronics to the detriment of the interests of the state</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two years ago, the electrical industry in Russia was in a state of stagnation.  Electronic components necessary for the production, maintenance and repair of state and defense facilities (including the GLONASS system) were imported.  The potential of factories and plants was not actually used. <br><br>  Refusing to import electronic components created a vacuum and nervous condition in the domestic market.  Global positioning systems GLONASS are left without a component base.  Russian electronics did not fit the tasks of the domestic navigation system, <a href="http://delonovosti.ru/business/3291-rossiyskaya-elektronika-rost-v-usloviyah-importozamescheniya.html">wrote</a> "Business News".  According to Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin, the enterprises currently being developed will reach the required level by 2018.  It was decided to develop the domestic industry. <br><br>  However, yesterday it became known that the initiators of import substitution of electronics are going to give a "back up". <a name="habracut"></a>  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has published a new edition of the state program for the development of the electronic and electronic industry.  The new state program will cost the federal budget 173.9 billion rubles.  Initially, this amount was to reach 175.6 billion rubles.  Planned expenses did not fall because the agency had figured out how to save.  In January, the Ministry of Industry and Trade set a task for Russian manufacturers to occupy 60% of the domestic market until 2025, but now it‚Äôs only 35%.

      In addition, the program excluded the support of radio electronics for medical products, for which it was planned to allocate 16.2 billion rubles.  Estimates of the share currently occupied by the Russian high-tech equipment on the market coincide in both options - 18‚Äì19% at the end of 2014. <cut><br><br>  The Ministry of Industry and Trade proposes to send 42.8 billion rubles to support the production of telecommunications equipment (in the previous version it was 36 billion rubles).  By 2020, the share of imports in this area should fall to 60%, and by 2025 - to 40%, suggested the first version of the state program.  Now we are talking about 88 and 70%, respectively.  To support the production of computing equipment, the department proposes to send 40.5 billion rubles instead of the previous 37.48 billion, Vedomosti reports. <br><br>  The production of computers, where computers, servers, processors and mobile gadgets fall, should increase significantly by 2025 - it is planned to reduce imports to 93.3%, although earlier it was about 95%.  The representative of the agency stressed to "Vedomosti" that this is a serious progress, considering that now the share of the domestic product in this segment accounts for less than 1%.  By the way, this is the only direction, the planned share of which is more optimistic, compared with the previous edition. <br><br>  The production of semiconductors, radio components and radio components will cost the federal budget 28.6 billion rubles instead of 26.17 billion.  By 2020, the share of imports here should fall to 89%, and by 2025 - to 72.4% (previous targets - 68 and 45%, respectively).  The production of intelligent control systems should now cost 12.7 billion rubles instead of 8.7 billion; by 2020, import systems will occupy 80.3% of the market against 36% planned, and by 2025 - 76.5 against 29%. <br><br>  When developing the previous version of the program, the Ministry of Industry and Trade proceeded from the latest official forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development: annual inflation is 4‚Äì4.7% and the exchange rate is about 35 rubles per dollar.  But the current situation has put the agency before a choice: reducing costs or revising the program.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has found a kind of compromise, reducing both the budget and the development plan.  The money for the state program has already been taken into account in the draft federal budget for the next year. <br><br>  The priority development areas of the Ministry of Industry and Trade consider: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ development of telecommunication equipment; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ development of equipment for fifth-generation mobile networks; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ development of hardware platforms for industrial enterprises and special-purpose objects (for example, on the Elbrus processor); <br>  ‚Ä¢ development of equipment for the production of semiconductors and for acceptance tests of electronic components; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ creation of Russian personal computing equipment. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.angstrem.ru/products">Angstrem</a> NPO CEO Alexei Bocharov and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2-%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">T-Platforms</a> representative (owns 75% of the Russian manufacturer of Baikal Electronics microprocessors) Elena Churakova consider the new plan realistic.  A representative of the Zelenograd plant <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%2598%25D0%2598%25D0%259C%25D0%25AD_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">"Micron"</a> Alexey Dianov does not exclude further adjustments to the program and stresses the need for state support to compete with international companies. <br><br>  Recall that the latter are worried about innovations in public procurement software, and even <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2845568">threaten</a> to leave the Russian market.  It is possible that equipment manufacturers will also be upset if there are special conditions for local companies in the country. <br><br>  On October 3, Interfax <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/business/471000">reported</a> that the Ministry of Industry and Trade is asking for a capital increase of the Industry Development Fund for at least 20 billion rubles. <br><br>  The head of department, Denis Manturov, noted that, taking into account the meeting of the last expert council, 40 loans worth 14 billion rubles had already been approved this year.  By the end of the year, he said, it is planned to distribute the remaining capital. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMoreover, the key factors in making a decision are the presence of a project in one of the sectoral plans and its support from the region,‚Äù the minister stressed. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295946/</a></p>
