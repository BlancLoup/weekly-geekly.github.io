This happens sometimes.  First comes the idea, and then the appropriate name for it. <br><br>  The idea came to us at the end of March 2007.  While everything was pondered, by the beginning of May a name was born.  According to which on May 11, 2007 the domain name for the project was registered - <a href="http://www.vladelia.ru/">vladelia.ru</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you might guess, the word "owner" comes from the word "own".  Let's look into the dictionary:

      <strong>To own is to own something, to possess</strong> . <br><br>  Everything is very concise and clear.  Wonderful!  Our Internet project will revolve around everything you can own. <br><br>  <strong>Judge for yourself</strong> .  Each of us owns something in this life ‚Äî a mobile phone, a personal computer, a food processor, all furniture, a car, a summer house, and so on.  Let's call it all in one word - possession.  Each of us, constantly or periodically (from someone as with money), acquires something.  And sometimes he is ready to say goodbye to any of his possessions. <br><br>  So ... <br><br>  <strong>If we approach according to the mind</strong> , all our possessions need to be taken into account and controlled, like that of a zealous owner.  When and why they bought, for how much, where, in what condition and under what circumstances.  Great!  This is a part of our life, and not a small one!  Who among us knows how much money he has for ‚Äúevery good‚Äù?  But it would be interesting to know all this and always have this information at hand. <br><br>  For each property, we have our own rating, reviews.  It would be nice to <strong>organize a program</strong> for this all, so that everything in its possessions could be written there - notes, tips, pros and cons. <br><br>  That each possession could be <strong>supplied with a photo or even the whole photo gallery</strong> . <br><br>  But it would be still good to somehow <strong>find owners of similar properties</strong> so that you can exchange information, ask questions, clarify some points ... interests me. <br><br>  Yes, finally, to <strong>help someone with advice</strong> based on their real experience on the acquisition of a product. <br><br>  And under all this organize a community of interest, more precisely on possessions.  It somehow inspires, and the commonality of interests brings together.  You can make a lot of new and useful dating.  Share experiences. <br><br>  But for these purposes it would be good to organize <strong>an instant messaging and alert service</strong> . <br><br>  And it would be convenient to have the opportunity <strong>to put their possessions on the flea market</strong> .  I clicked on the corresponding button in the list and the possession went to the virtual flea market with a corresponding accompanying comment ... Who knows, this possession will come in handy. <br><br>  And yet, <strong>this is a real paradise for collectors</strong> .  Books, music, films, stamps, coins, home flowers, pets.  Wow!  Show, show, marvel yourself on other collections and even exchange. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18311/</a></p>
