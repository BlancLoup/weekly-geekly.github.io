Design of high-load systems (fall 2017)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/7u/hn/fn7uhntwetzsbaowp0ite_lq7ki.png"><br><br>  We are starting to publish the lectures of Technopolis, an educational project of the Odnoklassniki team at the St. Petersburg Polytechnic University of Peter the Great.  Creating high-load applications is not only designing and writing code, but also a huge number of other aspects throughout the product life cycle.  We will go through the whole process of creating and using a high-load system.  Particular attention will be paid to the features of operation, networks, load balancing, memory hierarchy, everyday tools.  We will also talk about monitoring, auditing and much more.  The lectures of the course are given by a team of experts under the leadership of the leading developer at Odnoklassniki, Vadim Tsesko. <br><br>  List of lectures:

Introduction (Vadim Tsesko) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/KUgC/APwWUoLgx">Presentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2LTuRDFAzqc">Video on the channel Tehnostrim</a> <br><br>  Discussion of the features of the development stages of the Web and information systems, starting with the birth of the Internet and ending with cloud computing.  The objectives and content of the course, as well as sources of self-generation of new knowledge on this topic are considered.  In conclusion, we talked about an individual project in which each student develops his own distributed key-value repository with HTTP API in Java. <br><br>  Storage development is divided into three stages: local version, distributed version, load testing and optimization.  An informal specification is described for the repository, and a set of functional tests is provided.  The choice of technology is not limited by anything (except for the Java language).  Decisions are made in the form of a pull request in GitHub. <br><br>  At the end of the introductory lecture in the live demo mode, the first stage of the course project was completed.  It is noted that the third stage uses such popular open load testing tools as wrk and Yandex.Tank, as well as async-profiler for profiling. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 2. Typical architecture (Alexander Khristoforov) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/7MxY/taZ39XiGo">Presentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/m9S37qxbvN8">Video on the channel Tehnostrim</a> <br><br>  Using the messenger as an example, various versions of architectures, their advantages, disadvantages and pitfalls are considered.  We touched on issues of performance and optimization.  We discuss the popular ways of scaling systems with the aim of increasing performance and fault tolerance.  Details on various replication options and data consistency issues.  In conclusion, we are talking about caching, using queues and microservices. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 3. Operation (Ilya Shchanikov) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/ApyH/CfPyUaB5Z">Presentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfiNHRraxI88">Video on the channel Tehnostrim</a> <br><br>  The problem of ensuring high availability of distributed services is considered.  We discussed the features of operation - the various tasks, roles and teams that solve them.

Particular attention is paid to the practical features of network implementation in Linux, the most important aspects of TCP, as well as tools to configure and optimize the network.  In conclusion, the latest protocols and the motivation for their development. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 5. Balancing (Andrei Domas) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/D988/21Zndje3d">Presentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DCEZ2uxhQ0jY">Video on the channel Tehnostrim</a> <br><br>  We talk about what load balancing is, what tasks it solves, what problems it creates.  There are common solutions at different levels of the network model: master-slave, L4, GSLB DNS.  The topic of the mechanisms of functioning of the CDN: anycast and unicast.  Additionally, some types of attacks that can be countered by balancing are considered. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 6.

The second part of the lecture is devoted to the main aspects of memory management using the example of Linux: virtual memory, process memory, NUMA, pages, and caching.  In conclusion, typical problems, their diagnosis and elimination are considered. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 7. Data Warehouses (Sergey Egorichev) </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="https://cloud.mail.ru/public/EMcd/V8Yvctxfn">Presentation</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_d38g1tpLd8">Video on the channel Tehnostrim</a> <br><br>  Talked about the diversity of data warehouses.  We found out what basic characteristics they have and how they differ from each other.  We considered the basic principles of HDD and SSD, their features, as well as highlighted the strengths and weaknesses.  Disassembled common optimization methods, the most popular I / O schedulers and file systems.  We discussed the need for monitoring data warehouses and what is particularly worth paying attention to.  They also identified the basic requirements for storage from high load systems and tried to answer questions about the choice of storage type, which often arise during the design of applications. <br><br><h3>  Lecture 8.
