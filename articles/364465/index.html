For those who <s>tear their hair looking for gift ideas,</s> have not yet decided on gifts for their relatives, friends, colleagues, or for themselves (oh), we have prepared a small guide "How to become the best Geek Frost", carefully dividing what seemed interesting to us things (which, to be honest, we would like to see ourselves under the Christmas tree) by price categories.  Of course, we focused on the owners of Lumia (and those who want to become such), but in general the gifts are quite universal and will suit not only fans of Windows devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/960/23a/dc9/96023adc98124e948f520e3fe4981fde.png">

      Here it is necessary to add that this post is purely recommendatory in nature: we do not advertise either the stores or the goods themselves, but only offer ideas and give examples where it could be bought.  Anyway, nobody better than you, dear readers, knows what gift to prepare for this holiday. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e0/ae3/ff4/4e0ae3ff4a7e4a4793b17f46f8791136.png"><br><br>  What to do if the holiday budget is already bursting at the seams, and you still need to congratulate your beloved colleague?  Come on, be a good "Grandfather", do not give another cup or porcelain figurine.  A better inexpensive and useful gift than a useless dust collector.  However, given the difficult economic situation, this list risks becoming a bestseller in the category ‚Äúgifts for all.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Wacom Bamboo Stylus mini stylus</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17f/132/a42/17f132a42e84473ca976acad85ce0c33.jpg"><br><br>  One IT classic once said that the best device controllers are our fingers.  We cannot but agree here, but there are still situations where it is impossible to manage with one hand.  For example, drawing New Year cards in <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/fresh-paint/ab89f9f8-f78b-4fa0-a244-c87d53c14319">Fresh Paint</a> will be more convenient with a stylus.  Especially if it is so compact and convenient to carry around with you, like the Wacom Bamboo Stylus mini. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://www.eldorado.ru/cat/detail/71093443/%3Futm_source%3Dyandexmarket%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3DMoscow%26utm_content%3D71093443%26utm_term%3D71093443">Eldorado</a> / $ 8 <br><br>  <b>The novel "Project Rosie" by Graham Simcion</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fe/1b2/c2d/3fe1b2c2df7a4d35b722b05ffdd54d95.jpg"><br><br>  Times go by, and books remain the best gift.  The Rosie Project is Bill Gates‚Äôs handbook and one of nine that he <a href="http://www.vestifinance.ru/articles/47853%3Fpage%3D1">recommends</a> for everyone to read. <br>  Sharing his impressions of the novel, Bill noted that the book is not only ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, but also not devoid of a sense of humor, and sometimes takes it for life.  Believe me, you can certainly trust the taste of this famous bookworm. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://www.litres.ru/grem-simsion/proekt-rozi/">Liters</a> / 541 ‚ÇΩ for the paper version or 190 ‚ÇΩ for the electronic. <br><br>  <b>Nokia USB cable CA-190CD</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d8/0d1/06a/1d80d106a31d4deca4cb2f06046a6bbc.jpg"><br><br>  Want to make a pleasant surprise, but do not know anything about the hobbies of the presented?  Then it's possible that the Nokia USB cord is your only way out!  No, really.  First of all, since the time of Winnie the Pooh everyone knows that the lace is a wonderful gift.  And secondly, it is difficult to come up with a more universal object in the world filled with various devices with microUSB connectors.  Moreover, the bright design and construction, screaming "The cover is the mother of order!", Will hardly doubt the sincerity of your gift. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/usb-kabel-nokia-ca-190cd">Nokia</a> / 610 branded <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/usb-kabel-nokia-ca-190cd">store</a> . <br><br>  <b>Portable Speaker Coloud Bang MD-1C</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9b/ec5/b97/d9bec5b976ea46a3a681ca8cc3fd64b6.jpg"><br><br>  Would you like to instill a sense of beauty in your porch?  Then disaccustom these individuals to listen to music through the speaker of a mobile phone, making them happy with a cool portable speaker! <br><br>  But seriously, the Coloud Bang MD-1C is a good option for a gift to all participants of the New Year's party (unless, of course, the New Year's party is held in a circle of close people).  And all because this speaker supports the function of serial connection, allowing you to collect from several such quite powerful sound centipede.  And 8 hours of battery life guarantee you sound from the chiming clock until the very morning. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/md-1c">Nokia brand store</a> / $ 1,070. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Headphones WH-530</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e09/ffa/37d/e09ffa37d9d44871a9b4917111e97cfc.jpg"><br><br>  This is a one hundred percent hit in the supergame "A gift for a person with a developed sense of beauty."  Not only does the headset sound good for its price (although we understand that sound is a subjective concept), it also looks quite unusual and attractive.  And the convenient design of a 3.5 mm plug with a clasp will help curb the poltergeist that entangles the wires in your pocket. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/stereogarnitura-nokia-wh-530">Nokia brand store</a> / $ 1. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Treasure Tag Mini</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/931/448/f07/931448f07bd9465195f9f6b0504f9639.jpg"><br><br>  Those who constantly forget their keys / bags / <s>children in kindergarten</s> , this compact gadget, the younger brother of the Nokia Treasure Tag, about which we once <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoftlumia/blog/213231">told</a> on Habr√©, can be an ideal gift. <br>  The beauty of this device lies in the intellectual reminder of the forgotten thing that appears in the smartphone as soon as the user moves away a certain distance from it.  Having reduced in size, the smart key fob has not lost its functionality and supports the standards Bluetooth LE and NFC.  In addition to the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/treasure-tag/026c771b-473d-4593-b5db-e43cc8a3117b">official application</a> for Windows Phone, we could also find unofficial ones for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/treasure-tag/id836597234%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.comarch.mobile.treasuretag%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> . <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/nokia-treasure-tag-mini-ws-10">Nokia brand store</a> / $ 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfd/93f/847/bfd93f84773e4b07b697050a2d14c0de.png"><br><br>  A gift at the price of just 10 cups of cappuccino, a monthly fee for utilities services or a base rate for a Lada Grant loan.  In general, you already understood that we could not come up with a normal liner for this section.  But know that there are only nice gifts for a fairly reasonable price, or, as the draenei from World of Warcraft say, "All prices are are reasonable!". <br><br>  <b>Fitness trackers Misfit Shine and Fitbit Flex</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/123/57c/6dc/12357c6dcc7a4035a997e6df7f7bec76.jpg"><br>  <i>Misfit shine</i> <br><br>  Owners of Lumia smartphones can monitor their health not only thanks to the Lumia SensorCore technology and <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/cbb8c3bd-99e8-4176-ad8c-95ec6a3641c2">the Health and Fitness</a> app, but also with the help of the fitness fitness trackers Misfit Shine and Fitbit Flex, since their official apps ( <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/misfit/040923cc-e1bd-46c0-b2b1-7d3680aa6f99">Misfit</a> | <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/fitbit/378ebdb6-f31f-4505-a00d-c460ef22e7ff">Fitbit</a> ) are present in the WP app store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fa/1b6/51c/0fa1b651cbc049c68172812d2bc8444b.jpg"><br>  <i>Fitbit flex</i> <br><br>  A lot has been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/206048/">said</a> about each of these trackers.  It is worth noting that in many ways their concepts are similar: each of them is built on the principle of minimum power consumption and is a separate module with a simple LED display, which is supposed to be worn on special bracelets and brackets.  Therefore, the choice of one of them as a gift is a matter of taste ... well, and a few hours spent reading the reviews on the Internet. <br><br>  Misfit Shine can be found at: <br>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fitnes-treker-misfit-shine-grey-sh0az-50040773">MVideo</a> / 3 990 ‚ÇΩ. <br>  <a href="http://store.misfit.com/products/misfit-shine">the official website of Misfit</a> / $ 99 + shipping. <br><br>  Fitbit Flex can be found at: <br>  <a href="">Yandex.Market</a> / from 3 400 ‚ÇΩ. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Wireless Charging Panel DC-50</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/a49/43e/e24a4943e3924279aa69a09a45473be9.jpg"><br><br>  If your loved one cannot live without traveling, and in addition owns the flagship Lumia, the DC-50 wireless charging panel is the best choice.  Connected via a USB cable to a power source or laptop, it can perform the role of a static wireless charging standard Qi.  In its autonomous state, the built-in battery of 2400 mAh is activated, allowing you to replenish the charge of Lumia both wired and wirelessly.  More information about this device can be found in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoftlumia/blog/211152">our review</a> on Habr√©. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/portativnaya-besprovodnaya-zaryadnaya-panel-nokia-dc-50">Nokia Brand Shop</a> / 3,190 ‚ÇΩ. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Mini Wireless Speaker MD-12</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/f89/179/ad5f89179cc74441b08f9e36dcda2d13.jpg"><br><br>  A lover of powerful sound will not have to suffer with the transport of bulky audio systems, if you hand him this wireless speaker.  Weighing no more than an apple (only 180 grams), the Nokia Bluetooth Speaker MD-12 generates such a sound that even champagne glasses will dance on the table. <br><br>  The whole secret lies in the built-in vibrating transducer, located on the sole of the device.  It uses any surface on which the speaker is located, amplifying low frequencies. <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/besprovodnoy-mini-dinamik-nokia-md-12">The Nokia</a> / 1,990 <a href="http://n-store.ru/accessory/item/besprovodnoy-mini-dinamik-nokia-md-12">Brand Shop</a> <br><br>  <b>Nokia Lumia 530 smartphone</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/112/f84/d31/112f84d31d3544ac912c05e10a0245e7.jpeg"><br><br>  The most affordable smartphone in the line of Lumia is perfect for a New Year's gift to a child, family or even himself.  It has the necessary minimum - and even beyond it: Windows Phone 8.1, Office suite, free maps and micro-SD support up to 128 GB.  A good offer, given that for such a price, not every budget competitor (even a B-brand) boasts a 4-core processor (the 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon ‚Ñ¢ 200 chip is installed in the model). <br><br>  Can be found in: <br>  <a href="http://n-store.ru/device/item/nokia-lumia-530">The Nokia</a> / 3 $ 9 <a href="http://n-store.ru/device/item/nokia-lumia-530">branded store</a> . <br><br>  At the same time we will complete our selection for today.
