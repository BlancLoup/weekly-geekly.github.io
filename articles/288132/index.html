  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Spam - Modern Version</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More recently, a wave of discontent swept through the blogosphere when an unknown person published an ‚Äúorder‚Äù for blog comments on a forum.  The list of blog victims was attached, which allowed us to quickly reveal this information.  The discontent did not pass without a trace, and many bloggers began to look for new methods of protection. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Someone decided that it is necessary to remove the URL field altogether from the comment addition form, someone made all the links through a redirect, wrapping them nofollow and noindex for reliability.  How effective these methods are, time will tell, until one thing is clear - spammers are not going to give up. <br><h2>  Who is guilty </h2><br>  A year ago, spammers were stupid and worked extremely automated.  For spam blogs, special programs were used that could automatically add comments to many blogs.  To cope with such spammers is easy - just use one of the technical tools for your blog engine. <br>  Now it is quite difficult to distinguish a normal commentator from a spammer.  Apart from the fact that spam comments are published manually, they still more or less correspond to the subject of the message, so at first glance it is difficult to understand who is in front of us.  If spammers are not fools (and most often this is the case), they do not use a keyword for a search engine as a name - like all decent commentators, they sign with a normal name.  The only thing that gives them out is the link to the site.  If you look at it, then you will see a ‚Äúblog‚Äù on the WordPress engine, created on a specific topic with completely incomprehensible content for people.  The content of these sites is entirely stolen, automatically obtained from the feeds of other blogs, or manually copied. <br>  The purpose of such spammers is to increase the site's citation index and PR.  And although all modern engines add the nofollow attribute to links (such a link is not taken into account by Google when calculating PR), this does not stop them.  Even the fact that in some blogs the links are additionally ‚Äúwrapped‚Äù with the noindex tag does not stop, which greatly underestimates their weight in the eyes of Russian search engines (Yandex and Rambler). <br><br><h3>  What to do </h3><br>  Since the <a href="http://www.problog.ru/2008/01/link-to-commenter.php">link to the commentator is needed</a> , the option with removing the URL field is removed immediately.  It remains only to find some tricky way to use the link to the commentators, which would be of no interest to spammers.  I think I found such a method - sophisticated, but working. <br><h2>  There is a link, but not about your honor </h2><br>  To use this method, it will take a little time and basic knowledge of the engine that you are using. <br>  <strong>The essence of the method or policy links:</strong> <br><ul><li>  It is undesirable to introduce mandatory authorization for commentators, otherwise the number of people willing to comment will sharply decrease.  Therefore, authorization must be made voluntary. </li><li>  Direct links are placed only with authorized commentators, for the rest redirect is used. </li><li>  The nofollow attribute is added to the links to authorized commentators, as well as the noindex tag. </li><li>  For authorized commentators who are on the trusted list, all links are direct (without using nofollow and noindex). </li></ul><br>  The spammer will think twice whether he should comment on the blog using this policy.  After all, the maximum that he will receive is a link through a redirect.  Such a link will not increase either the PR or the citation index. <br>  For the usual commentator, on the contrary, an additional motivation is created - if the comments are interesting, the blog author will certainly add it to the list of trusted ones, then all links to such a commentator will be direct. <br><h3>  We start implementation </h3><br>  Since bloggers use different blog engines, there is no one solution.  I use Movable Type, in this engine this method <a href="http://movable-type.ru/2008/03/spam-protect.php">is implemented using regular tools</a> .  In WordPress, you most likely need to create a plugin. <br>  While the plugin is not created, in WordPress'e this functionality can be implemented only partially.  To do this, edit the blog templates by adding a redirect or noindex tag to the links to the commentator (nofollow is added automatically).  In this case, there is no question of separating the types of links for different commentators. <br>  You may also need some warning signs for spammers.  But this is a personal task.  The link policy can be described in a separate blog post, or it will be reported about it by the picture next to the comment addition form. <br>  Successful blogging! <br><h2>  Related Links </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.administrating.ru/2008/02/27/otkuda-berutsya-govnokommentarii/">List of blogs that wanted to spam</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.problog.ru/2008/03/spam-protect-modern-version.php">Original of this note in ProBlog</a> </li></ul><br>  Hello, spammers! </div>
