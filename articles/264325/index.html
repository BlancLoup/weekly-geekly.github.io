What is the problem </h3><br>  Many computer technologies, developed initially in the world of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">analytical language</a> , run into additional difficulties when being transferred to a community with a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA">synthetic language</a> . <br><br>  For example, a search for morphology in English and Russian texts requires a different level of complexity.  The branching of the Russian inflection has long been the subject of popular jokes about the torment of foreigners who study Russian grammar with all the rules and exceptions. <br><br>  One example of how technology stumbles across the difference in languages ‚Äã‚Äãis in English and Russian blogs and social networks.  While the tags are allocated in a separate block (as implemented in Habrahabr or LJ), there are no problems: in both languages ‚Äã‚Äãthe initial forms of words are used, sometimes the plural number (and even then English is the remnants of former synthism).  But as soon as the tags get into the text, the difference sharpens.  And sometimes it seems that, for example, Twitter hashtags are becoming a powerful factor in increasing analyticism in the Russian language.  Now and then you come across phrases like:

      <i>We # husband in a restaurant.</i> <br><br>  <i>Starting tomorrow, in #Moscow.</i> <br><br>  <i>Returned from # sea.</i> <br><br>  There is a very strange feeling, some language dizziness and a split. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  People who do not want to put up with such protruding unnaturalness solve the problem in different ways. <br><br>  Someone puts tags to the end of the tweet, as if in a separate block. <br><br>  <i>Returned.</i>  <i># sea # vacation</i> <br><br>  Someone takes the tags forward, as if additionally isolating the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2587%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">topic of the next sentence</a> . <br><br>  <i>#Moscow.</i>  <i>From tomorrow.</i> <br><br>  Someone turns all wordforms into tags.  Although this significantly reduces the potential of search by tags - after all, the morphology has not yet been screwed to them. <br><br>  <i>My husband and I are in a restaurant.</i> <br><br>  Someone adds the endings with a hyphen, double or single quote, and even a space.  This insertion terminates the automatic conversion of a word into a tag just on such a character.  But this decision makes it difficult to read, even though such punctuation ‚Äúoffal‚Äù sticking out is still easier to perceive than the sudden lack of declination. <br><br>  <i>We # husband-eat in the restaurant.</i> <br><br>  <i>We are # husband in a restaurant.</i> <br><br>  <i>My husband and I eat in a restaurant.</i> <br><br>  Such a solution is good only for those words in which the so-called zero ending is in the initial form, that is, in which the initial form coincides with the basis of the word, to which are added the endings of other cases.  In other words, such a design does not make sense, because no one will search by a tag that is not a full-fledged word.  Compare: <br><br>  <i>Streets #Kiev-a.</i>  <i>Evening # Kiev th.</i>  <i>We are in Kiev.</i> <br><br>  <i>Streets # Moscow s.</i>  <i>Evening # Moscow-oh.</i>  <i>We are in Moscow.</i> <br><br>  But still there are many words with a matching base and initial form to find a readable implementation for tagging. <br><br><h3>  Ii.  Two possible solutions and their features </h3><br>  In fact, there are two suitable characters in character sets that both interrupt tagging and leave no visible gap between the base tag and the ending: this is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_hyphen">soft transfer</a> (abbreviated "shy") and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_space">space of zero width</a> (abbreviated "zwsp"). <br><br>  Their use allows you to create, for example, such hashtags on Twitter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/303/393/a47303393d8941f3b9972af9081e1a0b.png"><br><br>  Or those on Facebook (the previous version will not work, because Facebook filters the same hashtags, leaving only the first one to be tagged): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/360/98f/254/36098f2544144e4eb0b4d210bf98c4de.png"><br><br>  The two characters have a number of <b>similarities</b> . <br><br>  1. In most cases, they are invisible inside the word. <br><br>  2. They become the place for transferring a part of a word to another line when the word no longer fits entirely. <br><br>  3. They do not allow parts of the word to be torn when the text is justified in width (at least in the major browsers of the latest versions). <br><br>  4. You can detect both characters in a word in the following ways: a.  when moving the carriage from symbol to symbol with arrows from the keyboard, the carriage ‚Äúslips‚Äù once in the place of an invisible symbol, as if it does not respond to a key press;  b.  when adding spaces before the word, sooner or later, going to the end of the line, it ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù into two parts in the place of the inserted mark;  at.  Some text editors (often programmers) display invisible characters (for example, a zero space can be seen in the well-known jsfiddle.net service, but the soft transfer is not displayed there; by the way, you can observe the behavior of text with such hidden characters if you <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/k37ssezj/">shift the</a> frames of the blocks: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/k37ssezj/">jsfiddle .net / k37ssezj</a> (in the first segment after each ‚Äúword‚Äù, a zero space is inserted, in the second - a soft carry)). <br><br>  But there are <b>differences</b> between the two signs, and all of them are in favor of a soft transfer: <br><br>  1. Soft transfer is a more traditional and ancient sign for the computer world, it is in the initial part of Unicode, is present in more fonts and is easier to type from the keyboard.  A space of zero width is located much later in the Unicode table, it may be in a smaller number of fonts and it is more difficult to enter it from the keyboard. <br><br>  2. When transferring a part of a word to a new line, the hyphen is more logical and more explicitly denotes the unity of the word. <br><br>  Some of the differences <b>depend on the application</b> . <br><br>  1. Signs may have different effects on the search on the page (the transfer does not interfere with the search in Chrome and Firefox, but interferes with IE; the space does not interfere with the search in Chrome, but interferes with Firefox and IE). <br><br>  2. When double clicking on a word containing an invisible character, sometimes only part of the word under the cursor is highlighted, sometimes the whole word (when inserting a transfer, the selection is divided only in the hybrid Twitter tags in Chrome; when inserting a space, it is divided in all words in Chrome and IE) . <br><br>  3. It is necessary to remember about the IE11 bug: when working with advanced input fields (the so-called <code>Rich Editor</code> , allowing you to see the design in real time in the style of WYSIWYG editors; they are generated by the <code>element.contentEditable</code> and <code>document.designMode</code> properties) sometimes paste from the clipboard does not work In this case, in the developer console, you need to switch from Edge mode to compatibility mode with a lower browser version (starting with IE10).  For example, such a problem manifests itself when trying to insert something into the text of a note (Note) on Facebook. <br><br>  Finally, <b>sites</b> may <b>have different effects</b> on the insertion of characters. <br><br>  1. Facebook is more hostile to an invisible space.  He deletes it almost immediately at the time of entry, and certainly does not save it when publishing a post ( <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/%3Fid%3D697454066946581">to all appearances, this is not very difficult for anyone</a> ).  The invisible transfer is preserved, including in unpopular yet face-based hashtags, but sometimes for some reason you have to move the input carriage back and forth by the word to make the website see this sign in the word ‚Äúsaw‚Äù, otherwise it may not be saved either (for manual input This problem appears less often than when trying to insert a symbol into the text programmatically using a script (more on that later)). <br><br>  2. When trying to insert a sign in Twitter with a script, you need to remember about <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi%3Fid%3D866522">this annoyingly old bug in Firefox</a> .  You have to either use other methods of insertion, or set the <code>security.csp.enable</code> key from <code>about:config</code> to <code>false</code> , which probably would be too radical a way to solve typographical problems. <br><br><h3>  Iii.  Ways of implementation </h3><br>  <b>1. Enter manually.</b> <br><br>  If you rarely type in rare characters from the keyboard, it may be useful for you to read <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">this small article</a> .  It describes two methods for entering characters: in decimal notation (it works reliably only with the initial unit of Unicode and some symbols of common encodings) and in hexadecimal.  For the convenience of the registry editing mentioned in the article, you can save this text to a file with the .reg extension and Unicode encoding, click on it and agree to enter the data into the registry. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">EnableHexNumpad.reg</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<font></font>
<font></font>
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Control Panel \ Input Method]
 "EnableHexNumpad" = "1"<font></font>
<font></font>
</pre></div></div><br><br>  So, when entering manually, we need to know the sequence number of our characters in two numerals: <br><br>  Soft transfer: <code>0173</code> and <code>00ad</code> (respectively, <code>Alt + '0173'</code> and <code>Alt + '+00ad'</code> ). <br><br>  Zero space: <code>8203</code> and <code>200b</code> (respectively <code>Alt + '8203'</code> and <code>Alt + '+200b'</code> ). <br><br>  (By the way, it is interesting that the zero space is not included in the javascript space class '\ s': the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp">enumeration of one of the groups of spaces is interrupted just before it</a> ). <br><br>  What to consider: <br><br>  but.  The decimal input of characters with a large sequence number works very rarely.  Sometimes nothing is inserted, sometimes something completely unexpected is inserted. <br><br>  b.  When entering hexadecimal codes containing letters, keyboard shortcuts specified in applications often work, and character input is broken.  Sometimes it depends on the current keyboard layout, sometimes not. <br><br>  <b>2. Paste from clipboard.</b> <br><br>  You can save these two characters somewhere to copy them from there and paste them through <code>Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V</code>  Although storing and copying invisible characters is a little more difficult than visible ones: you have to either save each in a separate file, or know their place and select using the keyboard ( <code>Shift+</code> ). <br><br>  In Windows, you can use the familiar utility by selecting the poorest font, setting the options you want, entering the hexadecimal number and pressing the buttons: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/483/49a/8f2/48349a8f23a34d8e8aff07deccdde878.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/1a3/91a/7901a391a71a47c6b8384bfec55d8eaf.png"><br><br>  <b>3. Input using a script ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582">bookmarklet</a> ).</b> <br><br>  A little further will be presented two programs that are identical in everything except the character code and its variable.  They sequentially look through three options of circumstances: <br><br>  but.  The input focus is in a simple single-line or multi-line text field.  The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTextAreaElement">usual properties and methods for such cases are used</a> . <br><br>  b.  The input focus is in the field with advanced features like <code>Rich Editor</code> (the options are taken into account both with the element of the current window / document, and with the fully allocated <code>iframe</code> editor with its window / document).  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand"><code>document.execCommand()</code></a> . <br><br>  at.  The focus is not in the text field or the desired method of working with <code>Rich Editor</code> not implemented in the browser (in IE11, the insertText command <code>insertText</code> not supported, but <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh801231(v%3Dvs.85).aspx">will be implemented in the Edge</a> ).  In this case, a window pops up in front of the user with a text field in which the required character is already selected (although it is invisible at the same time).  It remains only to press <code>Ctrl+C</code> , close the window (you can press <code>Enter</code> or <code>Esc</code> ), then insert the cursor in the right place of the text and press <code>Ctrl+V</code>  You can consider this option a convenient implementation of the previous method of copying and pasting from a file or utility. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Soft carry</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">javascript: (<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">d, e, shy, s1, s2, v, sy, sx</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> (e.type == <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'textarea'</span></span> || e.type == <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'text'</span></span>) { s1 = e.selectionStart;
