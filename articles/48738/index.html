  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is bad vkontakt</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started using the social network VKontakte around November 2007 and now, after a little more than a year, I decided to retire. <br><br>  What is the reason for this decision?  There are several reasons. <br>  By the way, this action has nothing to do with the temporary removal mode that has appeared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start from far away.  Everyone remembers that once in our country there was a revolution of 1917.  Immediately after the revolution, people began to unite in the community - the Communist Party, the Komsomol, the pioneers, children.  gardens, trade unions, hobby groups, etc.  Komsomol, for example, was created in 1918.  A community is easier to manage than an unorganized crowd.  It is easier to track the state, stop the excitement.  The Soviet government wanted to have power over the minds and it received it through these communities. <br><br>  Let's go back in our days.  Today, many people can work at a computer.  Many of those many go online.  Who are these people?  In essence, this is the ‚Äúintelligentsia‚Äù of our days.  A person who has managed to master a computer, and even more so the Internet most likely knows how to think a little.  For the state, people who know how to think are of some kind of danger when it comes up with something like totalitarianism or something else from the category.  By the way, the intelligentsia in the USSR was sent abroad.

      Why am I doing all this?  In my opinion, the main goal of social networks is global unification into a single ‚Äúhuman field‚Äù of the entire Internet.  As Wikipedia wants to collect all human knowledge in one place (see the slogan of its creator), so social networks will gather all people in a single field.  Have you noticed that the Internet has come to life recently?  Now there are living people.  There are thematic networks like Habrahabra.  The Internet begins to rule the opinion of not the individual - the creator of the site, but the opinion of a group of people.  On the news sites there is an opportunity to comment on the news.  In addition, social networks spurred a wave of interest in the Internet.  Previously, he was not interesting to someone, but now you can find your friend there, with whom you studied at school in the sixties and invite him to your birthday party. <br><br>  After three years, our government will create a single Internet passport and will not allow it into the network without it.  The whole Internet will become one big social network.  Why do I think so?  And because censorship is already introduced in blogs.  And how do you sue a blogger who publishes disagreeable government entries and at the same time does not give out his first and last name.  The Internet is a danger to the global community - it is difficult to control. <br><br>  The time of creation of this passport will coincide with the time of the introduction of microelectronic devices that are introduced directly into the body of a bio-object.  Microchip.  Well, about him for a long time say.  Briefly for those who do not know. <br>  First, a large number of different plastic cards are put in for people, such as rights, credit cards, plastic passes, now here‚Äôs a transport card.  Then the passport will be equipped with an electronic chip, then they will make the passport with the same plastic card.  And then decide to combine all the documents into a single card.  It will be all.  Photography, biometric data, insurance, data on the place of work or study, information on the availability of real estate in property and so on.  This time is likely to coincide with the time of the introduction of the law on the mandatory possession of a cell phone.  And then we will be asked, why not write down all the information from the card to the chip and inject it into the human body (in the right hand and in the forehead, it is in these places on the human body that the temperature of the body constantly changes, by a small amount, but this change enough to power the chip).  After all, the card can be lost, but you will not lose the chip.  Social networks are undoubtedly part of this system, as the Internet at that time will occupy a crucial place in our life. <br><br>  Why am I against universal globalization?  What I do not like these chips?  What's wrong with that?  This is so good and convenient, there will be no threat of terrorists, all citizens will be taken into account.  Bringing people together in a natural community, friendship and harmony is wonderful.  People unite from the time of their appearance.  Live together more fun.  A man can not without communication.  But globalization and soc.  networks are not natural phenomena of association.  They corrupt a person.  Using the example of ICQ and other messengers, we can illustrate what I am talking about.  Here you sit and you say twenty people are online, i.e.  you can tell everyone, at any moment, wherever he is, and what is most interesting you can instantly get an answer.  Already it is not natural, what can we say about the fact that we do not write to those who are online every day.  Twenty people are standing next to you, twenty people you know, those with whom you are not averse to sometimes talk, they stand every day, and you are silent every day and only once a month do you spread something from the category ‚Äúlike are you doing? ‚Äù  Man is not created for such phenomena.  It simply does not correlate with its essence and principle of existence.  After all, in the end, with the help of a social network, we will get a less operational connection with any person we know.  Of course, this phenomenon applies only to those whom I called the ‚Äúintelligentsia‚Äù above.  All this will lead to the fact that people who can somehow consciously influence the development of the country will begin to have a blurred mind. Of course, this does not apply to everyone.  Someone stand. <br><br>  Tk why am I against globalization?  And because about her in the Bible is written.  It is better not to participate in this process.  So I decided to start with VKontakte.  By the way, the removal procedure itself took me more than an hour, along with the removal of albums, inscriptions on the wall, etc. It‚Äôs not so easy to make contact, they didn‚Äôt consciously provide for this option, I think.  It is also possible to simply delete your page, close its content to access, but at the same time you can walk on someone else's pages, but if you erase all the information about yourself, you will not be allowed to access other pages.  They also say that they delete pages with unreal names.  How interesting is it that they find out their real name or not? <br><br>  And besides, I don‚Äôt like this non-rubber VKontakte design. <br><br>  Here is such a story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48738/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48738/</a></p>
