  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Robotics for children. Request for comments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdoing robotics came to me for a relatively long time, therefore, it was decided to purchase a set of Lego Mindstorms NXT. <br>  According to my subjective assessments, this set makes it quite easy to introduce the uninitiated to this fascinating science and, at the same time, has a certain charm, which makes it possible to effectively demonstrate to children the results of their work.  Anyone who likes the process of forming new synaptic connections in young heads, please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, after ‚Äúsettling down‚Äù in the closet for one year, time is finally taken to plan the attack. <br><br><h4>  Preamble </h4><br>  I live with my family in Melbourne in the Australian region.  There is enthusiasm for organizing a circle of robotics (in the following text of the RT) in the local club of Russian-speaking youth. <br>  Org.  issues with the room are not acute.  But the issue of preparing the methodological basis of the circle is extremely acute.  Due to the lack of special education, and the inability to devote time to get an education in the field of pedagogy, it was decided to try out a program on the daughter in terms of workload, material digestibility, etc. <br><br>  Currently, a program of classes for children is being developed, taking into account a wide range of ages (due to the possible shortage of personnel, it is planned to attract children from 6 years to perform ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù tasks such as assembling components under the strict guidance of older colleagues  If there are 6 people aged 10 years, then everyone will have about <br>  the same opportunities / knowledge.  At this point in time, the age structure of the audience is not known, therefore, as they say, options are possible.

    <h4>  Plot </h4><br>  I suggest that constructively-minded habrovchanam familiar with the proposed program of classes. <br>  I draw your attention, the program is not formalized, and one of the reasons for writing this post is to get the critics' opinion about the program and the approach itself. <br><br>  1. Introduction to RT, history, rules of RT. <br>  2. A brief overview of the set of Lego Mindstorm, the principles of interaction with the outside world. <br>  3. The main mechanical elements of the set (beams / levers / blocks, etc.) <br>  4. Construction of basic structures (types of connections / mates, etc.) <br>  5. Put the structure in motion (gear and belt transmission, engines) <br>  6. The concept of the algorithm.  Cycles and branching. <br>  7. Review of the Mindstorm development environment. <br>  8. Hello world, Mindstorm Edition <br>  9. Mindstorm Sensors <br>  10. Building the first robot (mechanical part) <br>  11. Put the robot in motion (the simplest program for controlling servo drives) <br>  12. "Sight" and "touch" of the robot.  Integration of UV-sensor, touch sensor, light / color sensor and robot <br><br>  After 12 classes, according to my ideas, students should have the necessary knowledge and skills to build basic systems.  The further program will depend entirely on the success of the students and their susceptibility to the material. <br><br><h4>  Report of information and structure of educational material </h4><br>  The duration of classes is expected to be around 90 minutes.  I clearly realize that 90 minutes is quite a lot, especially for children, but revolutionary methods of reporting information are in service.  For the lesson materials, PowerPoint presentations are used; every 10 minutes, interactive interaction with students is provided for keeping attention and / or entertaining illustration for a short humorous dialogue with the group.  <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Presenting-Win-Jerry-Weissman/9780137144174">‚ÄúPresenting to win‚Äù from Jerry Weissman</a> to help me. <br><br>  Again, it all depends on the age composition of the group.  For theoretical materials at the initial stages it is supposed to use presentations with illustrations from a <a href="http://ldd.lego.com/en-us/">CAD package from Lego</a> .  This will allow to develop spatial thinking and imagination in children.  After that, it is planned to design mechanisms directly as the presentation proceeds <br><br>  I will be grateful for constructive criticism, I hope readers will be interested in news about the promotion of the project. <br>  If there are any questions, the answers to which will allow readers to more critically approach the criticism, I will be glad to answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198900/</a></p>
