And he gave him mathematics, so that the mind was trained and clear.  And he introduced him to his apostles ‚Äî Ada, Wirth, Knut, and many, many others.  And they gave the apostles to the programmer the algorithms and data structures of the simulation for the sake of.  And they introduced him to the hardware and instructions of the implementation teams for.  And with programming languages, so that life was joyful and fun.  And the teacher saw that the programmer was able, joyful and satisfied with life.  And decided that it was good. <br><br>  But his wife came to the programmer and whimpered, saying that other wives had scarves brighter and more golden.  And carry them on the carts new and richer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And all because the herds of projects are more fat with other programmers.  And she gave her husband a taste of the forbidden fruit, a project called that the customer handed the serpent the tempter.  Sweet was the fruit of that.  And the teacher found out about it, and he rejoiced: go and work and earn your bread by the sweat of your brow.

      The programmer did not understand the joy of the teacher and, grabbing the whimpering wife, left for bread free, filled with sadness.  The programmer wandered for a long time, he saw many projects and customers.  Somehow he passed by Mount Sinai, sat down, and decided to draw up the rules he knew, so that the way of following him was simple and joyful.  I carved these rules in stone and carried it to people: <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Love the wishes of your customer as yourself. <br>  If the customer wants round buttons - give him round buttons.  Yes, it is important. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Become more flexible, become agayley agayla. <br>  Do not go into hysterics in response to a change of requirements.  The path of the righteous is to nod, agree, and insist on an hourly rate. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Do not make him an idol from himself. <br>  Speak to the business in its language - the language of money and user loyalty.  The customer does not have to understand the architecture and all that.  You are the paid translator from his wishes to the machine language. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Do not desire the customer base of the customer, nor its suppliers, nor its know-how. <br>  Remember, honestly with him you can fuck a lot more.  (c) "Do not even think" <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Be honest with your customer. <br>  Immediately report problems, time shifts and doubts about the correctness of the proposed solutions. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Understand your customer. <br>  This will help to replace the dubious from the point of view of architecture requirements for similar in result, but less crusty. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> Look for reciprocal love in the heart of your customer. <br>  And if you do not find it - update your resume. <br><br>  And as the thunder appeared the teacher's comment under these tables: do you know why I did not give you these rules, but made myself understand?  For they work only with bright customers.  And the teacher struck from the back of the stone plate: <br><br>  Customer, pay by the hour and follow the light side of the force.  Let the love of the project into the heart of the programmer.  Let him grow your project.  Listen to his recommendations, advise.  Try to explain the reasons for the disputed claims.  Remember - while the programmer loves your project - he is an order of magnitude more efficient.  That is why cheaper. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324824/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324824/</a></p>
