  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Concept Fusion of reality and virtuality in games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last night, my body suffered from insomnia, and since the brain was inflamed after writing a diploma, I gave birth to one very strange, but interesting concept of games in the near future. <br>  Progress moves in before wars and gamers.  You can not even try to argue with me, it is still useless))) Sometimes these things overlap, for example, all kinds of simulators and simulators for soldiers, as well as the rather popular game in the US America's Army, through which bourgeois warriors lure young people into their networks, as well as such as honing the skills of the soldiers and preparing them for different situations in hot spots.  But now it‚Äôs not about war and warriors. <br>  Many gamers sit in front of monitors or TV and crumble in different toys with the help of a keyboard / mouse or various types of joysticks.  There are also fans of Nindendo Wii, where in front of the TV you basically have to stand, and also the prefixes with cameras are gaining momentum, reacting to body movements and allowing you to more fully dive into the game (although xs).  I also heard about the paintball range, which completely copies the map from the counter-strike. <br>  So why not go further and not combine modern technology for even greater immersion in the game? <br>  In general, all the technologies already exist for the realization of the idea, you just need to wait until some of them bring to mind.  A large hall is required, it is possible with partitions and walls, it is even more interesting, transmitters are installed on this hall, which allow determining the position of special receivers with great accuracy (the more precisely, the better, this is not a big problem now).  Receivers can work on the same principle as GPS, or the same RFID tags that are smaller, but I don‚Äôt know the limits of their accuracy.  Each player is dressed in a special suit or even not necessarily a suit, there are enough gloves, shoes, a belt and a helmet with receivers to track the main points of the body in space.  You can also add receivers to your elbows and knees to build a more accurate player model, but I think this is not critical.  Also included is a wearable computer, of course shockproof, with a Wi-Fi module or similar.  There should also be a server somewhere (where modern games without servers))) into which the full level model (hall) is loaded and points with transmitters are indicated.  Now you can start the game.  Suppose someone from childhood wanted to play Unreal live.  No problem - we put on our equipment, take control panels (made as weapons), put on helmets and go!  Here lies the main highlight and the main problem of the whole idea, however, temporary, I hope.  The helmet visor should be transparent, but also allow some areas to draw the picture we need (well, or a fashionable image of the image on the retina of the eye), i.e.  allow to combine reality and virtuality.  Also in the helmet should be embedded headphones for a more complete immersion.  As a result, each movement of the players, their position in the space of the hall is accurately recorded and modeled on the server.  The server, having processed the received information, transmits to the players' computers information about what they should see.  Those.  if someone shoots a plasma gun, then all players who are at this moment next to see a plasma clot flying in one direction or another, while it is not so difficult to realize so that it would look realistic, once all the coordinates are set and there is a fully calculated model of the whole action. <br>  Another kind of such a game could even be popular among role-playing players.  The main feature of this game is in the simulation of the battle of magicians.  For casting spells, you can use special gloves that additionally track the movement of each finger, i.e.  all spells are actually cast with the help of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù passes, etc. <br>  The idea, in general, may not be revolutionary and logically follows from the possibilities of modern technologies, but I have not come across such a one yet. </div>
