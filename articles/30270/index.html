Such a brief reference material on the subject of "who is who in the market." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/ae8/6fd/0a2/ae86fd0a2fcda12e626a7d2dc98188a5.jpg" width="387" height="210" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Link exchange is a service that allows you to buy and sell links (traffic). <br>  Someone may call this ‚Äúpaid advertising‚Äù and he will be right, because this definition is the main essence of the service.

      Using link exchanges, you are exempt from a very important part of the work - you do not need to look for advertisers on your own (if you have your own website, and you want to make money by placing advertising links on it) or advertising platforms (if you have any or a project requiring promotion on the Internet). <br><br>  There are two main types of reference exchanges. <br>  In the first type of payment occurs for the number of unique clicks (with a unique IP once every 24 hours).  The cost per click in this case is the difference between the price of the advertiser and the exchange commission for the provision of services.  As practice shows, on average, for one click it is about 50 kopecks (prices range mainly from 0.1 to 1.2 rubles). <br>  In the second type of payment occurs during the placement of advertisements on your resource. <br><br>  And now we will try to consider some reference exchanges in more detail: <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>SAPE</strong> (http://www.sape.ru). <br>  Creation date - October 2006. <br><br>  Recognized by all market leaders.  Plus the exchange - in its openness: an offer contract is drawn up with customers.  It is believed that SAPE is more optimized to work with Yandex algorithms. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  113 524 users <br>  Sites 116 367 <br>  Pages 34 975 157 <br><br>  But, as elsewhere, there are a number of disadvantages and features in SAPE: <br>  1. URL when selecting sites are not displayed. <br>  2. The sites where the acquired links are hidden are not tracked. <br>  3. No money is charged for a period of time shorter than 12 hours.  Thus, there is no struggle with "flashing" links. <br>  4. Accepted so-called sites, garbage. <br>  5. Frequent failures in indexing. <br>  6. Practical lack of feedback from the exchange. <br>  7. There are overlays with the settings of the sites by the number of seats sold and the links purchased. <br><br>  <strong>LinkFeed</strong> (http://www.linkfeed.ru). <br>  Creation date - April 2008. <br><br>  Almost complete analog of SAPE.  Many SEO experts rightly note this similarity, putting this fact in a reproach to the creators.  Thus, LinkFeed has far from the best reputation in professional circles.  It is worth adding that during registration there is no possibility to conclude an agreement. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  6,400 members <br>  Sites 6 320 <br>  Pages 1 457 040 <br><br>  I will give some of her characteristics: <br>  1. Full monitoring of the indexation of pages of sites, exchange participants, Google and Yandex search engines. <br>  2. Several currencies for accounts in the system - rubles, dollars, euros. <br>  3. API availability. <br>  4. Import from SAPE. <br>  5. New options in the site search: <br>  5.1.  Domain age. <br>  5.2.  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãand themes sites. <br>  5.3.  Domain zones. <br>  5.4.  Platforms with IP from new networks of class C. <br>  5.5.  Only sites open to the optimizer - default setting. <br>  5.6.  New system script with advanced functionality. <br><br>  <strong>XAP</strong> (http://www.xap.ru). <br>  Creation date - November 2006. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  Users 60 685 <br>  Pages in the base 28 674 386 <br>  Links sold 26 903 419 <br><br>  There is a forum on the exchange website, and in several languages, since the exchange positions itself as an international one.  Also on the main page there is a calculator for calculating the income from the site. <br><br>  <strong>MainLink</strong> (http://www.mainlink.ru). <br>  Creation date - the beginning of 2006. <br><br>  The site is made in the same pleasant white and blue tones. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  Users 19 147 <br>  48 459 sites <br>  Pages 13 695 832 <br><br>  But what is indicated in the description of the exchange on its website: <br><br>  <em>Advertisers:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Find a lot of sites in a short time is almost impossible.</em>  <em>On the MainLink pages, you can select sites and pages according to a variety of characteristics (CY - the Yandex Yandex / PR Citing Index, Google‚Äôs Page Rank, external links, categories, domain level, and more).</em>  <em>It is possible to place links in a complex with the provision of discounts on a package of links, and it is also possible to buy links at the lowest prices in RuNet using the wholesale sales mechanism implemented in MainLink.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>We check every link you buy in Yandex search engine using indicator mechanisms (colors of checkboxes) and thus you can immediately discard unnecessary and non-indexable links to save money.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Webmasters and site owners:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>If you are a webmaster and want to earn extra money on your website, you can offer your pages to the MainLink service.</em>  <em>You select a small block on any page of the site for links, install a small script code.</em>  <em>After that, links purchased by advertisers will appear on the site.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>With us you will be sure that the links will appear automatically, and in the case of non-payment - disconnect.</em>  <em>Your task is to ensure that your website works and check your e-wallet on time.</em> <br><br>  <strong>PROPAGE.RU</strong> (http://www.propage.ru). <br>  Creation date - 2007. <br><br>  The project of CJSC Digital Technologies. <br><br>  The site already contains sections that are quite standard for all exchanges, but the exchange forum is simply a separate topic in the well-known and most influential search engine optimization forum searchengines.ru, in which the exchange consultant answers all users' questions and gives information about all the innovations of the exchange. <br><br>  As an example - one of the messages in the forum about the distinctive features of the exchange: <br><br>  <em>1. Only sites indexed by Yandex are allowed to participate in the system.</em>  <em>Checking the pages in Yandex and screening are non-proxied, we do it ourselves.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2. PROPAGE.RU offers its services on very favorable terms: the amount of commission for buying links is 10%.</em>  <em>From sellers of links commission is not withheld.</em>  <em>The money is deposited without deduction of the commission; when withdrawing money, a commission of 10% is withheld (withdrawal orders are executed instantly, slower only with the first order and change of payment details).</em>  <em>All other system services are provided free of charge.</em>  <em>Of particular interest is the purchase of links to money earned in the system - then all costs will be 10%, and this is the most favorable conditions in runet.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>3. We work with electronic currencies - WMZ, WMR, Yandex in money and by wire transfer with the conclusion of the Agreement and the provision of all necessary accounting documentation.</em>  <em>The rate of a conventional unit when paying by wire transfer is 25 rubles per cu.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>4. Using the company‚Äôs PROCHANGE.RU exchange office, we are able to offer favorable rates for the input and output of electronic currencies.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>5. It is possible to sell pages of any degree of distance from the main one with non-zero PR.</em>  <em>With zero PR, pages are allowed into the system if there is no more than 2 clicks away from the main one.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>6. It is possible to sell links both on pages added to the database when the site is indexed by a robot, and manually added.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>7. Sale of links is possible both on sites with PHP support, and on static ones.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>8. The system implements manual and automatic modes of operation.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>9. It is easy to connect a website implemented in any programming language to the system for working in automatic mode.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>10. There is a profitable referral program: we pay 25% of our income from each referral you attract, whether it is an advertiser or a site owner.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>11. We offer convenient interfaces, detailed statistics, detailed reporting with the reflection of all cash transactions on the account with details up to 0.00000001 cu.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>12. Your questions will be answered by a qualified and friendly support service.</em> <br><br>  <strong>SetLinks.ru</strong> (http://setlinks.ru). <br>  Creation date - 2006. <br><br>  Project LLC Inprime. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  23 115 users <br>  Main pages 13 234 <br>  Internal pages 3 081 128 <br><br>  A feature of this resource is that sites with narod.ru are allowed to work. <br><br>  Other characteristics of the exchange are listed below: <br><br>  1. Indexing site for two days.  The most important pages from your site are indexed first. <br>  2. Automatic and manual setting of prices for pages both for the group, and separately for each page, <br>  3. No commission for webmasters, <br>  4. The ability to prohibit the sale of links on individual pages, <br>  5. Restriction of the placed links by the size and by the forbidden words (there are ‚Äúmat‚Äù and ‚Äúporn‚Äù system filters), <br>  6. Calculate for links every day. <br><br>  <strong>Seolin.ru</strong> (http://www.seolin.ru). <br>  Creation date - May 2007. <br><br>  Another project, the site of which is solved in bright colors and has the character of minimalism in design. <br><br>  Statistics: <br>  1 572 users <br>  733 sites <br>  Pages 234,707 <br><br>  A small description of the resource, taken from the site: <br><br>  <em>We automatically check:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>1. The presence of links on the page owner of the site.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2. Whether the page is closed from indexing in robots.txt.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>3. Is there a noindex, nofollow meta-tags on the page?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>4. Is the link in the tag.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>5. TIC and WR sites, PR pages, their indexing by various search engines.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>6. The presence of sites in the catalogs of Yandex and DMOZ.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>7. The number of backlinks of the site by Yandex and Google.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>8. How many total external links on the page are installed.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>We offer the seller of links:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>1. Manual or automatic placement of links on their sites.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>2. The ability to automatically filter out non-thematic links.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>3. Ability to limit the number of external links on the page.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>4. To provide all pages found for sale by our scanner or only those you have selected.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>5.

Information on the spent funds on the links and the estimated budget for different periods of time.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><strong>CLX</strong> (http://www.clx.ru).</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Creation date - 2002.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Or rather, this is not exactly a link exchange, but an integrated advertising broker that provides a very wide range of services in the field of promotion and advertising on the Internet.</em>  <em>And by the date of creation it can be judged that the company is quite confident in the market.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>But we will not dwell on this broker for a long time, but proceed directly to the next participant in our review, the EliteLink exchange.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><strong>EliteLink</strong> (http://www.elitelink.ru).</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Creation date - January 2007.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>The exchange has a standard set of services for such a service, as well as its own forum.</em>  <em>They call themselves not only the "Link Exchange ‚Ññ1", which, with the successfully existing SAPE, personally seems to me a little exaggeration.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>From the description on the site follows:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em><em>Using the services of our link exchange, you will receive:</em></em> <em><em><br><br></em></em>  <em><em>1.
