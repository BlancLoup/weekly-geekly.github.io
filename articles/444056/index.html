  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet providers in Crimea sharply increased prices for services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Crimeans massively complain of a sharp rise in the cost of services of local Internet providers, <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3909999">as reported</a> by Kommersant.  The Federal Antimonopoly Service understands the situation, but it is already clear that the main reason is the need to comply with the ‚ÄúSpring Law‚Äù.  In Crimea, it is especially carefully monitored for its implementation, it is possible that in the coming months, tariff increases will be traced in other regions. <br><br>  Now all home Internet providers are required to provide information on price increases from the beginning of the year to March 25 in the anti-trust service.  A copy of the letter of testimony states that the service considers all civil applications for violations of antitrust laws.  The same was confirmed in the press service of the FAS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Inquiries from the antimonopoly service were received by ten providers in the region, according to the consulting company "OrderCom".  The company's general director, Dmitry Galushko, confirmed that the subscribers had expressed mass discontent with a significant increase in tariffs (1.5 - 2 times) since the beginning of this year.  Also, residents of the Sevastopol region publicly complained on the website of the head of the Crimea, Sergey Aksenov, to a local Internet provider, Crimea-Online.  According to them, the tariffs for the whole month increased by 450 - 750 rubles.  Denis Kamyshev, a deputy of the municipality of the Kolchugino rural settlement of Simferopol, is also concerned about the total increase in discontent of the local population, in connection with which he sent a letter to the head of the district administration. <br><br>  According to one of the players in the communications market in Crimea, he confirmed information about the rise in prices for Internet service providers.  But in his estimation, the growth was no more than 25%.  "This is due to the increase in tariffs of main operators operating on the peninsula," he says.  Dmitry Galushko said that the rise in prices is connected with the requirements of infrastructure owners (cable ducts, LEB supports, etc.) to conclude agreements with providers and raise tariffs.  On the site "Crimea-Online" you can see the notice of the increase in the cost of renting supports SUE "Krymenergo" 2.5 times.

      Also, do not forget about the "Spring Law", which entered into force on July 1, 2018.  According to which all operators are obliged to store data of telephone conversations, messages, sounds and images, including video. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDue to the political situation in the region, security agencies began to demand the introduction of data storage systems and the fulfillment of the requirements of the law in Crimea, but a similar situation will arise for all telecom operators in Russia closer to the beginning of 2020,‚Äù explains Galushko.  Rising prices for telecommunications services will certainly be even after the FSB authorities begin to impose requirements on operators under the ‚ÄúSpring Act‚Äù. <br><br>  Crimean operators are reluctant to contact and many of them refuse to comment on this topic.  Back in May last year, some Russian providers began to raise the price by 8-10%.  This was warned in advance by "Comfort" St. Petersburg, "Dom.ru" Perm and Rostelecom. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThroughout the country, providers somehow bring tariffs to the conditions in which they could continue to exist and develop,‚Äù said TMT Consulting general director Konstantin Ankilov.  But he also claims that they will not be able to raise prices above a certain level, since they have to exist in the face of fierce competition.  At the same time, if the increase in tariffs will cause discontent with the FAS, operators will always be able to objectively justify the situation. <br><br>  It is worth noting that in 2018 Russia stayed in the top 10 countries with the lowest cost of mobile traffic.  For the seven months of last year, 1 GB of mobile traffic began to cost about 15% less.  Perhaps the current trends will force Russian operators to raise prices for communications. <br><br>  As for other countries, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434704/">the cheapest mobile Internet</a> is in Romania.  Here 1 GB of traffic costs only 9.2 rubles.  This is followed by Poland (22.8 rubles), India (23.9 rubles).  But the most expensive mobile traffic in countries such as South Korea, where the price of 1 GB reaches 659.8 rubles, the United Arab Emirates (769.2 rubles), Canada (1137 rubles) and Switzerland (1179.7 rubles). <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444056/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444056/</a></p>
