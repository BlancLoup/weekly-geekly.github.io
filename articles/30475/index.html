  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Having created “People Search”, Mail.ru surpassed Yandex.ru in some way.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mail.ru now has the “People Search” service, which is absent in almost all Russian search engines, including Yandex.ru <br>  The fact is that in the West a long time ago, in almost every country, there is a “Search for People”, for example, through the White Pages telephone directories posted on the I-net: <br>  Phonebook USA - <a href="http://yahoo.intelius.com/">yahoo.intelius.com</a> <br>  Australia's telephone directory is <a href="http://www.whitepages.com.au/wp/">www.whitepages.com.au/wp</a> <br>  Or by mailing address or email address. <br>  And all these variants of “People Search” are implemented in ordinary search engines, well, the most famous option is the <a href="http://people.yahoo.com/">Yahoo People Search service</a> , or for example in the Australian search engine <a href="http://www.sensis.com.au/">www.sensis.com.au the</a> search in the Phonebook is implemented. <br>  And in Russia so far no search engine has implemented “People Search”.  One of the reasons is that in Russia, for some reason, they are afraid to lay out telephone directories in I-net.  And for some reason this is considered not decent, although this information was never secret, for example, in the middle of the 20th century in Moscow there were “Help desks” where knowing the Name and Surname you could find out the exact address and telephone number of a person and find him to contact him! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Who needs it: <br>  For example, I want to find a specific person, classmate or former business partner, with whom I lost contact and at the same time I know his “Name and Surname” <br>  In this case, only the Telephone Base, Post Office Base of Russia and Email Address Base can help me, and Search on social networks like Odnoklassniki.ru, My World Mail.ru and VKontakte can help. Ru and others <br>  Even this “People Search” service could be useful when searching for namesakes or distant relatives for those who are trying to find the roots of their ancestry (to make up the Family Tree), again trying to establish contact with their distant relatives (though this was not popular in Soviet times only those who do not want to be considered "Ivan does not remember kinship"). <br><br>  The implementation of “People Search” in Mail.ru is not yet perfect: <br>  <b>Firstly,</b> Mail.ru searches only in its social network “My World” and in its database of Email-addresses, that is, the search has a very limited base. <br>  <b>Secondly</b> , the Mail.ru database of email addresses has a lot of fictitious addresses.  For example, one person using one last name and a hundred different names can create hundreds of different email addresses for themselves.  And maybe even use someone else's name and check it is almost impossible.  Moreover, some of the addresses (if they were used to send Spam) are blocked by Mail.ru, but these blocked, fake addresses also appear in the results of the “People Search” Mail.ru :( <br>  And <b>thirdly, of</b> course, the Mail.ru People Search interface is still unfinished: you cannot sort the results either alphabetically or by age, but you have to turn over the endless pages of the search result (even the number of pages in the search results is missing). <br><br>  Of course, I would like that a full-featured “People search” service would be implemented on Yandex.ru.  Yandex.ru surely could have agreed with MGTS and at least for Moscow to search for people via the Telephone Directory, could it also implement a search in its database of Email addresses and free hosting Narod.ru.  Well, could I do a search on Social Networks both in my My Circle and Odnoklassniki.ru and VKontakte.Ru.  And biographies of famous people could be collected from <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">www.Wikipedia.org</a> and in such databases as <a href="http://www.24news.ru/persons/">www.24news.ru/persons</a> </div>
