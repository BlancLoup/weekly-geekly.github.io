  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PS3 steering wheel overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The thirst for speed lives in every real man with the desire for a permanent society of beautiful women, a passion for arms and a desire to sit with friends in an Irish pub on Friday night.  However, despite the fact that ‚Äúwhat kind of Russian does not like to drive fast?‚Äù, Far from each of us has enough skill to go to Formula 1 pilots or brains to NOT go to street racers.  Especially for those who travel in the real world, sacredly honoring the traffic regulations of the Russian Federation, and prefers to rip on the track exclusively in the virtual, we present an overview of the best racing wheels for the PS3 console. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/73af7e67/227ca1f4/6ba37ecd/2aedb43b.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Opens an overview of the mega-wheel from the company Thrustmaster - T500 RS.  This stunning device was created for fans of the world of speeds, who only by the whim of the villain of fate did not pass the selection to the world of big motor sport, but, nevertheless, they have forever preserved love for him in their hearts.  This steering wheel was specially made for fans of the Grand Turismo game series - the PS3 exclusive, which is generally recognized as the best and most realistic car simulator on game consoles. <br><br>  You start enjoying the ‚Äúweight‚Äù of the purchase even before the box with the device deflorates: this mega-device weighs as many as 14 full kilos, and the wheel itself has a little less than 5 kg.  The rest is pedals and power supply.  Such a significant weight is a consequence of the fact that all the main components of the device, which are most susceptible to wear, are made of metal, which, after some thought, it was decided to identify as alloyed steel.  So, it‚Äôs possible not to worry about the safety and durability of the unit: it can only be broken if you specifically set yourself the goal.  The second undoubted advantage of metal components on plastic is that, due to the increased weight, they have considerable stability: try it, try to accidentally shift the 7-kilogram pedal unit, without calculating the accelerator pressing force!  Pedals, by the way, can be mounted both in a classic car - from above, and from below, as in real racing supercars, while also adjusting their rigidity for your convenience. <br><br>  Thanks to the magnificently powerful 60 kW industrial motor, capable of producing up to 3000 revolutions per minute, the steering wheel behaves in your hands like a real wheel of a rally-raid leader: when turning, drifting on gravels or hitting cars of rivals, the steering wheel strives to break out out of your hands.  For the convenience of the game, the steering wheel can be quite easily attached to any flat surface.  For reliability, it can be fastened with special bolts, but, in general, this is unnecessary: ‚Äã‚Äãit is not so easy to move a 5-kilogram metal monster.  The gearshifts are not located on the steering wheel itself, but on the carrying unit, which saves the player from unnecessary hemorrhoids when entering sharp turns.  The number of steering turns is also impressive: it turns as much as 1080 degrees, i.e.  for three full cycles.  True, it is not entirely clear, but why so much is needed at all, but be that as it may, the number of turns can always be adjusted in the settings.  To determine the angle of rotation in the Thrustmaster - T500 RS, reliable contactless magnetic sensors of the Hall system are used, reflecting with jeweler accuracy all 65 thousand positions that fall on three full steering turns.

      This miracle of technology has only two drawbacks.  First and foremost is its price.  This device costs about 20 thousand rubles and is therefore unlikely to ever be the subject of widespread demand.  The second is a rubber steering wheel cover.  For such money, the buyer has the right to expect the edging of the skin of a young alligator.  Well, and a small remark: those who lack a full-fledged speed selector unit to achieve complete authenticity will be able to purchase it later this fall. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/30715973/15bc8035/032f1bd1/e18501fc.jpg"><br>  Another steering wheel, created specifically for playing Grand Turismo 5, is a top model from Fanatec, a German manufacturer of exclusive gaming devices for car racing.  The steering wheel of a Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2 can also rightfully be considered the jewel of the collection of any virtual race car driver.  Fully licensed by Porsche, the leading designers of which took an active part in its design, the steering wheel is thought out to the smallest detail in terms of design, comfort and ergonomics.  The base of the steering wheel is made in orange color, as in the present Porsche GT3 RS, and for its braid, authentic Alcantara leather is used, famous for its durability.  This material, in addition to its functionality, has another feature - the non-weathered odor of expensive leather, which will certainly enhance the effect of presence in your virtual supercar. <br><br>  The maximum number of wheel revolutions is 900 degrees: not 1080, as in the previous speaker, but also impressive.  To create a feedback effect, three powerful Mabuchi RS 550 servomotors are built into the steering wheel, one of which is responsible for power feedback, two for vibration.  The current game settings are displayed on the built-in steering wheel LCD display.  The wheel remembers up to 5 tuning sets, which is very convenient if you, for example, race in Formula 1, in rally and on the streets of megalopolises.  If this wheel falls into the hands of a person who does not consider the race to be something special and chasing every five-year period in the mood of an ordinary gamepad, he is able to completely change the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe world of virtual racing and turn an indifferent neutral into an ardent fan. <br><br>  However, a fly in the ointment.  Despite the rather high cost of steering (about 9 thousand rubles), the pedal unit is not included in its kit, and this is, for a minute, about 10 thousand full-weight rubles, and even about 2.5 thousand for a gearbox.  Thus, a complete set will cost even more than the indecency of an expensive Trustmaster T500 RS.  What did you think?  If you want to come off in full, you have to fork out. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/967fba7e/014b19f7/50d8df84/7c753588.jpg"><br>  The G27 steering wheel from Logitech is the ideological heir to the super popular G25 - a previous model from the same manufacturer.  Since the previous model was close to the ideal, and there were practically no complaints about its work, the developers decided not to reinvent the wheel and only improve the main components of the device without making any significant changes to it. <br><br>  Finishing and ergonomics of the device leave a very positive impression: looking at this steering wheel, you understand that removing or adding something would be a crime against the gaming community.  A stunningly comfortable 900-degree steering wheel with genuine leather inserts and a la F-1 LED tachometer, an authentic 6-speed gearbox with 16 programmable buttons, completely silent with Swiss watches accuracy, a pedal unit with adjustable pedals and interchangeable plates designed to ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù the standard pedals as comfortably as possible with your individual foot - all this leaves the gamer with a completely indescribable feeling. <br><br>  The minor flaws of this mega-device are noticeable only in comparison with our previous heroes, but is it fair to compare heavyweights with superweights?  Still, these are already different price categories.  This device will cost the consumer only 9 thousand rubles.  Not so much for incomparable quality. <br><br>  Summary: Each of the steering wheels presented on the review will decorate the collection of any gamer.  But the Thrustmaster T500RS and Fanatec Porsche 911 GT3 RS V2, in spite of their amazing build quality, will surely scare away the lion‚Äôs share of buyers with their astronomical price.  In terms of price / quality ratio, the Logitech G27 has no competitors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126419/</a></p>
