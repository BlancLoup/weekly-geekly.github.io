  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúOdu console‚Äù - IN MASS? From the VIII exhibition-competition ‚ÄúAlphabet of country construction. May. House"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of May - the beginning of June, exactly in parallel with Arch Moscow, in the ‚ÄúHouse on Brestskaya‚Äù an exhibition-contest ‚ÄúThe <a href="http://archvestnik.ru/">Alphabet of Suburban Construction</a> .  May.  House".  Due to this coincidence of works, she collected one and a half times less than usual.  About visitors can not talk. <br>  As before, the competition was held in only two nominations - ‚ÄúProject-Idea‚Äù and ‚ÄúRealized Object‚Äù (respectively, 55 and 19 works). <a name="habracut"></a>  And although this time there was no observation of country banks and offices, the project of an apartment building in Zhukovka (designed by workshop No. 17 of Mosproject-3, architect S. Kozyrev, II place in the nomination Project-Idea) is still knocked down a pantalik - how, one wonders, compare it with the residence of the oligarch along with the house of the guard in Zhukovka, a thousand and a half to two meters (A.Vyazminov, I.Selvinsky), types of houses in the range from 250 to 500 m2 for cottage villages (V. Bindeman, M. Kharitonov, etc.) or a modest 100-meter semi-semi-semi-cottage "for myself" (G.V.  oronin)?  But there is still a concept from L.Senyavskiy - a house-springboard with his koschlakovski-like casual delivery: on a bleached cardboard with spring-shaped slots and flippers.  The magic wand is still the same - art innovation as a comprehensive criterion, but this can happen from time to time, as they say, out of despair or lack of thinking, or both. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f36/1fd/cfc/f361fdcfc52081079c5fe6e7bad1a1d3.jpg"></a>  <em>Residential building "K".</em>  <em>Archit.</em>  <em>T.Kuzembaev, D.Kondrashov.</em>  <em>I place in the nomination "Realized object".</em>  Of the implementations of the contenders for victory in the competition, perhaps, there were three - masterfully built into the hill and sheltered from the curious neighbour's eyes ‚ÄúBungalow‚Äù from ‚ÄúArdepo‚Äù, ‚ÄúHouse K‚Äù on the Klyazma reservoir - Kuzembaevskaya variation on the theme of a temporary residence with numerous wooden ‚Äú releases into nature in the form of bridges, canopy and open galleries, and finally, another optic-rationalistic opus with a gray background of sentimentality in A. Kozyr-I. Babak Arkhangelsk.  The first two shared the first place, the last one was satisfied with the second one, probably due to the incompleteness of the construction work, conceptually refrained from awarding the third jury. <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43c/730/b61/43c730b61f33923ab5a9e5aaa07cc916.jpg"></a>  <em>House "Bungalow".</em>  <em>Archit.</em>  <em>P.Abramov, Bureau "Ardepo".</em>  <em>I place in the nomination "Realized object".</em>  In the ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù the competition was immeasurably denser - the leading peleton consisted of more than a dozen names: AB Bureau and N. Dorofeyev, Kamen Art Group and Sloboda AB, Borodavchenko-Goncharova and A. Vyazminov, A. and N.Sokhatskie and Kuptsov-Gikalo, R.Leonidov and I.Shkoda, M.Shirnin and S.Nasedkin otpkovkovavshiesya from him - not counting S.Kozyrev, author of the aforementioned apartment building in Zhukovka.  Basically, all this is the protagonists of the neo-modernism in its version of minimalism, more or less compounded by the archetypical place, the images of the landscape and the features of social order. <br>  Of the actual trends revealing themselves: the reconstruction of red-brick (and not only) monsters of the 1990s.  (M.Dolgov-E.Loskutov, AB "Terra", I.Shkoda, etc.).  It should be noted that already at the end of the last decade there were examples of unfinished modernization (the reasons for the spread of this phenomenon were different - from underreporting of hydrogeological circumstances to the consequences of criminal fights), now they lived, bored or sold to the new owner, and here they are rebuilt with different degrees of radicalism according to the changed tastes. <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40a/4f2/db6/40a4f2db61236145c55a47da11f60103.jpg"></a>  <em>"House on the hill."</em>  <em>Bureau "AB".</em>  <em>I place in the nomination "Project-idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa country house."</em>  Another trend is downright indomitable invasion of console houses and, moreover, of beam houses, heroically reproducing a titanic method of hanging and hanging - including the entire size of the house.  This is what R.Leonidov and I.Shkoda, Borodavchenko-Goncharov and Gikalo-Kuptsov amuse themselves, and also N. Dorofeyev, who has become the laureates of the review, with the ‚ÄúIsland House‚Äù in Sochi with its hanging ‚Äúsecond floor‚Äù beams over the pool surrounding the building (III a place in the nomination ‚ÄúProject Idea‚Äù) and an AB Bureau with a U-shaped house in plan, triumphantly riding an artificial green hill (I place in the nomination ‚ÄúProject Idea‚Äù).  Another exhibitor, M.Shirnin, has a villa with more than a pretentious proper name - ‚ÄúOde to the console‚Äù, although it is not hung out in such a way as to the full, unlike others. <br>  A year ago, admiring the console - it was almost exotic, today this trick went to the masses.  Tomorrow to wait for satiety? .. </div>
