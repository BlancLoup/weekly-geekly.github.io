  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The share of pirated books in RuNet is 95%, but Litres is profitable.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to representatives of the largest electronic library "Litres", only every twentieth user reads e-books in Russia legally.  In its calculations, "Liters" used the data from the Synovate Comcon Russian Index of Target Groups: the agency obtained this data in a survey of 28 thousand people in 50 cities of Russia with a population of more than 100 thousand people, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/09/07/2015/559e6fa99a79475eff72d696">writes</a> RBC.  The study revealed that the volume of the legal market for electronic books in the Russian Federation for 2014 is 950 million rubles, which is 10 million books.  At the same time, pirated content is not included in the market assessment at the end of last year. <br><br>  According to the Director General of Litres Sergey Anurev, it‚Äôs pirated content that accounts for 95% of book downloads.  Representatives of the analytical company J'son &amp; Partners gave a similar assessment, showing that in 2013 only 7% of users downloaded books legally.  At the end of the same 2013, J'son &amp; Partners estimated the volume of the e-book market at only 1%, in monetary terms - 600 million rubles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Unfortunately, Sergei Anuryev does not have accurate data on the distribution of pirated and legal content in the e-book market.  ‚ÄúWe can indirectly judge their popularity according to the data of [the traffic analysis service] SimilarWeb,‚Äù he commented on the situation.  However, Anurev pointed out the two most popular sites that provide access to illegal content - this is the torrent tracker RuTracker.org (91.4 million visits in June, according to SimilarWeb) and Flibusta.net (5.2 million visits in June , by SimilarWeb).  From July 1, 2014 to July 1, 2015, the service sold about 6 million e-books. <br><br>  According to the head of the company, this year the volume of the legal market for e-books can double, reaching a figure of 1.7 billion rubles.  According to Anuryev, over the past three years, the growth of the e-book market over the year is 99.3%.  True, these figures concern both the legal content market and the pirated books market.  However, with the tightening of anti-piracy legislation in Russia, the market for legal e-books is growing.

      As for the anti-piracy law, since May 1 of this year, the expanded amendments came into force.  Now the law works both in relation to video content, both earlier and in relation to books and music.  If the site distributing illegal content receives a warning from the supervisory authorities twice, then such a resource can be blocked forever. <br><br>  However, so far no resources have been blocked forever.  ‚ÄúAfter two or three years, we will see how it works, and after five years, the share of piracy can significantly decrease, but it will not disappear completely,‚Äù commented the situation on the Internet, General Director of the Internet Copyright Association (AZAPI; specializes in books) Oleg Kolesnikov . <br><br>  It is also worth noting that the online store e-books "Liters" went to the operating profitability.  The size of the proceeds and profits the general director of the service did not disclose, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2764654">Kommersant writes</a> .  At the same time, Sergey Anurev noted that last year more than 275 million rubles were paid to royalty holders.  ‚ÄúUsually we keep 50% of the sales, the rest goes to the publisher and the author,‚Äù said Anurev. <br><br>  The service itself began operation in 2005.  The company's main shareholders are Russia's largest publishing group, Eksmo-AST, and the Ozon Internet hypermarket. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292424/</a></p>
