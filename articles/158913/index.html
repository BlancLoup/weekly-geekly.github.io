  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mass hijacking accounts from EA Origin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Relatively recently, EA forums began to fill up with messages about hacked accounts of the Origin game distribution service.  At first, the support responded to people right on the spot in a personal, a little later, when the phenomenon became more widespread, it became more difficult to break through to support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ac/c42/3ec/7acc423ecedfe2bbfc462f1baddc0b4e.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Each account loss history begins with an email about changing the registration address: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1c/821/239/e1c82123974b6d568fcc82661644abf5.png"><br><br>  And here, the alarmed user to break to check your account, origin responds - no, I do not know you, it is free. <br><br>  Further, the path to the support, because password recovery, of course, is impossible - the link comes to the villain's mail.  Attempting to reach through the <a href="https://help.ea.com/contact-us">browser</a> does not bring any success.  For users from the CIS there is a telephone support in Moscow, but I could not get through there.  Switching the country to the USA, you can see the ‚ÄúLive Chat‚Äù button, where the waiting time is indicated ‚Äú10 minutes‚Äù, but it lasts forever.  The forum offers to log in to the client, switch the language to ‚ÄúEnglish (USA)‚Äù, open from the menu Help -&gt; Origin Help, click the Live Chat button. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bd/e80/435/8bde8043581e04ba58514e0fd9b8903d.png"><br><br>  In the late evening, the waiting time was specified from 1 to 5 minutes, but at least 15 will have to wait. <br>  When a good Hindu from the support responds, he will ask some details about the old account, such as: the last digits of the card associated with the account, date of birth, address, etc.  Further, most likely they will ask for a new email, to which the old account will be tied, and an existing account should not be registered to it. <br><br>  I finally, in order to prevent this in the future, set a secret question.  However, it was not indicated what was installed where, however, and what action would be offered to answer it. <br><br>  I was somewhat lucky - I was able to log into the account through Facebook, I found a completely left-handed guy there, with the specified email and some other details.  Googling a bit, found a pack of topics for him on various forums about the sale of stolen accounts from Origin, with battlefields, crisis and other buns.  Moreover, if the original Battlefield 3 + Premium costs you 70 dollars, you can buy rubles for 150. And they buy the same ... Most of our ... um ... hackers are quite ordinary guys without any special prejudices about other people's property, they can be found on blogs , social networks and other.  I found my handsome wherever I could.  Very cool that in Russia you can steal, and the stolen - to sell in public. <br><br>  And now we can somewhat clarify the question: what is the cause of such massive theft?  And the solution is simple - the password from EA Origin can be trite.  A whole bunch of low-quality videos on Youtube, like, what and how much can this be done.  By selecting a password, you can change ALL account details.  To change the registration e-mail, no confirmation from this e-mail is required. <br><br>  And the only recommendation I can give is to change your Origin password, if you have one, to a randomly generated maximum of 16 characters!  If not, congratulations, you do not feel the same idiot as I, who are offended even by schoolchildren thanks to the poor security of the service of the largest game publisher. <br><br>  It‚Äôs a shame twice - that such a big office cannot make the simplest protection for its users, and that the forums on behalf of American and European users are again full of messages ‚ÄúRussians are insulting!‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158913/</a></p>
