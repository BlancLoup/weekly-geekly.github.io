  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do companies need mobile apps or why there are so much junk in Markets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now any company wants a mobile application.  When we started developing the iPhone and Android app to order, we began to receive a huge number of requests from customers.  At first, we were very happy about this fact, but soon it became frustrating for us.  Because the majority of customers are not really aware of why mobile apps are needed, how people use them, and how they can help in business.  In this article I decided to write about typical customer requests, and why we often have to upset them.  And also about what to do with all this. <br><br>  <b>Mobile application - business card</b> <br><br>  Customer says: <br>  - We want to make an application about our company. <br>  - What features would you like to see in it? <br>  - Well, information about our company, contacts, order form is required, news, reviews. <br>  - Okay, how many visitors are there on your site? <br>  - I don't know, maybe 50 <br>  - Are there those who come again? <br>  - It is unlikely, mostly people get to our site from the search.

      To the question ‚ÄúWhy, then, will people install the program on the phone?‚Äù Customers can no longer answer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, everything is very simple.  An application is a tool for solving a problem.  Here are three main tasks that people solve using mobile applications: <br>  - pass the time; <br>  - get access to the Internet in the absence of other methods; <br>  - urgently obtain the necessary information; <br><br>  If the application does not solve any of these problems, it is most likely not needed by people.  Better to spend money on a good mobile version of the site, and you will be happy!  And if you see that people <b>regularly</b> come to your site, then most likely the site allows them to solve some problem.  Having reflected it in the mobile application, you will most likely get satisfied customers! <br><br>  <b>Mobile application for online store</b> <br><br>  Customer says: <br>  - We want to make an application with which you can browse the catalog of our products and make an order <br>  - Okay, what are your goals? <br>  - We would like people to find our app in the Appstore and Android Market and make purchases. <br><br>  In fact, the mobile application is made for <b>existing regular</b> customers.  If people regularly place orders at a particular store, then a mobile application for them may be a more convenient tool to place an order.  But you know a lot of these online stores?  Most people search for goods in Yandex, then go to the right online store, place an order <b>once</b> and leave.  Are they going to download the app for the sake of one order?  Much better here will suit the mobile version of the site, which will get people searching for products from mobile devices. <br><br>  In this case, customers often cite the example of Tanuki and the Pizza Empire, whose applications have become very popular.  But we must not forget that people regularly ordered food in these establishments.  The application allowed to do it more conveniently and from any place.  Of course, users were welcome!  In addition, these institutions were among the first in Russia that made a mobile application, but now you won't be surprised by this. <br><br>  <b>But iPhones and iPads - this is so fashionable.</b>  <b>Can we still make some application?</b> <br><br>  Sure you may!  But first, you still need to think carefully about why people will use it regularly.  If there is no direct obvious application, think up an additional one that will force people to open the application regularly.  Here are simple examples of how to make a regular company application necessary for permanent use. <br><br>  - An application about a fitness club, which also contains a training diary and a collection of exercises <br>  - Retail app, also including a handy shopping list <br>  - Restaurant app, which also includes recipes <br>  - Beauty salon app with everyday makeup tips <br><br>  Still, relatively few Russian companies have their own mobile applications, so it‚Äôs not so difficult to stand out in this market.  The main thing is not to get involved too much, and not to try to insert the analogue of Angry Birds on one of the tabs of the investment company application. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137644/</a></p>
