  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the smartphone on Android, which works for a week! Highscreen boost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What is more important in your smartphone?  Maybe its large user-friendly display?  And perhaps its fast internet?  Perhaps his chips and camera type frills?  Surely, many applications for work and entertainment, which are always in your pocket?  But certainly this is all useless when your smartphone shines with a red diode and writes ‚Äúconnect the charger‚Äù! <br>  So here.  Smartphone on android with a battery for a week?  Yes! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/843/c0f/630/843c0f630288fb2ab2040bfd901b8a85.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Specifications </h1><br>  Standard: GSM 900/1800/1900, 3G <br>  Type: Smartphone <br>  Operating system: Android 4.1 <br>  Body Type: Classic <br>  Body Material: Plastic <br>  Number of SIM-cards: 2 <br>  Mode of operation of several SIM-cards: alternate <br>  Weight: 185 g <br>  Dimensions (WxHxT): 68 √ó 123x14.2 mm <br>  Screen type: color IPS, touch <br>  Type of touch screen: multitouch, capacitive <br>  Diagonal: 4.3 inches <br>  Image size: 540 √ó 960 <br>  Number of pixels per inch (PPI): 256 <br>  Camera: 8 million pixels, 1.3 million pixels. <br>  Interfaces: USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 3.0, GPS, FM Radio <br>  Processor: Qualcomm MSM8225,100 MHz <br>  The number of processor cores: 2 <br>  Video Processor: Adreno 203 <br>  Built-in memory: 4 GB <br>  RAM: 1 GB <br>  Memory Card Support: microSD (TransFlash), up to 32 GB <br>  Battery capacity 4160 mAh <br><br><h1>  Box and equipment </h1><br>  Before us is a cardboard box-brick.  At first glance, the impression of a product without unnecessary frills.  A box of good cardboard, on which the characteristics of the smartphone are applied in the form of a diagram of the smartphone itself, as well as the name of the company and model. <br>  <strong>This is a highscreen boost.</strong> <br>  Inside the box is a charger (220v-USB), a USB-microUSB cable, a headset and a user manual.  Forgot something?  Oh yes!  Actually, the smartphone itself! <br><br><h1>  Smartphone itself </h1><br>  In the hand of a mortal is well.  Immediately felt his weight (185 grams, after all, for a modern smartphone is not enough). <br>  The materials of the body and assembly leave only positive emotions.  Or rather, confidence that this smartphone even in a year will be in good shape.  The back cover has a beautiful texture, which also protects from scratches and does not allow the smartphone to slide. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f58/19f/fdd/f5819ffdd06223518362acc3c108df5a.jpg"><br>  Also, the Highscreen logo is on the lid - chrome plated, embossed. <br>  The back cover has a convenient recess for removal.  The cover is removed and put with some effort.  But thanks to this, it does not creak. <br>  Under the hood we see a huge (4160 mAh) battery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4d/858/f8e/f4d858f8e386b869125b6869d7eaf85e.jpg"><br>  And under the hero - a slot for a memory card and two SIM cards.  The radio module in the device is one. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd5/ca2/f4b/bd5ca2f4b3753597b7f767e471c80f64.jpg"><br>  The rest of the body is a semi-gloss plastic (a good compromise between a pleasant eye gloss and a practical matte finish).  The plastic itself is solid, durable. <br>  The buttons do not dangle, the designations on them are also embossed. <br>  The device is not only weighty, but also voluminous.  Its thickness is 14.2 mm.  However, it does not interfere with the use of the device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9dd/e0d/4ab/9dde0d4abf0111558806556179815b33.jpg"><br>  On the sides at Bust pass the edges - a tubercle of almost the entire length.  In addition to design refinement, the convenience of the grip thanks to these edges increases significantly.  This is better than smooth edges with convex buttons, as for me. <br>  On the left, the device has a volume control swing.  Find it is not difficult, I could not miss. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42c/6d4/e9d/42c6d4e9d6acd92c925574680c09d554.jpg"><br>  On the right - the power button (lock), as well as (oh gods, yes!) - the camera button!  It's fine!  The camera button is on-off and the convenience of using the camera grows a thousand times! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a96/32c/e23/a9632ce23c57ed2a18927a93f66d8930.jpg"><br>  In addition, the device has a headset jack and charging. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/535/877/13a/53587713a69756ffbe7d5da7bd9cfc66.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c76/f30/213/c76f3021301ba5e40c72702de5464d9e.jpg"><br>  By the way, a simple headset is about the headset, with something inexorably reminiscent of that from Apple.  Only the color is different.  The sound in it is average.  But then it is complete.  To walk to the store and buy a normal one.  It is good that the standard has long existed, and the choice in the store is great. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/775/22b/9f1/77522b9f1b0b9fcd225c16e63d8601f0.jpg"><br>  Cameras in Busta, of course, two. <br>  Primary on 8 megapixels, with dual LED flash. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b9/6ed/5b9/7b96ed5b9600c15251fa8cd178f51dc4.jpg"><br>  The pictures are of medium quality.  There is a front camera 1.3 MP. <br>  A 4.3-inch display, the resolution is 540 √ó 960 pixels (this is 256 ppi).  The screen does not shine colors and viewing angles.  He rather budget.  But I can't call him bad.  Although, in the era of FullHD five-inch models - it's time to think about at least HD-resolution. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80a/692/f6c/80a692f6c2303a9d78526498b9ad7422.jpg"><br>  The display (and the entire front panel) is covered with glass.  Glass - tempered. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8b/636/ccf/c8b636ccf38260ff62c048f4e7af21c4.jpg"><br>  Despite its strength, it is scratched. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24c/c34/1c3/24cc341c36b63a5554a498cb065ebb13.jpg"><br>  The display sensor supports multi-touch for 5 touches. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a24/932/fd5/a24932fd57785c2aa6a6904b3a254c4c.png"><br>  The speaker on the phone is loud, the vibration is good.  Speaking speaker also did not cause any complaints.

    <h1>  Soft </h1><br>  The operating system is already familiar to everyone. Android JB (4.1.2) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/280/37f/b39/28037fb39a363634782f50c0f70ae1d5.png"><br>  No shells, snags and other filth are here.  Almost all stock.  It works as it should. <br>  There is a tricky setting - dynamic brightness.  Depending on what is on the screen - changes the brightness.  For example, when watching a video - boosts.  When reading the text - lowers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d89/267/6c5/d892676c5eb20aa3262b34079cfe59ee.png"><br>  The performance of the device is average.  Judge for yourself. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f65/32c/99c/f6532c99cb6401d8bf892350075a87e4.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/97d/752/5b8/97d7525b8057a5922bd41c61adfabd53.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e5/29a/233/6e529a2331635bbc79df4ada30dc7902.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e2/396/563/4e2396563c3c519a915999483b609087.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/466/55a/9c9/46655a9c904c543e716bec2a904bdbc4.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/563/5b7/9ed/5635b79edb52e8c958e7fbe3b2d70a4f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/333/5ea/c04/3335eac0403d0b68cf4d89959c855567.png"><br><br>  Since the device is on two SIM cards - there are small add-ons to work with this miracle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/806/22a/84f/80622a84f429855b2dddaa8053d38f94.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a87/35c/f83/a8735cf834b5fb1b01e5b236e93c1d08.png"><br>  There is also a software equalizer. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/533/fee/354/533fee3542d7454adefb7d91bc2dc1e4.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/355/8d6/13d/3558d613df4ae232d954083a468e94d4.png"><br>  Not cheated device and radio.  This is sometimes necessary. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/694/803/c06/694803c068e7d0328194d8070b7201d6.png"><br>  The rest is just a good clean stock android.  Do with it what you want and how you want. <br>  Yes, Boost can rutanut and sew custom on it (oh, yes you have a firmware!) <br><br><h1>  Trump </h1><br>  Well, in conclusion, I left the sweetest. <br>  With a permanently on display and a radio module, the device lives for more than 24 hours. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd2/de2/137/bd2de21371d957453903fc036417db6d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da7/a10/7ac/da7a107acdbf95e51714731db2df2d47.png"><br>  In normal mode, it's a week without a power outlet! <br>  Friends, this is finally happening!  Our prayers are heard! <br><br>  As a result, we have: a device with good case materials, an average display, not the most powerful stuffing, but an awesome battery!  Well, on JellyBean! <br>  What else is necessary for happiness?  Price?  <a href="">9000 rubles</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181496/</a></p>
