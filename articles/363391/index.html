This bill was proposed by the Russian Union of Rights Holders (RSP) in the person of Mikhalkov.  Nikita Sergeevich presented the concept of the bill personally to the President in September of this year. <br><br>  A little later, First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov instructed several ministries, including the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Justice, to draft a law on "anti-piracy tax" on the Internet.  In the case of the adoption of the bill, telecom operators will pay a flat fee (as far as one can understand, the annual fee) in favor of the right holders.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  It is clear that this bill is closest to the sphere of activity of the Ministry of Communications and then to all other ministries and departments.  Maybe that is why the Ministry of Communications in the person of Deputy Head Alexei Volin has already given feedback on the bill.  The review is <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/579654">short and succinct</a> : ‚ÄúThis will mean that there is no piracy, since everything is paid for.‚Äù <br><br>  Alexey Volin gave a relatively <a href="http://izvestia.ru/news/579654">extensive interview</a> to Izvestia, in which he explained this point of view: ‚ÄúWe are opposed to one organization being monopolized to arrogate to itself the right of collective management of rights.  We believe that trying to transfer control over rights to one person and, moreover, allow them to keep 30‚Äì40% of the total collection, is a robbery of the industry, which should and can earn itself.  We are not sure that these people will fairly distribute the proceeds between the right holders. ‚Äù <br><br>  He also said the following: ‚ÄúIt will be a big blow to the producers of films and serials who have started working on the Internet, buying licenses or raising money for viewing,‚Äù the Deputy Minister of Communication is sure.  - Such services will be killed by the introduction of such a collection - they will lose their meaning if we legalize piracy.  The loss of industry due to piracy is considerable, and it will be impossible to compensate these sums by the collection. ‚Äù <br><br>  A similar opinion is shared by the president of the Russian Television Academy Taffy Alexander Akopov: ‚Äúafter five years, the online video market and views on the Internet will be able to compete in terms of revenue from film distribution and income from sales of television rights.‚Äù  In other words, if you introduce a "tax on the Internet", then no growth in income from the online video industry is not expected. <br><br>  It is worth noting that revenues from telecom operators are planned to be distributed in accordance with the actual use of the content of one or another rightholder.  And the use will be tracked by the method currently being developed, which includes elements of both <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/111054/">DPI</a> and the recognition of content elements.  The obtained data will be published in open form, and the right holders will receive funds, depending on the activity of using their content.  As far as one can understand, such a system is unique, and has not been used anywhere in the world. <br><br>  It remains to wait for the views of representatives of other departments.  In the meantime, you can express your opinion in the survey (or in the comments, as it is more convenient to whom). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363391/</a></p>
