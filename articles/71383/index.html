For those who do not remember, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">here is a wiki</a> about how they successfully sawed 13,950,000 rubles, and all this came to the surface thanks to blogs. <br>  But everything is flowing, everything is changing, and for two years now the generation of the next cut has been living, about which there is not a word in runet yet.  It lives on the elegant address <a href="http://schoolinfo.educom.ru/">schoolinfo.educom.ru</a> : 8080 and is called the ‚ÄúElectronic Journal‚Äù or more officially the ‚ÄúSchool Information System‚Äù.  Previously, it was called "Urban School Information System 1.0" and lived <a href="http://www.schoolinfo.educom.ru/">here</a> .  To understand the seriousness of the problem, an account of schools using this service goes to hundreds, if not already to thousands, the system developer is a kind of office called ‚ÄúE-School‚Äù <a href="http://www.e-school.ru/">www.e-school.ru</a> , whose website has beautiful words about efficiency, long-term partnership and numerous GOST ah.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you can see, you can only enter there with a login and password and the only possible IE browser, although the presence of this login and password does not guarantee entry at all, it‚Äôs good if the system deigns to give you an error message, usually this does not happen if everything is correct after a few minutes expectations we fall inside the system.  (I just wanted to take screenshots for the post, the system showed foresight and logged in for 10 minutes).  Alas, the screenshots will be later.  I have to note that it‚Äôs not that the login problem is a performance problem in general, any interaction with the server entails a wait of 30 seconds to 10 minutes, the connection just doesn‚Äôt last longer, the transaction failed as a result or not the user is given to guess . <br><br>  Judging by the reviews of colleagues, the previous version did work a year ago.  Then, all users forcibly hinted at migration to version No. ... well, just a new version, simultaneously asking to manually overwrite all the data for the past year, as the developers did not master the database conversion.  Just re-hammer all teachers, all students, all grades and attendance of all students in all the lessons that are scattered (just scattered) in the depths of the system. <br><br>  The technology platform is asp + .NET + mssql, in the script it‚Äôs quite specific, but I don‚Äôt see anything particularly flawed in it myself. <br><br>  What is the depravity?  I'll tell you about the elementary transaction.  Suddenly, it turns out that the period of pupils' training was miraculously wondered by the students, not from the first of September, but from the 14th.  Accordingly, from the 1st to the 14th, we can not put down the assessment.  Well, try to fix it.  We take one student, delete his study period and create a new one for him.  Yes, unfortunately his grades and attendance were completely removed.  Well, it should be expected.  Re-open the class and find that the attendance and assessment of the entire class in which the child learns, also completely zeroed out.  What to do with it?  Nothing special, just re-drive thousands of numbers and letters into the tablet with your hands.  Thank God, the system graciously allows us to export what we see on the screen (not the data from all the tables) to excel, since this is realized by a couple of lines on the ASP.  No responsibility for data integrity, system availability, etc.  developers and support service of this system do not bear. <br>  Honestly, I immediately found a lot of ways to save more data or the entire database (interestingly, data from other schools is just as easy to reset?). <br><br>  What one teacher or administrator sees in the grading tables may not coincide with what is visible from other accounts.  The system is not yet found. <br><br>  Accordingly, any unsuccessful click with the mouse can lead to the loss of a large number of man hours to drive in data again.  There are no means of automated input, from the interfaces only a web-interface with lags of 10 minutes, no backup, no responsibility, it is possible to save what you now see in Excel, so that you can get data from again.  But this system still claims to manage the money for lunch, taking into account the aisles, but just not ... <br><br>  At a quick glance, this thing is a bit more complicated than a school portal.  If the school portal was made by a schoolchild during a week, then a student working on an ASP worked on an electronic journal and even a month or two, unfortunately, at least one hand tester was not enough. <br><br>  The list of ‚Äúmerits‚Äù can be continued for a long time, who was responsible for the visual design ?!  Who randomly named menu items.  Yes, this is still the same student who received the papers ... so I would like to find out how many millions of rubles, dollars, yen, or what is sawn better there. <br><br>  Alas, our teachers have already started working with EJ by inertia, so it will be difficult for me to test it further, I‚Äôm getting tired of recovering the data, but I‚Äôve got enough of my eyes to start sending emails with relevant content and in the memo request to refuse to use the system . <br><br>  Are there analogs?  Yes full. <br>  If you want, use ballov.net online or try the services listed <a href="http://foxua.ru/news/2008-12-23-996">here</a> , want - deploy the ‚ÄúNET school‚Äù (which, most likely, we will do) and ensure the safety of the data and file the solution.  There are lots of options, but the most dumb, inexorably predictable way was implemented with state support. <br><br>  In the end, please allow me some PR.  Recently I have been <a href="http://nextstage.livejournal.com/">blogging</a> about the life of a professional IT specialist in one of Moscow colleges.  If suddenly IT issues in educational institutions for you are not indifferent, then I invite you to read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71383/</a></p>
