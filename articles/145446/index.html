And if we don‚Äôt surprise anyone with a merchandise to a popular computer game or a new film, the characters of popular smartphone games began to enter our life relatively recently.  And, of course, our Chinese brothers take an active part in the production of such products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b4/c85/45c/9b4c8545c727e37322bd0a04491e87e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Today I will tell you about what came to me on a test device, originally from the Middle Kingdom, but officially delivered, which means that there is a guarantee for this device. <br>  I'm talking about android, the symbol of the same name operating system for smartphones. <br>  Some time ago I already came across photos of a toy of this type, but there was only a toy there, but here it was something more.  Let's get a look. <br><br><h5>  Unpacking </h5><br>  So, we have a box in which the device itself is located, a cord for connecting to a computer and a stand.  Instructions for use are pasted on the box itself, inside is the supplier's booklet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff5/3f8/c59/ff53f8c59f97a027271e18fbaee03f67.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cc/c07/039/3ccc07039b6be54a2b0e31aa2c314a9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f05/12e/9b3/f0512e9b3bf390be4af6675b5098f6a9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  What can this miracle android? </h5><br>  Firstly, this is an FM radio and mp3 player.  The device supports memory cards, songs must be poured directly into the root of the card.  I could not play the tracks recorded in the folder.  Volume control, track switching and radio station search are performed by turning the head of the robot, play / stop by pressing on the head. <br><br>  The built-in speaker is responsible for playing music, it is located at the bottom of the device, a stand is needed to lift the device above the table and not jam the sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1b/60a/ccd/f1b60accd16790163f502e48f8683ab2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99c/494/486/99c494486838be372471456d183e78e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the controls and interfaces are located on the ‚Äúback‚Äù of the robot: MiniUsb port, power on, microSD card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/05d/561/13a05d561d819da905815c2414326ec5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Play mp3 works without problems, as I wrote above, the tracks must be put in the root directory.  I did not manage to achieve intelligible work of the radio, but testing was conducted on the second floor of a 9-storey building, because I do not like synthetic tests in greenhouse conditions. <br><br>  Secondly, you can use the device as an audiobook or for broadcasting podcasts, similarly uploading files to a card. <br><br>  Thirdly, when connected to a computer, the android acts as an external speaker, so it can be a cool office accessory.  One has only to make sure that your musical taste coincides with the taste of colleagues, since the volume of the speakers is enough to listen to music for the entire office. <br><br>  The robot hands move, but it does not carry any functional load, except for aesthetic.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/302/36c/79f/30236c79f9c242b2186cbeed8c0f402f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And he also glows cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/796/bfb/080/796bfb080bbc1616b670834a21d8483d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, both the robot and the birds can be used as a portable speaker for portable devices, for example, for a PocketBook reader, in order to listen to music on vacation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98d/2d7/74a/98d2d774a95bd1382b397166fdca51f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/706/d69/497/706d69497aff5e39c72e65822f30c97b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, there are similar devices in the form of Angry Birds.  There are a number of significant differences from the player in the form of a robot from the birds: in particular, the birds have 3.5 jack jack instead of miniUSB, the column is located at the top and hidden behind the plastic.  Accordingly, in a set with a bird there is a wire of a slightly different configuration, it has two 3.5-jack plugs and 1 USB for connecting to a computer. <br><br><h5>  I will say a few words about what I did not like. </h5><br>  Basically, these are claims to the appearance of the devices, since it is not worth expecting a Hi-End sound from a portable office speaker a priori.  Android made with high quality and close to the original, but the colors cause some confusion.  The ‚Äúnative‚Äù light green color is super, but the dark blue robot is no longer pleasing to the eye. <br><br>  As for the birds, the manufacturer did not show much attention to detail, all the color variations of the birds are identical in shape and completely copied from the original red bird from the first level of the game.  Something tells me that if they were a little more diverse, they could be more successful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf8/932/914/cf8932914de0e67fe0fb3cd8e20f2f25.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/553/a0b/87b/553a0b87b133c7010a16669ca50974e5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a summary: A pleasant and inexpensive gift for a teenage child, a geek, or spending a lot of time at the computer. <br><br>  PS By tradition, larger photos are available <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/ragnamaniac/album/188999/%3Fp%3D0">in the album</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145446/</a></p>
