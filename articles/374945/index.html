It turned out that many of the users of Geektimes and Habra are passionate about the topic, but all the news about it is read on specialized sites.  The audience of these sites is very large.  So much so that we can confidently talk about the subculture of eSports, which is no longer just one player, but has specialized journalists and bloggers, administrators and functionaries of teams, bookmakers and betters, sponsors and advertisers, coaches and ... psychologists in orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63b/a9e/971/63ba9e97116d48dbaab28965d8dd52c5.jpg"><br>  In the world of eSports, you just can‚Äôt meet anyone.

      We will talk about other aspects. <br><br>  After the publication, I was contacted by guys from <a href="http://ru.cybbet.com/">Cybbet.com</a> , which I inadvertently mentioned in my article.  This is a young bookmaker that specializes in e-sports betting.  Having learned that psychology is in my area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest, they threw up several materials on issues that are completely unfamiliar to us, but are becoming increasingly relevant in the West.  It will be about the psychology of cybersportsmen. <br><br>  <b>Is eSports a sport?</b> <br><br>  The discussion of whether eSports is a sport reminds us of the controversy of the last century about whether chess is a sport.  By the way, the International Olympic Committee recognized chess as a sport only in 1999, but did not include it in the Olympic program. <br><br>  <i>Here the main thing - to determine what is generally a sport.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúSport is more than a set of movements that athletes demonstrate in competitions.  In fact, this is only one of the components of the big picture, which defines the concept of "sport".  Mental skills, strategies or training are also important components that affect performance.  All this is in eSports.  Although movements in eSports cannot be compared with those that we see in traditional sports, for example, in football or biathlon, however, the motion activity in eSports cannot be underestimated.  The movements may be of smaller amplitude, but they are usually very fast and accurate.  For these reasons, eSports can certainly be attributed to sports, ‚Äù <a href="http://cgc-europe.com/blog/when-someone-says-esports-not-sport">says</a> <br>  Junior Researcher at the Center for Christopher Griben Health Ing Fobez. <br><br>  Sport is not only physical activity.  Psychological preparation, stability, reaction, etc. are necessary for the desired result.  In the preparation of an athlete plays a role integrated and holistic approach: nutrition, psychological and physical aspects. <br><br>  Is this all in modern eSports?  At the professional level, the answer is yes! <br>  Currently, eSports is at the initial stage of development, but already in some countries, for example, in South Korea, there are such game aspects as analysis, team management, and nutrition instruction. <br><br>  Some teams from other countries also pay much attention to these aspects. <br><br>  <b>Don't play a cybersportsman, he plays as best he can!</b> <br><br>  Cybersport, like any other sport, is connected to the Internet.  And this gives rise to a big problem that has gone unnoticed for a long time.  This is the relationship between the eSports community and professional players. <br><br>  Criticism of fans, in case of failures, falls on cyber sportsmen as much as on football players or representatives of other sports.  But the kibeosportsman plunges into it faster and more intensely, so his whole sport is in the same environment as the critic.  He is not divided from the fans by the stadium space and insults hit him harder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82b/1d2/113/82b1d2113e384477853e707f14fef2ec.jpg"><br>  <i>Fans are the same everywhere, but they are everywhere in eSports :)</i> <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.goldper10.com/article/1302-a-call-for-riot-to-promote-sports-psychology-in-the-lcs.html">an interview</a> with Team Liquid member Travis Guffford, this issue was discussed.  The player claims that even the strongest players can be hurt by the comments and various messages that are related to the death threats.  Research in the field of psychology shows that negative events, emotions and negative reviews are processed differently and are strongly imprinted in our mind.  Ignoring a comment that carries a negative is not so easy. <br><br>  The problem is aggravated by the fact that modern professional players are often impressionable and emotion-filled teens and young people who are placed in stressful conditions.  A huge amount of time is given to the game.  However, unsuccessful performances in a short period of time can ruin everything they have been working on for so long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1f/17b/bb3/f1f17bbb35954bc495933dcce1617852.jpg"><br>  <i>The guy is clearly bad and good at the same time.</i> <br><br>  A fresh example, the former top player CLG - Nien.  Low performance during one play-off of the series, excessive public censure and his struggle with depression made him temporarily leave the competition.  Anxiety, depression, and other mental health problems are common in eSports.  Of course, not every player can develop a serious problem of a mental nature.  But each player will be faced with stress, uncertainty and negative.  Psychological awareness and skills training are needed to learn how to overcome these obstacles. <br><br>  In the LCS European League, the Copenhagen Wolves team hired Weldon Green for group and individual sessions.  Green focused on increasing productivity through time management and goal setting.  It also included the training of players in mental resilience skills to get through various difficulties, such as learning to talk with oneself.  The German e-sports organization SK Gaming also uses the services of a sports psychologist, and its players have already shown impressive results from this cooperation. <br><br>  About psychologists in our teams, I have not heard.  So far, a good result is achieved without them.  But in the future, undoubtedly, victories will be behind technologically advanced teams that have a complex and well thought-out training regime, proper nutrition and leisure, necessary physical activity and, of course, a psychologist. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374945/</a></p>
