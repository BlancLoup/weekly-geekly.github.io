I can think of it as targets, dogmas, covenants, set of rules, the terminology is indifferent to me.  This should unite people not on a national / territorial basis, but on the level of intelligence.  I wrote this for myself and for my son.  We will live like this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am a thirty-year project engineer, designing and supplying factories and complete lines.  On duty, I often wind around Russia, I go abroad, I have the opportunity to talk with different people.  Behind MSTU and a couple - three manufacturing firms. <br><br>  I have not drunk liquids for a year.  No way and under any pretext.  And, unfortunately, I begin to realize what is happening with my country.  Almost through tears.  Tears of an adult, strong man, the head of the family.  Tears of fear for the future of their children.  I appeal to the IT community as one of the most progressive - you are close to me in spirit, where else to write, I do not know. <br><br>  Natural population growth, 2010 &lt;wiki&gt;.

Over their many years of history, they are overgrown with conventions and overt inconveniences (hello, Shabbat).  I offer not a new religion ‚Äúfor advanced‚Äù, I do not propose to abandon the existing religion.  Rather, it is a set of rules - a superstructure, due to logic and multiplied by humanity.

      To begin with, imitating a decent confessor, I promise <i>eternal life</i> to everyone.  According to one of the formulations of the first law of thermodynamics: <br><br>  "In any isolated system, the energy supply remains constant."  For simplicity, we will consider the universe as a closed system.  Any human being has a biofield - a set of electrochemical, thermodynamic and information processes.  It is logical to assume that after death the energy does not go anywhere, but goes into a different state.  I am also inclined to believe (this is already mysticism, rationals - scold) that the energy of a person with positive karma is less prone to entropy than a person with zero or negative.  Since the latter indulges the basest properties of a person - his instinctive / bestial beginning (chaos), but not the intellect (antientropic, ordering process). <br><br>  Well, without any mysticism - we are immortal at the expense of children and procreation.  With the possibility of partial correction of their own shortcomings. <br><br><h4>  <b>Dogmas:</b> </h4><br>  <b>1. Develop critical thinking whatever you do.</b> <br>  Any information of interest must be understood in a critical manner and begin with the question ‚Äúwho benefits from it?‚Äù.  Do not read the "Truth" before dinner, do not watch television.  On the Internet, libraries and the heads of the surrounding mass of useful and interesting. <br><br>  <b>2. Do not climb on someone else's field.</b> <br>  If you have been preparing for a confrontation in the ring all your life, you do not need to engage in an intellectual squabble, the interlocutor will roll you out.  If you are an intellectual - do not get into a fight, this is not your path. <br><br>  Strong independent women are unnatural and stupid, nature will take its in the most inopportune moment when it will be too late.  Hyperfeminism is a great contraceptive.  Women, you are naturally given the gift of controlling a man, bring up a genius.  Feminine men - it's cute ()))), but unnatural.  Both types - a dead end of evolution, doomed to extinction and eternal oblivion.  In addition, it is much easier to be realized by drifting than against it. <br><br>  <b>3. Help each other if resource costs are minimal.</b> <br>  Humanism is the greatest achievement of collective evolution, civilization is obliged to this quality.  Artificial cultivation of individualists is an attempt to split society, smash it on a twig and turn it into a flock of sheep. <br><br>  Do not regret.  Pity is shameful for each side.  There is an opportunity to help - help in the spiritual plan.  Do not serve.  Do not help someone who does not need your help. <br><br>  Never give anything just like that, better help morally, spiritually.  No loans, only real emergency aid to a person in need.  Give a man a fishing rod, do not give a fish.  Fool you will not help. <br><br>  <b>4. Give up drunkenness and drugs - they are dull and deprived of motivation.</b> <br>  Promote these dogmas wherever possible, pull out of the dirt of the one who is still possible. <br><br>  <b>5. Highlight one full day a week for self-contemplation and three for physical training for at least 43 minutes (you can limit yourself to push-ups with a squat, girls - add in your comments).</b> <br>  Good must be with fists.  Any permanent action disciplines, and discipline is curbing the inner beast / devil / Lucifer, it is an internal order and a decrease in the entropy of karma.  Do not indulge a capricious child in yourself.  Stay close to nature, it charges.  Walk - for the Russian and Belarus - the forest and the field, for the Ukrainian - the steppe, for the Caucasus - the mountains, for the Yakut - the tundra, for the Evenk - the taiga and the seashore ... Draw strength from nature. <br><br>  <b>6. Cleanse karma, inner conscience.</b> <br>  You must be satisfied with yourself.  Try to follow the universal human values, and not to pray for sins in the temple / synagogue / mosque.  This is our firmware.  And for Ethiopians and for the Chinese and for the Germans, all these values ‚Äã‚Äãare the same. <br>  Do not engage in reflection, but analyze actions and draw conclusions.  To make mistakes and learn from them our purpose. <br><br>  <b>7. If work occupies more than 60% of the time resources of your life - drop it, this is slavery.</b> <br>  Any, incl.  The most favorite work in this mode turns a person into a zombie. Look for opportunities and develop your strengths.  Analyze yourself and the world around.  If your goal is to earn, you will always achieve it.  Money as an end in itself never brings inner satisfaction.  Believe me as a specialist, communicating with the first persons of the enterprises, the rich in the mass are deeply unhappy, notoriously complex and dissatisfied people. <br><br>  <b>8. Improve.</b>  <b>Change doctrines and postulates throughout life, with the acquisition of new experience.</b> <br>  This is not moral prostitution, but flexibility and multitasking.  Growing up as you gain experience. <br><br>  <b>11. Stop playing adult toys and material non-values.</b> <br>  Brand cars, watches, expensive cosmetics and clothes are the means of stupefying and false values.  Culture of consumption, artificially imposed from the outside. <br><br>  <b>12. Learn to cook, take it for granted and get used to it.</b> <br>  My main direction is food processing.  We are fed and watered with trash and garbage disguised as food / drinks. <br><br>  <b>13. Give birth to children no matter what.</b> <br>  Each family must have at least three children.  Try to instill in them these dogmas from birth.  Expensive maintenance of children is a myth.  Immortality in children is a reality.  You have the opportunity to recreate yourself from scratch, eradicating flaws.  Do not take away immortality. <br><br>  <b>14. Censure and destroy the free sex market in every way, in a word, by deed - this is a contraceptive pill for morons.</b> <br>  Men - despise women of easy virtue, women - organize a family with a man who is ready to take the burden of responsibility.  Prostitutes, majors, thieves and infantils are doomed to extinction.  Dead-end branch of evolution.  Self-destruction by drugs and rabid pokatushkami from idleness lead to the grave. <br><br>  <b>15. Forget about racial hatred and nationalism - this is weakness, it is unworthy of a real man and a real woman.</b> <br>  Russian, Ukrainian, Tatar, Buryat, Chechen, Ingush, Kabardian and Balkar are my brothers.  Moslem, Zoroastrian, Christian, Jew, Buddhist are my brothers. <br>  IF they are smart.  IF they are not stupid, flock inflated with propaganda. <br>  From every religion, every nation you need to take the best - from a Jew - a trick, from a Caucasian - pride, from a Buryat - resilience.  Think.  Analyze.  Our strength is in our unity. <br><br>  <b>16. Revenge for insults.</b> <br>  This is in our blood, there is no getting away from it.  "Substitute the other cheek" - a lie and manipulation of the masses. <br><br>  <b>17. Learn Russian.</b>  <b>And ideally, one - two foreign.</b> <br>  It is a powerful tool that has absorbed the wisdom of the whole world.  Whoever speaks the language does not need a knife or a gun. <br><br>  <b>19. Learn the history of all the peoples of Russia, and, if possible, peace.</b> <br>  Analyze.  Get rid of the imposed myths - Russian lazy drinkers, Caucasians are stupid, Roma are thieves.  Russia is a family, we are all people of the book, people of the scripture.  Abstract from myths, look at the deeds.  Believe the eyes, not the rumors <br><br>  <b>20. Scorn an idle life and meaningless toys.</b> <br>  Hedonism is the path to self-destruction.  If you buy a car as a means of luxury - you are stupid, nothing will help you.  Pont is a means of weaning off excess resources. <br><br>  <b>21. Any man must be able to build a house, and a woman to raise offspring.</b> <br>  Do not buy or hire a caregiver, but on your own, at least at the level of a hut.  The rest are parasites, they are doomed. <br><br>  <b>22. Do not be afraid to enter into inter-ethnic marriages.</b> <br>  The diversity of DNA and worldviews is our strength.  Artificial constraints - the path to degeneration. <br><br>  <b>23. Fear no one and nothing.</b> <br>  If you follow the truth and mind, you always calm the raging guests of the mountains or drunken youth in short.  Learn from Caucasians pride and principle one for all.  Tell a wise Jew that you respect him and heed the age-old wisdom of the ancient people.  Talk to a Buddhist - he will teach you the power of the spirit. <br><br>  <b>24. Cheat if this contributes to the advancement of dogma, but avoid petty lies.</b> <br><br>  <b>25. Enlighten yourself as soon as you have the opportunity.</b> <br>  Torah + Talmud / Bible / Quran (in my inexperienced view - variations of the Old Testament) <br>  The golden rule of morality, the ten commandments of the Abrahamic religions, Yama and Niyama, the ten rules of Taoism, Bushido, Nohchallah, any code of ethics and moral rules. <br>  Zen, meditative practices. <br>  Read Marx, Kara-Murzu, Pelevin, Arab and Jewish sages - this is the experience of thousands of years. <br>  Be interested in hypnosis, the placebo effect, the art of managing your own body and other people. <br><br>  <b>25. Think.</b>  <b>Analyze.</b>  <b>Be fruitful and multiply.</b>  <b>You will be invincible.</b>  <b>You will live forever.</b> <br><br>  120184-1200bvi. <br>  Lyumveri. <br><br>  <i>To moderators - I am rehabilitating myself in a series of articles "How to assemble an RPG from matches and acorns."</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319356/</a></p>
