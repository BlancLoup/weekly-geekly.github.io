  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SamsPcbGuide: Release of the first version of the book</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is finished!  The path was long and perhaps this is just the beginning.  There were no articles for a long time, including in ‚ÄúComponents and Technologies‚Äù, because I was engaged in preparing a full-fledged book.  Revised, rechecked, polished material and illustrations to the smallest detail, until he was convinced of their (subjective) perfection.  So, I present to all fans of the genre "Practical recommendations for the design of printed circuit boards" (electronic version of the book <a href="http://tyutyukov.ru/samspcbguide/">here</a> ). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ft/o3/1_/fto31_sgqhpget3asktxwqvde_m.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I must say that this is a highly concentrated material, no water.  Squeeze from more than three hundred sources of literature, including the authorship of the great and terrible titans of Bruce <s>Arshambu</s> (just as I understood it, the set of letters ‚ÄúArchambeault‚Äù - UPD is pronounced: after all, they say, Arshambo), Henry Ott and Eric Bogatin . <br><br>  I have been involved in the design of printed circuit boards for almost 10 years since I graduated from the Physicotech Faculty of Radio Engineering and all these years of answering questions that I had in the process of developing.  This book will save you time searching for information (as well as money for correcting errors, re-ordering boards, etc.).  We can say that I have been looking for this book for almost 10 years, I have not found it and decided to write myself.

    <h3>  What is the difference from countless PCB / EMC Design Guide, written by most self-respecting manufacturers of microcircuits? </h3><br>  Firstly, in Russian, because there is so little in Russian literature that it is even indecent.  You can, of course, remember everyone's favorite "Black Magic Course", which was mentioned many times in the comments to the articles.  I read, even the original was not satisfied.  The book is old, and although the laws of physics are eternal, the technology of manufacturing printed circuit boards and approaches to design develop dynamically.  And the book was obviously not translated into Russian by the developers of printed circuit boards.  And this is partly the problem of many translated articles, the material is not passed through real experience.  When I wrote to the editor-in-chief of Components and Technologies with drafts of materials and a proposal for a series of articles, his answer further strengthened me in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting this book: ‚ÄúA very interesting proposal.  It's good that practicing engineers are starting to write - this has been a big problem for the past fifteen years. ‚Äù  After the first article, a year of work on the material has passed, including with the editors of the journal, as well as as a result of feedback from readers of ‚ÄúGeektimes‚Äù. <br><br>  Secondly, and this is what drove me out in all these Design Guide, the recommendations are practically not supported by the basic principles from which they derive.  Most often this, unfortunately, is simply a set of migrants from ‚Äúguide to guide‚Äù, divorced from their basic advice.  That is why one of the articles on the LearnEMC website says: "The worst printed circuit boards that we have ever seen were developed by engineers who tried to ensure compliance with all the items on the list of recommendations for improving EMC (printed electromagnetic compatibility) of printed circuit boards."  There is also an article with the telling title ‚ÄúThe worst recommendations for EMC printed circuit boards‚Äù (eng. ‚ÄúSome of the EMC Design Guidelines‚Äù).  As a result of serious analytical work, all the foundations were found and systematized, after which recommendations gained priority and limits of applicability, the logic of making compromise decisions in the design of printed circuit boards appeared (and this is always a history of compromises). <br><br><h3>  Who is this book for? </h3><br>  For radio amateurs.  Now the direction of DIY and the design of smart devices based on microcontrollers is gaining popularity.  Including due to the availability of various debug kits, simplifying the development process, the availability of ready-made code libraries.  But sooner or later there is a desire or need to make something of their own, their own PCB.  And here there is all the rake, on which can be enough to walk up.  The book will help avoid this painful and, moreover, resource-intensive process.  Although the book presupposes knowledge of the fundamentals of radio engineering and electromagnetism (this is a classic - there is plenty of material on the subject), it is written in accessible language, no more difficult than articles on winding up Tesla coils. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1z/e9/g8/1ze9g8jnsx_0chi0yfpnyl2bijo.png"></div><br>  The book will be useful for professionals, even for those who have long been in business.  I have it on the desk, even though I wrote it myself, and have been working on it for a long time.  Something is not necessary to keep in mind, something useful to refresh before starting the project trace.  It is not by chance that when solving complex tasks such as DDR SDRAM tracing, checklists are created for developers.  Beginner developers will find a lot of useful information for themselves, and the conscious application of these recommendations will take projects to a higher level, create a development culture, and help avoid many mistakes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/ri/af/ujriafcbypbhbpvfncmamzgxlw8.png"></div><br><blockquote>  Lyrical digression about the rake.  I highly recommend digging into the cause of the error (if this is not a confused pinout of a new footprint, of course) and try to fix it with an add-on 3D montage, also known as ‚Äúsnot,‚Äù or ‚Äúcrutches.‚Äù  This is an indispensable experience that increases the likelihood that the error will not happen again.  And in this experience can not do without the "third eye of the developer of electronics" - an oscilloscope.  By the way, I didn‚Äôt find here an explicit guide to the use of the oscilloscope - I decided to add another application to the book (probably, I‚Äôll duplicate it here with the article).  In general, the book lives and develops. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/bc/ta/wabctavrlv8d22f7rwxhvcovgc4.png"></div></blockquote><br>  Long thought about how to disseminate the results of labor.  Came to a compromise.  The book has a free version, which is a structured material published in open sources, with some additions.  The book also serves as a demo version of the paid book in terms of the study of the material.  There is a second version, you guessed it, paid.  It contains an additional chapter on the design of the power subsystem, extended comments, very useful applications and, importantly, all references to sources.  In addition, as a result of feedback, the book will be developed, the edited version will be sent with a description of the corrections.  The free version will also have a development, but it will be just in the form of a periodic update on the site.  I try to find a balance between altruism and respect for my own work.  I perfectly imagine the current attitude to authorship, he himself used the sky-hub, he was a sinner, and in general, the readiness to pay for someone else's work for some reason arises after he himself did something similar.  With regard to financial support - well, this is feedback and motivation for the continuation of the project, and there are ideas for development: <br><br><ol><li>  There are several books that I would like to buy, read and share, having finished the material of the book.  If new requests arise from readers, complications of issues, I most likely will have to accumulate and broadcast other paid resources. </li><li>  I want to make a convenient calculator for the developer of printed circuit boards, including on the basis of the material of the book.  So far, not on the basis of analytical approximations, but with mandatory limits of their applicability.  I have not yet met a calculator, which I would be delighted with.  Under the PC or mobile application has not yet decided, I suppose. </li><li>  Practical video tutorials, of course.  Perhaps in cooperation with companies developing measurement equipment, CAD systems or offering printed circuit board design courses, because there already normal resources are needed to order the same experimental boards. </li><li>  There is an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúOne Error Story‚Äù rubric, where real histories of searching and eliminating errors in the design of printed circuit boards will be aggregated. </li></ol><br>  The paper version will arise only if there is a request for it and only after the book becomes better under the blows of criticism and with the help of suggestions.  For now let the trees grow. <br><br>  Actually, everything.  And once again the <a href="http://tyutyukov.ru/samspcbguide/">link</a> to the site (WordPress strength, by the way, made on the basis of the template for a couple of days in the end).  Download, study.  Waiting for your feedback and suggestions, they can also be sent to samspcbguide@yandex.ru or in l / s here, counting on the participation of the community of professionals in the development and refinement of the material of the book.  Good luck, people! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429560/</a></p>
