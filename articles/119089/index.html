And now, in the direction of emotions, I will try to impartially give an overview of this service. <br><br>  <a href="http://thankyou.ru/">Thankyou.ru</a> is a meeting place for creators and viewers in the broad sense of the word.  Service revives, in my opinion, the original and natural form of communication between these two categories of society, namely, the <b>creators present their works to the audience, and the audience themselves decide what part of their income they are willing to pay in gratitude</b> . <br><br>  <b>We, as consumers, can see and hear everything that is presented on the site.</b>  <b>Yes, yes, it is free and completely legal.</b>  <b>And then we ourselves decide the fate of the author</b> - whether he will be successful, whether he will delight us and further the results of his work or go into oblivion.  We have the right to decide this, because we vote with our own blood ruble.  Everyone has their own amount, which he considers adequate payment for the pleasure.  If this amount is a guarantee that from now on we get what we like, and not what the producer put his grandmother in and why he cram us so obsessively, then this amount is spent twice as profitably.  We support those who are worthy of it, and we are promoting the very culture that we want to continue to receive, and this is in our interests.

      To participate in this project, you do not need to register. <a name="habracut"></a>  But if you are registered, then, saying ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, giving ratings and even downloading something, you get points to your account.  Think, as they say, yourself.  <b>Virtual points can be converted into cultural and material benefits</b> (the best quality of downloaded music, realtones, CDs, souvenirs, tickets to a concert in the fan zone) is a good attraction, let's see what happens.  I only have HQ access and realtons for now :) <br><br>  <b>The money you transfer to artists goes to artists</b> .  And if you want to say a special ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to the organizers, for this there is a special button ‚Äúthanks to the project‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, <b>authors (beginners and not only) can submit an application and join the project</b> . <br><br>  <b>Payment methods</b> : Visa / MasterCard, QiWi, Yandex Money, SMS, WebMoney.  In the near future, the connection of systems: RBC money, then money@mail.ru, and also plans to add PayPal. <br>  In principle, not bad.  Although I personally would not mind even using Moneybookers :) <br><br>  The choice on the site is not very large, but it is replenished, and replenished by quite interesting participants.  ‚ÄúLapis‚Äù, ‚ÄúCrematorium‚Äù, Zdob si Zdub, UMA2RMAH and many others.  Recently, my favorites have appeared - ‚ÄúTime Machine‚Äù.  And from day to day (according to the assurances of the organizers) should join: Alexander Kutikov, Gleb Samoilov, Andrei Makarevich, the group "Accident", "Aria", "Caste", "The Cross Family". <br><br>  Another feature.  When I said ‚Äúcreators in the broad sense of the word,‚Äù I meant not only musicians and singers.  The site has the opportunity to support a decent athlete.  Suddenly, but like this.  Why?  Athletes are somewhat similar to artists ... Perhaps in the future there will be new categories. <br><br>  Well, check it out?  Fortunately, the site has recently moved from an old hosting to a cloud server, let's hope that the habr-effect in the form of increased users will not break it.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119089/</a></p>
