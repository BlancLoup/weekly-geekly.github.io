The browser has long been a leader among web browsers, occupying up to 90% (!!!) of the market. <br><br>  What happened to the company?  There was a browser from Microsoft, Internet Explorer, which began to push Netscape on all fronts.  In 1998, Netscape Communications Corporation was sold to AOL for $ 4.2 billion.  The deal was very timely, after a couple of years the dot-com bubble was blown away.  In the same year, 1998, the company created the non-profit organization Mozilla Organization, which in 2003 became the Mozilla Foundation.  And like from the Phoenix bird, Firefox, a favorite by many, was born.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  And from February 1, 2008, the new owner of AOL officially stopped supporting all Netscape browsers. <br>  Although formally the company exists to this day, but only the name remains of it and it is engaged in providing Internet services within the AOL company. <br><br>  The latest browser version, Netscape 7.2 (2004), can be downloaded <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Netscape/3000-2356_4-10310559.html">here</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Little nostalgia</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  I would not be surprised if some of the readers do not know what Netscape was to us 20 years ago. <br>  In 1994, I studied at the university where the Internet was held by an American grant.  For the whole institute there was a channel of 33.6 Kbps.  Yes, dear reader, 3 kilobytes per second.  When your mobile phone is very slow at 12-20 kb / sec on GPRS, it is 4 or more times faster than we had then on all computers.  And there were at least twenty computers connected to the Internet, and quite often they were all busy. <br><br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/intn6QD.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We opened Netscape (other browsers and did not know), entered URLs that were written out in a notebook, which were usually written out from paper magazines (Yahoo will appear only after a year, in 1995, I don‚Äôt talk about Google).  And waited.  They waited for three to five, and sometimes ten minutes until the page opens.  For us, it was a miracle - to see a web page that was located thousands of kilometers from us.  We turned off the pictures so that you can download at least something.  Video?  Audio?  Flash?  This we did not even dream. <br><br>  I burned the Netscape browser onto several 3.5-inch floppy disks, brought it home and started learning the HTML language.  Soon I made my first web page, which still weighs on the archive of the Geocities site. <br><br>  Yes, the Internet was for us so ... warm, tube. <br></div></div><br><br>  Our first steps on the Internet were with you, Netscape and many thanks to Netscape Communications Corporation for this! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218319/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218319/</a></p>
