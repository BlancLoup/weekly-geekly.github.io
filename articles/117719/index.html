      <b>A spoon of honey ...</b> <br>  A distinctive feature of the CIB conference, and later CIB + RIF from other core events, was Program 2.0 (it was dubbed ‚Äúpopular program‚Äù in RuNet) - this part of the program is formed by the participants themselves by direct voting as a result of the mini-section of Program 2.0 reflect interests, trends and trends Runet. <br><br>  Having introduced Program 2.0 on CIB a few years ago, the organizers made a revolution, the initiative was enjoyed by absolutely everyone - both those who organize sections and those who come to them. <br><br>  In 2009 and 2010, the mini-sections of Program 2.0 were literally sold out. <br>  (And despite the fact that the sections were not in the best conditions for comfort, capacity and size). <br><br>  <b>A barrel of tar ...</b> <br>  This year (2011), the organizers of the CIB + RIF, obviously, decided to withdraw from the general concept laid by the creators of the CIB and made a profanation from the 2.0 program. <br><br>  In 2009 (the first KIB + RIF), the program already included 54 sections! <br>  In 2010, the number of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù sections was of the same order. <br>  In 2011, a total of 10 (!) TOR-sections on voting were to take place (it was planned to provide each section 2 hours each). <br><br>  As a result, ALL sections, which took place with a significant margin in the number of votes in the top 10 best sections on Sunday evening (April 17), turned out to be rejected this morning (April 18)! <br>  At the same time on Saturday evening (April 16) the voting was officially stopped and the leaders were known. <br><br>  <b>What is remarkable, the leaders of voting did not enter the program 2.0:</b> <br><img src="http://10pix.ru/img1/900155/4114285.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://10pix.ru/img1/1705/4114269.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://10pix.ru/img1/985791/4114309.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Who entered the program 2.0?</b> <br><img src="http://10pix.ru/img1/3853/4114373.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Don't get me wrong, I think this and other sections that have gone into Program 2.0 are very interesting and will not overflow in the halls. <br>  But somehow I did not see them on Saturday night as the leaders of the vote. <br><br>  <b>Finally:</b> <br>  The most ridiculous thing that could happen happened. <br><br>  The vote turned out to be complete, to no one unnecessary farce, simply deceit. <br>  All 3 years before this section really passed by the number of votes. <br><br>  That, in general, is understandable - after all, it is initially announced that the sections with the highest number of votes will pass. <br><br>  And what about this year?  This year the laws of mathematics do not work and 30&gt; 156 <br><br>  In fact, having published the results of the ‚Äúprogram 2.0‚Äù yesterday, the organizers of the RIFOKIB publicly subscribed to the fact that they are not interested in the opinions of those who formed these sections and those who voted for them. <br><br>  Of course, I understand that the last word for the organizer and how he decides will be so - and this is normal. <br><br>  <i>I do not understand another - why it was impossible to simply say that Program 2.0 is being formed by an org.</i>  <i>committee on your own?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>They would save both themselves and people a lot of time and nerves.</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117719/</a></p>
