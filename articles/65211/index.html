      Dear user of the network, who wants to earn good money without leaving home, this message is addressed to you. <br>  Sit back, have some tea, coffee or some cola :), today we‚Äôll talk about the prerequisites and the ethical side of making money online (hereafter, moneymaking or moneymaking).  I ask all skeptics to leave, so as not to interfere with our conversation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, let's begin: <br><br>  Many netizens, after a brief conversation with her, asked the question: ‚ÄúIs it possible, can you make some money here?‚Äù.  And this is not surprising.  A huge amount of resources has been invested in the network infrastructure, and representative offices of most large real companies are functioning in it, but even more virtual organizations are here. <br>  E-business has become the reality of modernity, now the formula for the functioning of a large company has changed fundamentally (at first glance), although this is a rather common misconception: <br><ul><li>  Earlier, in order for a company to be reckoned with, a large, expensive and modern office in the center of the city, a huge staff of personnel for its maintenance, a fleet of prestigious cars, and serious security were needed. </li><li>  Now you need an e-office (Internet site), which you can either build yourself (hire programmers to develop, build your server and connect it to the network), or use a typical rented office (build site on a public CMS and locate on a hoster server).  The office maintenance staff is system administrators, moderators and secretaries, who are pleased to communicate not only by phone, but also by ICQ.  Security - network security service. </li></ul><br>  As we see, not much has changed, only the accents have changed.  Now the qualification of the staff must be much higher in order for the firm to succeed. <br><br>  Modern e-firms bring much more profit compared to their real predecessors, their profitability can be compared with the oil business, and in some cases reach hundreds of percent of the profits.  Turnovers of e-business are growing from year to year and have already overtaken the budgets of small countries. <br><br>  So why is it still the opinion that it‚Äôs impossible to make money online? <br>  And I'll tell you where your legs grow from: <br><ul><li>  Reason number 1: Many still remember the collapse of the USSR, followed by the freezing of Sberbank accounts. </li><li>  Reason number 2: A wave of trust funds, fake joint-stock companies and financial pyramids that have heated their hands on those of our citizens who still have at least a drop of hope for the integrity of these organizations. </li><li>  Reason number 3: Often expelled by the press, reports of hacker attacks on the world's largest banks. </li></ul><br>  All this, and much more, was the cause of our man‚Äôs distrust of ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù money, which cannot be hidden in a sock and put under a pillow.  All the developed countries of the world have been living ‚Äúon credit‚Äù for 30-40 years, citizens of these countries pay for their purchases with credit cards, the share of prepaid services has already become less than the share of loans, and the turnover of ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù money has outgrown the turnover of cash 5-10 times.  Therefore, there is nothing strange in the fact that e-business came to us from the west. <br><br>  Are we so backward?  No no and one more time no!  It's just that the Slavs have a slightly different mentality.  No need to fight with you.  No need to bring up a "Western" person.  It is enough to understand that ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù money is no worse than cash, and in many respects even better: <br><ul><li>  No matter what currency they are in.  When transferring money to an account in another currency, the conversion is performed automatically. </li><li>  Any operation can be performed in a time that is unthinkable for a ‚Äúcache‚Äù - from a few seconds to 15 minutes. </li><li>  There is an opportunity to act anonymously and not to hide their actions. </li><li>  You can carry out banking operations anywhere in the world, from any computer connected to the network. </li><li>  Stealing e-money from you is much more difficult, and if you are not a complete ‚Äúlapuk‚Äù, then this is only a highly skilled hacker, who simply will not associate with a ‚Äúmere mortal‚Äù. </li></ul><br><br>  So.  We dealt with the prerequisites: huge turnover of e-business, enormous investments in promotion, advertising and development, practically inexhaustible scope for activities, lack of objective reasons to be afraid to work for e-money. <br>  We now turn to the ethical aspect. <br><br>  Who said that moneymaking is bad? <br>  Those who can not do it, but really want to! <br><br>  Why do we still have the opinion that making money out of thin air is a scam? <br>  In the entire developed world, the top management of the management is ‚Äúselling air‚Äù, provided that it is not a hoax. <br>  Of course, it is difficult to distinguish between the sale of "donut holes" and plots on the moon.  Here the only judge should be sound mind.  If your business does not harm anyone, much less makes someone other than you happy, then he has a right to exist, something you would not sell. <br><br>  Many of our fellow citizens have experience of participation in network marketing (MLM).  Many have achieved great success in it, but even more have been burned and now consider this kind of business of the purest water a deception.  In fact, they are completely wrong, network marketing is a very profitable type of business that supports you in a constant high tone, encourages you for your zeal, but does not forgive mediocrity. <br>  Many people know the ridiculous scene, when a solid office, literally, bursts in, sweeping away everything in its path, a fat, poorly dressed woman in 40 years old with a cough of expensive cosmetics and offers to buy it :)) Well, what a normal person will buy from her something? <br>  Option two: a stylishly dressed, good looking, if not young (it is even better - additional makeup advertising) woman comes to the same office with an expensive leather briefcase and politely suggests a fifteen minute presentation after the lunch break followed by free testing of the products offered.  How many times do you think her investment will pay off due to the appearance of another corporate client? <br>  That is, MLM is the art of looking for regular customers of its products, and not in a hurry to pay back in a quicker entry fee and ticket for the trolleybus to the client :) <br><br>  Is it a cheating MLM or a financial pyramid scheme? <br>  Many people know the sad glory of MMM, the company promised to pay enormous interest to ALL of its depositors, but after collecting a certain number of them, it went bankrupt.  And went bankrupt, did it?  This is a vivid example of an open deception of their depositors, because the organizers immediately knew that they could not pay all their depositors with SUCH interest on deposits. <br>  Are ‚Äúletters of happiness‚Äù a hoax?  Imagine, you receive a letter in which you are invited to send a certain amount to a certain address with the subsequent dispatch of such same letters, "and you will be happy."  On the one hand, you understand that this is an ordinary pyramid, and there can be no talk about constant and stable earnings.  On the other hand, there is hope that someone will respond to your letters and you will pay back the project, and maybe you will earn from it.  If you still decide to try yourself in this business, then all responsibility for damages rests with you. <br><br>  Consequently, the financial pyramid is a fraud if the organizer tries to hide any aspects of its functioning or violates the proposed rules. <br><br>  Online Networking - Fraud or Bottomless Business.  What is all about moneymaking? <br>  You sign a contract with a sponsor, he undertakes to pay you a reward for performing certain tasks.  You work - you get paid.  You attract other users (referrals) to the system - you are paid a percentage of their earnings. <br>  This process does not turn the language called the financial pyramid, because  There is a product - your work, the assignment of the sponsor.  Another thing is that the results of the work cannot be touched, but this is characteristic of any intellectual work, the results of which are such ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù concepts like discovery, invention, and development.  In the future, they certainly can get paid into some aggregate, but, at the time of the developer receiving a salary, they exist only in the form of abstract concepts recorded on any information carriers. <br><br>  With ‚Äúhonest‚Äù earnings in the network, we decided - this is the same job that most of our fellow citizens go to every weekday.  And what about the "dishonest": cheating, cheating, falsification?  How can they be considered malicious? <br><br>  On the one hand, we are breaking the rules that we agreed upon when signing a contract with a sponsor and he has a full legal and moral right not only to not pay us for the work, but also to ‚Äúdismiss‚Äù (cancel registration in the system).  On the other hand, if he continues to pay, then what? <br>  Then there are two options: <br><ul><li>  The sponsor did not notice the fraud, he considers you to be a decent worker and continues to pay regularly. </li><li>  The sponsor noticed a deception, but this deception, by virtue of coincidence, is beneficial to him, and he closes his eyes to him. </li></ul><br>  In the second case, everything is clear: the sponsor himself is unclean, and all responsibility for violations falls on him. <br>  And about the first case, you need to talk in more detail, because  it is most common.  Cheaters invent new and new ways to cheat sponsors, for which the latter do not have time to make protection. <br><br>  Why do sponsors invent these tasks at all?  Is it that the rich have such games, throw us, honest moneymakers :), all over the network, make you watch, read, receive letters, click, register, and get paid for it?  Not.  All this is done for the promotion of network resources that are sponsored and paid. <br><br>  Imagine: A new website has appeared online that offers some services, you need to attract visitors to it, but how? <br><ul><li>  Option 1: Let's say the owner of the resource will place a bunch of ads all over the network, and its resource is dedicated to communication.  Walks in <br>  to the site a new visitor who bought an advertisement, and there is empty ... How do you think, how long will he stay on <br>  site and communicate with himself, and how soon he wants to go there again, and wants to?  So the site will be idle <br>  and scare the public until several people enter it at the same time, by coincidence.  Can <br>  go through months of huge advertising bills. </li><li>  Option 2: The owner of the resource can hire a company of young people who will depict some kind of activity. <br>  on the site and pay them a decent salary.  This option is already better, but far from ideal. </li><li>  Option 3: The best option.  All the same owner of the resource buys from some sponsor two dozen <br>  regular users and a couple of hundred onlookers.  It then advertises and gets its legitimate customers. </li></ul><br>  The resource has been launched, the fictitious users have already left and the real ones have replaced them.  I would like to go up in the rankings of search engines to get even more targeted visitors, I also want to place on the site expensive advertising.  Yes, that's bad luck: the advertiser requires that his advertising is shown at least 1000 times a day, and in the ranking of search engines at the hundredth place is a site with attendance that is ten times higher than your attendance.  What to do?  How to be? <br><br>  It was reasonable, again, to contact the sponsor and buy now shows of his site.  The owner of the resource buys a certain number of hits on their site per day.  The sponsor is willing, and here we, the moneymakers take on their work. <br>  Again two options are possible: <br><ul><li>  We do all the work honestly.  We go to the client's site, click on the banners, depict activities. </li><li>  We just wind the counters to get our money faster.  And more. </li></ul><br>  In the first case, everyone is happy: the customer received visitors to the site, increased the meter readings, earned banner displays;  The sponsor received money from the customer, took his share and paid us for the work. <br>  In the second case, the sponsor and we received the money, but now the customer received only a wound counter, and at best, banner-shows, but not a single target visitor from our side.  It would seem a crime, we deceived both the client and the sponsor, but did anyone incur losses? <br><br>  The sponsor has not lost anything, and you can not even undermine him.  All sponsors in the contract have the following line: ‚ÄúWe do not bear any responsibility for direct or indirect losses or non-receipt of expected profits from the use of our service‚Äù.  So the sponsor just got another profit, and even a little too high, thanks to our actions. <br><br>  At first glance, the client lost target customers, because if we had acted according to the rules, although we knew about his service superficially, he would have received a certain percentage of target visitors from our regiment.  But do not forget that he still received the readings of the counters and banner displays.  Thanks to the readings of the counters, his website ‚Äútook off‚Äù in the ratings and attracted already real target visitors, as a result of which the ratio of target users to idlers was restored. <br>  The power balance was restored :) ¬© George Lucas. <br><br>  And do not forget about stimulating the development of security systems.  If there were no inattentive drivers, now there would not be such reliable cars.  If there were no bearmen, then from where it was, would take super-safe safes.  Any violator of any rules, left unpunished, stimulates or revises the rules for their artificiality or the development of new means of preventing subsequent violations. <br><br>  So, we have found that by slightly violating the rules of sponsors, we do not engage in fraud, but make money and help make it different.  So, as a result of our actions, neither side suffers losses, it means that we have achieved that very feeling of aerobatics. <br><br>  Finally, I want to say. <br>  Dear moneymakers, beginners and professionals, do not be impudent, do not engage in fraud, work according to the rules and break them only because of their illogicality and artificiality :) <br>  If you do not know what to do - act according to the law!  ¬© Al Capone <br><br>  Everything that I have said here is an expression of my personal opinion and can in no way be used as an excuse for abusive actions of the network‚Äôs residents, nor can it be used as a call for wrongdoing. <br><br>  With you there was PC_M @ niac.  See you soon. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Gentlemen, minus, can you even say what you disagree with?  Just wondering) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65211/</a></p>
