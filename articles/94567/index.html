Today, these points can be easily circumvented with electronic drums.  Under the story of their appearance, the principle of operation and an overview of the two most suitable solutions for the home. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>How does it work?</b> <br>  The impact of a pad is detected by a piezoelectric sensor (piezo) or a pressure sensitive resistor (FSR). <br>  The received signal is transmitted to the electronic "brain", which converts it into a digital format and reproduces the sample mapped to the transmitting pad.  Each pad can be customized individually and is associated with different sounds or a sequence of sounds, which makes electronic drums a very versatile instrument that can adapt to any genre, be it rock, jazz or techno.

      <b>When and how did they appear?</b> <br>  The first serial electronic drum appeared in 1976.  His production started the company Pollard Industries and it was called Syndrum.  This novelty immediately attracted the attention of many famous musicians, but did not become commercially successful.  Syndrum consisted of a sound module and one or more pads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a33/a16/684/a33a166841356a065bac8e5fc5ddaccb.jpg" alt="syndrum"><br><br>  In 1977, Star Instruments launches its Synare product development.  The main elements of this device were similar to Syndrum, but Star Instruments introduced its unique capabilities (customizable filter, modulator and pink noise).  This instrument quickly became popular with disco artists.  The pads were built into the sound module, in the first version there were four, in the second, twelve.  It is worth noting that the sound of Synare is not outdated today, and many use it with the help of emulators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/3f0/3d4/8a83f03d4f6bdafe06a562b439b8406a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_ORWAo6tpU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2IQB6zB9t8nxRXspijicrg8d0SQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next notable leap in the history of electronic drums was the creation of Simmons in 1978.  Which later put on the market the following models: SDS-V (1981) and SDS-7 (1983).  SDS-V is considered to be the first full-fledged electronic drum set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98f/a63/e86/98fa63e867aaed11694afa6a8338f163.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vWLVMz1Qfn4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgoeqZqp32-fmX3V3f2onReqfUOZg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Overview of solutions for home from the company Yamaha </h4><br>  Now electronic drums are produced by many companies.  One of the best, by right, are the tools from the company Yamaha.  I will try to tell about them using the example of a portable Yamaha DD 65 station (~ 13,000 rubles) and a full-fledged electronic drum kit Yamaha DTXPLORER (~ 39,000 rubles). <br><br><h5>  <b>Yamaha DD 65</b> </h5><br>  For me, the main plus dd 65 is a compact size that does not limit functionality.  The unit is equipped with 8 pads and 2 pedals, which allows you to play quite difficult parts.  Powered by power supply or batteries. <br><br>  You can strike the pads with both chopsticks and hands.  They are sensitive to pressure (sensitivity is adjustable), which allows you to maintain the dynamics of the game.  In relation to the player, are at an angle.  The instrument's memory stores 100 different songs (five demo songs, rhythm patterns and inserts), which can be used as an accompaniment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/874/4c5/d0e/8744c5d0e7cd947a92aa9a642d12ba22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are two pedals.  One is a hi-hat, the second is a bass drum.  Connect via standard "jack".  You can also assign other pedals. <br>  timbres. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/298/48b/950/29848b950c238aeeaa6ce86df8400422.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front panel, under the pads, placed the control panel and display.  I will not describe the meaning of each button, for a deeper immersion into the subject you can <a href="http://yamahamag.ru/cat-38/yamaha-dd-65">download the instructions in Russian here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbf/5a2/898/dbf5a2898cbaafcdf69580224b5b11d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All entrances and exits are located at the back.  Midi in, Midi out, two entrances for pedals, headphone / monitor output, Aux in and power supply connector. <br><br>  Thanks to Midi, we can: <br><ul><li>  transfer performance data between the instrument and other instruments or computers that support the MIDI interface; </li><li>  transfer song data between instrument and computer. </li></ul><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/acd/839/e87acd839b6cc9ac26d71c2b4fa83361.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A good option, for example, for guitarists or other musicians, in order to quickly fill the computer drums through the midi output. <br><br>  <b>Sound examples</b> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSVtj15w89Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7Q_gGA8fzRX5dYXf6zD8OsnVOnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Brief summary</b> <br><br>  To play at home.  Takes up very little space.  Affordable price.  The first step to mastering the drums. <br><br>  <a href="http://yamahamag.ru/cat-38/yamaha-dd-65">Yamaha dd-65 page (photo, price, instruction)</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Yamaha DTXPLORER</b> </h5><br>  DTXPLORER is the most affordable option from the Yamaha range of electronic drum kits.  It includes five TP-65 single-zone pads, two pads for cymbals, one pad for a hi-hat controller, and a pedal.  It should be noted that only this installation is completed with a pedal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/384/107/bc6384107c578a10e9b411e26081296b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It gives a very low level of acoustic noise, so the installation is optimal for playing at home.  The rack conveniently and compactly develops for storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a73/933/a50/a73933a50dd7b98e1707be1b1e5fa114.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The DTXPLORER module includes 32 drum timbres and 22 minuses.  There is also a built-in metronome and several memory slots for loading your own timbres. <br><br>  On the rear panel is placed midi output with which you can save your party in the computer, and then edit them, the AUX input and line-out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/660/b08/a16/660b08a16d3ae0f1cc314b7d0a4fc067.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  DTXPLORER can be used with an acoustic drum kit if they are equipped with an optional kit. <br>  Yamaha's triggering DX20 sensors and sensors are connected to the DTXPLORER input connectors. <br><br>  <b>Sound examples</b> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-eUUXIq7mfI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-YyLvDd_WIWoDW2IJz7v4b6SCvw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Brief summary</b> <br>  Suitable for those who are just going to learn how to play and those who have been playing for a long time.
