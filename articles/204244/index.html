And the reverse is also true. <br><br>  Programming is a great Game.  It absorbs you whole body and soul.  When you are all immersed in it, nothing else exists for you.  When you emerge into the light, you may be surprised to find that you have added 50 kg, the age of your underwear is approaching the age of the first-grader, and judging by the number of pizza boxes, spring has come. <br>  But you don't care, because the program works, the code is beautiful, elegant and fast. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  You won. </h5><br><br>  You know that some people consider you a nerd.  So what?  They are not Players.  They never competed with Windows, did not go one on one with DOS.  For them, C ++ is a good grade, almost B (according to the American rating system) - but not language.  They are almost not visible.  As a soldier or artist, you don't care what these civilians think.  You create something intricate and beautiful.  They do not understand.

    <h5>  Apiary. </h5><br><br>  The secret on which all successful software companies are based: programmers need to be tamed as the beekeeper tames the bees.  You cannot talk to them, but you can attract them so that they swarm nearby.  And when they turn away, you can take honey. <br><br>  So that they do not sting, you pay them money.  More than they can spend.  But this is less than you might think.  It's just that all programmers in their heads have a fatherly voice saying, "When will you do some real work?"  And you just need to pay them so much that they can answer (also in their heads): ‚ÄúDamn, dad, yes, I earn more than you.‚Äù  On average, this is not so much. <br><br>  So that they do not fly away from the hive, they need other programmers ‚Äî it‚Äôs more fun to dig together  For a programmer, praise only from another programmer is important.  Less talented will idealize them;  equal in strength will compete and induce them.  To make the swarm fit, make sure that you have one certified genius that they can all be equal to.  Even if he looks at someone else's code, only to make fun of him. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHere he is - the Player!‚Äù, Thinks the novice coder.  "He looked at my code!" Nothing more is needed. <br><br>  If the software company has such a hive, the coders will forget sleep, love, health and clean clothes, and the company will hurt money. <br><br><h5>  Out of control. </h5><br><br>  The problem that kills one company after another is next.  All successful companies had a leader who nurtured programmers.  But he can't stay at the helm forever.  He either sells the company, or leads the managers who get rid of him, or he himself becomes the manager.  One way or another, management passes into the hands of marketers. <br><br>  But the management of what?  Instead of smooth assembly lines with workers at the sides, they find that the company's products are made by unpredictable, non-contact, capricious, and worst of all, unattractive people who resist trying to control them as hard as they can. <br>  Throw them in the time frame, get drunk suits - they shut themselves up and begin to sabotage the product.  And worst of all - managers will feel that programmers make fun of them in every conversation. <br><br><h5>  Smoking out </h5><br><br>  And for the programmer, shock is even greater.  He suddenly discovers that he is controlled by aliens.  Meetings, schedules, reports ... <br>  And now someone suddenly demands from him to PLAN their activities, and then stick to the plan!  Do not improve.  Do not fix it.  Never, never touch someone else's code. <br>  Now the novice programmer, who once worshiped him, became his tyrant commander.  Because he played golf with some dick in a suit. <br><br>  The hive is doomed.  The best programmers <s>fly</s> away.  Marketers feel comfortable surrounded by people in bright ties, and they have everything under control.  True, they are confused - for some reason, each new version of the program loses market share, grows and becomes cluttered with bugs. <br><br>  Probably, it is necessary to make a new packaging design.  Tochnyak. <br><br>  <i>PS: This is a translation of an article by Orson Scott Kard, the author of the Ender Universe series, The Tale of Alvin the Creator, and The Return Home.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204244/</a></p>
