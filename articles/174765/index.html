  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Digital lenses from Intel & Mail.Ru Group - look at the world in a new way!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Intel</b> Corporation <b>and</b> <b>Mail.Ru Group</b> , the largest Internet company in the Russian-speaking segment of the network, announce the start of cooperation.  The first joint project that companies are going to launch is digital lenses, which allow them to see the world in a new way.  The lenses are a hardware and software solution used as an essential addition to smartphones based on Intel Atom processors.  The Mail.Ru Group‚Äôs contribution to the project is to provide lens users with unique opportunities to use the company's Internet services specially adapted for digital lenses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3dd/f8f/bcc/3ddf8fbcc90d101d63cc0cd5f58bd438.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The lenses are made of semiconductor material using advanced 13-nm technology.  They are a receiving device that, using the wireless display technology (Intel WiDi), receives a picture of a smartphone on the Intel Atom platform and projects it with Fresnel lenses directly onto the retina.  Thus, the problem of the impossibility of focusing the human eye on the contact lens itself is solved.  At the same time, for a lens user, the projected image may look like a 13-inch screen located half a meter from the eyes, or simply overlap with a real plan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2d/2b6/01b/c2d2b601b05174c5c13f74cea4204ed7.png" align="left">  1. projecting chip with LED <br>  2. battery <br>  3. antenna <br>  4. connections <br>  5. clear polymer lens <br>  6. projected image. <br><br clear="all">  Lenses are superior points in many ways - this is aesthetics and ease of use in a dynamic world that will surely win the sympathy of users. <br>  But the main reason for choosing a lens form factor is technical.  The human eye is constantly in motion, fixing the gaze on various objects, and also periodically changes the shape of the area uncovered by centuries.  In this case, the lens, in fact, becomes part of the eye - it moves and darkens with it. <br>  Therefore, the installation on the lens of a set of simple sensors - motion and illumination sensors allows not only to uniquely identify the direction of view of the lens carrier, but also its emotional state expressed by the eyes - the eyes of a smiling and sad person are significantly different.

      Accordingly, the augmented reality pictures offered to the user of lenses will be different.  So, if a person smiles when looking at a snowdrift, the lenses will offer him options for ski resorts, and if he frowns, they will project heaps of sand with sunbathing people onto the image of a snowdrift and offer beach recreation options available on Mail.Ru Travel. <br><br>  This functionality is supported by the corresponding software installed on the smartphone, based on the Intel <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/vcsource/tools/perceptual-computing-sdk">PerC SDK</a> . <br><br>  The lenses are controlled by head movements (‚Äúnegative‚Äù movement leads to erasing the image before the eyes or pressing the Escape virtual key, a nod by the head is equivalent to pressing OK), as well as blinking.  To filter out the usual, physiological blinks, the main gesture used in the management of lenses is an analogue of a ‚Äúdubclick‚Äù - double blink with one eye. <br><br>  Mail.RuGroup has developed special clients for mail and instant messengers - applications for digital lenses.  When using these applications, the text of incoming letters or messages from selected recipients will automatically appear literally "before our eyes". <br><br>  Also useful for users of lenses may be assistance in making purchases provided by the Goods Mail.Ru service.  So, when looking at the price tag in the store, you can immediately see the price information for this product in online stores, a list of technical specifications and customer reviews. <br><br>  Daytime view through lenses: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bad/f51/bdf/badf51bdfc202dbb2e3b8677d4c4979c.png"><br><br>  Night view through the lenses: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ceb/565/f41/ceb565f411c94939c3546599dfbbee43.jpg"><br><br>  But the most amazing possibility of digital lenses is the simplification of real communication between people.  It is implemented as follows.  If you look at the lenses for at least 5 seconds at any person - the person with whom you are communicating or just want to meet, then the lenses will automatically display all the information about him from the profiles of Odnoklassniki and My World, the accounts of ICQ and Agent Mail.Ru linked to them .  And if this person has accounts in Allods, Juggernaut or other Mail.Ru Group games, then you will see them too! <br><br>  The technology that provides this opportunity is not new, but its application is extremely limited for ethical and legal reasons.  Thus, the well-known product Google Goggles, which also helps to obtain additional information about the world, deliberately does not provide similar data about people. <br><br>  In our case, we found a reasonable way to circumvent these obstacles - Odnoklassniki networks and in My World will have an additional license agreement, as well as special user options - settings that allow you to allow or prevent other people from seeing information about you through digital lenses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15a/acf/5ad/15aacf5ad8f00e9bfaf9f657828415a5.jpg"><br><br>  The lenses are absolutely harmless to health, they have successfully passed laboratory tests, including the convenience of wearing, and now the version of lenses with diopters is being tested by one of the famous bloggers. <br><br>  Lenses from sunlight are charged directly in the container with a solution, if necessary, placed in a special charger with an ultraviolet lamp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fae/1f6/010/fae1f6010e23343efbd14e160b66c2f5.png"><br><br>  The release date of the first batch of lenses - the beginning of the second quarter of 2014 <br><br>  <b>Mail.Ru Group comment:</b> ‚ÄúThe project is very interesting from a technical point of view.  The dizzying opportunities provided by digital lenses suggest bold ideas.  For example, we constantly wanted to impose on the images of real-world objects in front of the user a synthetic addition ‚Äúwith this subject users often look at‚Äù, but we restrained ourselves.  The main difficulty was the creation of an e-mail client for digital lenses.  We already have very successful clients for Android and iOS, but the task of writing a client for lenses is an order of magnitude more difficult.  This is the unusual resolution of the virtual screen, and the need for an interface designed to the last pixel of the interface - after all, what should never be annoying before my eyes.  We hope that we succeeded. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Intel's comment:</b> ‚ÄúWe have been cooperating informally with the Mail.Ru Group for a long time and successfully: for example, the Odnoklassniki engine is used inside Intel to check the quality of the CPU circuits - each of the million transistors that form the CPU is assigned a set of connections to other transistors, i.e. on the board ‚Äù, after which the system checks the correctness of the correspondence to the architecture of the CPU links of the form‚Äú friends of friends of my friend are my friends ‚Äù  However, officially digital lenses are our first joint project.  We are very pleased to cooperate with Mail.Ru Group, especially given the fact that Intel has a large development center in Russia. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Of course, this is the April Fool's Day.</b>  <b>And, of course, in him, as in any joke, there is some truth.</b>  <b>Thanks to everyone who appreciated us - regardless of your rating mark.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174765/</a></p>
