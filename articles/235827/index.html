  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ThL 5000 - a resilient Chinese</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Android's good appetite for battery charge generates a lot of jokes.  Indeed, the average smartphone needs to be recharged about once every 1-2 days, which causes a lot of inconvenience.  To solve the problem, some manufacturers of smartphones are somehow trying to optimize the firmware specifically for their hardware, but this does not bring much effect.  In addition, there are several models, the battery life of which exceeds 1-2 days, but most often this is achieved due to the reduction of the functionality and performance of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff6/c52/c85/ff6c52c855074c34bf43d396d0a2774a.JPG"><br><br>  But the new smartphone with marking 5000, released recently by ThL, at first glance has all the features and capabilities of the Chinese flagships, but in addition has a rather capacious battery.  Did it affect the weight and dimensions of the device?  Is it really worth the battery with this parameter?  Have you ever cut performance?  Let's try together in the review to find the answers to these questions! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br>  ThL 5000 is based on the Taiwan eight-core platform - MediaTek MT6592 Turbo and has a frequency of 2.0 GHz.  The graphics accelerator on the smartphone is the Mali-450 MP.  We also have 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of permanent memory.  Operational, in principle, is not small, but the constant can always be expanded by using microSD memory cards (with a maximum supported capacity of 64 GB).  The main advantage of the hero of the review is a long battery life, which provides 5000 mAh battery (here it becomes clear what the numbers in the model name mean).

For beauty, a white glossy finish is applied to the cardboard.  On the front side of the packaging is a small silver logo of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/778/d2c/b72/778d2cb729c04565807383de16df508a.JPG"><br><br>  On the bottom side of the address of the manufacturer's website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/7e8/1b1/9b77e81b164841c5af9f96657e949ae8.JPG"><br><br>  On the back side of the device information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b5/eb7/386/4b5eb73868fe499cb090713c10cee975.JPG"><br><br>  The design of the box is simple, but there is a zest: pay attention not to the packaging, but to the contents, so let's move on to the picking.  The smartphone lies tightly in the cardboard box, which prevents damage to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbc/05d/3fb/bbc05d3fb54f423b8c1fa4ae600098b5.JPG"><br><br>  Yes, and the box itself sits in a box very tight, but to get to the rest of the contents is not a problem, there is a special ribbon, pulling which opens up the view of the rest of the equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d53/c50/65f/d53c5065fd724deba71c793f0d5d37aa.JPG"><br><br>  Included are headphones, USB cable, instructions and charger, protective film on the display and two covers.  The charger is mains 220V, the output charge current is 1500 mA, it charges stably and without overheating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f0/57e/fe3/2f057efe355b401e8508bdd229ae6489.JPG"><br><br>  The brief illustrated user guide describes the basics of working with the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/884/0f2/679/8840f267992c40bd8866dd2675847572.JPG"><br><br>  Spare film was placed in a cardboard casing, which is in the package.  On the reverse side of the instructions for gluing the film. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ac/b4d/20e/6acb4d20ec284b36911993243ff2f88c.JPG"><br><br>  Headphones are very mediocre, not only in sound but also in convenience.  The rubber bands on them are quite hard and cannot be firmly fixed in the ear, which causes discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b8/4c7/095/6b84c709575245a2ae0cd49405d0a3d4.JPG"><br><br>  With their help, you can answer calls by clicking on the chrome button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaf/2eb/0d5/eaf2eb0d559c400fb0119959e92b42fd.JPG"><br><br>  And use them as a microphone, the hole is on the back side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/c53/206/4f9c53206f3f466486a40100f70d4979.JPG"><br><br>  The set includes two covers: a ‚Äúbumper‚Äù and a flip case book. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15a/3d4/d29/15a3d4d2964b44a9b746fa011b4e7066.JPG"><br><br>  Translucent gray plastic bumper, flexible and durable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e4/6d8/782/3e46d878248e4b2baba46c7626fa86a5.JPG"><br><br>  The cover sits tightly, protecting it from falling and coming into contact with various surfaces.  With him, the smartphone has become somewhat thicker, but the appearance has remained unchanged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f9/9c9/648/5f99c96488ad48c690b1e3d35d23fff5.JPG"><br><br>  The flip case has a nice texture, and the flip cover has a slightly different relief than the plastic base.  It has a fabric coating, and a relief is simply applied to the plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88f/b01/c78/88fb01c78ff04b858aed6b41c3b2d221.JPG"><br><br>  On the flip cover there is a small window in a silvery edging, which makes an already pleasant looking richer case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/e2e/773/783e2e773a1d4f6394ecf6ecbfd6f246.JPG"><br><br>  Through this window you can see the clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/795/0e8/9fb/7950e89fb40d49d388e0f4f3e4a94e3c.JPG"><br><br>  If you do not like digital, that is, analog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d19/449/a90/d19449a902714813a1bf1bc5e656069a.JPG"><br><br>  The owner can answer the call without opening the flip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65f/5e5/db3/65f5e5db3b2b4991aab4b50b5f412a71.JPG"><br><br>  This case has drawbacks: firstly, there is no magnet that fixed the cover to the device, and secondly, the lock button is hidden under the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d95/d44/aa4/d95d44aa425c4546aad0380d11325ae0.JPG"><br><br>  The rest of the cover is comfortable, and the design corresponds to the design of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/821/520/44c/82152044ce38494195317435983255af.JPG"><br><br>  Pleased complete adapter.  I could not take a photo of him, I was involved in another place, but I forgot to take it.  But there is an interesting promotional picture.  In general, this form factor is more convenient than the usual OTG cable.  Full size USB is hidden at its bottom.  And in order to get to the microUSB, you need to tilt the head of the robot back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/839/1eb/9dc/8391eb9dcc3441858a8d10329ce876ec.png"><br><br>  The package can be called extensive, everything is provided.  By the way, the book case can unlock a smartphone - the function is quite useful.  It is a pity, however, that it is not fixed in any way in the closed position, the lid remains slightly ajar. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN, DIMENSIONS, CONTROL ELEMENTS</font> </h2><br>  ThL 5000 comes in two variations: in black and white.  We have a copy of the black color in the review.  The shape of the device is classic - a rectangle with slightly beveled corners.  As a plus, it is worth noting that the manufacturer has not forgotten about the appearance of its model.  Many long-lived smartphones are distinguished by their unattractive design and impressive thickness (which is not surprising, in principle).  However, in this case, the engineers decided not to neglect this important parameter.  That is why the thickness of the device is only 8.9 mm, the model is completely different from a thick ‚Äúbrick‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/c16/e22/9c7c16e220de468b95d988e939a831e3.JPG"><br><br>  On the display there is a factory protective film that needs to be removed before use, it has completed its task. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4df/e07/193/4dfe071938d9443d88b4c0b79851c616.JPG"><br><br>  The main part of the front face of the THL 5000 is a large five-inch IPS touch screen with a 1080 resolution of 1920 pixels.  In the off state, it almost merges with the side frames and creates the impression of a monolith. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d6/1e0/a1a/8d61e0a1a0ce4ab3992f2d12b7816db8.JPG"><br><br>  In the upper right corner of the front camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels, to the left - the speaker, and near the light and proximity sensors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/118/23a/6cc/11823a6cc0ec404aa666a8ae68f1eaec.JPG"><br><br>  Below the screen are control buttons with LED backlighting, and in the lower left corner a microphone.  It is very good that the engineers carried him here, and did not leave him below.  The device is not small, and so the voice when talking gets louder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/613/176/8976131763a244c8963c7b95fdd6ef44.JPG"><br><br>  On the left side is the on / off / lock button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21d/667/67d/21d66767d16b4e3da026246f59d52cc0.JPG"><br><br>  On the other hand, the "swing" volume control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad2/50d/210/ad250d21008948d2b028f4e0f225ddef.JPG"><br><br>  On top of the 3.5 mm jack for headphones and a port microUSB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/251/e8e/f4c/251e8ef4c8e44ffcbac802a747cb19fe.JPG"><br><br>  The material of the body served as a matte plastic.  The back cover has a nice texture - a small embossing is applied to it, and because of the rounded edges, the phone in your hand is like a glove. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/315/dab/5a1/315dab5a1a304f6e8a527502dc1242c9.JPG"><br><br>  On the top of the cover is a 13 megapixel camera and a flash diode, below is a silver ThL logo.  The ‚Äúwindow‚Äù of the camera is recessed deep enough so that it will be difficult to scratch it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bf/5bd/aff/8bf5bdaff0d9455a9c9e99195a33bfc3.JPG"><br><br>  At the bottom of the cover is the company's slogan, and even lower is the opening of the main speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/baa/2c5/089baa2c52334457a26a2723e7653133.JPG"><br><br>  Just to the left of the speaker hole is a slot, with which you can open the back cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a15/d1f/a58/a15d1fa58a4e412988c6881ac7d53bb2.JPG"><br><br>  Chrome edging around the edge of the phone is a good move. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/528/2a7/e9a5282a7f6247ca93d2fa7798a78db7.JPG"><br><br>  Under the hood is a huge 5000 mAh battery.  Yes, 5000 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f08/e16/04d/f08e1604dbd340e382028f2bf869b638.JPG"><br><br>  It is attached to the small screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a5/b21/23a/4a5b2123a88d47429eb4918de0b7a944.JPG"><br><br>  Above the battery are two slots for SIM cards and a slot for microSD. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be7/9cb/74c/be79cb74cbcd4cab94c3108b625a6a28.JPG"><br><br>  Below are the speaker and device information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/fde/bfa/6e6fdebfa59b483ca442757ee9f13a64.JPG"><br><br>  Super slim smartphone can not be called, but the thoughtful design and rounded sides of the sides hide the thickness.  But the mass of the smartphone (especially if we recall the capacity of the battery) seems too small (recall that the device weighs 162 grams).  Due to the fact that it is evenly distributed over the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe case, the gadget fits well in the hand and does not strive to lean in any direction when using. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e51/82a/063/e5182a063f9b43008dca56b4f4716a6e.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="808080">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISASSEMBLY</font> </h2><br>  We have already removed the lid, looked at the battery - and now let's look under the protective plastic cover and look at the ‚Äúinsides‚Äù of the smartphone.  The plastic frame covering the boards rests on 15 small bolts.  By unscrewing them, the frame can be easily removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/677/e9e/e83/677e9ee833b94798bf70287f76e011d9.JPG"><br><br>  On the cover is an NFS antenna.  This is quite unusual and suggests that the manufacturer does not waste the place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/ff3/345/e9aff33455af47069c8e1be26b524553.JPG"><br><br>  The layout of the parts successful.  It is evident that the developers have done everything to free up as much space as possible under the battery.  By the way, he himself weighs 80 grams separately.  The lithium polymer battery with a silicon anode was developed by Amprius, and is manufactured by Lishen.  Therefore, there is no doubt that the capacity corresponds to the declared one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a57/b5b/d36/a57b5bd3695f4ca1947b1764e2861774.JPG"><br><br>  Power from the battery is fed through a small, neat loop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/386/1d7/638/3861d7638dfe4696a1fa51546ea9974a.JPG"><br><br>  In general, everything is done neatly, the place is used wisely.  The wires are hidden, the contacts lie tightly, there are no traces of solder. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DISPLAY</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone is equipped with a touch-sensitive IPS-matrix with a diagonal size, which has already become ‚Äúclassic‚Äù for modern Chinese devices.

Such a parameter as the density of pixels per inch, here is equal to 441 ppi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/e36/84b/6cee3684b44b4acda05bf9fa500dca8c.JPG"><br><br>  The screen is covered on top with a protective glass Corning Gorilla Glass 3, resistant to scratches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/066/b5a/08e/066b5a08ee604a80b291f80660d6baed.JPG"><br><br>  Wide viewing angles, but not close to perfect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/cf2/917/d68cf29177ee45faacf85c4df056addb.JPG"><br><br>  The display brightness can be adjusted manually, or you can use the automatic adjustment.  The sensor supports 10 simultaneous touches.  There is a smartphone and proximity sensor, which locks the screen when you bring the smartphone to your ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd2/46b/f6a/cd246bf6a8c5443eb3af99e08d381ea3.png"><br><br>  At maximum illumination, the screen remains readable under the bright rays of the sun. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERA</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone has two cameras: the front five-megapixel and the main thirteen-megapixel.

Photos are clear, but the main camera‚Äôs white balance suffers, which causes problems with contrast, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, the colors remain natural, though not so juicy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca9/529/8fb/ca95298fb55a4b04b3add604f560b93f.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a photo from the main camera in sunny weather.  The Sony IMX135 rear camera with a F / 2.0 aperture has a real resolution of 13 megapixels and is capable of taking pictures with a resolution of up to 4096x3072 pixels, which are programmatically interpolated in 18 megapixels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ee/015/cdb/1ee015cdb20642ec9f192f88d1a5c244.jpg"><br><br>  But in the late afternoon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d2/a7a/a4c/2d2a7aa4c25744a581b7ba94d75f8662.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a photo from the front camera, taken at the same time as the previous one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/377/7a0/3c0/3777a03c03bc49008bcb24e47c1f9c30.jpg"><br><br>  The front camera is slightly more contrast, but with a lack of lighting, the image is too dark. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00ffff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SOFTWARE PLATFORM</font> </h2><br>  On ThL 5000 installed Android 4.4.2 KitKat, whose interface is slightly modified.  Added new wallpaper, other icons and some applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2a/1cf/0af/b2a1cf0afbb04754a8b8a841b351f216.png"><br><br>  The shell here is not standard.  There is a lot to tell.  I will begin, perhaps, with pre-installed applications.  There is a flashlight, a task manager and a compass.  Everything is clear with the file manager and a flashlight, but it‚Äôs worth saying about the compass.  It is accurate enough, works well.  In comparison with a normal compass, the face did not fall into the dirt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/774/0dc/6d8/7740dc6d8c5542949949a9ce4cb8d1d7.png"><br><br>  There is also a DU Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãBooster application for memory acceleration.  They, of course, a lot, but it is preinstalled.  The design of the application itself is beautiful, stylized for space.  DU Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãBooster is a convenient and easy-to-use program for Android, combining the functionality of a task manager, allows you to increase speed, analyze and diagnose RAM, as well as optimize battery usage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b74/0d3/e2e/b740d3e2e3e54c68918283e783b4d26b.png"><br><br>  Developers put gestures into ‚ÄúSpecial features‚Äù - switching on silent mode by turning the device with the screen down, protection from screen activation in the pocket and ‚Äúsmart gestures‚Äù, including unlocking with double tap, unlock on svaypu on glass and launching various programs on drawing on glass .  Gesture processing is not fast and in everyday life I would include only unlocking by tap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e94/62e/90f/e9462e90f4b84e76a2b3748c2702235f.jpg"><br><br>  An interesting feature are widgets.  They, you guessed it, are not simple.  The first widget I saw was a little man peeking from behind the screen.  When I clicked on it, a small menu opened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/408/6bb/8c1/4086bb8c15964fb5958017c3ec3e19e3.png"><br><br>  Such widgets are included only in pre-installed applications, for example, in DU Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãBooster.  Is it convenient or not?  In my opinion, this is a matter of habit, for me the display is too cluttered.  Also a disadvantage is their small amount.  Another ‚Äútrick‚Äù is iOS-styled app icons. <br><br><h2>  <font color="EA5F39">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">WIRELESS NETWORKS</font> </h2><br>  ThL 5000 has GPS, Wi-Fi modules.  In addition, there is support for two SIM-cards and NFC.  The phone works with two SIM-cards.  When you are going to call or send someone a text message, you choose which SIM card to do it from.  There is maybe only an LTE module, but the SoC used does not support it.  For the rest, cellular communication in urban conditions caused no problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad2/b56/f64/ad2b56f6438d4040b5d3f2ac4fef0aba.png"><br><br>  The Wi-Fi module finds many networks, the signal is stable and powerful.  Here is the test at the router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45c/cdd/28a/45ccdd28ad9f404d9989de4ff0046a4d.png"><br><br>  But in another room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/f8e/6d7/db1f8e6d76d24eb08649fe074b9e8e23.png"><br><br>  GPS left positive emotions.  True, the phone does not work with GLONASS, which is rather sad, but not critical.  On average, there are 6‚Äì8 satellites in use.  The location is determined quite accurately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/660/a44/6a3/660a446a3b2542d28b971c70c4b4604d.png"><br><br>  There is also NFC.  The function is quite useful.  For example, sitting in the car, you turn on the navigator every time.  If you program an NFC tag for this action, then each time you bring the phone to it, the GPS navigator starts.  But there are no tags in the kit, and many of them will not be bought again, so this is just a nice bonus. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRODUCTIVITY</font> </h2><br>  The ThL 5000 is equipped with an eight-core MediaTek MT6592 Turbo processor with a frequency of 2 GHz and, in addition to it, a Mali-450 MP4 video processor and 2 GB of RAM.  According to the test results, the phone is not in the top, but very close. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/16b/6a3/12916b6a32614342a431a73da8aad9c7.jpg"><br><br>  Now let's look at the graphics performance.  But everything here is not very bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/875/003/f48/875003f4856741f88ab3e5a799ee8ca5.png"><br><br>  You can play quite demanding as to performance, and to the graphics of the game, such as Respawnables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ec/190/218/5ec1902181ec42e8aa8134e444990827.png"><br><br>  Or Real Racing 3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12a/64e/02c/12a64e02c4a04d7c9841bd4dd89b2f25.png"><br><br>  Or less demanding, but equally dynamic and colorful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9a/f66/ab3/c9af66ab333145e2bcaf0d62f5dda3bb.png"><br><br>  A huge problem is strong heat.  During the graphics tests, the smartphone overheated and forcibly turned off.  During the operation of the games there was no such problem, but the left hand was not very comfortable.  There are no jerks and delays in the menu.  Navigation goes smoothly, without any visible flaws.  The total performance of the ThL 5000 is enough to handle most popular formats. <br><br><h2>  <font color="1C1C1C">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">BATTERY, CHARGING, TIME OF WORK</font> </h2><br>  Lithium-polymer battery capacity as much as 5000 mAh!  Enough for 3 days of regular work with calls, sms, internet, games, movies and other pleasures of life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/7c9/46d/1257c946d00b44b4838bcf89598cddbc.png"><br><br>  With constant viewing of the film at a brightness of 100% and full volume, the phone lasted 12 and a half hours.  The test results only confirm my words.  If, however, constantly not looking up to play any shooter, then the charge will last about 7-8 hours.  And web browsing will land your battery in 11 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/366/726/ae63667264fa4d90b395f60671de07e7.jpg"><br><br>  Charging time regular charger is approximately four and a half hours.  By the way, your smartphone can charge your other gadgets using the OTG cable that comes with it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="6BB501">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CONCLUSION</font> </h2><br>  Thl 5000 is a solid Chinese smartphone.  The only drawback is overheating, but its attractive appearance, average performance and tremendous autonomy make this smartphone competitive.  It is also very pleased with the presence of even if controversial in terms of functionality, but unusual and beautiful software ‚Äúchips‚Äù.  In addition, the rich equipment of the device and the attractive price are captivating.  So, in my opinion, this unit deserves recognition, and given the not very high price, it will become a strong competitor for classmates, and, perhaps, for smartphones to rank higher. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Long battery life <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Rich package <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Latest OS Version <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Great sound (NXP chip) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Dual SIM support <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  NFC module <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Strict design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Ability to use as a Power Bank <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a7/99a/ea7/3a799aea7d11fc5d49274e15b6642e35.png" alt="image">  Low price <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Budget headset included <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Average camera <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  Slight heat <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f2/996/400/4f29964003baaf62d7bfefa7f2e32bf1.png" alt="image">  No support for LTE networks <br><br><h2>  <font color="E4F43B">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PRICE AND PURCHASE</font> </h2><br>  The device was purchased in the online store <a href="http://ru.coolicool.com/">Ru.Coolicool.com</a> .
