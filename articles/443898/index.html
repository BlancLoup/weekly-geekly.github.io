      Of course, most politicians FOR, you need to protect yourself from enemies, they are around and at any time can cut off access to cats and dogs in classmates.  But this is a far-fetched argument, since the world wide web is so ramified that Americans would not even be able to disturb the work of the entire RuNet, since it is GLOBAL. <br><br><h4>  The only arguments (in my opinion) in the ‚Äúdisconnection‚Äù of the RuNet can be 2 hypotheses </h4><br>  <i>1. Through <b>ICANN</b> , it is an international non-profit organization registered in the United States and it distributes domain names.</i>  <i>Russian politicians say that the organization is controlled by the US authorities and may, on their orders, take away top-level domains ru and rf.</i>  <i>But in history it has never been like this, even with more malicious and petty players (countries) disliked by Washington.</i>  <i>Moreover, in 2015, the US Department of Commerce, which ICANN should have consulted on strategic decisions, lost these functions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2. Through the regional Internet registrar of IP addresses, the <b>RIPE NCC</b> is an independent Dutch association, which has repeatedly stressed that it is not involved in politics, but simply keeps a record of addresses.</i>  <i>Moreover, if they decide to take blocks of IP addresses from Russia, then this will also disrupt the Internet in other countries.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fe/d2f/409/7fed2f409fa578d458ce51e9048cf726.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To figure out <b>why, how and why</b> , in my opinion, you need to start with a small history of the formation of the RuNet. <br><br><h2>  Brief history of Runet </h2><br>  The history of the Russian Internet can be safely begun in 1990, when in January, with the funding of the American Association for Progressive Communications from San Francisco, the public organization Glasnet was created.  This public organization was designed to provide communication for teachers, human rights activists, environmentalists and other guarantors of an open society. <br><br>  <b>1991 - 1995</b> , the first connections to the world wide web appear, usually within the framework of research institutes, the first providers appear in parallel and connect few users.  RU domain registration at the Kurchatov Institute, which creates a supporting infrastructure for the unification of RUNNet (Russian Universities Network) university networks.  The appearance of the first server. <br><br>  <b>1996</b> - The Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation) began the implementation of the program ‚ÄúUniversity Centers of the Internet‚Äù, designed for five years - until 2001.  The program is carried out jointly with the Government of the Russian Federation.  The acquisition of equipment and financial support for University Internet centers in the amount of $ 100 million are carried out by the Soros Foundation.  This served as a further technical impetus for the development of the Internet in Russia. <br>  <i>The number of users is 384 thousand.</i> <br><br>  <b>1997</b> - the appearance of the search engine Yandex for the search in the Russian segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/073/e42/936/073e4293609145b673f153e0af32c95e.jpg" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  June 28 can be considered the first action in history that justifies the Internet as <b>free space</b> .  Then a section on <b>SORM-2</b> (a system of operational search activities) was opened on the Moscow Libertarium website, which makes it possible for FSB officers to effectively bypass the requirements of the Constitution and current legislation regarding the mandatory court decision for limiting the secrecy of correspondence to computer networks. </blockquote>  The publication of news, research, comments, as well as the holding of various actions directed against SORM-2, has led to the fact that <b>information on the SORM-2 project, which allows spying on citizens, has become known to the general public.</b> <br><br>  <i>The number of users has reached 1.2 million.</i> <br><br>  <b>1998 - 2000 The</b> number of users reaches 2 million. The first major Internet news publications appear, more than 300 Internet service providers operate in the country, the network architecture is growing at a tremendous pace, the first advertising networks appear, the first violations of intellectual property, etc. <br><blockquote>  <b>In general, the 90s can be considered the basis for the formation and development of the Internet in Russia, which was created in conditions of freedom and lack of control by the state and in general at the expense of commercial and charitable organizations.</b>  <b>This is reflected in its internal decentralized topology of networks and servers that are not tied to specific territories and are not within the jurisdiction of a particular country.</b>  <b>Later, all this allowed the Russian segment to grow to a very impressive size.</b> </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f7/851/3b6/3f78513b683ddbcfd4a30c07db7f75e0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  The history of state control attempts </h2><br>  The threat of state control over the runet arose as early as 1999, then the Minister of Communications <b>Leonid Reiman</b> and the Minister of Press <b>Mikhail Lesin</b> proposed to take away the authority to manage the domain zone RU from the public organization established at the Kurchatov Institute (RosNIIRos), which invested forces and funds in creating the first networks.  After the ministerial meeting headed by the Prime Minister (Putin) and Internet leaders (with the active struggle of the latter), the control over the domain zone RU was still taken away from a non-controlled public organization. <br><br><h4>  From the book Red Web - about the history of control of domestic intelligence services over telecom: </h4><br>  <i><b>Gleb Pavlovsky,</b> head of the Effective Politics Foundation (FEP), initiated a meeting of Internet leaders with Prime Minister Vladimir Putin at the time.</i>  <i>Pavlovsky is a political consultant who at that time was close to the Presidential Administration.</i>  <i>His FEP then created a number of popular Internet projects - Gazeta.ru, Vesti.ru, Lenta.ru, etc.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>At the meeting, Putin told Internet leaders about the proposals of Reiman and Lesin.</i>  <i>Soldatov (the head of Relcom, author's note), which by that time <b>Rykov</b> (government adviser on information technology, author's note) had already informed about these proposals, began to <b>object categorically</b> .</i>  <i><b>Anton Nosik</b> also opposed (‚Äúthe father of Runet,‚Äù as the media called him a journalist, was at the forefront of the formation of the Runet, at that time he served on the FEP board and oversaw such projects as Vesti.ru, Lenta.ru, author‚Äôs note).</i>  <i>Of the representatives of the Internet industry, only designer <b>Artemy Lebedev</b> spoke in favor of reforming RosNIIRos, accusing the organization of maintaining high prices for domains.</i> <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIf Russia adopts a law regulating activities on the Internet, this will mean the redistribution of ownership in the Internet market in the interests of those who order this law.‚Äù  Anton Borisovich Nosik </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/053/f2e/675/053f2e6755bd55e51d1b14576ba9bc1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2000, Putin signed the information security doctrine, which contained such threats as "the intention of a number of countries to dominate and violate Russia's interests in the information environment."  As part of this doctrine, work has begun on the preparation and development of a set of measures: the search and creation of personnel, the expansion and opening of special departments within specialized agencies and ministries, etc. <br><br>  Since the end of the 2000s, the Russian authorities have stepped up their efforts to deprive the American ICANN corporation, which is under the formal control of the US authorities, of the global distribution of domain zones and IP addresses.  However, representatives of the United States met this idea is extremely cool. <br><br>  Then the Russians changed their tactics and tried to withdraw their powers from ICANN through the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which regulates traditional telecommunications and was headed by Maltese Hamadoun Tour, a graduate of the Leningrad Telecommunications Institute.  In 2011, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met with Tours in Geneva and told him about the need to transfer authority for the allocation of Internet resources from ICANN to ITU.  Russia prepared a draft ITU resolution and began to gather support in the person of China and the countries of Central Asia. <br><br>  On December 8, 2012, the head of the US delegation, Terry Kramer, called these proposals an attempt to introduce censorship on the Internet.  Understanding that the proposal will not pass, on December 10, Tour persuaded the Russian side to withdraw it. <br><br>  Actually, on this Russia's attempts to create a starting point and get a grain of influence to regulate the Internet on the world stage failed.  And the Russian authorities have completely switched to the internal segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/12b/0e4/60612b0e488509074e2c1b3a30e6f10d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Yandex Fight </h2><br>  In the fall of 2008, the Yandex company began to feel one after another of trouble: its new data center could not be started due to bureaucratic problems, a criminal case was opened in which the head of the company, <b>Arkady Volozh</b> , appeared, and businessman <b>Alisher</b> showed interest in buying the company <b>Usmanov</b> .  In "Yandex" feared unfriendly absorption. <br><br>  The reasons for dissatisfaction with the authorities were explained to Arkady Volozh in the form of screenshots shown from the home page of the Yandex.News aggregator, made during the Russian-Georgian war.  In order to clarify the situation, two ministers ( <b>Vladislav Surkov</b> and <b>Konstantin Kostin</b> ) visited the Yandex office, where officials were trying to explain that it was not people who were involved in collecting news, <b>but a robot</b> acting on a <b>special algorithm</b> . <br><br>  According to the memoirs of Gershenzon, the head of YandexNews, Surkov interrupted his speech and pointed to the liberal headline on Yandex.News.  ‚ÄúThese are our enemies, we do not need this,‚Äù said the deputy head of the Presidential Administration.  Konstantin Kostin demanded the provision of officials access to the service interface. <br><br>  At Yandex, they were shocked by the results of negotiations with the authorities.  But in the end, the fight against officials ended with the provision of partner status with the note ‚Äúa representative of an interested newsmaker‚Äù and then <b>Alexander Voloshin</b> , the former head of the Presidential Administration Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin, joined the Board of Directors of Yandex. <br><br>  Approximately the same scenario, but with varying degrees of sophistication can be seen in the cases of partial pressing of Kaspersky Lab ( <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2018/01/22/orki-pobedivshie-tehnarey">here is an interesting article on this subject</a> ) and Vkontakte ( <a href="https://www.the-village.ru/village/business/story/150063-kak-otbirali-vkontakte">read here</a> ).  And these are only resonant and well-known to the author cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cc/b4a/0ea/2ccb4a0ea341ed15a7c18b4868acb29e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Further, the machine of bans and regulation of the Runet has already gained momentum and acquired modern features.  Special laws were prepared with blurry content, so that they would not be directly considered as censorship, under the auspices of security or the fight against extremism.  Blocking illegal content, through the empowerment of Roskomnadzor, has already become massive.  With the big players in this segment, the powers that be held "negotiations".  Well, as the culmination of this stage, real administrative cases have already begun with fines and criminal prosecutions of ordinary users, which have become firmly established in the public mind as ‚ÄúFor likes and reposts‚Äù. <br><br>  Therefore, in order to finally control the network, the power remains only one thing - to learn from the experience of China (they thought about it even earlier) and to begin work on centralizing the RuNet.  For many experts, this seems difficult to do and expensive ‚Äúpleasure,‚Äù since China built its network immediately with the advent of the Internet in the region, and in Russia, as described above, it was built by itself.  But the main thing is to start, after all, there is already an agreement with the Chinese and experience, so to speak, is flowing from the heavenly kingdom. <br><br>  <i>There is an opinion of <a href="https://vestirossii.com/obshhestvo/eksperty-obiasnili-chem-grozit-grajdanam-zakonoproekt-ob-avtonomnoi-rabote-ryneta.html">some</a> officials that this bill is only aimed at protecting Russian business (near-state, naturally) and government services from the machinations of Americans.</i>  <i>Allegedly, you need to protect them from shutting down and save their data.</i>  <i>But the fact that they all have been functioning for <a href="https://www.garant.ru/news/592838/">a long time</a> already on the internal servers (all state sites, near-state business, high-tech enterprises in the military-industrial complex, etc.), for some reason, the officials do not say.</i>  <i>Moreover, the recent MIR payment system was introduced in connection with the ability of Americans to block the already existing popular payment systems.</i>  <i>Believe me, they are protected as far as possible and specialized "hardware" with protection against cyber threats has been standing for a long time.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/579/951/3f9/5799513f9b17e00fa5e7981e7f210145.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <b>Why is this a trap?</b> </h2><br>  The draft law on the sovereign Internet will allow starting work on the creation of an internal infrastructure of networks where all traffic to foreign servers passes first through state-controlled "gateways" <br><br><ul><li>  Internet providers will install special equipment aimed at countering cyber threats (although they already do this as part of the ‚ÄúSpring Package‚Äù). </li><li>  Ensuring control of all traffic of Russian users. </li><li>  Create a registry of traffic exchange points, DNS and IP addresses. </li><li>  Collect data from companies that organize the work of the Network. </li></ul><br>  And while the ‚Äúdebate‚Äù is underway, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has already prepared a resolution providing for limiting the routing of Russian traffic outside the runet, in order to protect us, citizens, from ‚Äúwiretapping‚Äù of unfriendly countries.  The new law will untie their hands and give them money.  The resolution also says: "... by 2020, the share of domestic traffic in the Russian segment of the Internet that goes through foreign servers should decrease by up to 5% ...", doesn't the iron curtain remind you of this, but so far only in virtual space? <br><br><h3>  And you really think that after the implementation of external traffic control and enforcement measures to store data on servers in runet - will they leave everything as it is? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/b7a/228/10fb7a2287ceea7ed92689cef261fdf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  All these measures will affect all working Russians and Russian users of the network who have not been subjected to patriotic frenzy. <br><br>  <b>Quite literally and without metaphors, the state will take money out of your pocket in order to limit you to receiving information.</b> <br><br>  Chain reaction from such actions without exaggeration is large-scale. <br><br>  We use services and gadgets that almost all are developed by foreign companies, not all of these companies will want to duplicate information on Russian servers, while paying for their storage, thereby affecting the withdrawal of these services from the market (for which the loss of Russian users is insignificant) Of course, not all will go away, thereby reducing competition, which ultimately will affect the pricing policy.  Not to mention the fact that they will constantly fail due to the loss of communication with their servers abroad. <br><br>  It is not known whether they will be ready. <br><br>  Facebook / Instagram / Reddit / Twitter / YouTube / Vimeo / Vine / WhatsApp / Viber and other popular services of such Internet giants as Amazon / Google / Microsoft and others. Transfer information to servers in the Russian zone, this amount of data and work on their transfer In my opinion, it is incomparable with the income from our market now, and even more so in the future. <br><br>  Many toys will stop working or will fall off every 10 minutes online games, free torrent trackers will not be available even through a proxy server.  You no longer watch your favorite movies "without registration and SMS", with horror finding that search engines no longer find Marvel and DiSi, because access to these resources abroad will be blocked. <br><br>  And another, in my opinion, a terribly important factor that ordinary users may not consider is the problems of communication that <b>scientists and researchers</b> will face.  As it is the most dependent, on the openness of receiving information, the community.  After all, it will not be a secret for anyone that the leading scientists and research databases are located abroad. <br><br>  Having isolated the Internet from the rest of the world and redistributing the network architecture within the runet, the authorities will be able to proceed to the next phase (or in parallel) - this is the creation (by invaluable experience of heaven) software and hardware for automatic control and blocking of illegal content.  And this is an analogue of the great Chinese firewall (below link for review) <br><br><h4>  And that's all for our money. </h4><br>  Of course, the above described takes time and a huge amount of tools, <b>technology and knowledge</b> .  There will be enough problems with the latter, and it remains to be hoped for.  Plus, this is quite a sad forecast.  As for money, it does not matter, there are many options - they will impose an additional tax on Internet providers and do not be surprised when you find your tariff increase by 100-200 rubles. <br><br>  <i>Conclusions in the article - this is only the own opinion of its author.</i>  <i>If you are in doubt with the above evidence, then you still have Google - google the events described in the article, read and dive further into this rabbit hole.</i> <br><br><h3>  <b>Read on this topic</b> </h3><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433188/">On the bill autonomous RuNet</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357332/">Initiative of the Ministry of Communications on the reduction of traffic abroad</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tadviser.ru/index.php/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D1%258F:%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C)_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5._%25D0%259E%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D1%2582_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">Great Chinese Firewall</a> <br>  <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/44118/">Results of state regulation of Runet in 2018</a> <br>  <a href="http://wikireality.ru/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Laws on the restriction of the Runet</a> <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443898/</a></p>
