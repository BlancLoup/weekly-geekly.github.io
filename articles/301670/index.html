  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"I am the director" - a television broadcast at the junction of technology</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I came up with this idea at the end of the last century.  Then Russia was embraced by the boom of digital satellite television, he did not bypass me.  At work, the first satellite receiver appeared, which opened up access to a thousand or so channels.  In general, there were many. <br><br>  And I quickly got hooked on this content - because, at that time, I ran my own TV company, in the southern province of our country. <br><br>  The satellite has become a real window into the world.  Moreover, he allowed himself to learn and train the team.  At that time, we had no idea that the Russian federal television channels were engaged in mass copying of someone else‚Äôs.  The first discovery was the show: as it turned out, all of them, on domestic television, at that time were more or less (usually less) satisfactory copies of projects of European and American industry.  With a few exceptions, like ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When?".

      But Italian television was a real discovery: I never suspected that almost every Italian village has its own television channel.  No, of course, then in Russia each district had its own VHS-TV.  But such studios were broadcasting with transmitters with a capacity of 10-100 watts, "under their breath".  The Italian colleagues did approximately the same, however, each of their broadcasters considered it quite normal to have their own satellite channel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Merry exercise, I tell you, to switch between two three dozen channels of provincial Italian TV studios, which were a cross between the emerging Bollywood and the press service of Napoleon in exile. <br><br>  But, really captured reality shows, which there, in Europe, have already won a huge audience.  It seemed that nothing special had happened in the frame - just think, several people eat, sleep, talk, do everything the same thing as in life - but it ‚Äúkept‚Äù. <br><br>  Showed such shows are not always well.  When I wanted to see the general plan, they showed a large one.  When one person was shown, I wanted to see a completely different one.  That is, the zone of interest of the director of the broadcast did not at all coincide with mine. <br><br>  <b>It was then, for the first time, I thought: if I had my own satellite trunk, I would hit the cameras in the studio for a group of channels, and let the viewer switch these cameras himself.</b> <br><br>  Agree, simply and efficiently: we move to the next channel - and this is the next camera standing in the live studio.  Result: we look at the sector (hero, object) that we want to see.  And not where it sees fit to watch the director of the broadcast. <br><br>  From time to time, any TV viewer feels such a desire, but cannot formulate it.  I, by virtue of professional affiliation, knew how the cameras work in the studio, who controls the signal from them, who is responsible for forming the final picture of the broadcast, and why exactly this picture comes to the viewer. <br><br>  Why?  - you ask. <br><br>  Most of the broadcast is based on existing industry rules.  The smaller part is influenced by the taste, tastes and habits of the broadcast director.  One hundred percent (or close to that) match matches, martial arts, and races are regulated.  In concert work improvisation is a bit more. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Here we are talking about industry leaders - the BBC, SNN, HBO and the like.</i>  <i>Discussion of the rules for forming the final picture of arithmetic average broadcasters should be outside the scope of this article.</i> </blockquote><br>  Sometimes the signals coming from the cameras are reduced in one place and the ready mix created by one team is distributed to consumers. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>You have probably met this in boxing when Russian-speaking commentators note that the broadcast is being prepared ‚Äúat their place‚Äù, therefore, replays show moments that do not reflect the objective course of the fight.</i> </blockquote><br>  In other cases, different studios, in different parts of the country or the world, receive signals from cameras for information at their discretion.  Example: Olympic competitions in individual sports, or global Eurovision shows. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I'm not sure that now in these projects individual broadcast packages are being distributed, but the message is clear.</i>  <i>The clarifications are not fundamental.</i> </blockquote><br>  Let's go back to the idea. <br><br>  Constantly creating television products, I had to watch a lot of content.  The phrase "very much" should not go unnoticed here.  I really, at some point, became a television expert, at my regional level.  It did not surprise me that the leading studio of Callabria T19 reads announcements in the evenings, from a crumpled piece of paper, about the sale of five sheep, in a neighboring village - on her personal satellite channel!  In prime time! <br><br>  And the more I looked, the stronger my confidence that my idea would shoot.  Everywhere, everywhere - in educational projects, in sports, in music, in political battles and products for adults - the control scheme of cameras could work everywhere, with the help of two buttons on the other side of the screen.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Life forced to abandon the activity in this direction.  If you live in Russia, it‚Äôs not you who are in charge of business, but he is in command of you.  In general, I went away on business, for a short time, about fifteen years ... Until the time came to return. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Today's Day </h2><br>  Ideas are tested by time and consumer.  The second check in the future, the first is considered to be passed.  TV is no longer relevant, or rather, it is - far from the main interface in this system.  The road to the recipient of the product has become a hundred times shorter. <br><br>  With the advent of interactive video services, tablets, smartphones, applications and the like - a tool that I called ‚ÄúI Directed‚Äù, of course, is about to appear and find its consumer.  Another question is how ready are the broadcast and related industries for this, but when someone asked them ... <br><br>  Now we summarize: what we give, how we realize, who is the recipient and who is against? <br><br><h2>  What we offer to the consumer </h2><br>  On the broadcast site (for the desktop version), the user sees the layout of the cameras and the zone of their ‚Äúview‚Äù.  He chooses the one that he is interested in at the moment.  Or, switch cameras by clicking on the screen.  In the mobile application it is even more interesting - the start screen can be divided into sectors or make a layout for cameras like in Periscope.  There will be as many user interface implementations as the consumer wants.  And two smartphones, for example, will allow you to have a multi-screen in front of your eyes, and even half a kilometer from the scene you can see your idol side by side, from two angles.  Especially if this is the second reserve guitarist of the Ivanushki band, which is never shown. <br><br>  Taking into account the possibilities of wireless communication, the prospects are even more interesting.  Next - virtual glasses and camera switching by turning the head.  And even the target hold mode, when the cameras switch as the object moves. <br><br>  Applications: concert venues, sports, theater performances.  In fact, much broader, but more on that below. <br><br><h2>  How to implement </h2><br>  Elementary.  We get end-to-end signals from the cameras, to their attention in the mixer.  Squeeze each one individually and give it to the user.  Compression technology, transmission, other technical details are not discussed here.  Moreover, in ten years we will be giving away video without compression. <br><br><h2>  Who is the recipient </h2><br>  The first in line are fans, fans, experts, as well as fans to talk to the TV, from the conditional city of Taganrog.  Over time, technology will replace the existing traditional broadcasting completely. <br><br>  In biathlon we can ‚Äúlead‚Äù our idol from the beginning to the end of the distance.  In the "Formula" we will finally begin to understand who is driving whom and who is catching up - especially sitting in the stadium in Sochi, where there is a place for wild money from which you can hear the "Whack-Whack" and can be seen in much the same way. <br><br>  At a music festival (for example, in Woodstock), we can safely take a place where the best sound ‚Äúknocks‚Äù (traditionally far from the stage), cling a TV to the head (or glasses to the nose) and look at the performer close-up, to the left, right, top ... as we want. <br><br>  Separate stories - contests, backstage, reality shows, sex industry. <br><br>  As a result, with the spread of technology, it will reach the "most holy" - a new genre will appear in the gaming film industry.  From this point on, it will be possible to talk about the advent of a new technological era, in the industry of serials and in world cinema. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>With the technology ‚ÄúI Directed‚Äù, the series ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory‚Äù, which I never watched, would become my favorite movie - you can turn on the camera that follows Penny and the rest will not interfere ...</i> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Who will be against </h2><br>  Of course, the industry.  Literally, here and now, the profession of a director of the ether and about a dozen of related ones, plus all kind of assistants and consultants, has been declared dying.  And all those who teach this beautiful irreparably outdated work. <br><br>  But, advertisers will say the most significant ‚Äúagainst‚Äù at the beginning: now nobody will force boxing fans to look at the general plan of an empty ring, just because alcohol is written on the canvas.  After all, while the boxers come out, you can take a look at the ring-girl, who are hiding somewhere in the second row ... <br><br>  Industry and subcontractors shake up so much that until the results are not predictable.  And this is not our business.  We are talking about the idea. <br><br><h2>  Where to begin </h2><br>  It is this question that made me write the text you are reading now.  I know how to launch a test version: we take a nightclub or a concert venue, hang stationary cameras (with Wi-Fi), write an application, draw something like a scheme at the entrance to the club, how it works and advertise the Unique Trade Offer. <br><br>  But how to give this project a great future, I have not yet formulated.  Software development is secondary here.  In the first place is the question of how to receive a signal from broadcasters for the implementation of global projects, such as the World Cup in cross-country skiing or broadcast from cameras installed on the ISS. <br><br>  What are the suggestions, comments, amendments? <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Finally, foreseeing questions about copyright and patents: I realize that my idea, sooner or later, will bring a lot of money.</i>  <i>But, for me the implementation is now primary.</i>  <i>And progress, ultimately.</i>  <i>And we will earn money.</i> <br><br>  <i>Paraphrasing the known - the reward will always find its hero.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301670/</a></p>
