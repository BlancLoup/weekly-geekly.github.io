    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  For 7 years we have been providing virtual hosting services.  We always pay special attention to the quality and convenience of our services. <br><br>  That is why we: <br><ul><li>  We use only server hardware. </li><li>  Entirely switched to SSD drives, which led to a significant acceleration of sites. </li><li>  We developed our own <a href="https://webmail.timeweb.ru/">webmail interface</a> for our users. </li><li>  We developed our own virtual hosting <a href="https://cp.timeweb.ru/">control panel</a> and VDS. </li></ul><br>  We do not save on the quality of our services, since our main task is to provide first-class services.  This includes the use of not only excellent equipment, but also a thoughtful user interface - the control panel. <br><br><h2>  Prerequisites </h2><br>  Despite the fact that the first version of our control panel was notable for its convenience and thoughtfulness, we saw opportunities to improve it.  We collected our ideas, analyzed user feedback, and, taking into account current trends and our vision, finally realized everything in a new development. <br><br>  The hosting market has changed significantly since then.  Previously, these services were mainly used by web studios, individual developers and geeks.  Now the same hosting is used by people far from programming.  We create individual blogs, galleries and websites.  The audience has changed - the requirements for the service have changed.  First of all, to the tools of interaction with the hosting provider.  Users expect simplicity, convenience and clarity. <br><br>  Second, the security requirements have changed.  If advanced users know how to avoid phishing, then beginners often fall for the most simple tricks, which leads to the loss of a password on the account. <br><br>  Thirdly, modern users pay great attention to the attractiveness of the interface, and it does not matter if it is a hosting control panel, a smartphone or a kettle. <br><br>  So, when developing a new version of the control panel, we set ourselves the following goals: more convenient, more beautiful, simpler and safer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/89a/44a/aa789a44a8e4670bb2f76d5371dd9181.jpg"><br><br><h2>  More convenient </h2><br>  We paid great attention to detail that will make the user's work more comfortable and understandable.  Similar improvements are implemented throughout the control panel. <br><br><ol><li>  Convenient menu by section.  In the previous version of the menu bar as such was absent.  To navigate through the panel, users had to always return to the main page.  In the new version of the panel, the main menu with all sections is located on the left, which makes navigation more convenient and intuitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67b/5bc/8ae/67b5bc8ae929733b16d5a071fd033384.png"><br></li><li>  Quick action bar.  We have shortened the user‚Äôs path to frequently performed operations by a few steps.  The main functions are in the most visible place - the quick action panel.  Users can manage important operations by choosing a set of quick actions at their own discretion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c76/c45/80c/c76c4580c2831ef2d981b6928aa8f5ad.png"><br></li><li>  Advanced scheduler.  The user will no longer have to remember the task format and the periodicity of the Cron task, as well as remember the path to the file - the built-in file manager will make it easy to find the task and set its execution parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/b89/ad4/46bb89ad4039bc452e91d0edfffd9202.png"><br></li><li>  Simplified work with text files - no longer need to configure the FTP-client for quick revisions in the code or change. Htaccess.  It is enough to double-click on the text file, and it will open in the editor with syntax highlighting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e71/4b2/6f9/e714b26f9a63d1d55af9472d1590c21c.png"><br></li><li>  Individual rates.  The new panel is much easier to manage the parameters of services.  You can add another website or database simply by moving the slider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/738/fe0/7e8/738fe07e8f81be650f905ec73523f104.png"><br></li></ol><br><br><br><h2>  More beautiful </h2><br>  Modernizing the appearance, we were guided by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãconciseness and lightness.  For us, it was important not to go to Modern UI and realize our own views on what the interface should be.  The color scheme of the new panel has become much softer, cleaner and lighter. <br><br>  Buttons, tabs, inputs, headers - for each element was a serious struggle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1a/d29/92c/e1ad2992c116b80dc35141684aecb5a8.png"><br><br>  Modern users often use tablets to customize sites.  We took this feature into account in all sections, where in the previous version of the panel the work presented difficulties.  For example, in the file manager, line spacing and fonts are significantly extended. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fd/b68/c72/2fdb68c7207ae2b66aaa397cd79e7803.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Simpler </h2><br>  All elements of the new panel have undergone dramatic qualitative changes. <br><br><ol><li>  We have changed the installation process of the application.  Previously, in order to install a CMS, it was necessary to select a domain, website, database, enter a password for it. <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs enough to press one button ‚ÄúInstall application‚Äù and the CMS will be installed into the new automatically created website and database.  The application will be placed on a test domain by which you can immediately test its work.  And if the application did not fit or did not like it, you can simply delete it without thinking about the site, the domain and the database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d2/4e5/cc1/5d24e5cc160b44d308eb0b6fc6ce8fd2.jpg"><br></li><li>  Convenient information on resource limits.  Now on the main page graphically displays information on the use of resources.  Displays data on the state of the user's balance, information on the use of resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/043/df2/154/043df2154eeed6b44a80d3208d6bfab8.png"><br><br></li><li>  Statistics on sites.  Now the user can control the most important information on all his sites in one interface.  We began to implement the collection and display of statistical data on all resources of our clients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aec/480/e66/aec480e661bfcaefb5757527835c0326.png"><br></li></ol><br><br><br><h2>  Safer </h2><br>  Securing user information is one of our key tasks.  Our customers are faced with password phishing.  We regularly notify users about attacks, change the passwords of those who are in an unpleasant situation, and take a number of necessary actions to prevent consequences. <br><br>  In the new panel, we implemented a set of measures that will protect the user from a phishing attack.  This complex includes the following options: <br><br><ul><li>  SMS authorization is the most simple and popular technology that allows you to guarantee only a legitimate user login. </li><li>  Login by IP addresses.  If you work with resources through a fixed IP address or VPN, then restricting the login by IP will ensure the security of your account without the need for additional confirmation via SMS.  The current IP address will be automatically added to prevent the loss of access to the account. </li><li>  Access only from certain countries.  As a rule, attackers use foreign proxies and VPN servers to make their trail difficult to detect.  A new option allows you to restrict access to the control panel list of countries selected by the user. </li><li>  Notifications of failed login attempts.  Every time if an unsuccessful attempt to log in to the control panel under a client name, the user will receive an e-mail with a warning. </li><li>  Full log of inputs.  Now it will be possible to see the entire history of the entries in the control panel on a separate tab, which will make it possible to detect other people's inputs and change the password in time. </li><li>  The control panel works only over HTTPS, which protects user data from third parties. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61a/72f/db1/61a72fdb1dd05601843a919f433b983d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  If you are not yet our client, <a href="http://timeweb.ru/services/">order a</a> free trial period in order to evaluate our work.  And, we hope, you will get the same pleasure from working with the control panel, which we received during its development. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205686/</a></p>
