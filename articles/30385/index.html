After analyzing the proposals in Tyumen, I realized that basically here they are selling ‚Äúexcuse from DPSnik‚Äù - the golem ketai.  I began to consider options with the purchase in Moscow, but then I came across a different topic discussed on the website of one of the auto clubs.  The meaning of the topic is - why pay more when there is no difference?  Right there is no need.  Therefore, it is proposed not to feed our domestic business, but to order car seats (and not only) in German online stores with ‚Äúalmost home‚Äù delivery.  About the experience of such an order I want to share with you, my dear habravchanin :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First, a little about the choice of the chair.  His process was long and difficult :) First, the choice fell on the Maxi Cosi Cabrio + isofix-base Maxi Cosi EasyFix.  This chair in this embodiment <a href="http://www.adac.de/Tests/Kindersicherung/Kindersitze/kindersitze_2007/default.asp%3FComponentID%3D184236%26amp%3BSourcePageID%3D147654">was the best in the previous year</a> in its category according to ADAC.

    <img src="http://1702.ru/blog/upload/2008/07/maxicosi-2007.png" alt="ADAC 2007 Tests" width="457" height="475"><br>  In addition, seduced by the abundance of colors to choose from.  But I was pushed away only by a three-point seat belt.  Not serious. <br><br>  The next candidate was Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio Tri-Fix (the reason is simple - it has a common chassis with the planned sidecar).  Also with isofix-base.  The best result (see below in the table) scared me away, and even in the comparison table, he was placed on the penultimate place, although they could have been on the second (similar results).  In general, psychology took its toll and I refused this idea.  Moreover, in German stores it is not so easy to find. <br><br><img src="http://1702.ru/blog/upload/2008/07/adac-2008.png" alt="ADAC Tests 2008" width="457" height="589"><br>  But in the plate I came across a chair that I eventually ordered - <a href="http://www.britax-roemer.de/produkt.php%3Flang%3Den%26amp%3BcatID%3D1%26amp%3Bid%3D3%26amp%3Bnavid%3D8">ROMER Baby Safe Plus Isofix</a> .  The winner of <a href="http://www.adac.de/Tests/Kindersicherung/Kindersitze/default.asp">the ADAC-2008 test</a> in the category 0+, the presence of the isofix base, the five-point safety belt - all this played its part in the selection and even the <a href="http://www.britax-roemer.de/produkt.php%3Flang%3Den%26amp%3Bnavid%3D8%26amp%3Baction%3Dact_dessin%26amp%3Bid%3D3">thin choice of colors</a> could not change it. <br><br>  The next step in the acquisition was the choice of the store itself.  In RuNet there are mainly reviews about Halter Mobil GmbH ( <a href="http://www.autoteile-shop.de/">autoteile-shop.de</a> , <a href="http://kindersitze.de/">kindersitze.de</a> , <a href="http://kindersitze-shop.de/">kindersitze-shop.de</a> ).  The reviews are mostly positive, but the choice of colors of such a chair in this configuration is even poorer than the official one.  So I had to look for alternatives. <br><br>  This alternative was the <a href="http://www.pingpong-online.de/osc/">pingpong-online.de</a> store.  Number of reviews about it is much less, and not all positive.  The main complaint is the long delivery time (and it occurs for 3 months) and sluggishness with answers to questions by mail.  But the opportunity to choose the color you like and a slightly lower price did their job and I decided to order it there. <br><br>  Now, in brief, the chronology of events from the time of the order to today. <br><br>  July 10, 2008: the order was made and paid.  The original price of the chair is 275 Euro, <strong>most German online stores deduct VAT already included in the cost of goods when sending goods abroad</strong> (which is, in principle, correct and very logical), so the price for me is 231.09 Euro.  Delivery (full price, will not have to pay extra) - 21.55 Euro, discount on promotions (5% for all orders until July 31, 2008) - 11.56 Euro, discount for prepayment by card - 4.39 Euro.  <strong>Total - 236.70 Euro.</strong>  He immediately paid the card, the money on it was blocked.  The order went to processing. <br><br>  July 11, 2008: Knowing the reviews about this store, I decided to remind myself and sent an email asking me how things are going with my order.  Since I don‚Äôt have trouble in German (although I ‚Äútaught‚Äù him at school), I used a <a href="http://translate.google.com/">Google translator</a> . <br><br>  July 12, 2008: I received an answer to my letter.  Its meaning is ‚Äúthe order is accepted for execution, the goods are expected in stock at week 32‚Äù.  The numbers of weeks in this case have nothing to do with the time of pregnancy - this is the number of the week of the year.  That is, translating into Russian, week 32 is from August 4 to 10, 2008. Apparently, it is common practice for the Germans to use such unusual concepts.  Well, nothing incomprehensible, I just had to look for a calendar with the numbering of the weeks.  Write off money from the card in the amount of <strong>8769.74 rubles.</strong> <br><br>  We look forward to the next.  I will keep up to date.  If anyone decides to repeat my feat until the end of the story begun - in case of failure, only blame yourself, I haven‚Äôt advised anything yet :) <br><br>  Cross post from my <a href="http://1702.ru/blog/%3Ftag%3Dzakaz-avtokresla-v-germanii">blog</a> . <br><br>  By the way, for those who are interested - the <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Fclid%3D9582%26amp%3Btext%3DBaby-Safe%2BIsofix">price of such chairs in Russia</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30385/</a></p>
