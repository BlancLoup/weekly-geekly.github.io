  <section class="page js-page"><h1>oDesk: competition for developers and interesting statistics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, <a href="https://www.odesk.com/">oDesk</a> , the world's largest (according to its own data) international freelancers' exchange, has announced a contest for developers from Russia and Ukraine.  The essence of the competition is as follows: On October 19, programmers need to enter the <a href="http://www.codingame.com/cg/">Codingame</a> service (you can register right now), get two competitive tasks and perform them.  For everything about everything is given four hours: from 11.00 to 15.00 Moscow time or, respectively, from 10.00 to 14.00 on Kiev. <br><br>  Contestants who, by the way, must have an oDesk account, can solve problems in one of 15 programming languages: C, C ++, C #, Dart, Go, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, Pascal, Perl, Python, PHP , Ruby or Scala. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The winner of the competition, which will be announced on November 1, receives a paid trip from oDesk (visa payment is not included) in Silicon Valley with excursions to offices of Facebook, Google, Autodesk, PayPal and other well-known international companies.  In addition, the vice president of service Matt Cooper, in his own words, volunteered to organize surfing classes for the winner.  He also casually noted that the champion programmer would be offered a job (in freelance, of course) on the oDesk team. <br><br>  The participants who showed good results (they will be determined by the company) will be promoted in the search results of freelancers on oDesk, and will also be highlighted in the marketing mailings that oDesk sends to customers.  If new customers do not interest you, you can refuse the last prize.

    <h4>  Focus East </h4><br>  In a telephone interview a couple of days before the launch of the competition, Cooper, who, by the way, is flying to Moscow today to talk with the press, and the day after tomorrow <a href="http://idcee.org/agenda/10-10-2013/">will speak</a> at IDCEE in Kiev, explained why oDesk distinguishes Ukraine and Russia among others: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúRussia and Ukraine have always been‚Äú anchor countries ‚Äùfor oDesk in the technological field.  These regions have always been strongly represented, many talented developers live there;  In addition, our own engineering team consists mainly of Russians and Ukrainians. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  The demand for developers from the CIS can be seen from the statistics of earned money: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/52d/ad0/706/52dad07063041a672137e638c15eab61.jpg"></div><br><br>  In addition, according to the results of the second quarter of 2013, Ukraine was in fourth place in terms of earnings on oDesk, and Russia - in the sixth place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a49/c68/62a/a49c6862ab9e37d449723d6c83b77ff7.jpg"><br><br>  According to Cooper, the most common skill offered by developers from Russia and Ukraine is PHP.  It is followed by JavaScript, MySQL, HTML, jQuery, C #, C ++, and Java.  And here is the breakdown into categories, the projects in which they carry out: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/544/c47/737/544c47737aa9f9eaec87d97a4f8d3ebf.jpg"></div><br><br>  It is interesting (albeit predictable) that both Russian and Ukrainian freelancers are most often hired by clients from the USA, Canada, Australia and the UK: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/22c/bdc/762/22cbdc762805f7c49363e056746e695f.jpg"></div><br><br>  According to oDesk, as of the second quarter of 2013, the average hourly rate for a Ukrainian freelance developer is $ 19.88, and for Russia - $ 21.17. <br><br>  At the same time, the company claims that in 2012, freelancers in oDesk accounted for about 5% of the earnings of the Ukrainian software development outsourcing industry and about 1% in Russia. <br><br><h4>  Metamorphosis </h4><br>  One of the most notable and interesting trends in the development of Russia and Ukraine on oDesk is the transformation from purely freelancer regions into client-side regions.  Domestic companies are still far from the US and UK levels, but by the end of 2012, both countries were in the top 10 in terms of increasing the number of clients: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/774/f06/d6b/774f06d6bc98149e514e251cc48d1ee6.jpg"></div><br><br>  The growth itself looks like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b2d/a13/9a4/b2da139a4d4a704f6c9cc4c544650b92.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/2fc/2f6/f10/2fc2f6f10ea812ddfbd869f41a1a65e1.jpg"></div><br><br>  It is curious that Ukrainians are mostly looking for ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù specialists, and the Russians - all the same programmers, PMs and web designers: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/9b7/9b6/745/9b79b6745429b9174f8dfb450fb3f063.jpg"></div><br><br><h4>  Future freelancing </h4><br>  Finally, some general statistics.  This summer, oDesk announced that over the eight years of its existence, customers paid $ 1 billion for all kinds of freelance services;  according to the company itself, in terms of payments, it surpasses all competitors combined. <br><br>  In recent years, the expansion of categories of work, which simply did not exist several years ago, manifested itself <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/666/130/76a/66613076aac32945bc0b101319c08473.jpg"></div><br><br>  Today, oDesk has 900 thousand customers and 4.5 million freelancers who have already worked 35 million hours.  During the lifetime of the service, 1.5 million vacancies were published.  According to statistics, the freelancing market is far from saturation: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ee9/d4d/a5c/ee9d4da5cd4157fadfe58797900cfd6a.jpg"></div><br><br>  PS As a small bonus - the cities of Russia, from where freelancers work on oDesk.  Unfortunately, a similar map of Ukraine could not be obtained. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ef5/2b2/433/ef52b243397f2916cc2cf8cf51bf21a0.jpg"></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196740/</a></p>
