      It really started to burn, but the majority did not get anything out of this: for example, there was a whole week of the arrival of projects dedicated to p2p crediting.  Another week was noted by developers.  Next - seven days about loyalty programs.  In general, the originality decided to suffocate itself with the banality of life and the frailty of life, hiding the potential of creativity in unknown ideas about huge, simply horrible, impossible gatherings. <br><br>  But the world always consists of differences: efficient projects have begun to come, even if not in such quantity.  Among them are those about whom I already told: kickico, descrow, pluscoin, eloplay and others.  And recently, another star of adequacy and love for the code flashed on the horizon - <a href="https://digmus.io/">https://digmus.io/</a> (the most interesting is at the end). <br><br>  About her and will be discussed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If it is extremely short, then the definition of service is: decentralized platform for checking the authenticity of goods.  Logically, if we take into account the possibilities of the blockchain;  just because  Retail, in my opinion, is the very first industry where the blockchain should generally be in demand;  openly, since the fight against counterfeit does not imply another.  At least in the context of decentralized systems. <br><br>  To make it a little clearer, how much the team is involved in the process, I recommend reading their post on Medium devoted to the comparison of services of this kind, where, in addition, a small but capacious insight into history is given. <br><br>  <b>Immediately to what I liked about the project:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  History is not local - scalable: applicable in any geolocation from the point of view of coordination and any jurisdiction from the perspective of law; </li><li>  The story is honest: based on the fact that the scalability effect lays down the process of educating consumers about the quality of goods; </li><li>  What is especially good for Habr is that IT specialists are higher than the industry average (no matter how surprising or even paradoxical it sounds); </li><li>  The white book is not an ideal, but it is quite structured to give a ‚Äúcredit‚Äù rating.  Also a rarity in the current ICO market. </li></ol><br>  <b>What did not like:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The mechanism of dealing with gray marks is not quite clear when they multiply in the nth quantity and are transported to different parts of our country (or not ours); </li><li>  The social component, again - in my, perhaps even scabrous, view, is worked out by many worse than the technical one: the imbalance of it-shnik apparently plays its role here too; </li><li>  Disclaimers in the project - just one and a half pages: I understand that this is the standard for the industry, but <b>I always have a question, but what remains :)</b> </li></ol><br>  But seriously, the functionality of the service is declared as follows (see below): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/10/59ed108849d85774990598.jpeg"><br><br>  Everything is very simple: there is a Digmus blocochain, there is a Qr-code - from this comes the scheme of the buyer and the manufacturer, who are interested in selling and buying non-counterfeit goods. <br><br>  Another plus of the platform is an adequate assessment of development: $ 1,000,000.  However, even this figure will be criticized (there will always be haters), but taking into account time, labor and other costs, it causes even respect. <br><br>  As for the concept, my personal opinion is that its minimalism is the reason why such projects should be born: after all, everyone knows that unique bottles of soda, intricate design of dental bills, incomprehensible shapes of jam cans, etc. - not just about marketing and merchandising, logistics and aesthetics, but also about authenticity. <br>  And most importantly, having gone deep into the topic (approximately since the spring of this year), I can say that this is not a problem of small or medium ones, but not a problem of large ones - this is a problem for everyone: large ones can lose on regular supplies, and small ones - on uniqueness, for which they are fighting so much, for example, in the camp of honey, taiga products, handicrafts and similar fields. <br><br>  In addition, such an approach is very, very necessary in such a field as commodity aggregators, which are now pushing the world forward (where exactly - for certain it is not known, but that which is ahead is certain): it suffices to recall Aliexpress or E-bay.  After all, it is also beneficial for them that sellers sell what is stated, since  in this case, the loyalty of not only the customer, but also the user of the platform increases, even though it is one person, but its functions are different. <br><br>  No wonder even today, when ICO is banned in fact in China, does the site still contain a translation into this beautiful, but incomprehensible language? <br><br>  <b>By the way, if we talk about the 4T methodology (4K), here Digmus will give odds to many:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The command is simple to verify, and it is easy to make contact with it; </li><li>  About the concept has already described everything; </li><li>  Coin has a clear and simple history, though not unique from that: ‚Äúin Digmus, all transactions in the blockchain (creating a new company, creating a type of goods, creating a unit of goods, recording information about the movement of a unit of goods, etc.) are paid in local currency systems - genuineness or GEN.  Of the coins spent on a transaction, the majority is destroyed, and the smaller is transferred to the miner as a reward ‚Äù. </li><li>  Code: you can find demo.  Let's say on Android.  About him - a little more detail: again - Habr contributes to this. </li></ol><br>  I will immediately tell everyone who will ask questions about how the prototype is made, that when you carefully read the White Paper, the answer will become obvious (but for hyper-evidence, I‚Äôll send it here): <br><br><blockquote>  The prototype will be implemented on a centralized basis due to ease of development.  Starting with the beta version and for further development, you will be transferred to your own blockchain. </blockquote><br>  I have a twofold attitude to Grafen, but we will leave it for the next time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/ed/11/59ed116c1e2ef196598180.jpeg"><br><br>  Checking is easier than you can imagine; it‚Äôs easier and you can‚Äôt do it: go to the site <a href="https://digmus.io/demo/">https://digmus.io/demo/</a> and use the QR reader (aka camera :) to do the reconciliation.  I will also say that the guys obviously did not bother with the marketing account: it is understandable - education does not allow. <br><br>  But, I note that it impresses me: multi-million projects, supposedly made for centuries and exclusively for ‚Äúglobal needs‚Äù in 99% of cases - if not fake, then scam, if not scam, then dust.  Here everything is aimed at ensuring that the process is open and transparent. <br><br>  Test application conducted: on Note II and the new J7.  Works smoothly.  I did not see any problems.  There was a crash on the old Note II, but corrected, for which - a special thank you and plus.  But the information is still not enough: I think there should be unique codes (strokes?), So that the binding is to the unit, and not to the party, say.  You can still test the iPhone in beta: there is no access through the AppStore, but the email will be sent, rest assured. <br><br>  And one more interesting fact that geeks should like: here it is more detailed about it <a href="http://telegra.ph/CHto-takoe-RFID-i-NFC-10-18">http://telegra.ph/CHto-takoe-RFID-i-NFC-10-18</a> : the fact is that Digmus was recently received for testing New NFC chips with embedded cryptography from NXP and I look forward to a detailed story about this on Habr√©, but for now, I recommend plunging into the project through WP longrid <a href="https://digmus.io/wp/Digmus_WP_RU.pdf">https://digmus.io/wp/Digmus_WP_RU.pdf</a> or brief technical spells on wisdom site <a href="https://digmus.io/">https://digmus.io/</a> . <br><br>  <b>May the Strength of Integrity Chains be with you :)</b> <br><br>  <i>PS By the way, part of the team is definitely on Habr√©: I think she will have something to answer the questions.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340718/</a></p>
