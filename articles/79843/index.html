  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Andrei Ershov Soviet pioneer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Andrei Petrovich Ershov - an outstanding Soviet programmer.  The works of which had a significant impact on the development of the Soviet school of programming and computer technology.  Under the leadership of Andrei Petrovich, such well-known optimizing programming systems were created such as ALPHA, ALPHA-6, BETA, which in many respects defined the modern methodology of optimizing translation. <br>  He belongs to the fundamental results in the theory of operator schemes, the general theory of saving memory, in the theory of schemes of programs with distributed memory, as well as the initial formulation of the theory of schemes of parallel programs, later developed by his students. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Andrei Petrovich Ershov was born in Moscow on April 19, 1931, in a family of intellectuals.  Studying at school, I did not dream of becoming a programmer.  But life was different. <br>  In 1949 he graduated from high school in the city of Kemerovo.  After graduation, she enters the Moscow State University in the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics with a degree in computational mathematics. <br>  In 1953, A.P. Ershov joined the Institute of Precise Mechanics and Computing (ITM and BT).  Participated in the preparation of acceptance tests of the BESM machine.  He developed a matrix inversion program as a test task. <br>  As a fourth-year student, I listened to a series of lectures on the Principles of Programming, read by Lyapunov, and later determined the choice of a life path. <br><img src="http://ershov.iis.nsk.su/ershov/pict/76.jpg" alt="image"><br>  After graduating from Moscow State University, he was transferred from (ITM and VT) to the Computing Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences. <br>  In 1957, A. P. Ershov, the set-up function was defined as a method of uninterrupted information retrieval by key, and its statistical properties and application to the algorithm for saving commands working in linear time were investigated.  In the same year, he was appointed head of the programming automation department at the Computing Center of the USSR Academy of Sciences. <br>  Along with scientific activities, Ershov participated in the teaching process from the very first steps of programming: as a student, at the request of S..  Lebedeva gave lectures on programming for BESM developers, and in 1957, for the first time, with his participation, classes were organized with students at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics. <br>  In the second year of his postgraduate studies, he began to organize the department of programming theory at the CC of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  His research on creating a programming program for BESM was published <br><img src="http://ershov.iis.nsk.su/ershov/pict/56.jpg" alt="image"><br>  in 1958 ‚ÄúProgramming program for high-speed electronic counting machine‚Äù, which is the first monograph on programming automation in the world literature.  It was immediately published abroad. <br>  In November 1958, A.P. Ershov took part in a conference on the mechanization of thinking processes, which was held in the NFL in Teddington (England).  There he met with John Backus, Grace Hopper and John McCarthy.  Meeting with John McCarthy later developed into friendship and cooperation. <br>  In connection with the change of place of work I have to move to the Novosibirsk Academgorodok.  Ershov began working as head of the laboratory at the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences.  In the future, he goes to work at the created Computing Center, SB RAS Academy of Sciences, with which his scientific and pedagogical work is connected.  The main directions of its activity are connected with questions of automation of programming and problems of theoretical programming, the objects of which are mathematical abstractions of programs.  He wrote many articles in domestic and foreign scientific publications and a number of books. <br>  In 1962 he defended his thesis, and in 1968 and his doctoral thesis on the topic: ‚ÄúMethods of constructing translators‚Äù <br>  The AIST project, the creator and leader of which was A. P. Ershov, united a wide range of studies on the architecture of computing systems. <br>  Within the framework of this project, the country's first developed time-sharing system AIST-0 was created.  Implemented as a multi-machine complex of domestic computers, this system was largely pioneering and made a great contribution to the development of domestic works on computer architecture and operating systems, which, unfortunately, were further curtailed due to the orientation on copying foreign developments. <br><br><img src="http://root.loopback.su/habralogger/empty.gif"><br>  In 1969, A.P. Ershov became a professor at Novosibirsk University (NSU). <br>  In 1970, he was elected a corresponding member, and in 1984 an academician of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.  Foreign colleagues honored him and elected a member of ACM (1965) and an honorary member of the British Society for Computing Engineering (1974). <br>  Andrei Petrovich took an active part in scientific life in the country and abroad, he could often be seen among the organizers and speakers at seminars, symposia and other events.  His reports aroused constant interest and often served as a reason for extensive discussion.  So at the Second All-Union Programming Conference in 1970, held in Akademgorodok in Novosibirsk, he confidently defended the thesis that the program finally became a commodity, and this requires an appropriate attitude from the state both to the product and to its creator - programmer. <br>  In 1971, A. P. Ershov published an article ‚ÄúUniversal Programming Processor‚Äù, which initiated the work on the BETA project.  The research on the BETA project was a multi-year methodological experimental work related to the understanding of the fundamental principles of translation and programming languages. <br>  His work of 1967-1973 had a great influence on the development of theoretical programming.  They formulated a number of problems in the theory of schemes of programs, compared various directions and models of this theory, developed a general system of concepts and connected various results and their applications, in other words, created the foundation of the theory of schemes of programs as an integral direction of theoretical programming. <br><img src="http://ershov.iis.nsk.su/ershov/pict/27.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From the end of the 70s and until the end of his life, A. P. Ershov paid great attention to the problems of teaching programming. <br>  A. P. Ershov was the organizer of many International and All-Union conferences, a member of the editorial boards of a number of leading foreign and domestic journals, a member of the International Organization for Information Processing (IFIP).  In recent years, he has been the chief editor of the magazine ‚ÄúMicroprocessor-based Means and Systems‚Äù. <br>  December 8, 1988 after a long and serious illness, Andrei Petrovich Ershov passed away.

      In 1988, the charitable foundation named after A. Ershov was created, the main purpose of which was the development of computer science as an invention, creativity, art and educational activity. <br><br>  Andrei Petrovich Ershov was not only a talented scientist, teacher and fighter for his ideas, but also an outstanding, multi-talented person.  He wrote poems, translated poems by R. Kipling and other English poets into Russian, played the guitar perfectly and sang.  Anyone who had the good fortune to know Academician Ershov and work with him will always remember his brilliant ideas, outstanding achievements and extraordinary benevolence. <br><br>  Part of the material taken from ershov.iis.nsk.su </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79843/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79843/</a></p>
