      Ce6 is an analogue of chlorophyll.  Under the influence of light radiation (lasers are used in PDT), it releases <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">active oxygen species</a> that actually kill cancer cells.  That, of course, caused fears of irreversible damage when the substance was injected into the eyes. <br>  The combination of insulin and dimethyl sulfoxide during the experiment was used to enhance the absorption of Ce6 by the retina.  The mixture obtained from these substances and a weak aqueous NaCl solution was black in color and kept wrapped in foil (probably to prevent light from entering) at 20 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  After the subject was prepared for the experiment using a pipette <a href="">,</a> small amounts of the mixture were <a href="">injected</a> into his conjunctival bags (roughly speaking, under the eyelids), ensuring that she did not get into the nasopharynx, and its absorption was quite fast: the blackness was dispersed in seconds.  Then the subject was installed black contact lenses (they can be seen on KDPV) and put on sunglasses to reduce the amount of light entering the eyes.  Further points were removed only during the tests.  (The lenses were allegedly removed before them and were no longer used.) <br><br>  The effect of the mixture became noticeable an hour after its use [3].  After a two-hour adaptation, testing began.  The subject and four people, representing the control group, were led to a dark place where they needed to recognize various objects with marks on them in the form of numbers, letters and geometric symbols from a distance of 10 meters. <br><br>  Then the experiment continued in a grove where a group of people were asked to stand among trees and bushes in such a way as to be at a distance of 25 to 50 meters to the place from which the subject and the control group tried to visually identify them and use their laser pointer to mark their positions. <br><br>  During the tests, the subject correctly identified the objects in 100% of cases, and the control group - only in 33%.  After the tests, he put on his sunglasses and did not take them off before going to bed, in the morning his eyesight returned to normal and at least 20 days after the experiment had no noticeable deviations from it. <br><br>  <i>[3] - Shantha, T, inventor, assignee.</i>  <i>Methods for Night Vision and Night Blindness.</i>  <i>June 21, 2012. Patent 20120157377.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://turroserver.chem.columbia.edu/PDF_db/publications_801_850/NJT826.pdf">[4] - Washington I, Zhou J, Jockush S, Turro N, Nakanishi K, Sparrow J.

Unlike humans, mice were injected with a mixture intravenously, and the results were obtained using electroretinography.  The mechanism of action of Ce6 is not described in the publication, but it was carried out to check the effect of chlorophylls on vision in the red region of the spectrum in mammals after they were found in the organs of vision of a number of other animals, including amphibians and deep-water fish. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366651/</a></p>
