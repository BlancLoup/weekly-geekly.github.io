  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most popular fraud on the Internet today</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day, ladies and gentlemen! <br>  I decided to start a topic on the account of the fraud on the Internet, I think this is a current topic today. <br>  Hundreds of people fall under the machinations.  As they say, who is forewarned is armed!  <b>Be careful!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It seems to everyone: they can deceive or rob anyone, but not me.  Especially if it concerns fraud on the Internet.  Even those who once caught the bait of scammers are sure: now I am careful and this will not happen again. <br><br>  But the thing is that the World Wide Web is a bottomless barrel of all kinds of scams.  Its openness, and most importantly, legal impunity, contribute to the creation of more and more tricks.  Citizens can only fill the bumps and share the sad experience with friends.  The journalists tried to put together the most popular types of cyber frauds to date and warn Muscovites about them. <br><br>  "We make <b>horoscope</b> " <br>  Ads, offering to order a personal horoscope, are simply teeming with the World Wide Web.  The authors promise to send it quickly and for free.  The user is invited to fill out a standard form (name, surname, date of birth) and, of course, leave your email address.  An amateur of astrology indicates all these data, but instead of a horoscope, a letter with another condition falls into its box: in order to receive an order, you must send an SMS message with a set of certain numbers to the specified number.  If a client is doing this, a few dollars will fly away from his mobile phone account.  At best, he will indeed be sent a horoscope.  And immediately, which already raises doubts about its uniqueness.  At worst, they won't send anything.  And if, after the first stage of the procedure (sending data), the candidate for suckers stops, tempting messages will come to his box for a long time.  But it is albeit unpleasant, but for free.

      " <b>Help the child!</b> " <br>  This is the most blasphemous form of online fraud, because it is a question of speculation on sick children.  The text of a seriously ill child with his photo is distributed through live magazines, sent to mailboxes or hung up on the Internet forum.  The author of the message tells a tearful story about a boy (girl) whose parents cannot pay for expensive surgery (drugs).  Anyone who wants to help is invited to transfer money to a bank account (details are attached) or to pay via the WebMoney system. <br><br>  The authors of such messages can hang on the Internet as a photo of a really sick baby, taken from a charity site, and any "left".  As a result, citizens, having found any request for help on the Internet, stop believing such announcements and sometimes turn away from people who really need urgent treatment. <br><br>  Tip: Seeing the announcement of collecting money for the child, make personal contact with the author or the patient‚Äôs relatives.  Specify the name of the child, the diagnosis in which hospital.  And agree on the transfer of money from hand to hand. <br><br>  " <b>We steal someone else's negotiations!</b> " <br>  Scam for jealous men and women.  The person who is sitting in ICQ will receive a spam message from a stranger, offering mailbox hacking services, and most importantly, details of mobile conversations (information about incoming-outgoing data from the owners of numbers) and decryption of SMS messages. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHalf a year ago my suspicions crept in that my husband was going to the left,‚Äù said Tatiana, a 32-year-old marketer, ‚Äúbut there was no certainty.  And here at work I get this message.  I wrote it to the author at the specified email address, he sent the answer: they say, we carry out the order within 1-2 days.  Information on negotiations over the past 2 months costs $ 80, they need to be listed on the systems "Web-mani" or "Yandex.Money."  I immediately sent the money, but I still haven‚Äôt received the promised text file with the negotiations ... <br><br>  The correspondent entered into correspondence with the author of a similar spam message.  Sensing the profit, the crook patiently corresponded with me for two weeks.  Immediately warning that the phone talks are impossible, he said that they receive the data directly from mobile operators.  After transferring an advance payment (half of the order value), a part of information is shown to the client.  And only upon receipt of the entire amount will be sent the entire file.  To the question, what guarantees that after receiving an advance an order would indeed be sent, the unknown could not answer intelligibly.  The conversation ended ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúObtaining such data is a difficult thing even for detectives,‚Äù an acquaintance who worked for many years as the head of the criminal investigation department told us.  - To take the details, we need to get a court order at the request of the prosecutor's office.  And that is usually practiced only in serious crimes.  I do not think that detailing is so easy to buy on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>However, familiar hackers have a different opinion:</b> <br>  - Selling such information is a real thing.  But in your case, deception says that the unknown asks for half the money in advance.  A real hacker will first send a part of the detail to the client and only after that will he ask for money. <br><br>  " <b>Buy advertising!</b> " <br>  Potential customers - owners of smartphones.  The meaning of the announcements published on the Internet is a quid pro quo.  The owner of the phone can download for free and install a special program on his phone, thanks to which one or another advertising picture will be displayed on the display of the mobile phone with each incoming call or SMS message.  And the owner of the phone, in turn, will receive dividends from each such banner.  For those who have tried, opinions differ.  Some argue that if you talk a lot, you can really make good money.  But the majority says that 200 rubles came from a force of their own within a month. <br><br>  A company offering this type of mediation will most likely just want to test a new type of advertising, to see how effective it is.  But familiar hackers explained: there is no guarantee that today or tomorrow they (hackers) or their colleagues will not register malicious code in such a program.  In this case, the subscriber‚Äôs phone will send SMS to expensive servers without his knowledge.  Usually in this case it takes from 3 to 5 dollars per message.  Sending can occur infrequently, and a single smartphone owner may lose and not notice.  And the malicious code, by the way, can be sent from its phone and to other people without the knowledge of the owner. <br><br>  " <b>Buy your ICQ number!</b> " <br>  My next interlocutor's name is Peter, and he is very lucky with Internet pests. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt started in early December last year,‚Äù recalls the young man.  - Several times, when I opened the ICQ program at home, I found a message that it was already being used by another computer.  At first I thought that someone at work turned on my computer and my ICQ automatically started there.  But then there were suspicions that an unknown person had stolen my password and was using my ICQ. <br><br>  Peter's pager number is long, unmemorable.  Therefore, the goal of the thief was clearly not to get him.  The victim soon found out about his intentions. <br><br>  - In the end, I got myself a new "ICQ" and entered into a correspondence with the old one about it, - continues Peter.  - Or rather, with its new owner.  I told him: "Brother, it would be nice to return the number."  Answer: "And what will I do for it?"  The thief demanded to transfer him $ 40 via WebMoney.  Of course, I stopped the negotiations - a jester with him, with the old number ... <br><br>  And other owners are willing to pay money to the blackmailer - for example, if the list of his contacts has more than one hundred numbers and it will be problematic to restore it.  But this is not the end of Peter‚Äôs adventure.  By evening, puzzled friends and acquaintances began to call him.  It turned out that the person who stole ‚ÄúICQ‚Äù walked through his contact list.  And to each addressee on his behalf sent a message with a request to transfer $ 10 via WebMoney.  Like, urgently need money.  Several people sent the money and now they called to find out what happened to the guy. <br><br>  And sometimes the "hijacker" can send a virus to the contacts of his victim in messages.  Therefore, each Internet user needs to be remembered: if a friend has sent some link via ICQ, before opening it, call him and ask if this message is really from him. <br><br>  " <b>We offer home-based work!</b> " <br>  The art of preying on those who are looking for a job, Russian scammers took possession even in pre-Internet times.  Just moved their simple scheme to the World Wide Web. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe conists hang ads on the Web that they need typesetters,‚Äù says the same Peter.  - Wishing to earn some extra money, I answered several suggestions.  I filled out the questionnaires sent to me and received answers from different addresses with the same (!) Text.  "I work in a publishing house. You will need to reprint the authors' handwritten texts on a computer. Payment - 26 rubles per A4 page. We are ready to send you a trial order - photographs of manuscripts from which you need to type the text. But first translate us by Yandex. Money "or" Web mani "50 rubles. This will guarantee that you fulfill the order."  They say that the printing house can not throw away copyright texts - it must be responsible to customers.  I was amused by the fact that the ‚Äúprinting houses‚Äù, which, according to the authors of the messages, were located in different cities, with their texts resembled twins. <br><br>  " <b>Mobile phone for free!</b> " <br>  Now two ways of such scams are most popular. <br>  The first is used by unscrupulous online shopping.  They announce on their websites that the drawing of the cool mobile begins.  To participate, you need to buy two discs (for example, music) from them, and at the end of the week there will supposedly be a draw among buyers.  But to see firsthand who won, you, of course, no one will.  Although the site of the store in a couple of days and information will appear that the number of winners this week has increased. <br><br>  The second method is even simpler: fraudsters arrange something like an auction.  They offer you to send a specific number of text messages.  Naturally, paid.  Those who send more will get that expensive mobile phone.  Warm up your excitement will come to the mailbox message that you are behind the leader just a couple of SMS.  As a result, you squander all the money on your cell phone, and you will be told: "You sent 25 messages, and the winner - 26. Try next time." <br><br>  IMMEDIATELY RESPONSE.  Not all of the above TYPICAL internet ads are sure to fool you.  But is it worth the risk?  To lose 10-20 dollars is, of course, not expensive.  However, for a fraudster to get $ 10 from twenty the same as you, is already a good profit. <br><br>  <b>Who are they - Internet rogues?</b> <br><br>  Receiving a lot of advertisements every day via e-mail, many wonder: "Whose handiwork, how do spammers find our addresses and why can no one stop them?"  About this and many other things "MK" told a representative of such a business.  35-year-old Sergey has been engaged in electronic mailings for several years. <br><br>  &lt;span style = "font-style: italic" <b>&gt; - How do you find the addresses of our mailboxes?</b> <br>  - On the Internet there are a bunch of databases and directories such as yellow pages.  There, in addition to the actual addresses and phone numbers of companies, their e-mail is often indicated.  Databases on the staff of a particular organization is also easy to get.  Addresses of personal boxes we take from forums, live magazines, etc.  When traveling on the Internet, people often have to register somewhere and leave their e-mail address.  Special spider programs bypass resources and pull out these addresses. <br><br>  - You're right: I never leave my e-mail whenever possible, so spam almost never comes to me. <br><br>  - This is also not an option.  It is much more convenient to have one mailbox for personal correspondence, and the other one to hold for various forums - let everything go there. <br><br>  - Having received an advertisement, some users send an angry letter to the address from which it came.  And they immediately receive the answer: this address no longer exists. <br><br>  - Yes, each address is unique, and due to the fact that the Internet is constantly filtering, you have to constantly change the boxes.  It used to be easier, but the spammers themselves unwittingly complicated their task.  A few years ago, we decided to work in a civilized manner and out of respect for the recipient, to designate a sales letter in the subject line - ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù.  But such messages were immediately blocked, and they simply did not reach the addressees.  We have to act more sophisticated. <br><br>  - Why won't the fighters with advertising newsletters stop them? <br><br>  - Ha!  Those who struggle with them, for example, authors of anti-virus programs that offer mailbox owners to buy antispam from them, are beneficial for this phenomenon to exist.  As long as there is spam, there will be a demand for anti-programs, and you can release more and more.  Therefore, we have a lot of talk about laws prohibiting spam, but this is unlikely to be adopted in the near future.  It does not benefit anyone. <br><br>  - Do you send any ads?  Even every financial pyramid? <br><br>  - In the mailing list of such ads do not see anything wrong.  For scam is responsible who offers it.  Our business is to fulfill orders.  But there are a number of taboos in our environment.  For example, no one will ever send out advertisements for child pornography.  After all, we ourselves have children.  For the same reason, we do not send out bogus requests for help to sick children.  A person who tries to distribute them will be immediately thrown out of our business.  He will be blocked by all who he collaborated with on the Internet.  And the authors of those messages that are still skipping are more random people.  Just a few months ago, one spammer attempted to engage in such ‚Äúcharity‚Äù, and although he later made excuses that a large percentage of his profits were allegedly transferred to charities, in our midst he was dealt harshly with him. <br><br>  And further.  Not so long ago, a curious page appeared on the Internet: "We offer an encyclopedia of all-all-all-known Internet frauds in the world. After reading this book, you will be able to resist rogues and never get into their networks!".  Its authors are only asked to transfer 10 rubles to their e-wallet, and then they will indicate to you the way in which you can download it to your computer.  So you can try.  At least, if you are deceived this time (God forbid!), It will be the most beautiful scam in the entire history of the Internet. <br><br>  <b>WHERE TO GO TO THE VICTIMS? /</b> <b><br></b>  <b>According to the Center for the Study of Computer Crime, about 14,000 cybercrimes were recorded in Russia last year.</b>  <b>These are mainly false offers of goods and services, services for organizing hacker attacks, scams with electronic payment cards and customer accounts of electronic payment systems.</b>  <b>More than 450 such scams managed to stop.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Where to go if you are a victim of online scams?</b>  <b>The question is, of course, interesting ...</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>‚ÄúThe management of" P "was abolished in our country several years ago," said the MK in the Moscow police department.</b>  <b>- Profile division remained only in the Ministry of Internal Affairs - management "K".</b>  <b>So if you are hit by hackers, there are two options.</b>  <b>The first is to contact the Ministry of Internal Affairs immediately, the second is to write a statement to the nearest ATS</b>  <b>In the latter case, the local police will decide for themselves what to do with it: either they will be transferred to the district or the same Ministry of Internal Affairs, or they will try to solve the crime themselves.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>Why is the necessary control disbanded at the Central Internal Affairs Directorate?</b>  <b>The guards of order only cautiously notice that the decisions of the authorities are not discussed.</b>  <b>It is only known that some of the fighters against hackers from the Moscow administration of "P" then went to work in other spheres - for example, deal with tax crimes, and some of them left "for citizenship".</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>- The high-tech market is developing at a breakneck pace.</b>  <b>And, unfortunately, neither law enforcers, nor lawmakers can keep up with him, - says lawyer Peter Dombrovitsky, who had to deal with such cases.</b>  <b>- In such things, the law enforcement officers are inert, and you can draw their attention to your case only with the help of an official statement to the police or the prosecutor's office.</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b><a href="http://cd.websklad.net/"><b>a source</b></a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7050/</a></p>
