  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Novice Project Manager - Design</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Little preface.  We have a need to make a website.  And not just a business card, but an online store with a non-standard ordering system.  More precisely - to alter the existing one, but since the existing one in terms of safety and ease of administration (as well as design and quality of the version) was not suitable, it was necessary to do it anew. <br>  Having talked with a number of programmers (I myself am such), we realized that CMS (even modified) does not suit us, self-written code disappears for a number of reasons (there is no guarantee of security first of all), we need a website on the framework. <br>  Why it was not to turn to the site for a ready-made team, where there is a manager and trusted employees? <br><br>  <b>Firstly</b> , there was already experience in freelance exchanges, experience of 2 years, an employer account with 20+ reviews ... everything seemed real, given that I myself can impose (really something quite simple), set to hosting - in short, I have basic knowledge and experience in dealing with specialists. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , I wanted to try myself in a new position, this is career and personal growth ... and how the ‚Äúproject manager‚Äù sounds like!

      <b>Thirdly</b> - honestly, I wanted to save.  The project budget was about $ 2500 (+ -), and an assumption arose, which then seemed obvious - why pay more, if we are better for this money we will hire not just a good, but a very good designer ...?  This also applies to other project participants. <br>  Everything turned out to be not so obvious at the check, but there appeared basic principles that I would like to state in the article, as well as to get additions - perhaps the person who was or is the project manager also got them together - thus the collective mind forms an interesting topic and, perhaps discussions in which, as you know, truth is born. <br><br>  Everything written is a personal opinion, it is definitely worth considering. <br><br><h3>  Quality required by the project manager </h3><br>  <b>1)</b> Stress resistance. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  It may happen that in the most crucial moment the performer disappears.  The designer will not produce a mock-up, but something completely unsuitable, although he or she seems to have explained everything, and no alteration of the result will be given.  It may happen that the deadlines will be blown out, the customer will be fairly unhappy.  Or very unhappy.  It may happen that you have to pay performers for a number of reasons from your own pocket.  There may be a fire, a flood, a server with your unfinished site will burn down.  Be prepared for stress, it is inevitable.  It‚Äôs cheaper for your nerves to hire a manager or contact the development team, but since I‚Äôve identified myself as a grudge ... <br><br>  <b>2)</b> General literacy and erudition. <br>  The ability to write competently will save a lot of time, the ability to communicate competently will allow you to establish communication with people.  After all, a customer and, say, a programmer are often very different people.  Everyone needs to explain something, employees - to motivate ... it is always pleasant to communicate with a competent and well-read person, it will give you extra points for the customer and specialists. <br><br>  <b>3)</b> Technical literacy. <br>  Of course, it‚Äôs good if you are a programmer.  But this is a topic for a separate discussion - even people who write books on management have not reached an unequivocal opinion on this issue. <br>  But if you are not a programmer, then you should understand in general terms what the program code is and how it works.  The more this kind of knowledge - the better.  Yes, and it is more pleasant for a programmer to communicate with an interested and generally presenting person, rather than with an ‚Äúoak tree‚Äù at all. <br>  Read, learn - the mass of literature. <br>  Not bad, if you know something yourself from what your command is to do. <br>  Although, for example, I find it difficult to imagine a project manager who is not technically well versed in anything. <br>  "At the worst" - you need to understand at least in design or usability, only professionally. <br>  You need to understand what the customer wants.  And bring it to the designer.  Because in 90% of the cases the designer ate gave out ‚Äúnot at all‚Äù - the manager is still to blame.  Even the fact that he misunderstood the customer and found the wrong designer. <br><br><h3>  TK </h3><br>  Spend not 2-3 hours, but even 2-3 days of your time to make a good TZ, with pictures, with a detailed description of what happens when you click on this and that.  It is desirable that the main essence is reflected graphically + explanations.  Such a practice, as practice shows, is the most optimal.  The TK should have a prototype of the site, this is a common TZ, which is then broken down into parts for the designer, layout designer, and programmer. <br>  The prototype of the site is made by an interface specialist.  If you yourself can not draw a prototype of the site, then be sure to hire it.  In addition, there will be an additional bonus in the form of good usability).  Although, if this is a business card site, for example, you can also enter the role of the creator of the prototype yourself, spending time on it.  The main thing is that the prototype of the site was agreed with the customer. <br>  Customers generally do not like being bothered ‚Äúover trifles,‚Äù but this is one of the key moments.  Because the alteration of any elements on the finished site is the same gimp. <br>  The first thing is to reformulate your big TZ in TK for a designer.  There should be a minimum, very briefly, the simple language of an ordinary person describes the functionality of the site - and the maximum is given to designer gadgets, details, colors, as well as small details. <br><br><h3>  Designer </h3><br>  There are not so many designers on freelance exchanges, but very many. <br>  Here you need to clearly know the budget and imagine what level of design you will get for it. <br>  Very good site design starts from $ 1000.  About. <br>  There is a segment of 15,000 rubles.  - 20,000 rubles., If the customer is not picky and a simple design suits him - here you can also find some good experts, but with a greater share of risk, of course. <br>  It‚Äôs not even cheaper to look for.  The project should not turn into a lottery, but here either this is a novice good designer (the lucky ticket is 1 out of 100) - he will quickly go to another segment, or you will draw UG, and after all, the designer needs prepayment.  Think about it and in no case try to save. <br>  Be sure to check with the customer what style of sites he likes.  It will be difficult to answer him, in most cases, on the move, so prepare in advance and show examples of sites.  As many as possible examples. <br>  So, we conditionally decided on a budget and move on.  Dozens will respond to your application ‚ÄúSite Design‚Äù, and quite quickly.  How among them to choose someone? .. <br>  It would be good, by the way, to formulate an application ‚ÄúDesign of a site in the style of such and such‚Äù or to somehow describe it, you can also name the budget (although here, perhaps, I would like to ask the opinions of readers what it is and how best to write in the application?). <br>  Look at the portfolio.  If you do not like any site - go to the next portfolio.  In this way, a part of you will be eliminated, the rest will be sifted out further. <br><br>  <b>1.</b> Look at your portfolio.  For example, I have such a mistake ‚Äî as it turned out, it can be fatal ‚Äî to pay particular attention to sites in the portfolio that I like, and not to particularly focus on those that are ‚Äúnot very‚Äù. <br>  It is to the latter that you should take a closer look and ask yourself the question - ‚ÄúWhat if my site is like this‚Äù?  As practice shows, in the portfolio the designer puts out the best work.  That is, it is likely that your site will resemble the site that is ‚Äúnot very‚Äù in terms of the overall level of performance.  Here come to work critically.  Tolerance will be needed when he sends you the first layout.  And you may need, perhaps, to still convey this tolerance to the customer.  Your designer all sites should like and fit.  Everything. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Thus, we have eliminated some of the designers. <br>  Now look at the following topic: Do the websites of the designer reflect the theme of the website?  That is, is it possible to understand what the site is by looking at the picture?  And it's easy to check yourself - we look, we make an assumption, what the site is about - we read the name (we follow the link).  A very important point. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Probably, someone was eliminated again. <br>  Now we look at your technical specification for the designer.  What do you need? <br>  If you need a beautiful background in the form of a picture, see which of the designers makes the background in the form of a picture.  If you need beautiful icons - we look, who on the sites he is especially beautiful.  If you need a design on a white background - we see who has good designs on a white background.  This seems obvious, but the moment cannot be missed, scrupulousness is needed here. <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Now, having selected several candidates, we read reviews.  We immediately mark those who have not mentioned the delayed terms of the project more than once in the reviews, plus those whom the users praise for punctuality.  If there are no reviews at all ... or there are few of them ... then my ho is no risk.  Because along with a novice designer (who may not get a good design for this project), it can be a fraudster who does not give away his work as his own.  I didn‚Äôt want to talk bad about people, but it happens on stock exchanges. <br>  It is checked, it is better to work with experienced designers, and again - not to save ... because there is a high probability of paying twice or even three times. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> We send ours to the designer to any candidates you like. <br>  Choose a candidate normally, plus or minus a day.  Some good designers work at night, some will answer in the morning, it‚Äôs necessary that they all read, and you also have time to think ... <br><br>  <b>6.</b> It would not be bad, if there is such an opportunity, to show the designer's work to the customer. <br><br>  In the TK for the designer should show examples of sites.  As much as possible, each phrase should be supported with examples. <br>  <i>Example: we like when there is a transition of colors on the site and a pattern on the background is like a link.</i> <br>  <i>Example 2: we need very good clear, beautiful buttons like this - link.</i> <br>  The fact is that in the designer's concept ‚Äúbeautiful buttons‚Äù and in yours can be completely different in general.  It is desirable that there are several examples of each statement. <br><br>  Thus, for example, I managed to find a good designer, cooperation with which was (and maybe still will be) pleasant and fruitful. <br>  And how are you looking for a good designer on freelance exchanges? <br><br>  To be continued - layouts need to impose. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137070/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137070/</a></p>
