  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[Woman's View] Highscreen Thor Overview: Masculinity and the Power of Eight Cores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Numerous manufacturers of smartphones on Android already, it seems, do not know how to surprise.  So they are looking for all the new advertising "chips" like eight cores in the processor.  This was advertised, for example, in the notorious "Korean" - but after the euphoria about the number of cores, the secret about the 4 + 4 scheme was revealed.  Another thing is that today the definition of ‚Äúeight-core‚Äù fully corresponds to reality: in Russia, the domestic Highscreen brand was the first to embark on this path.  The novelty received a sonorous and truly manly name - Highscreen Thor.  Even those who are not familiar with Scandinavian mythology can associate with at least one (and the most attractive) hero from the Avengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab2/e8c/23f/ab2e8c23f2a03a8eb9bd321baafd71a9.jpg"><br><br>  I admit, it was still attracted not so much by the successful name of the smartphone, but by the promising eight cores inside.  What is more important - quantity or quality?  I'll try to figure it out, although some fans of the same Highscreen have announced that such a task is beyond the power of the girl. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The box looks not too attractive, because it is made from recycled materials.  However, there is a kind of contribution to the environment - for this plus.  On the box in the corporate style there is the name of the smartphone, the scheme of the device itself ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù and the promise of 128 GB of space in the cloud storage 4Sync. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b21/88e/3d9/b2188e3d9b3292a0b2702167ea7eb5b3.jpg"><br><br>  Inside - the smartphone itself and a standard set of related paraphernalia and accessories.  But no, not everything is so banal.  The real ‚Äúbonus‚Äù is the second back cover in white.  Thank you, we thought about the girls: for some reason, the white color of the body is especially close to us.  At least, any user, regardless of gender, will be able to somehow diversify the tired appearance of the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/d7a/645/1bad7a6450dda5164cd0496738c14394.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cc/45a/324/5cc45a324a232bbc86d2f11f7582f4b6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Very big and thin - these are my first impressions of Highscreen Thor.  The Russian smartphone is not very comfortable in the hand: due to its size, this device seems to be a bit cumbersome for a girl.  However, the dimensions are partly compensated by the case thickness of 7.6 mm - as in the same iPhone 5S.  So you can‚Äôt call heavy Highscreen Thor, but also ideal for the female palm - either.  Although women, too, are different ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/19f/979/567/19f9795675f622cc71c29d0732138111.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87e/8bf/ac6/87e8bfac67ea2a2c3f94ea45687ca22e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/949/d50/b5f/949d50b5fd403d3afb2824e652d62271.jpg"><br><br>  On the whole, the design of the ‚Äúcourageous‚Äù smartphone doesn‚Äôt meet its name too much: a body with smooth corners, smooth and streamlined lines are associated more with female forms.  From a smartphone with such a name and such aggressive advertising (about it a bit later) you expect something more brutal.  Well, this is what is called an amateur. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/fac/b3f/c96facb3fa53ec061b049748c1602d26.jpg"><br><br>  All buttons and connectors are in place here: the power and volume buttons are located on the sides, the necessary connectors are at the top and bottom.  Quite convenient, since the smartphone is still not the most compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb1/26c/ed0/eb126ced067a0212b33d0797156b4379.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bad/688/8a5/bad6888a5c9db06676a35c161b8661e9.jpg"><br><br>  The back cover is made of rubberized plastic, which is pleasant to the touch and on which almost no prints are visible.  White replaceable cover, on the contrary, glossy and smooth.  In the upper part of the back side in the center is the camera lens, which protrudes slightly on the flat surface of the cover.  I was worried that in this way the built-in lens could be scratched / broken / ruined quite easily if not treated too carefully.  But I still didn‚Äôt check the validity of such a theory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/985/84f/623/98584f6236a206b58e03ec940b025c4f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/840/edb/f1e/840edbf1e51597e03ed1ee85d7cc77e6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c2/c0f/2e6/1c2c0f2e678db94ef9685b27a452c13c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/fc3/c0e/6cefc3c0ee0a1dcb43f152aa7e3bfd47.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  When you turn on Highscreen Thor, I immediately noticed the quality of the picture.  For the image meets the 5-inch IPS-screen from the Japanese manufacturer Sharp, with a resolution of Full HD.  When creating and used technology OGS and Full Lamination (peeped in the instructions), hence the excellent color reproduction, and sufficient screen brightness.  Previously, I ‚Äútalked‚Äù with other Highscreen smartphones and I can confidently say that it uses the best matrix among those ever installed in brand models.  The image is very lively, the picture really seems to lie on the surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f54/e51/1e1/f54e511e1be1064fa40908ddf702a4f3.jpg"><br><br>  A little upset if the presence of "fingers" and all sorts of dust on the screen - there is no so-called oleophobic coating.  But for me it is not such a minus - there will always be napkins in the bag. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  What does a girl need from a smartphone?  I will not bring everyone under one line, but there are still general ‚Äúfemale‚Äù requirements.  For example, the ability to seamlessly go online, upload photos and videos and watch videos in high quality.  With this, the Highscreen Thor I tested tested once or twice, but first things first. <br><br>  In Highscreen Thor, as mentioned above, those eight cores attracted me.  Frankly, for me, as for most typical smartphone users, a large number of cores inside are equally high-performing (many will disagree with me and will be right).  In the case of Highscreen Thor, everything turned out to be exactly like this: as a ‚Äúengine‚Äù here MediaTek MT6592, which showed almost 27,000 points on performance tests.  However, the figure is equivalent to the performance of the Samsung Galaxy S4, which, as we remember, the processor operates according to the 4 + 4 scheme.  Plus 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of built-in and decent graphics accelerator Mali-450MP4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/671/ab3/921671ab332f11fb9b17e03005278573.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/154/bac/912/154bac912caae7cf8c45c64a42bfeaef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/519/0a8/f675190a8dabc6c9aa69bce8214c78b8.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3d/f47/471/a3df4747102ae6f1bc630aee4f1f6ec0.png"><br><br>  What do all these numbers and names mean to me as a user?  As I already wrote, surfing the Internet and watching high-quality video for Highscreen Thor was not a problem - everything flies. <br><br>  I tried the speed of work on my favorite applications, for example, ‚ÄúCold Heart‚Äù and ‚ÄúDespicable Me‚Äù games.  No brakes or hangs: the minions run, the balls disappear.  Of course, for the sake of completeness, Asphalt 8, Modern Combat 4 and their ilk were launched - everything is in order.  No, I didn‚Äôt get along without any minor lags, but I haven‚Äôt yet met an absolutely perfect Android smartphone in this regard.  Another point: I am not used to keeping track of the number of games and applications launched and "hanging" at the same time.  In other words, order is not my thing.  In the case of Highscreen Thor, even this my ‚Äújamb‚Äù did not affect the speed of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/7f3/370/d0c7f337085b304e7ebdb75b6c2f12d7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/0f8/67e/29d0f867e5ef7deb671d80e6657cfd42.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e39/588/f74/e39588f74907e4cae4af4b87cabd7608.png"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  This item was especially important to me.  I like to photograph myself and everything around me, and it‚Äôs not always necessary to carry extra weights like a ‚ÄúSLR‚Äù.  Of course, to compare a professional camera with a smartphone camera, I will not.  But to say a few words about the camera, which somehow always is always at hand. <br><br>  So, in Highscreen Thor there are two cameras - a front one with 5 megapixels and a main one with 13 megapixels.  The fact that megapixels - this is not the parameter by which to evaluate the quality of the camera, few know.  And because the cherished 13 Mp on the price tag, most will only cause delight.  However, not everything is so bad specifically for Highscreen Thor.  In this case, the pictures are quite clear, without color distortion, the macro is also at a decent level.  As a camera for ‚Äúrandom‚Äù shots, the device proved to be very worthy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cf/4d4/51e/2cf4d451e079d7ce2bfae4b5cbe9563c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/997/98d/208/99798d208acae4bb8101d91766d9c043.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b26/9e0/d0f/b269e0d0f617a8c7bed137c6788eaf29.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46d/31d/37c/46d31d37c9192cbb72d2610f2d31d664.jpg"><br><br>  "Selfies" with Highscreen Thor will also be obtained on a solid "four".  You should not wait for portrait accuracy, but a 5-megapixel camera is useful for video chatting or photo-to-memory communication. <br><br><h4>  System </h4><br>  For Android 4.3, refer to Highscreen Boost 2 SE, here we are content with Android 4.2.2.  There are no special improvements, even additional applications - from the usual MediaTek set.  Although one highlight from Highscreen is still there - non-standard wallpaper, among which there is a great picture with native birch trees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/fe7/84c/53dfe784cbd01725f31ba42e13e9421d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/477/91a/b87/47791ab87684593d0e9a7c99fe7e54a6.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/319/d0c/29b/319d0c29bfd32b47cbbe8370edf32ddf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da2/0ba/966/da20ba966ef59abee574e73bfafff5ad.png"><br><br>  Of course, in the latest MediaTek processors there are often problems with GPS, so just in case, I also tested navigation.  I can‚Äôt say that the best GPS receiver I‚Äôve seen here has been installed here, but there are no overt failures at work.  Confident communication with the satellites has to wait at the ‚Äúcold start‚Äù for about two minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/bf8/2fe/ce1bf82fe3d08719740d3ce17392b545.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/b8c/380/849b8c3804ae376a9ee422bd12b36d27.png"><br><br><h4>  Eventually </h4><br>  In conclusion, it is worth mentioning that Highscreen Thor runs on Android 4.2.2 and is equipped with a 2,000 mAh battery.  The latter means that there is enough work for about a day.  For me, with my running toys, the charge lasted about 4-5 hours.  The smartphone will last about the same if you watch the video in HD. <br><br>  It is worth Highscreen Thor 13 490 rubles - not a lot for a smartphone with such characteristics, but also a lot for a model of not the most famous brand.  In general, Highscreen Thor met my expectations in terms of masculinity and power, with the exception of perhaps not too brutal appearance.  Well, I still haven‚Äôt figured out the issue of quantity and quality: after all, Highscreen Thor guarantees the quantity and quality. <br><br>  And finally, the promised bonus about advertising.  Nikita Dzhigurda, the quintessence of male energy in runet, became the face of this Highscreen model.  Everything is logical, in my opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ae/afa/a4f/2aeafaa4f2c26150014504fa877d018c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fd/c88/7ad/2fdc887ad917a078ec000d6b6a109ff5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac1/52b/ca8/ac152bca89bb3cbd16d969b04f083027.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218689/</a></p>
