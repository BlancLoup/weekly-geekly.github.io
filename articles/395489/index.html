  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A startup from Ukraine offered wireless charging capable of charging up to 8 iPhones simultaneously within a radius of up to 10 meters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ukrainian startup <a href="http://technovator.co/">Technovator XE</a> presented a working prototype of wireless charging for several smartphones at the same time.  The project was founded by the co-founder of CTO Concepter and the creator of the <a href="http://concepter.co/iblazr2/">iBlazr</a> flash Ivan <a href="http://concepter.co/iblazr2/">Chuba</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6e/111/775/f6e111775bd478a1af06a5622955d765.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The device of the same name, Technovator XE, is a hardware-software complex comprising a base station, several cases for smartphones and a special application that allows you to manage it.  The base and the cover, playing the roles, respectively, of the transmitter and the receiver of energy have inductors coils operating at the stage of energy transfer in the resonance mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1bd/d13/5fb/1bdd135fb1bcd97527492131a94c8b0c.jpg" alt="image">

      Using the Bluetooth channel, the base checks the space in the available range and searches for all smartphones in Technovator XE receiver covers.  Having discovered a smartphone / smartphones base activates the charging option.  The application allows you to flexibly change charging parameters, set a convenient time, mode and charge level, etc. The created prototype is focused on the iPhone top segment - the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d33/941/502/d33941502e9a4ca5630bf5745bcdc6f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The base station has a small power (40-50 W) and emits waves in the mid-wave range.  This is quite enough to charge smartphones.  At the same time, which is very important, the level of electromagnetic radiation within its radius of action completely fits into the safety requirements for residential premises set by European standards.  You have to pay for comfort with time: in order to fully charge the iPhone from scratch, you have to spend up to four hours, which is almost twice the time required to recharge via cable at a voltage of 5 volts and a current of 1 ampere.  But the final charging characteristics are still being clarified.  ‚ÄúWe are working towards lower power and greater efficiency,‚Äù says Ivan. <br><br>  Charging Technovator XE involves the active use of the smartphone during the process, which means that the final charging time will depend on the power consumption.  The charging case is equipped with a buffer battery, which is also constantly being recharged from the base station, with a capacity of approximately one third of the standard smartphone battery.  Usually, the smartphone is charged directly from the station, but if the user leaves its area of ‚Äã‚Äãoperation or the signal level decreases, charging from the backup battery in the case turns on. <br><br>  Case Features: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2be/bff/693/2bebff6939fa5b5f587021067bb36f46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the convenient features of the application is the option to automatically control the charge level, the installation of which will allow a smartphone discharged to some state to be charged whenever it falls within the range of the base station.  If during the day time to charge is sorely lacking, the application can be programmed to night mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac3/674/dda/ac3674dda966900302d739ecf88e40bd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In its current performance, the base station for the Technovator XE house can recharge up to 4 devices simultaneously within a radius of up to 5 meters, an office modification - up to 8 devices within a radius of up to 10 meters. , and each subsequent case will be sold for $ 50. <br><br>  <b>Market</b> <br><br>  It would be naive to assume that such a promising direction as the wireless transmission of energy within the premises will be ignored by competitors.  And Technovator XE, of course, has them.  Among them, for example, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubeam">uBeam</a> , <a href="http://www.energous.com/product-overview/">Energous</a> , <a href="http://www.qiwireless.com/">Qi</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, Chuba is sure that Technovator has a technological advantage, since some of the competitors (Energous and Cota) use other frequency ranges - for example, 2.4-2.5 GHz (the range where Wi-Fi works), and this , taking into account international safety standards, establishing the level of e / m-radiation, does not allow charging devices quickly enough.  Charges that work according to the Qi standard do not involve using the phone in the process, moving from place to place, etc. <br><br>  Some of them (like uBeam) use ultrasonic transmitters for charging, but this technology is much more laborious and complex, as Ivan points out.  Moreover, relatively recently, uBeam <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/11/charged/">was accused of</a> representing non-existent technology, calling the startup ‚Äúsecond Theranos‚Äù.  To some extent, this may be true, because despite the statements about the 100% readiness of the product for the commercial launch, not a single public demonstration was held and was not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d9/379/6a3/1d93796a360a766fc3a5cdc614e29d74.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the Technovator XE team is actively speaking at various conferences, demonstrating a prototype of the base charging station, from which everyone can try to charge their smartphones right on the spot.  Next year we plan to release a commercial version, and by the end of this year - access to the Kickstarter platform. <br><br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
