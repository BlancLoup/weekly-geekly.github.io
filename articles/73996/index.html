Engaged in the production of bicycles (1), scooters and other vehicles. <br><br>  Announcement: ‚ÄúNew model from Beltelecom - Rickshaw (2)!‚Äù <br>  The buyer finds out the details. <br>  P: - What is this? <br>  B: - How so?  Personal transport!!! <br>  - How much is? <br>  - 50 rubles ... per minute, well, and we for the stroller 5 rubles ... per minute (3) <br>  - Expensive <br>  - What did you want?

      Provider appears. <br>  Pr: - Do you sell in bulk? <br>  B: - We need to think, okay, take 55 per minute, plus a stroller, plus taxes <br>  Pr: - Expensive <br>  B: - You're a businessman - well advertised, you sell more.  I am a benefactor, damn it, bicycles for people with disabilities (4) cheaply (4a) I give.  And orphans (5) I have tens of thousands in care - everyone wants to eat! <br>  Pr: - Perhaps I will take a dozen <br>  B: I still have such with a motor (6), only 3 000 000 per month <br>  Etc: ?! <br>  Pr: - And by the way, why do you need so many orphans, let them go somewhere else are fed <br>  B: - Have you ever seen such a feeder as mine? <br>  Pr: - And why bicycles for all people with disabilities? <br>  B: - GO TRADE, speculator!  Do not bother to work! <br><br><h5>  ACT 2 </h5><br>  Several years have passed. <br>  Announcement: ‚ÄúNew offer from Beltelecom - Car (7)!‚Äù <br><br>  The buyer is interested. <br><br>  P: - Tell me more. <br>  B: - This is the most advanced technology in the West!  VAZ-2101 (7a) for only 1,000,000 rubles <br>  P: - I heard that in the west now they are driving Ford cars (7b), and for less money.  Maybe I'll go buy myself? <br>  B: - Come on.  We have already gone so smart - they are now in prison.  Here, except me, no one can be engaged in charity!  The law is written! <br>  The buyer leaves sad. <br><br>  Immediately the Provider appears. <br>  Pr: - Do you sell cars in bulk? <br>  B: - Take it, 1 500 000 plus taxes ... Or take Ford for 15 million, generally cool! <br>  Etc: - ?! <br>  B: - You can sell for parts.  Give a good advertisement ... <br>  B: - And don‚Äôt think of supplying me from abroad, well, you yourself know everything. <br>  Pr: - Let's two dozen Zhiguli and 1 Ford. <br><br>  Announcement: ‚ÄúNew offers from Provider - Cars! <br>  - VAZ-2101!  Like new, painted!  Jokingly overtakes the flying carpet!  Only 1,000,000! <br>  (dismantled, surcharge for each kilometer) <br>  - Ford!  Almost new, painted, polished!  Cosmic speeds!  For the wealthy - for 9 900 000! <br>  (dismantled, without engine, payment of 1000 rubles for each kilometer) <br>  - New Rickshaw!  Carries free night - for food! <br>  (100 rubles per km) " <br><br>  The bespectacled buyer tries to find out the details of the provider. <br><br>  P: - And what for me at night to rickshaw ride?  I sleep at night. <br>  Pr: - Oh, you village!  At night, they all chase!  Who is on the case, but mostly in high places (*)! <br>  - And if I buy a Lada, why pay for kilometers (10)? <br>  - Everybody pays! <br>  - And abroad do not pay. <br>  - Here and get out abroad! <br>  - And if I collect a Ford, how can I go without an engine? <br>  - We will disperse you for a small fee - ooh how we will disperse! <br>  - And then? <br>  - Then we will again accelerate to maximum speed! <br>  - Ie  payment for mileage? <br>  - (quietly) Yes, go already, you still have no money. <br><br>  The buyer leaves, thinking: ‚ÄúIt is wrong somehow.  I pay for a rickshaw or a car that is 100 times more expensive than they cost. ‚Äù <br>  A representative of Beltelecom is quietly sneaking up behind. <br><br>  B: - Do you want to offend the orphans !? <br>  P: - No, that you!  But you and the providers pay, and I, and even Aviation (9)! <br>  B: - Who told you such a heresy, Aviation on cost accounting! <br>  P: - Aviators, for each flight, unfasten you 100 ruble lines, 1,000 for international, and also buy rickshaws (learned to fasten propellers) (8a). <br>  B: - Lies is all!  I help disabled people!  I feed the orphans! <br><br><h5>  ACT 3 </h5><br>  Nowadays.  Already the N-th year, it is rumored that Beltelekom will be taken off the feeder (11). <br><br>  Ads: <br>  ‚ÄúNew offer from Beltelecom - Ford for 150,000 rubles!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWe feed over 25,000 orphans !!‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúWe help people with disabilities!‚Äù <br>  "99% of disabled people with our bikes!" <br><br>  Instantly, a provider appears in the office of Beltelecom. <br>  Pr: - I take all the Fords of 150,000! <br>  B: - No, this is only for the Buyer.  He was so sad last time.  For you, 1 200 000. In six months the discount of women will be 15%.  Only you tell everyone how I help people with disabilities, I get cars for overseas to get expensive cars, by the way, for currency! <br>  Pr: - Is it true that you are going to take away the feeder? <br>  B: - You will not wait for her anyway!  Goodbye! <br><br>  The buyer rides a Ford, produced in 1998, pleased says: ‚ÄúAnd next year, maybe a Mercedes for such a price will be sold!  And maybe cheaper - both abroad!  And the Provider, a redneck, could have sold cheaper!  He does not need to feed the orphans! ‚Äù <br><br>  The end? <br><br>  PS <br>  Why did I write this? <br>  1. Now there are articles that after the sale of the feeder will not get better, but on the contrary, it may become worse. <br>  2. Show that cross-subsidization is only a cover for ‚ÄúOrphan‚Äù. <br><br>  I do not work for any of the providers. <br>  I don‚Äôt consider any characters as bad or good.  Simply, there is a system that rolls by inertia, and tries to find excuse from any changes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73996/</a></p>
