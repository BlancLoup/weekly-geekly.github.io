  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many minutes does it take to communicate with the client by phone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello Megamind!  For 3 months, more than 400,000 calls were made via <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> .  Unfortunately, we do not have access to conversations (for confidentiality policy), but we asked several loyal customers to give us access to their personal account so that we could collect statistics on the duration of conversations.  So we scrubbed 800 calls that allowed us to do a little research in order to find out how much time it takes to talk with one client, depending on the specialization of the company.  The result was this picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b5/d25/90b/7b5d2590bdc64c5d920a3ee6deb0b3bc.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  As you can see, most often at 1 conversation takes less than 1 minute.  It may seem that this is not enough, but in fact in 60 seconds you can not only clarify, but also make a new order.  True, these are mainly conversations when it comes to clarifying any nuances.  If we are talking about turning a call into a deal, then the time increases accordingly:

          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

Almost everywhere more than a minute.  Probably, it was not a discovery for anyone that most of the time for a call is spent by real estate agencies - this is explained by the fact that the question of buying an apartment, as a rule, is not solved in correspondence.  As for law firms, there is a completely different reason - judging by the length of calls, here we are talking about consultation, respectively, there is also a wide range of issues. <br><br>  The least amount of time is spent on companies engaged in the repair of household and electronic equipment - 40 seconds per conversation.  This is mainly a question and answer: <br><br><blockquote>  - Good afternoon, my name is Arsen, Apple service center, how can I help you? <br>  - Hello.  I have a broken screen on the iPhone, how much will the replacement cost and how long will it take? <br>  - What is your iPhone? <br>  - Fifth. <br>  - Replacing the screen of the fifth iPhone will cost 1000 rubles.  Term - 3-4 hours. <br>  - How long do you work? <br>  - Up to 9. <br>  - Where are you? <br>  - Metro Begovaya. <br>  - Thank. </blockquote><br><h4>  What conclusions can be drawn? </h4><br>  There are areas where anywhere without a callback - this is the same direction, travel agencies, law firms, resorts and sanatoriums.  At the same time, there are areas where it is possible to confine ourselves to chatting - for example, here are companies such as service centers, where all questions are clarifying.  In some cases, of course, the conversation can take up to 3-5 minutes, especially if the problem is serious, but this is rare. <br><br>  We have always been interested in how someone uses our service, so we discovered with pleasant surprise that almost in each of the 33 spheres there is a different tactic.  For example, WEB-studios and travel agencies are trying to transfer the conversation to offline, offering to send a brief (in the first case) or to come to the office and discuss everything on the spot (in the second).  If not for this, one call would take much longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/8a0/9c3/edb8a09c362041038a6445b59435cd7e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Service centers, pizzerias, dentistry and beauty salons do not need this.  Here Rocket acts as a tool of retention, rather than involvement, say, make an appointment, order a pizza or specify delivery.  The call takes less than 1 minute. <br><br>  As a result, one conversation takes not so much time, respectively, paying 15-20 rubles per minute - pure waste.  This is how we came to the decision to make our widget in the time - in the summer we tested several callback services, saw that the price per minute was about 30 rubles, and some even had $ 67 for 37 calls when the price soared to 70 80 rubles per minute.  This is despite the fact that most conversations take no more than 2 minutes. <br><br>  And finally, another conclusion, though controversial - the phone is still one of the main channels of communication.  People, seeing all the information on the site, still prefer to contact by phone and, if not to find out, then to clarify, to hear the human voice.  This is already something from the field of psychology, something like "people love other people." <br><br><h4>  Objectivity as it is </h4><br>  We already had about 20 registrations and 10 payments from the moment we arrived at Megamind, based on which we can conclude that there are our potential customers.  If you or your friend is going to establish a callback service on your site, then you need to do this after monitoring the time spent on 1 conversation with the client.  This will make the right choice, since almost all services can be divided into 2 large groups: where you pay for the conversation, and where you pay for the minutes.  If all the conversations in your company last more than 5 minutes, then it is worth choosing the first option, and if less, then the second one.  <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback</a> for example, we consider ourselves in the second group. <br><br>  We have it all.  We hope that the information will be useful. <br>  Thanks for reading us, subscribe to <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback">our blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289956/</a></p>
