  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúYoung people don't watch TV‚Äù - one of the conclusions of the annual ‚ÄúDigital News Status Report‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The annual ‚ÄúDigital News Status Report‚Äù, prepared by the Reiter‚Äôs Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford, appeared <a href="http://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/Reuters%2520Institute%2520Digital%2520News%2520Report%25202015_Full%2520Report.pdf">freely available</a> yesterday. <br><br>  The document contains a lot of statistical and analytical data for the countries in which the research was conducted: USA, UK, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Japan, Australia and major cities of Brazil.  The conclusions that the authors have gathered in the document are expected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, one of the main conclusions of the document was the statement that the improvement of mobile technologies and devices completely changed the model of news consumption.  Young people have already abandoned newspaper news and are gradually ‚Äúturning off the TV,‚Äù preferring content distributed on social networks and on various Internet platforms.  The funny thing is that, statistically, the youth did not watch TV for less time - it just does not perceive the information being presented as ‚Äúnews‚Äù.  Therefore, there is no ‚Äúnews‚Äù on TV for young people. <br><br>  In the United States, the proportion of people under the age of 35 who watched a news release at least once in seven days dropped from 37% in 2013 to 24% in 2015. This figure, according to experts, casts doubt on the business model of the world's leading broadcasters.

      In contrast, the authors of the report separately note and appreciate the activities of technology companies that understand the new trend.  Facebook (with <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15352/">Instant Articles</a> ) and updated Apple News feature as an example.  Experts consider that they take up editorial functions as a manifestation of a serious attitude to the news. <br><br>  The main author of the report - Nick Newman, in an interview with the Financial Times says the following: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúOf course, editorial responsibility exists, and companies such as Google already take on this responsibility and recruit people who have the appropriate qualifications.  And this is absolutely inevitable for both Facebook and Twitter. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In all countries surveyed, Facebook is the most popular source of online news.  The only exception is Japan, in which in the first place, no matter how strange it may sound, YouTube. <br>  There are other interesting points, for example, a quarter of Spanish users noted that they were watching and discussing news using WhatsApp. <br><br>  Returning to television, experts say that among those who use the Internet rarely, TV is still the most popular source of news. <br><br>  And, finally, the last, but not by its significance, researchers' conclusion: Internet users are not ready to pay for the news.  No "more or less noticeable trend towards an increase in subscribers to paid content, as well as willingness to pay" was found.  Users in the UK are the least willing to pay for news: 75% of respondents said they would not pay for news regardless of price. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291614/</a></p>
