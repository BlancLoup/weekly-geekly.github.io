When the server was unavailable for several days, I ordered hosting from another provider and restored the site from the backup. <br><br>  After a couple of weeks, they restored something and the site started working.  One domain still points to it and someone even goes there, but very few.  Swearing with them and demanding money (a small amount) did not have any desire and decided to leave it as it is, suddenly come in handy.

      And last night I receive the following letter from them: <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Mikhail Benkovich, <br><br>  We are sorry to announce the blocking of your account: <br>  Login: mikhail <br>  Account Number: # 526575_0 <br>  Plan: Start (Start) <br><br>  Your account has been suspended for a reason. <br>  server overload <br></blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This surprised me a lot, and I asked to send logs.  In response, the following came: <br><br><blockquote>  [05/17/2010 21:13:13] <br>  A: Please, explain why it is caused by the fact that a connection to the server 188.72.80. * Was running from your account in several threads, clogging up the processor by 100% <br><br>  Do you have scripts that use this server? <br></blockquote><br><br>  I wrote that there are no such scripts and in general there are no scripts that themselves establish a connection to another server. <br><br>  And lo and behold, a letter arrived this morning. <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Mikhail Benkovich, <br><br>  We are pleased to inform you about unlocking your account: <br>  Login: mikhail <br>  Account Number: # 526575_0 <br>  Plan: Start (Start) <br></blockquote><br><br>  Of course, I immediately went to watch the logs (FTP access to this was also closed) and did not find anything there.  The average processor load of about 1-2% of the mentioned IP in access_log is not at all, the scripts have not changed since April. <br><br>  I wrote them the following: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, finally got FTP access and I can see the logs myself. <br><br>  2010-05-18 08:45:01 cpu usage: 1.46% <br>  2010-05-18 09:00:01 cpu usage: 1.46% <br>  2010-05-18 09:15:01 cpu usage: 1.66% <br><br>  IP 188.72.80. *, Which you mention in access_log is completely absent <br><br>  What are you 100% talking about? <br><br>  I repeat my question.  What compensation can I get for a period of inactivity for two weeks after the fire in the data center and for the time that my site was unavailable yesterday and today due to your fault without any reason or justification? <br><br>  Are you willing to voluntarily return the money and compensation when you close your account? <br></blockquote><br><br>  Waiting for an answer. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : UFO moved the topic from ‚ÄúHosting‚Äù to the closed blog ‚ÄúI am indignant‚Äù.  Apparently hosting.ua is no longer hosting. <br>  <b>UPD2</b> : someone actively spits into karma, probably the machinations of disgruntled hosters <br>  <b>UPD3</b> : the answer came <br><br><blockquote>  [05/18/2010 15:37:56] <br>  A: Good afternoon <br><br>  Your account was blocked due to the fact that you had several processes running that were connected to a remote server. <br>  and since yesterday, the server where your hosting was located was hosted by the DDoS, we had to disable it as soon as possible and repel the attack with the reason you were given in the ticket. <br><br>  We bring our apologies for the time inconvenience. <br><br>  As for compensation, the fire, which was the reason for not providing you with a service, happened because of not dependent on us and not through our fault.  Therefore, we do not provide any compensation to our subscribers. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>UPD4</b> : And here are the logs sent, attention <br><blockquote>  [05/18/2010 23:05:19] <br>  A: Look at the hardqueries.log file and see what we are talking about: <br><br>  DATE: 2010-05-18 17:08:54 <br>  PID: 10567% CPU: 46.0%% MEM: 0.5% VSZ: 43588 kB RSS: 22764 STAT: D TIME: 0:00 <br>  SCRIPT: /hsphere/local/home/mikhail/bb.org.ua/index.php <br>  Query String: q = photos / user / 1 / image &amp; page = 2 &amp; limit = 50 <br>  Remote Address: 93.158.148.30 <br>  - DATE: 2010-05-18 17:11:36 <br>  PID: 11946% CPU: 32.0%% MEM: 0.6% VSZ: 44868 kB RSS: 24044 STAT: D TIME: 0:00 <br>  SCRIPT: /hsphere/local/home/mikhail/bb.org.ua/index.php <br>  Query String: q = photos / album / 627 &amp; page = 1 &amp; sort = desc &amp; field = comments &amp; limit = 5 <br>  Remote Address: 93.158.148.30 <br></blockquote><br><br>  and my answer <br><br><blockquote>  Where is the outgoing connection? <br>  Remote Address - the address from which the request was sent <br><br>  &gt; A: Please explain what caused the connection to the server from 188.72.80. * <br>  Other IP appears in logs <br><br>  Here is this link <a href="http://mike.pp.ua/photos/user/1/image%26page%3D2%26limit%3D50">mike.pp.ua/photos/user/1/image&amp;page=2&amp;limit=50</a> generates the first request from what you sent in the letter. <br>  TIME: 0:00 - how long the request took.  Yes, what a split second he ate 50% of the CPU.
