  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feeling Web is still far away, but ChuvstoHabr is already possible ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the previous topic of Feelings and Habr, I raised the question of whether feelings are a characteristic of information that is not inferior to meaning, and we use it in our knowledge every day.  Also in the topic there was a question, what do you feel when looking at this picture ( <a href="http://kazabon.habrahabr.ru/blog/52784/">see previous topic</a> ). <br><br>  As a result of a small study, it turned out: <br><img src="http://www.robotraff.com/img/article/feelings.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Look closely at the result, as you see the feelings that have arisen for the readers, or rather the image keepers, turned out to be completely different.  On the other hand, the given search engine Yandex finds this, only, on request Academic direction.

      <b>And again the question arises, and so what?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  See, with all that this picture (feelings for it) was associated with images different from the words Academic direction, it (the picture) cannot be found in Yandex, by other requests. <br>  At the same time, if we try to look for images by the words: horror, hunger, cognac's desire, nostalgia of the artist, or despondency of a techie (let's call it for simplicity, the Bouquet of Feelings).  We will be able to find (if possible) only some photographs (not pictures), the meaning of which is clear enough for us, but their finding is not related to the capabilities of processing the image content, but only to the names assigned by the authors themselves (or those who posted the picture). <br><br>  From this it follows that the search engines take into account only the name of the sample.  but do not take into account expert assessments because  those simply nowhere to take. <br><br>  Imagine now that we get a sufficient number of sensory characteristics for a given object (Bouquet), now the content of the object becomes less important (in the concept of cognition, as changes in the degree of uncertainty), associations are important.  those.  there will be a kind of convolution of the object in the bouquet of feelings. <br><br>  And how, you ask, it is possible, in spite of Raphael‚Äôs Madonna, to understand what the essence is? <br>  Yes and no. <br>  The question is not in finding all the images, but in finding the most relevant.  No one makes it impossible to see a certain object on your own. <br><br>  You have never been tormented by the thought, you are watching a movie, there is no interesting argument, but this is an old song in a new way ... <br>  Those.  from the standpoint of changing the degree of uncertainty, receiving new information, it is empty ... <br>  those.  no connection between the amount of text, meters of film or length of speech and Informational content ‚Äî no, and why? <br><br>  As I said earlier, we think in images, if we have no such image, we create it (this is the value), and if there is, then we just restore it.  At the same time, without feelings, the description is devoid of global meaning. <br>  How to understand this? <br><br>  See why you are doing this or that work, write a post, a program, dig a garden ... one outcome <b>to experience feelings</b> - satiety, satisfaction, joy, and so on .... and now imagine, remove all this, why do you need work, why money why life?  In the center of everything is the test of feelings, the second aspect of thought - I will consider in another topic. <br><br>  If it were possible to set the Bouquet of feelings, like a search query for relevant texts, and get the result ... and feel ... <br><br>  I will give an example of convolution: Stalin, links, 1945, <br>  Example: personal fear, grief for the loss of loved ones, pride in victory in war <br><br>  Which of these descriptions carries more information in a global sense gives more images? <br><br>  In the past topic, I touched the question of porn, as the only representative of the senses (even if the lowest category), did you wonder how it works?  This feeling is most simply described and understood at the physiological level, in fact, each given Image is curtailed in just one feeling - orgasm, carnal passion (try searching in a search engine). <br><br>  And in the end, why do we need a search for feelings.  As I have already said, images give rise to feelings, respectively by solving the problem of searching for feelings, you can approach the solution of the problem of searching for images, and measuring the amount of information.  And if you go further, it leads to the transfer of feelings at a distance, but that‚Äôs another story ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53128/</a></p>
