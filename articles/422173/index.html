Even after reduction and compression, the data obtained at the LHC in just an hour, by volume, are comparable with the data obtained by Facebook for the whole year. <br><br>  Fortunately, particle physicists do not have to deal with this data manually.  They work in conjunction with a form of artificial intelligence that learns to conduct independent data analysis using machine learning technology.

      ‚ÄúCompared to traditional computer algorithms that we develop to carry out a certain type of analysis, we make the machine learning algorithm so that it decides what analysis to do, which saves us an innumerable man-hours of development and analysis,‚Äù says physicist Alexander Radovich from the College of William and Mary, working in the Nova neutrino experiment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Radovich and a group of researchers outlined the range of current applications and future prospects of MO in particle physics in a summary published in Nature in August 2018. <br><br><h2>  Sifting big data </h2><br>  To process the huge amounts of data obtained in modern experiments, like those that go to the LHC, the researchers use ‚Äútriggers‚Äù, special equipment that works in conjunction with software, deciding in real time which data to leave for analysis and which ones to get rid of. . <br><br>  At the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHCb">LHCb</a> detector in an experiment that can shed light on why there is much more matter than antimatter in the Universe, the MO algorithms make at least 70% of these decisions, said one scientist, Mike Williams from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology mentioned bulletins.  "MO plays a role in almost all aspects of working with data in the experiment, ranging from triggers, and ending with the analysis of the remaining data," - he says. <br><br>  Machine learning demonstrates significant advances in analysis.  At the huge ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC, thanks to which the Higgs particle was discovered, there are millions of sensors, the signals of which need to be brought together in order to get meaningful results. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThese signals make up a complex data space,‚Äù says Michael Kagan of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory of the US Department of Energy, who works on the ATLAS detector, and was involved in generating the report.  "We need to understand the relationship between them in order to draw conclusions - for example, that a certain trace of a particle in the detector was left by an electron, a photon, or something else." <br><br>  MO is also beneficial for experiments with neutrinos.  NOva, which serves <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1">Fermilab</a> , studies how neutrinos move from one species to another when traveling through the Earth.  These <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">neutrino oscillations have the</a> potential to reveal the existence of new types of neutrinos, which, according to some theories, may turn out to be dark matter particles.  NOva detectors look for charged particles that appear when neutrinos collide with material in the detector, and MO algorithms determine them. <br><br><h2>  From machine learning to depth learning </h2><br>  The recent advancement in the field of MO is often referred to as in-depth training, and it promises to further expand the field of application of MO in particle physics.  Under GO, they usually mean the use of neural networks: computer algorithms with architecture inspired by a dense dense network of neurons of the human brain. <br><br>  These neural networks are independently trained in certain analysis tasks using training, when they process test data, for example, from simulations, and receive feedback on the quality of their work. <br><br>  Until recently, the success of neural networks was limited because it was very difficult to train them, said co-author Kazuhiro Terao, a researcher with SLAC, who works in the neutrino experiment MicroBooNE, which studies neutrino oscillations in the framework of the short-term Fermilab program.  The experiment will be part of the future of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Underground_Neutrino_Experiment">Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment</a> .  ‚ÄúThese difficulties limited our ability to work with the simplest neural networks with a depth of a couple of layers,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúThanks to the advancement of algorithms and computing equipment, we now know much more about how to create and train more capable neural networks with hundreds or thousands of layers.‚Äù <br><br>  Many of the breakthroughs in GO are due to the commercial development of technological giants and the explosion of data that they have created over the past two decades.  ‚ÄúFor example, NOva uses a neural network made in the image of the GoogleNet architecture,‚Äù says Radovich.  ‚ÄúIt improved the experiment to a degree that could only be achieved by increasing data collection by 30%.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Fruitful soil for innovation </h2><br>  MO algorithms are becoming more and more complex and finely tuned day by day, opening up unprecedented opportunities for solving problems in the field of particle physics.  Many of the new tasks for which they can be applied are related to computer vision, as Kagan says.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like face recognition, but in particle physics, the properties of images are more abstract and complex than ears or noses.‚Äù <br><br>  The data of some experiments, for example, NOvA and MicroBooNE, can be quite easily converted into real images, and AI can immediately be used to determine their features.  On the other hand, images from the results of experiments at the LHC must first be reconstructed on the basis of an entangled set of data obtained from millions of sensors. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut even if the data does not look like images, we can still apply methods from computer vision if we process the data correctly,‚Äù says Radovich. <br><br>  One of the areas in which such an approach can be very useful is the analysis of jets of particles that appear in large quantities in the LHC.  Jets are narrow jets of particles whose traces are extremely difficult to separate from each other.  Computer vision technology can help you understand these jets. <br><br>  Another new application of GO is the simulation of data on particle physics that predicts, say, what happens in particle collisions at LHC, which can be compared with real data.  This kind of simulation is usually slow and requires incredibly large computing power.  AI could conduct such simulations much faster, which in the end could be a useful addition to traditional research methods. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnly a few years ago, no one could have imagined that deep-seated neural networks could be trained to‚Äú see ‚Äùdata based on random noise,‚Äù says Kagan.  ‚ÄúAlthough this work is still at a very early stage, it already looks quite promising, and will probably help solve data problems in the future.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  The benefits of healthy skepticism </h2><br>  Despite the obvious breakthroughs, MO enthusiasts often encounter skepticism from their colleagues, in particular, since MO algorithms for the most part work like ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù without giving virtually no information about exactly how they came to a certain conclusion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSkepticism is very healthy,‚Äù says William.  ‚ÄúIf we use MOs for triggers, discarding some data, such as on LHCb, then we need to be very careful about this issue and lift the bar very high.‚Äù <br><br>  Consequently, in order to strengthen the position of MO in particle physics, one must constantly try to improve the understanding of how algorithms work and, if possible, make a cross-comparison with real data. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe constantly need to try to understand what the computer algorithm is doing and evaluate its results,‚Äù Terao says.  - This is true for any algorithm, not only MO.  Therefore, skepticism should not slow down progress. ‚Äù <br><br>  Rapid advancement already allows some researchers to dream of what may become possible in the near future.  ‚ÄúToday, we mostly use MOs to look for features in our data that can help us answer some questions,‚Äù Terao says.  ‚ÄúAnd after ten years of time, the MO algorithms may be able to independently raise their own questions and understand that they have discovered a new physics.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422173/</a></p>
