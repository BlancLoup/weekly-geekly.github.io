The event featured major IT market players, such as: Microsoft, Badoo, Mail.Ru Group, Evernote and Softline, and others. Quite a friendly atmosphere, game section, pleasant little things (red caviar, nuts, cookies) and a competition from Badoo, where happy the new iPhone5 was presented to the winner. <br><br>  The most notable events worth noting were the presentations by Leonid Bugaev (Creative Director of Nordic), Sergey Averin (Project Manager of Badoo desktop applications and Artyom Kumpel (CEO and founder of ITmozg).  All three speakers disrupted a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãapplause and told really useful things about both the work in the IT field and the personal development necessary to advance not only their project, but also themselves as a specialist. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76235417%40N08/8063620001/" title="Photo 2 by festaaal, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bac/4ca/5c3/bac4ca5c34cc83633249d1c138e28467.jpg" width="179" height="240" alt="photo 2" align="right"></a>  Master class by Leonid Bugaev ‚ÄúINFLUENCE.  Come with me to the stars: how to involve other people in your Universe of ideas ‚Äùcaused a great interest among the audience.  ‚ÄúIf you dream that someday you will turn the Earth, develop Windows, invent an iPod and launch a rocket into space - all this will happen.  You just need to grow.  Grow in the direction of charisma and the ability to light the hearts and minds of other people. "  Leonid talked about how to increase personal effectiveness and about mobile marketing.

      The rest of the conference was a platform for recruitment by participating companies, which spoke about the areas of their activities and the needs for certain specialists.  Speakers came out, advertised their companies, listed open vacancies and left.  Enough and monotonous. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76235417%40N08/8062874294/" title="Photo 5 by festaaal, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/18c/396/f8b/18c396f8bfa3962e6b4658e6b5284de0.jpg" width="240" height="179" alt="photograph 5" align="left"></a>  The desire to get useful information and learn a bit of the experience of large companies was not fully justified. <br>  It is not clear how the First Channel took part in the event.  A very small stand, even for the level of a small regional company, behind which sat two women buried in monitors.  Home Credit Bank spoke very superficially about its 600 developers. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76235417%40N08/8063620331/" title="Photo 1 by festaaal, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abe/e93/020/abee93020d25cc4ef33a4b95ed35953c.jpg" width="240" height="179" alt="picture 1" align="right"></a>  The boring was the speech of Alexander Rubanova (Director of the Softline development department) with the lecture ‚ÄúDistributed work and the ideal employee‚Äù.  A lot has been said that the company does distributed work among the branches and about the problems of globalization in Softline, but not words about how the company solves these problems.  I would like to note that the most demanded employees for companies with BiteByte are Java, Perl and PHP developers. <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/76235417%40N08/8062873209/" title="Photo 3 by festaaal, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40e/500/f19/40e500f19f83ffb887f4e3d3593f4df0.jpg" width="240" height="179" alt="photo 3" align="left"></a>  The news about the opening of the co-working center on Nagatinskaya, on the squares of which the conference was held, is quite interesting.  Administrators of the center promised 50 jobs by the end of the year.  The monthly cost of one workplace is 12 thousand rubles.  In 2013, it promises an expansion of up to 350 beds, the creation of a hotel for residents, the provision of relevant forums and conferences, as well as assistance in promoting goods and services from residents among potential customers.  And of course, the downward trend. <br><br>  As a result, I think that the invitations say a lot more about the conference than it actually is.  If you find fault, then I have not heard about any startups;  ‚Äúcontests‚Äù meant 1 contest, and the feeling that the winner was determined in advance (there were very ‚Äúrare‚Äù questions about Badoo in the contest that Badoo‚Äôs CEO Andrei Andreev would hardly answer);  and most importantly, few intriguing lectures about IT.  Of course, the creation and development of a new HR platform in the IT field is a huge plus for the entire industry, but the organizers still have a lot of work to improve the quality of such events.  I want to wish them success. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153921/</a></p>
