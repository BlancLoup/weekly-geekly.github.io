Reptilicus service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f4/e18/f41/7f4e18f41ccd5fff412656eb14273587.png"><br><br>  It so happened that some of my friends and relatives are losing quite expensive smartphones with an enviable (or not) regularity.  However, some manage to take expensive smartphones on credit, and lose them in the very first week (this happened quite recently).  Not long ago, a couple of such victims asked me about a program / service that would allow me to find the lost.  To my shame, I couldn‚Äôt immediately find what I‚Äôm looking for - the very phone from HTC, they have a simple search service (calculated more like searching for a phone dropped among a pile of things in my own apartment).  Nevertheless, I decided to find something reliable, functional and domestic.  And I found, and it turned out that I didn‚Äôt need to go far - the required service / application was relatively recently created by a compatriot.  I saw several similar services in the search process, but this one turned out to be the most functional and yes, as it were, native.  It's about <b><a href="http://reptilicus.net/">Reptilicus</a></b> .  In the sequel - a description of the service (two-step: service capabilities + own use cases) ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This service will allow you to find out where the phone is in the event of theft or loss.  But besides this, the application has a large number of functions that can be used not only for your own good, but also for the good of your near and dear ones, as well as for the benefit of your business (if such is revealed :).

      <br>
      Program features <br><br>  The main functions of the application (the functions listed below interested me the most) should include: <br><br>  <i>1. Effective search for the missing phone;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Protection against theft;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Parental control of the child‚Äôs phone;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>4. Storage and protection of personal data;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>5. Corporate performance monitoring.</i> <br><br>  Of course, the very first question that arises is how the service will prevent the theft of the phone or find the lost device?  There are several ways to implement such a function, and in Reptilicus all this is organized in a rather original way. <br><br>  So, in case of loss of the phone, the REPTILICUS intercepts the coordinates of the device location (by base stations, WiFi identifier or GPS), and, consequently, the person with whom the phone is located.  Further, the owner of the device can use this data in its own way.  Well, for example, you can go with them to the police or go on your own to look for the phone (by the way, did anyone search for his stolen device on Habr√©? Share a story).  In addition, up to this point, you can remotely lock the phone, erase personal data from the internal memory and / or SD card.  Remote commands will give you the full opportunity to record the conversations made from the phone (yes, you can turn on the audio recording), read all the SMS, plus take a picture of the attacker or his surroundings using the camera of the phone.  Remember the story of the missing laptop? <br><br>  REPTILICUS is able to intercept absolutely all phone signals, including messages and calls, in parallel to determine the location of the device on the map and display all this data to the rightful owner via SMS or e-mail.  In this case, the attacker has no choice.  He will not be able to sell a quickly blocked phone (and even if he succeeds, you know where to find him), and it will simply be impossible to perform any other actions with the phone without your knowledge.  In addition, the program cannot be detected by a stranger on the phone (who, most likely, does not even suspect if there is anything on the device), since it can be hidden.  But, even if you did not manage to remove the program icon from the menu, no one can enter it, since an individual login and password is required.  As you can see, everything is quite logical and simple.  Plus, there is also a version of the program for rooted Android devices, on which the software will continue to work even after factory reset. <br><br>  Another important feature that will please the parents is the control of the child‚Äôs phone.  The realities of today are such that every schoolchild of any age and even adolescents fall into the zone of potential danger, as soon as they leave the house.  Every parent knows how difficult it is to control oneself and stay calm if the child does not answer the phone for an hour.  And well, if he started playing with friends or turned off the sound.  And if not?  The function of parental control is that you are always aware of where your child is, with whom he is talking and rewriting.  You should not consider this as interference with privacy or surveillance.  However, in my opinion, the line is very fragile, and only the parent / relative himself decides where control ends and tracking / spying begins. <br><br>  As for the kids, there is another option.  If your child is learning poorly, distracting on the phone or talking too much on him, you can partially block the functions of the smartphone for certain periods of time.  That is, while the child is in school, he will not be able to play games on the phone.  If you suspect that the child has fallen into a bad company, a difficult situation or is hiding something unpleasant from you, you can trace with whom and what he is talking and writing to, where he can help the child in time.  Control over the adolescent will also not be superfluous, because at this age many of them go through difficult times and keep all the problems and anxieties in themselves, and they accumulate like a snowball and can lead to the most unexpected consequences. <br><br>  If you do not want the child to know that you are following his actions, then you just need to hide the program, and he will not guess about it.  Thus, you control the baby, and he remains in the confidence that he has his own life, about which you do not know. <br><br>  The REPTILICUS program can also help you to keep your personal data on the server, which reduces the risk of losing them in the event of a phone loss or breakdown.  In addition, REPTILICUS will allow companies and firms to control the work of their employees and their movements during the working day.  All this manufacturers promise every owner REPTILICUS.  Any interested owner of an Android-based phone will be able to test the program for free until July 31, 2013.  Payment is charged only for SMS, which the person sends through the service, whether it is a request, command or report.  In Russia, the cost of one SMS will be 0.05 cents, and in Ukraine - 0.06 cents.  In other countries, the run between prices ranges from 0.09 cents to 0.23 cents.  The only time when you send a message you must have an account with a positive balance, otherwise it will not work (as if everything is logical). <br><br>  Work with the program <br><br>  The application can be downloaded from the official site, or you can find the program by name in the Play Store.  You only need to authorize using your mailbox, and it‚Äôs better if it is Gmail - that‚Äôs where all the necessary information will be sent to requests.  If you, like me, have registered through another mail service, the program will automatically prompt you to log in through GCM, and there will be no problems. <br><br>  Immediately after registering the application on the phone, you enter the settings window.  Here you can select the language, the interval for sending data to the service, set a password, plus implement a couple more functions.  All settings are accompanied by explanations and intuitive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f51/3e4/2b1/f513e42b1ba7dc6b6b4dd51df30a2244.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64b/4cf/d8d/64b4cfd8d14f3229fdeeed1df36f5f51.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0f/180/537/f0f18053758bd0df6f535b63cf5d952f.jpeg"><br><br>  It is controlled by REPTILICUS via SMS commands or from a computer on <a href="http://reptilicus.net/">reptilicus.net</a> .  On the site, you can manage your smartphone for free and receive reports. <br><br>  It is worth paying attention to features such as turning on and off the administrator mode.  In general, explanations are not needed here, because both on the site and in the settings themselves.  Only when it is turned on can you format the phone card, send and receive data, lock the phone, and so on. <br><br>  Once you have set all the settings on your own, you can go to the site.  You get to the main page where you enter your password and login.  After that, your computer screen will look like this.  At the top there is a menu and settings panel, the rest of the space is occupied by an interactive map, where your device whose data has been received is displayed with an orange marker.  Map can be increased.  It is worth saying that when I entered the program I noticed that my phone was marked in the places I had recently visited.  But did not show my current location.  The difference was usually 500-1000 meters, but this is because the location was based on the base stations, GPS and WiFi were turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/631/725/d32/631725d3274628ebf0284d91dd3d7045.jpg"><br><br>  If you include these modules, the location is made with much greater accuracy, up to meters. <br><br>  When you click on the device marker, you get detailed information about the phone model, the serial number of the device, the date and time the device was located at this location on the map, coordinates, travel speed, battery level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/966/1d1/797/9661d17976dbb09afda67fc7f0bc2a1f.jpg"><br><br>  If you have connected several mobile devices to your account, then to select one of them, you need to click on the ‚ÄúDevices‚Äù tab, where you can select the desired phone from the list, for management and control. <br><br>  Detailed instructions can be found in the manual on the site, so I will not talk about everything, but only about what interested me. <br><br>  The most interesting for me is the Reports tab.  On the left you select the device and report type, for example, calls and SMS, then set the time interval.  And the results I was struck.  The system gave me not only calls and SMS, but also the place where I was at that moment, the data of subscribers, the duration of calls and the text of messages.  At the bottom of the reports there is an Export button that allows you to save them in Excel format. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ada/c9c/160/adac9c160ce35cc920e8a4e6b6ac655f.jpg"><br><br>  The Commands tab allows you to send commands to your phone from a browser or via SMS.  As I mentioned, SMS is paid, but this is a great emergency way when there is no access to the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bc/37c/063/6bc37c063002c3150f8ca3073acc0e07.jpg"><br><br>  I wanted to mention that in the reviews I met the messages of people that it was impossible to do something: either take a photo, or block the phone, and so on.  I cannot advise anything here, because everything worked perfectly for me, although I was ready and almost certain that nothing would work out.  By the way, administrators respond to complaints promptly and suggest what and how to do. <br><br>  Immediately I was embarrassed by the situation when I blocked the phone screen, and there was no ‚Äúunlock‚Äù button.  You can enter the phone only if you know the PIN code, so it‚Äôs better to remember it, although emergency numbers are available.  In this case, to remove the block, you need to go into the settings of the phone itself and change it there.  This is a bit inconvenient, but not critical.  (screen from phone) <br><br>  All reports on the execution of commands arrive at least five minutes, depending on how you set the interval. <br><br>  In the Media tab, the user can view the photos taken by the camera of the phone without flash, of course, or listen to audio recordings.  The quality of the photos depends on the capabilities of the camera itself, so many of those I have done are blurred or unclear (as it is clear that if you take a photo while the phone is moving, you can not expect a quality ‚Äúpicture‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44a/c93/700/44ac937008ec7e00fb3c93d7680fb2cb.jpg"><br><br>  Audio works without complaints. <br><br>  In general, this is probably all that I would like to tell about this program / service.  In any case, the program is curious and useful for almost everyone.  Also free.  Perhaps in the future some subscription fee or cost for updates will be charged.  In my opinion, even a not very experienced user of the phone and PC can understand the program.  And I'm not talking about how useful REPTILICUS will be for parents of schoolchildren and teenagers. <br><br>  Now my friends / relatives who lose their smartphones try the service.  While everyone is happy, someone even found the phone, safely forgotten after gatherings, from a friend, although the phone was considered the owner the next day lost (the friend of the phone himself did not see, and did not touch, the owner‚Äôs forgetfulness was the only fault). <br><br>  Here are the links to the program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e47/a8b/a81/e47a8ba818476e1f2df99557ded5f2aa.gif"><br>  <i>This is the regular version.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34f/870/f0f/34f870f0f9334d867521917c6951d139.gif"><br>  <i>Root version</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186046/</a></p>
