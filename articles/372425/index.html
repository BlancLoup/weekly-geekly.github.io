  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Genes waking up after death</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some genes, ‚Äúfalling asleep‚Äù for the whole life immediately after the appearance of the organism into the world, suddenly show activity again immediately after his death, and demonstrate it in a body that does not give any outward signs of life for a few more days. <br><br>  From the point of view of rational thinking and science, all of the above may seem strange and even unnatural, but, as recent studies have shown, many genes actually work in the body even after its transition to a state that is associated in our view with death.  Forensic experts who study the liver or blood of the deceased have known about the similarity of such post-mortem activity for a long time.  Now, researchers from the University of Washington, together with colleagues from the University of Alabama and the Max Planck Society, have set themselves the bold task of recounting all genes that work posthumously, as well as finding out how long they continue to be active.  The research results were published in the journal Science on June 22, 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/451/bd0/bff/451bd0bff3948cefdf15fd90cad61c20.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Genetic activity was measured in the bodies of Danio rerio mice and fish, and the result showed that there are a lot of genes that continue to perform work after death at their level, and more precisely, more than 1000. Initially, scientists suggested that the cessation of activity of such genes could be fixed a few hours later, but the results of the experiment showed something else: hundreds of genes continued to work out their program several days after death.  For mice, this time interval was two days, and for fish - four.  At the same time, surprisingly, the ‚Äúotherworldly‚Äù genetic activity could not be described by a smoothly descending curve or a straight line, some genes showed an increase in activity during the first days, after which, after passing a certain maximum point, they began to ‚Äúlose acceleration‚Äù and eventually fell asleep. to its full stop.  Most likely, such a dynamic was possible due to residual energy and other resources that the cell could still use for RNA synthesis before its full biological death.

      What genes are we talking about in this case?  First of all, they turned out to be genes that suppress biochemical, physiological and molecular stress and stimulate the immune system to make attempts to cope with the problem.  But, if such a result is fully consistent with the assumptions of the researchers, the set of other genes from the number of "overactive" was completely unpredictable.  In the preprint of the article on the pages of <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/11/058305">bioRxiv, the</a> authors of the paper claim that after death, as their studies showed, the genes responsible for embryonic development became more active for some purpose.  To clarify the observed fact, scientists can not yet, building only the assumption that after death in a number of parameters the cell becomes similar to the cell of the embryo.  Another oddity was discovered that completely goes beyond the existing scientific logic: after death, oncogenes that stimulate the development of malignant tumors became more active.  Here, scientists have drawn an obvious parallel between the tendency of oncological diseases in patients who transplanted the organ of a recently deceased person, associating this predisposition with the increased activity of awakened alien oncogenes. <br><br>  If similar manifestations of genetic activity with the participation of similar genes are observed after a person‚Äôs death, the results can be very useful for molecular biologists, transplantologists and forensic doctors who, given the new data on post-mortem genetic activity, could specify the exact time of death. <br><br>  <b>What is the likely reason for this, yet not studied phenomena?</b> <br><br>  What causes the genes that were silent all their life to become more active, even for a short time, the field of death?  Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that in the dying organism the setting of the genetic network naturally collapses: a system of molecular-cell prohibitions and permits, which forced some genes to work, and others to remain silent, simply ceased to work out instructions. <br><br>  In order to support the work of this entire complex machine according to the gene ‚Äúschedule‚Äù, it is necessary to expend energy, but after death the energy that is not replenished and other resources are rapidly melting, so that some genes are given the opportunity to finally ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù themselves. <br><br>  <i><sub><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/undead-genes-come-alive-days-after-life-ends">Science</a></sub></i> <br><hr><br>  That's all with you was Dronk.Ru.
