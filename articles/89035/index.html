  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 conclusions about the effectiveness of the campaign to attract traffic to the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today is exactly 5 months from the day of the start of the advertising campaign of our Internet mall.  The campaign took place in several stages, different and targeted messages, and the volume of advertising investments.  Previously, we did not conduct large-scale online campaigns, and much was new, some results surprised us a lot. <br><br>  We decided to share our observations in the hope that they would be Habra-useful. <br><br>  1. The cheapest clicks are on Yandex and Google (hello, Captain Obvious).  In addition to price, contextual advertising gives a certain threshold of quality - the average duration of a visit is 1-3 minutes, 3-5 viewed per page visit.  The average price per click on Yandex is 8 rubles, on Google it is 5 rubles.

      2. The Rambler is much less effective compared to Yandex and Google (hello again, captain).  We were convinced of this from our own experience.  Received about 5 times less visits than predicted.  However, the average cost per click is also not too high - 9 rubles. <br><br>  3. Media advertising (banners and pop anders) on Odnoklassniki and VKontakte brings a lot of visits, but the cost of these visits is worthless, because the average length of time on the site does not exceed 30 seconds and the percentage of refusals is about 90%.  We will no longer buy such advertising.  We recommended working with applications on VKontakte, but to be honest, I don‚Äôt even want to try after this first experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4. Banner networks did not like at all - few transitions, the high cost of clicks.  The only thing that may be used sometime later is the Soloway network. <br><br>  5. I really liked the effect of placing banners on Ledia.Mail.ru - 11 rubles the average cost per click, 6-7 pages per visit.  The remaining "women's sites" are not pleased - tried Eva.ru, rasprodaga.ru, kleo.ru, cosmo.ru. <br><br>  6. Distribution of press releases gives an illusory large number of publications on the Internet, but it practically does not give traffic.  The conclusion that we made - in order to get traffic, it is more efficient to cooperate with individual Internet publications, in order to ‚Äúbe friends with journalists‚Äù - to periodically send out press releases, without traffic expectations. <br><br>  7. I liked the radio ads.  Efficiency was measured as follows: counted the number of direct requests for the website address on the day the ad was aired and the next day, then the average daily traffic was subtracted the previous week.  Received approximately 1000 clicks from each advertising output (tried City FM and Vesti FM).  Sorry that there were few exits. <br><br>  8. The blogosphere is also good.  The ‚Äúagents‚Äù who worked for us in various forums and blogs brought us several thousand visitors.  For the price, this is comparable to placing banners on inefficient sites, and the quality is much, much better.  The longest sessions on our site and many purchases were born from work in the blogosphere.  In addition, there is the effect of "long tail" - we observed transitions to the site for a month after the end of the work of "agents". <br><br>  9. Twitter - has become one of my favorite toys.  It is pleasant and useful for familiarizing the audience with the brand, but we are just learning how to get traffic from Twitter. <br><br>  10. We keep our blog in LiveJournal (with cross-posting to other blog sites) and see in this the prospect of creating a community around us.  It is not yet possible to receive stable traffic, and in the period of a limited time share - several hundreds of free traffic. <br><br>  <b>Meta output:</b> <br>  Context + banners in mail services + blogosphere + radio = effective advertising campaign </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89035/</a></p>
