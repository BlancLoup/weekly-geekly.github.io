Have you already prepared for a distant journey to London, where is our head office?  In vain.  We understand that time is money.  And next to Russia there is another bastion of reliability and stability not worse than good old England - Finland.  It was there in the environmentally friendly area of ‚Äã‚ÄãHelsinki in the former building of a warehouse of transformers and cables in January 2013 Viikinm√§ki was commissioned - a data center of the TIER 3 level. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/6fc/e95/6806fce9514d8d539191be8a16c886d5.png">

You can and on the plane.  The road from the airport past the picturesque pines and rocks will take 30 minutes and will be pleasantly surprised by the absence of traffic jams.  In the event that you, marveling at the advantages of our data center, opt for it and order to deliver your equipment, your own extensive parking and loading and unloading platform at your service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f06/186/4a5/f061864a59b7d72daa630d696e6594b2.jpg"><br><br>  You see, there is a large transformer substation 100 meters from Viikinm√§ki?  By the way, one of the largest in Helsinki.  And the power to it is suitable even for the four loops of 110-kilovolt power lines.  Reliable power supply - <b>guaranteed</b> . <br><br>  By the way, Finnish electricity prices are among the lowest in Europe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d85/ed8/058/d85ed8058add3aaff4a4f07b62fbf06e.jpg"><br><br>  Fault tolerance and reliability of data center communication is provided by its own fully redundant 10Gbit / s communication channels.  Add to this the independence of providers and get that the full variety of choices is <b>guaranteed</b> . <br><br><h4>  Next, dry numbers: </h4><br><br><ul><li>  Data Center Area: 700 square meters.  meters  Cramped?  No problem: there is the possibility of expansion up to 2900 square meters </li><li>  3 server zones.  Isn't it enough?  No question: we will expand in accordance with customer needs. </li><li>  Load: up to 1 400 kg per rack </li><li>  Current power: 0.95 MW.  Weak?  It‚Äôs not so: it‚Äôs only now, but according to the project it‚Äôs 4.2 MW. </li><li>  Rated power: up to 20 kW </li><li>  Reservation of all systems at least according to the scheme N + 1.  More reliably only in a Swiss bank! </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/415/4a3/6b4/4154a36b4bc5b094e2fb061080cce5c8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22e/c96/dab/22ec96dab78f5161de6b1449ed619b76.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e8/e85/89c/3e8e8589c033d84baacd256870292c02.png"><br><br>  Yes, to the word about security and access control.  They are at the highest level: perimeter fence, video surveillance system on the territory, alarm system, 24-hour security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/102/8d6/f29/1028d6f293c4abebaacf05e8ea8a8ce9.jpg"><br><br>  Access to the data center is available only on personal access cards with a passport.  Without them, you will not go further: the doors, dedicated suites and technical rooms without them will not open. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/e3a/7ad/56ae3a7ad2bbbdfe58edca59a56f03d9.jpg"><br><br>  All racks are locked.  Video archives from external and internal video surveillance cameras are stored for 90 days, in accordance with local legislation.  For especially sophisticated customers, there is the possibility of organizing an individual protection system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57f/702/57d/57f70257ddaea4eeb16d44aa7c3334cb.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, in Finland the legislation in the field of information protection is very strict.  The secrecy of the transfer of written and electronic correspondence or calls, the protection of other confidential information is prescribed in the Constitution.  This is not America and the CIA or even Sweden, where intelligence agencies are officially allowed to listen in on telephone conversations of citizens and view their email.  So, safety and security are <b>guaranteed</b> . <br><br>  TelecityGroup is a recognized energy efficiency fighter, actively promoting environmental initiatives.  The technologies applied in the TelecityGroup data centers demonstrate that energy efficiency is not only fashionable, but also leads to a reduction in operating costs.  For example, the use of free cooling, together with in-line air conditioners and the release of cold corridors, can significantly increase the cooling efficiency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/925/5c8/709/9255c87095bda8cec1930e36c19417b1.jpg"><br><br>  The planned building energy efficiency ratio (PUE) is below 1.3.  In the winter, thanks to free cooling, this value is even lower - up to 1.1. <br>  The data center has been certified for compliance with ISO 27001, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. <br><br><h4>  <b>Cooling system</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  Due to the cool Finnish climate, the potential of free cooling can be increased to 80%.  In the summer months, as a rule, a combination of free cooling and chilling water cooling is used, which ensures maximum use of free cooling depending on the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fe/0b2/fb0/8fe0b2fb007c82321433e10a5dd7f7d3.jpg"><br><br>  Four chillers with a total capacity of 1 MW and redundancy according to the N + 1 scheme are connected to the machine rooms with two independent pipelines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/671/921/67b/67192167bd97d3c3edc3c4b898a2c5f5.jpg"><br><br>  Customer equipment is cooled by air-conditioners in-line, with redundancy at the N + 1 level.  The cooling system is organized with the release of cold corridors.  So we can say that the frosty freshness is <b>guaranteed</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51d/d59/4ed/51dd594edbb783ddd1dd79e5f02e50fe.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Power supply system</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  Electric power to the Viikinm√§ki data center is supplied from one of the largest transformer substations in Helsinki, 100 meters away.  In turn, its electricity supply is provided with as many as four looped 110-kilovolt lines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/038/591/9f4/0385919f4a85a2afca9e2b2a86e0f14d.png"><br><br>  The power supply system is located inside the data center and is represented by 2 transformers, 3 UPS systems and 3 diesel generators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ed/804/aef/3ed804aefcaed8f8d13170224c7c53cd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/356/da8/5e4/356da85e4c03a014952d266790c9a9bc.jpg"><br><br>  The UPS system is reserved under the N + 1 scheme and has a total capacity of 1.1 MVA.  The modular design of the containers provides for the possibility of further expansion and facilitates servicing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56b/0ab/6d0/56b0ab6d00620da48fb3c3a9b5188317.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1d/ada/733/a1dada733c6c297dcdebd7ab95f3c656.jpg"><br><br>  In an almost incredible case of interruptions in the main power supply system, the data center is equipped with 3 diesel generators with a total capacity of 2 MW and a redundancy level of N + 1.  There will be enough fuel for at least 10 hours without refueling at 100% load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcc/2c2/051/dcc2c20511930c74f850e9e4261a7686.jpg"><br><br>  Each rack is connected to two independent power distribution units (PDUs) supporting a combination of feeders 16 or 32 amperes, single-phase (230V) or three-phase (400V).  On each bus and each feeder energy meters are installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/338/1e8/d33/3381e8d334e6e35c02f5263b35ae5e51.jpg"><br><br>  Management System Electrical Management System (EMS) for electrical networks allows you to track all system components, ranging from feeders to the power supplied to the rack.  Be sure the light in the data center is <b>guaranteed</b> . <br><br><h4>  <b>Fire extinguishing system</b> <b><br></b> </h4><br>  For every "fire" case in the literal sense of the word, the data center is equipped with a highly sensitive Stratos smoke and fire detection system that will immediately detect smoke particles and heat sources in the air.  The alarm signal is instantly given to the on-call data center shift, thereby excluding the possibility of a fire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f4/11a/d6f/9f411ad6f8183fd0a5a35541dc5db949.png"><br><br>  If, however, the inevitable happened, then the fire extinguishing system is activated.  It uses environmentally safe gas Novec 1230, which does not harm so much the equipment, and people in the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd7/b1c/c7c/fd7b1cc7ca109c4a007566e384c5ac61.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/257/f93/d0c257f93487f3be37051560a576a9ce.jpg"><br><br>  Equipment condition monitoring, temperature sensors, fire detectors and door alarms are constantly monitored with the help of a modern building management system (BMS Building Management System). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/696/3f6/b656963f692448e904560c000e25a35e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Telecommunications</b> </h4><br><br>  Internet connections with bandwidths ranging from 100 Mbit / s to 1 Gbit / s are available to customers thanks to their own reserved 10 Gbit / s network.  In addition to the Internet channels, it is possible to organize dark optical fiber and systems using WDM technology in cooperation with leading telecom operators in Finland. <br>  Two separated fiber optic cable entries guarantee the fault tolerance of the fiber optic network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f03/1e7/957/f031e7957653c2901be5877326179560.jpg"><br><br>  Neutrality with regard to telecom operators provides the freedom of choice of provider for customers.  Such operators as DNA, Elisa, TeliaSonera and TDC are present at the site.  Future plans, connection to other leading Finnish providers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f5/1aa/171/7f51aa171535c0a89c1700b075912405.png"><br><br>  2 traffic exchange nodes (Meet-me-rooms) are located next to the server zones and allow you to join any providers and partners through cross-connects. <br><br><h4>  Thanks for attention! <br></h4><br>  I wanted to walk through the data center <b>Viikinm√§ki is</b> no longer a virtual, but a real tour - <a href="http://www.anpdm.com/public/run-form.aspx%3FId%3D444350407548435C4071%26EventId%3D4443504B7642465E4371%26SessionId%3D434759407946465C4571">please contact</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212523/</a></p>
