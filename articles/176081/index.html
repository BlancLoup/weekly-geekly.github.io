  <section class="page js-page"><h1>eBay plans to ‚Äúflood the planet‚Äù by 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In early March, eBay management announced that it plans in the coming years to pay special attention to progress in developing countries and by 2015 to receive a quarter of orders from them.  Meanwhile, 30,000 purchases on eBay.com are already being made daily in Russia, and eBay‚Äôs turnover on the Russian market is comparable to the turnover of the largest online stores of Runet.  Under the cut - a little more entertaining statistics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b62/9c6/030/b629c60308e9beb621a5c67a65fbb206.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Even the frantic growth dynamics of the Russian e-commerce market is not able to withstand the growth rate of eBay popularity: Russian online retail growth in 2012 was 27%, and eBay turnover in Russia grew by more than 1.5 times (54%) and amounted to 400 million dollars.

      These turnovers are comparable to those of the best Russian online stores - even the turnout of the entire holding of Ozon.ru is only 19% behind the American auction. <br><br>  And at the end of March, Vladimir Dolgov (head of the Russian representative office of eBay, and in the past - the head of the Russian representative office of Google) announced at a press conference the launch of the Russian version of ebay.com instead of ebay.ru.  Russians have access to navigation and the description of goods in Russian, the opportunity to pay for the purchase with a bank card of one of the IPU.  Also for the Russians, there is a Russian-speaking support service and a customer protection program. <br><br>  However, as the statistics show, in the previous version of the site the Russians were quite well oriented - over the past year, the eBay customer base in Russia grew by 75%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81d/355/e53/81d355e539619cf97d0ea56c1fc56d21.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The company's active policy in Russia correlates with eBay global plans: a substantial increase in revenue is expected by 2015 - up to 23.5 billion USD compared to 14 billion USD in 2012.  The number of active users of eBay.com by the end of 2015 could increase to 200 million versus 112 million by the end of 2012, said eBay President Devin Venig.  At the same time, David Markus, president of PayPal, promised to double the volume of payments passing through the payment system over the same period compared to 2012, which amounted to 145 billion USD. <br><br>  And in Russia in 2013 another event is expected, which will allow Russian online merchants to sell their goods on eBay.com.  The PayPal payment system, through which all non-cash payments pass through eBay.com, will receive the status of a non-profit banking structure in Russia. <br><br>  Wendy Jones, the company's vice president in charge of international development and cross-border trade, noted that Russia remains one of the priority markets for eBay.  He recalled that eBay has a local representative office in Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Dolgov, who previously headed the Russian representative office of Google, and a Russian-language website.  The next step for the company will be the development of logistics and adaptation to market fragmentation, Jones added. <br><br>  And yet - on the subject of the conquest of the Russian market - at the same recent press conference, Vladimir Dolgov announced the start date of the first global advertising company eBay on Russian television - April 8.  On this day, it was planned to start broadcasting an advertising video on television in the capital and major cities of Russia, which makes it possible to predict a jump in the growth of the online store's customer audience in the coming months. <br><br>  We haven‚Äôt seen the video yet on TV :) but the first video, which consists entirely of products purchased on ebay.com, is already available on YouTube. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWUZuvdjllI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700258&amp;usg=ALkJrhhufSIDm9CCWTggg-huwYiaidcuMQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176081/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176081/</a></p>
