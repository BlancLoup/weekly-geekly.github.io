      Here I sit, in the field of view of an exercise bike, for which the last time my daughter sat a month ago.  There is a mess on the table: bags, a camera, all sorts of printouts in a chaotic manner, a paper Bender (from Futurama), a bunch of wires.  In short - a mess. <br><br>  And it seems that everything suits - all interfering things are shifted away from the hands and nothing interferes.  But there is some sort of ‚Äúsediment‚Äù or something.  Remove the table reluctance, and where to put it all.  Do not shift everything to another place.  Although the table a month ago was clean! <br><br>  Actually, I invent a lot of things not to get out.  I come up with a bunch of reasons to not sit behind the exercise bike.  A lot of reasons not to go to the pool in the morning.  A bunch of reasons to leave it at that. <br><br>  And now, after cleaning, I wondered if our mood about surrounding objects was transferred to our work (of course, not only work)?  It turns out yes!  And how.  Forcing yourself to do something useful for at least yourself, you are already somehow looking at everything around you. <br><br>  Here who did not like to get out in the childhood?  Remember, when it is almost the finish of cleaning (general), a bunch of trash is thrown away, a lot of little-needed is placed on the shelves in the pantry.  Everywhere even a semblance of cleanliness and order.  There is no need now to look for a hammer or pliers all over the apartment, because now you know what and where lies. <br><br>  Even now I come to our closet with such a longing (in it I do a full cleaning once a year, partially once every 3 months).  But starting to throw out all unnecessary, for some reason there is some kind of satisfaction from the process, sort of like getting rid of the old with a swing for the purchase of any buns in the future.  After all, you feel much better when you buy a thing that has never existed.  It's almost the same here.  Getting rid of the old, you get something new in return (whether it is a sale or a scrap). <br><br>  And with the work the same thing, at least the semblance of order (sorry for the oil and oil) in general, helps to build order in the head. <br><br>  And now let's go back to our work.  Many programmers have a stop valve.  They were given to him by the heads of the project " <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">hopeless in advance</a> " (in the sense of a production time of more than a year).  And our programmer "suffers" over it day and night.  In any case, we are tired of such projects, for various reasons, of course, but nevertheless almost every employee needs a change. <br><br>  And if the programmer works, moreover, in / dev / null?  In the sense of almost every project is not claimed in the end.  Yes, alas, there is.  Just imagine what a mess will be in his head.  Because for many the ‚Äúproject completion‚Äù is associated with the launch, and if there was no launch, then the feeling of incompleteness will remain. <br><br>  Actually, we return to the same.  The order should be in the head first.  Due to this, there will be a minimum of concentration.  Well, the subsequent - creating a more encouraging atmosphere for yourself and creating a really good environment for not only work, but also everyday life. <br><br>  And by the way, the principle of work to life and back here works.  Problems at work - there will be problems at home.  Problems at home - will be at work. <br><br>  Let's say I have a friend.  I would not say that he is a bummer, but a person just ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt close‚Äù 5 projects.  Moreover, the same analogy goes with his studies and personal life.  He, of course, slobs, but indifferent scoring has nothing to do with it.  "If a person says he is a pig, he will grumble."  This familiar suffers from "incompleteness" in work and in school all the same awry.  Now he is starting to correct himself - he is finishing everything he has thrown, all that is not allowed to finish. <br><br>  <i>There are such people.</i>  <i>I call them "beginners."</i>  <i>These people are able to start any business at the highest possible level.</i>  <i>But to bring the matter to at least the middle is a problem.</i>  <i>And soft methods in this case can not cope, only to break and force.</i>  <i>In general, a person should be given to feel the buzz from the completed case.</i> <br><br>  Now let's talk about the fight against this ailment. <br><br>  In the first reasons, of course, there is ‚Äúlayered‚Äù laziness.  I missed it once, the second time did not work and so on.  Accordingly, what to do: <br>  1. I would start with the little things.  Tidy up again on the table. <br>  2. Help at home relatives. <br>  3. Make yourself stick to your schedule.  And at least charging for 1-2 minutes you have to force yourself to do.  MANDATORY! <br>  4. Make a list of unfinished business and begin to carry it out.  (We have 3 lists at home. For life, for a year and for the near future. Most interestingly, we still put ticks in it) <br>  5. Believe in yourself.  It will come when you realize that you like a lot of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù just to like it and you are not looking for a reason to shirk <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/593/74b/ace/59374bace7b7555bc06282a1a9f8a41b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_0003.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b29/38f/6e8/b2938f6e893e39893d3c0203f871ab5b.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_0002.JPG"><br>  In general readers, changing lives for the better!
