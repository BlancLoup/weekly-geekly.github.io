  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Compilation of gaming industry news from March 8 to Sunday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FromSoftware">FromSoftware</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gaming/news/software-would-love-have-crack-battle-royale/">announced the possibility of</a> creating his battle royal. </p><br><blockquote>  Games of this genre are certainly good, and we are interested in how they work.  But if we take up the creation of the ‚Äúroyal battle‚Äù, we will do it in our own way. </blockquote><p>  These comrades have established themselves as their own, special view of the world - what else can we expect from them?  The only thing that causes concern is that they traditionally had not had a lot of multiplayer. </p><br><p>  I remind you, <a href="https://www.sekirothegame.com/ru/">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> is scheduled to be released on March 22. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><p>  Epic Store <a href="https://dtf.ru/flood/42431-nebolshoy-plyus-v-karmu-epic-store">returned money</a> for the game, which a couple of months later began to cost 3 times cheaper.  Have you seen anywhere else a similar attraction of unprecedented generosity? </p><br><hr><br><p>  Activision Blizzard fired the hell out of people.  It became known that out of a total 8 percent reduction in staff, 209 people were in the US division of Blizzard. </p><br><p>  You can go <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/job-news/68664/exclusive-here-are-where-209-jobs-were-cut-in-blizzards-us-business/">to this article</a> , bypass the link graph and independently calculate.  But I thought a little for you. </p><br><p>  <em>Admins</em> (well, IT department) - 41 employees. <br>  <em>Marketing</em> in Irvine and Austin - 29 employees. </p><br><p>  All kinds of <em>copywriters</em> : <br>  North America Publishing Division, copywriting, that is - 12 employees. <br>  Blizzard Latin America Publishing - 10 employees. <br>  Some chthonic garbage Global Insights (this is also a copywriter?) - 15 employees. <br>  All together - 37 people. </p><br><p>  <em>Echarki</em> in Irvine and Austin - 18 employees. </p><br><p>  <em>Testers in</em> Irvine and New York - 11 employees. <br>  <em>Web and mobile workers</em> - 9 employees. <br>  <em>Finance</em> in Irvine - 8 employees. <br>  <em>Team Battle.net</em> - 5 employees. <br>  <em>Customer service</em> - 2 employees. </p><br><hr><br><p>  13 people <a href="https://uploadvr.com/valve-employees-vr-2019/">will be fired from Valve</a> from the VR department.  The company didn‚Äôt really want to shout about it at all angles, but the loggers cracked before them.  They found out that Net Brown had escaped from the company, working on Steam compatibility with external GPUs, who had worked in the VR department since 2015 and Rob Rydberg. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Hideami Itsuno, the Devil May Cry franchise <a href="https://www.maniac.de/m-games/die-neue-m-games-306/">game director, said</a> that they didn‚Äôt target the Nintendo Switch because they didn‚Äôt have devkits. </p><br><p>  It looks like a very weak excuse - they don‚Äôt look like people who can with impunity be able to block access to girls.  Exiting DMC is a big event and a big holiday, ten years with DMC4, it doesn't happen every day. </p><br><p>  But then, it seems, he merges a more important reason - they are just waiting for the results of sales of Draong's Dogma, to which they relate.  If all goes well, DMC5 will appear on the Switch. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Anthem (multiplayer action RPG), which was released on February 22, became the best-selling game in <a href="https://blog.eu.playstation.com/2019/03/08/anthem-was-the-best-selling-game-on-playstation-store-in-february/">both the European</a> <a href="https://blog.us.playstation.com/2019/03/08/playstation-store-februarys-top-downloads-4/">and American</a> PlayStation Store in February. </p><br><p>  At the same time, the rating of Anthem on Metacritic is very sad, which leads to a bunch of philosophical questions - why do people buy top games that they consider to be disgusting? </p><br><hr><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2-/ct/nl/2-ctnlhqlmrz9af7ddf_lssencu.jpeg">  Valve terminated the contract with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B4,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4">Richard Garfield</a> amid the failures of Artifact and his studio. </p><br><p>  Richard Garfield - Magic: The Gathering, Battletech, Netrunner, and much more besides Artifact.  This Dad is a living god from the dark era of game technology. <br clear="all"></p><br><p>  On the other hand, Artifact is really bad.  Now there are only about 500 players online (not "five hundred thousand", but just five hundred). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/tk/v0/yrtkv05jqfsdoualycvitokhuei.png"></p><br><p>  Of the shortcomings of Artifact, players often mention the anal model of monetization and the lack of entertainment when viewed on streaming platforms. </p><br><hr><br><p>  In the western version of the Devil May Cry 5 for PS4, censoring the nude with shining rays. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ve/xr/m4/vexrm48fvjgs1h-5noepnwsjiwy.jpeg"></p><br><p>  On the Xbox, PC and European versions under curling - this indecency is absent.  One joy - such a censored screenshot can now be published on Habr√© :-) </p><br><hr><br><p>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18257385/epic-fortnite-lawsuit-ribeiro-2milly-dance-emote-lawsuits-withdrawn-pause-registration">The Verge says</a> that Epic could not stop the lawsuits against him, but only paused. </p><br><p>  Claims have been put forward by pop culture figures like Backpack Kid, Orange Shirt Kid, 2 Milly, BlocBoy JB, and so on.  They all accuse Epikov of stealing their trademark movements. </p><br><p>  According to the fanciful laws of the United States, copyright does not apply to whole dances, but you can <br>  copy individual movements. </p><br><p>  The problem is that the Epic achieved a deferment solely by some bureaucratic means, nothing is over.  Just gave a little time - for what?  We learn. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Died technology 3D Vision.  She allowed to watch three-dimensional stereoscopic image at home. </p><br><p>  Technology appeared in 2008.  Requires special glasses and an LCD monitor with a refresh rate of 120 Hz.  The glasses are equipped with alternately closed ‚Äúcurtains‚Äù, 3D Vision divides the original image into two - for the left and right eyes. </p><br><p>  The problem is that everyone scored on this technology, and as a result - artifacts in games, headache, additional costs.  It turned out that the game is not worth the candle either for content producers or for consumers. </p><br><hr><br><p>  On the DTF recently rarely write original articles about the gaming industry.  And then came the whole two in a row. </p><br><p>  First, this is an <a href="https://dtf.ru/gameindustry/42155-ot-guilty-gear-do-dragon-ball-30-letnyaya-istoriya-arc-system-works">awesome story of Arc System Works</a> .  For those who do not know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_System_Works">ASW</a> are the developers of Dragon Ball, Atlus's Persona 4 Arena, Guilty Gear, BlazBlue and so on, who started their work in 1988 - very few people survive in our world! </p><br><p>  The second article is from Iliya Makarov, <a href="https://dtf.ru/gameindustry/41489-otnosheniya-zhurnalistov-razrabotchikov-i-auditorii-statya-video">Relationships of Journalists, Developers, and Audiences</a> .  It is also duplicated by videocast on YouTube - simple and home-dictated on a mobile phone. </p><br><p>  In short, the content.  He recalls the reaction to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D320%26v%3DrTHu1pZLy7I">words of Albert Zhiltsov</a> in the podcast ‚ÄúAfter Titers‚Äù - everyone cursed, but very few claimed that what was said was not true. </p><br><p>  The article notes the difference between a ‚Äújournalist‚Äù and a ‚Äúblogger-streamer‚Äù.  Igrozhur is something sublime.  Leads even the omnipresent Logvinov with his division into the "upper" and "lower" Internet.  In addition, the factor of corruption of journalists is emphasized (if you often write negative - you will stop receiving orders). </p><br><p>  The "embargo on criticism" (as Iliya Makarov puts it) on the part of the developers can greatly prevent the audience from seeing the real picture and this can lead to negative consequences: <br>  for example, to create a game that the audience is not waiting for. </p><br><p>  What does Elijah want: </p><br><ul><li>  From journalists, he wants new approaches to coverage; </li><li>  From developers - to be tolerant of criticism; </li><li>  From the community - to be more friendly to the two previous castes; </li></ul><br><p>  Of course, it seems to me that this is a complete bullshit and utopia :-) The very formulation of the problem is such that everyone is on opposite sides of the barricades.  Conflict is part of the task.  This is a system of checks and balances, which should not be weakened.  If you weaken it, everything will very quickly go straight to hell. </p><br><hr><br><p>  Something like this.  For today everything, maybe in a couple of days, still scrape something.  Initially, this article appeared as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpKiVfyPTOF0">vidos</a> transcript <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpKiVfyPTOF0">on YouTube</a> , and there is a desire to continue to write them further. </p></div>
