  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to study correctly?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to touch upon the monumental theme of self-development and pack it into a small article.  I understand that on several pages it will not be possible to open the topic completely, but I will try to give some impetus to productive thinking in the right direction. <br><br>  To do this, I will consider how to understand what to learn at all, and how to find the most effective and suitable ways of learning? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>1. What to learn?</b> </h4><br>  So it turns out that we are constantly evolving.  In one day, you can read a book about the Russian-Japanese war, try out a new pasta recipe and practice using smarty templates.  But however vast our development possibilities would not be, they will never be limitless.  It's like in a store: you go to the supermarket, having a limited amount of cash.  You can afford different products in different combinations, but you can not buy the entire store. <br>  The same with knowledge.  You will never know everything!  Therefore, your development plan should be carefully thought out. <br><br><h5>  1.1 To study only what is interesting </h5><br>  Let's try evidence from the opposite.  Recall what happened at the institute on the least favorite subjects (I had this engineering graphics): <br>  - these items are ‚Äúgiven‚Äù worse than others <br>  - you have to look for some artificial substitutes for natural motivation <br>  - training is always postponed to the last moment, most often - on sleepless session nights

      <br>
      And you hardly want to dedicate your life to unpleasant activities, so this knowledge will simply not be useful to you. <br><br>  What is the conclusion?  Run from the knowledge, the acquisition of which does not give you pleasure.  Look for those that bring joy to the contrary. <br><br><h5>  1.2 Study only what you can apply </h5><br>  The applicability of knowledge may be different.  Something can be applied at work, something at home, something in a favorite hobby.  But what happens to knowledge that cannot be applied? <br><br>  They are "gathering dust" without bringing either joy or benefit.  And gradually, like everything that we do not use regularly, are forgotten. <br><br>  Of course, there is nothing wrong with that.  Just remember that your resource is limited?  Are you ready to give up other, useful and pleasant knowledge, for the sake of dust? <br><br><h4>  <b>2. For whom to study?</b> </h4><br>  The question sounds weird, huh?  Of course, we learn for ourselves! <br>  ... <br>  <b>Right?</b> <br><br><h5>  2.1 "Parents said ..." </h5><br>  Higher education, we often choose not themselves.  Sometimes we don't need it.  Sometimes we want something else.  But many do not want to conflict with their parents, and go on about. <br>  What does this lead to?  Who is the winner?  Parents who made the child unhappy?  Hardly. <br>  Look for yourself, do not go on about! <br><br><h5>  2.2 Corporate development plan </h5><br>  Many companies are introducing the practice of creating a corporate development plan for their employees.  This is a noble occupation, for which they need to shake hands, say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and generally thank you in every way, but ... Sometimes this process is not done in the best way for an employee.  The management is interested in the efficient use of resources by the company, and not at your advantage as an employee. <br>  Companies are most often profitable for employees to work in one position for a long time, achieving maximum efficiency in performing the same tasks.  If you want it too - wellcome. <br><br>  But if you want growth - then you need to develop and gain knowledge for the <i>expected</i> position, and not to improve skills in the <i>current</i> . <br><br><h5>  2.3 To argue! </h5><br>  Recently, at work, a colleague, not unreasonably, noted my low qualification on one issue that was not related to my field of activity.  My first reaction was: damn it!  It is urgent to find out!  At the tire, I also recently felt awkward: how is it that I do not know what is fraught with improper departure discs! <br>  The first reaction in such situations is to find out!  To be no worse, to know no less ... But ‚Äúreaction‚Äù is not a choice!  To study something in order to ‚Äúprove‚Äù to someone is not serious and meaningless. <br><br>  Do you really need it? <br><br><h4>  <b>3. How to study?</b> </h4><br>  Training can be theoretical and practical, emotional and analytical, and the interface can be books, coaches, trainings ... <br>  Suppose there is a goal: ‚ÄúI want to master C ++ in 21 days‚Äù :) This is interesting (like) and useful (fits into our career growth). <br>  What to do next?  How to study? <br><br><h5>  3.1 Choosing practice instead of theory </h5><br>  I can‚Äôt even imagine how to study the Russian-Japanese war in practice, but C ++ theory is beyond the control, that‚Äôs for sure. <br>  You can read a book, articles, but what will it give?  For effective acquisition of skills, you need to set a specific task for yourself, the solution of which will be compatible with obtaining a new skill. <br>  For example, it is now full of books and articles on management.  So what?  Most people read them, analyze them, and ... and that's it!  What's the point? <br>  You should see how I mapped my mom's motivators and how I conducted friends situational interviews!  The result is experience, skill, but not useless and irretrievably forgotten knowledge! <br><br><h5>  3.2 Emotions or analysis? </h5><br>  According to the theory, people are divided into those who learn through emotions and those who learn through the analysis of information.  The first is the ‚Äúcharge‚Äù, the impetus for action and cognition in practice.  The second is important deep amount of information for analysis, a kind of stack, after filling which a person becomes ready for new actions. <br><br>  If you look closely, the authors of the books, leading the trainings, are also divided into these categories.  Someone charges more, and someone overwhelms with information.  ‚ÄúEmotional‚Äù students die of boredom over books full of theory and in lectures overloaded with information.  And ‚Äúanalyzers‚Äù consider the generalized statements of ‚Äúemotional‚Äù trainers and authors of books to be idle talkers. <br><br>  Choose the right teachers, trainers, books.  According to their descriptions, it is usually very easy to understand what type the author is. <br><br><h5>  3.3 "What will I do next week" </h5><br>  Well, you have read an interesting article, a cool book, or have visited a training course you like.  In the reviews, you wrote "Wow, thank you, it was super!".  What's next?  What exactly is super? <br><br>  If nothing - then spent money and time were thrown to the wind.  Make a list of specific actions that you will take in the next 7 days to consolidate the information received. <br><br><h4>  And finally - analysis of complex cases </h4><br><br> <code>   ***,     .  ?</code> <br>  ‚ÄúForcing‚Äù yourself to do anything is the worst sin.  If this happens, then the new information is uninteresting, useless, or you need it <i>not for you</i> .  About all this - see above :) <br><br> <code>   !  ?</code> <br>  Really interesting?  Honestly honestly interesting? <br>  Cool, do not worry and catch the buzz from a life full of discoveries :) <br><br> <code>    .   - ?</code> <br>  In short, yes, definitely.  Our world does not stand still, it moves, turns, develops.  But you can not force yourself, yeah.  What to do?  Search what is interesting!  What do you like, what fascinates, what motivates.  Happy are those who found it.  And, by the way, judging by my observations, there are a lot of such people lately :) <br><br> <code>  ,  ""?</code> <br>  It depends on global goals, depending on the context in which it speaks of ‚Äúbenefits‚Äù.  Everything is relatively simple with a career, thanks to the creators of job search sites!  In vacancies, one can always trace the correlations between skills and wages. <br>  Want to move to Europe?  It is clear what languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill be useful.  Well and further on the list :) ‚ÄúBenefit‚Äù is not absolute - it depends on specific life goals. <br><br>  And the most important question: <br> <code>  -   ?</code> <br>  NEVER choose between benefit and pleasure.  Studying the structure of a paraglider is as useful for a paraglider as it is to master a new accounting program for an accountant.  Our life is meant for pleasure, and whatever you do, you will always find something that gives pleasure. <br><br>  If you choose between benefit and pleasure, then something is wrong somewhere! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118903/</a></p>
