Even nicer when this development is supported by mutually beneficial financial relationships. <br><br>  Today we will talk about our agents and how to become one of them and why it is profitable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The development of an international taxi service, in any case, requires the presence of official representatives in cities and regions, because  Each city has its own peculiarities that can be taken into account and applied only by the people who live there directly.

      Therefore, we decided to implement the Agency scheme of cooperation, thanks to which in any city of Russia (soon Ukraine) it is possible to become an Agent of the company and with the full support of the company to develop our service getting all the profit except for the commission. <br><br><h4>  <b>Who is the Agent and what does he do?</b> </h4><br>  The agent is the official representative of our company in any city.  The essence of the agent‚Äôs work is that he develops our service in his region, controls the quality of work, and can even personally accept payments from drivers for completed requests. <br><br>  Taksolet provides the agent with all the tools for work - the company's website, advertising materials, web interfaces and much more.  Those.  The agent acts with the full technical support of the company, being a kind of conductor of new technologies in his city. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/123/839/64d/12383964ddec8a87c39752278ee7ddf3.png" alt="Taxi Agent Tax Account"><br><br>  From a technical and ideological point of view, only one person in each city can become an agent.  So in essence, this is franchising. <br><br><h4>  <b>Why is it profitable?</b> </h4><br>  The agent can organize not only the unique technology of our company (calling a taxi without the dispatcher's participation), but also additional branches of the service - a regular telephone taxi, SMS taxi, ICQ taxi thanks to the Dispatcher application.  And having a website with detailed instructions, explanations and a description of all aspects of the company's activities will greatly facilitate the task of the Agent and he will not have to worry about a detailed explanation of the scheme of work for customers and drivers. <br><br>  The very same niche taxi service is always in demand and relevant.  With new technologies it is easy to get leadership and significant profits.  The agent scheme is designed to provide the agent with as much productive activity as possible and as little routine and technical as possible. <br><br>  Our service can be rolled in for free by <a href="http://taxolet.ru/partner.php%3Fagent">ordering a test drive</a> .  There you will also find more detailed information about such a scheme of cooperation. <br><br>  <i>PS Despite the very recent opening of our taxi service, some areas and cities are already occupied by Agents, therefore we advise interested parties not to miss this chance and in advance to be interested in the possibility of buying a territory before planning joint activities with us.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93517/</a></p>
