In front of computer?  What time they walk?  (Now, probably, many of you thought: ‚ÄúPha, well, then I‚Äôm a good father / mother (I‚Äôll be a good father / mother).

    <h2>  Fuuu!  how could you think such a thing! </h2><br>  Shame on you! <br>  So, the brain shook? <br>  Moving on. <br>  So.  How many experiments are needed to get positive statistics?  Two?  How many people can go out of step if the rest keep up?  Could one person be right, and everyone else is wrong? <br>  So, in the way of work I talked with many teachers from different universities in Moscow.  They agree on one thing.  Despite the fact that you just said above that your children ... (everything is fine, yes?), The level of high school graduates decreases every year. <br><h2>  Yes, you bros, teachers have always said that, and they will speak. </h2><br>  Sure?  give an example.  Last year, in the physics exam, two groups totaling 45 people received 5 twos.  In this 40. Great! <br>  Guys, in 6 years - these people will build factories, newspapers and steamboats.  Are you scared?  Oil talk ends?  Are you sure that this is the worst? <br>  Okay.  One more question. <br><h2>  Can you talk? </h2><br>  What about communication?  I will not bore you with long thoughts, then I think you will agree - the ‚Äúsoul of the company‚Äù is more the exception than the rule. <br><h2>  - So, I'm confused, what are you talking about? </h2><br>  About life, as always.  The fact that we, the information community living in the post-industrial era, think too much about the fact that under FF and IE paddings work a little differently, we do not think about whether our children can communicate. <br><h2>  Communication is the key to understanding! </h2><br>  And finally, it's time to tell you for the sake of what all this was written.  In order to tell you that there are still people who are not indifferent to the future of our country.  These are people who instead of after work / institute (and often after institute, and then work) are engaged with your children.  And yes, if a slightly stout man in a yellow-green (red, blue) tie in your yard is playing with children - this is not mentally retarded, and not a maniac.  This is a person who is trying to teach your child to communicate.  This is a person who, after 10 years at the workplace of your son, will tell someone about him: ‚ÄúLord, how lucky I am that I was introduced to such a fantastic creative, cheerful person.‚Äù  These are people thanks to which your child will not fall into bad company. <br>  Such youth organizations are throughout Moscow.  Relax and smile.  While among us there are such people the Matrix will not be! <br>  Actually that's all.  The goal is achieved.  You are thinking, and perhaps you have learned something new for yourself. <br><br><h2>  Final question: </h2>  ‚ÄúWhat moves these people, and why doesn't it move you?‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://uenota.ru/zv/1.jpg"><br><img src="http://uenota.ru/zv/2.jpg"><br><img src="http://uenota.ru/zv/3.jpg"><br><img src="http://uenota.ru/zv/4.jpg"><br><h3>  Ps </h3><br>  Formalities: I believe that this post is related to this resource, because  Mostly thinking people gathered here. <br>  And secondly, I have a request.  I ask for help with the design for the site of one of these organizations. <br>  Well, now everything.  Minus =) <br>  <em>upd2: specifically when I have time in the <a href="http://zel-wave.ru/">Green Wave</a> .</em>  <em>About her and the conversation in the request.</em>  <em>But once again.</em>  <em>I did not let under the specifics.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28105/</a></p>
