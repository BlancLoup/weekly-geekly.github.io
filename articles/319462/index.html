If you believe the feedback from participants - we managed to achieve the goal: <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>In general, I liked everything very much.</i>  <i>Before that, I was 2 years ago and I will say that the conference has changed just at times.</i>  <i>There were many interesting reports, there were no tedious retellings and promotions of their products.</i>  "

      However, we do not stop at what has been achieved and continue the Mobius series.  This time the conference will take place <b>on April 21-22, 2017 in St. Petersburg</b> .  Yes, this time the conference will be held within two days: last time, participants often complained about excessively high loading by the end for, now due to the two-day format and reports will be more, and it will be easier to perceive them.  The program will include not only the best speakers of past Mobius, but also new faces.  In addition, a new format of reports and communication with speakers is planned. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Speakers 2017</b> </h2><br>  The program, as before, will be devoted not only to development for iOS / Android, but also universal and cross-platform solutions.  Already, we have confirmation from 10 speakers, let's see who it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/e90/4bf/ef8e904bfc7c4f0ea020af7b9656e134.jpg"><br><br>  So, promising newcomers: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Fernando Cejas, SoundCloud</b> with a <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/talks/hidden-mysteries-behind-big-mobile-codebases/">report</a> on combating the formation of legacy code, technical debt and the constant need for refactoring in growing mobile projects. </li><li>  <b>Marcin Krzy≈ºanowski, PSPDFKit GmbH</b> , the author of the Natalie, CryptoSwift and ObjectivePGP iOS libraries, talks about Swift syntax in terms of how the compiler optimizes the source code and which solutions allow you to gain extra milliseconds in runtime. </li><li>  <b>Alexander Efremenkov, Yandex.Taxi</b> , will continue the topic of mobile performance, but already under Android.  Everyone understands that benchmarks and ‚Äúbig‚Äù Java profilers are not always suitable for analyzing mobile solutions due to the specific features of the Dalvik / ART virtual machine.  As part of the report, Alexander will tell you how to get the necessary metrics and what tools we need to conduct various types of performance experiments; </li><li>  <b>Alexey Buzdin, GDG Riga</b> , will talk about cross-platform ‚Äúmobile‚Äù DevOps: CI, test automation, backup, auto-heat in AppStore / Google Play and much more. </li></ul><br>  Of the veterans, the leaders of the previous conference chart confirmed their participation: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Igor Kashkut</b> from the London office of <b>Badoo</b> plans to prepare a new report on the organization of the development process for iOS; </li><li>  <b>Egor Tolstoy, Rambler &amp; Co</b> , will tell about neural networks on the client for iOS; </li><li>  <b>Denis Neklyudov, M2B</b> , the first Android GDE in Russia, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXmkLj5Vl8fw">keynover of the</a> last year is now determined with the theme; </li><li>  <b>Matvey Malkov</b> , a Scala-developer for Android from <b>Nexters</b> , one of the best speakers of past conferences ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9Y6EZPxXxYk">you can evaluate it yourself</a> ), will continue the series of reports on Rx and talk about how all this stuff works under the hood; </li><li>  <b>Aleksendr Korshak, MERA</b> , who last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdRFOTMyVokg">talked about Cardboard solutions in medicine,</a> will continue to develop the theme of mobile VR.  This time, dig in the guts of technology and delve into mathematics; </li><li>  <b>Kirill Popov, Odnoklassniki,</b> will tell you about the new approach to downloading (upload, not download!) Pictures on Android, which should significantly reduce the time of uploading pictures to the server. </li></ul><br><br>  By the way, in the near future I will prepare a ranking of the best reports of the last conference - stay tuned! <br><br><h2>  <b>Call for papers</b> </h2><br>  If you want to talk about something hardcore and new Russian community of mobile development - <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/callforpapers/"><b>give us a report</b></a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de7/a32/d9d/de7a32d9d40842469853ceaae1341135.jpg"><br><br>  If you have already spoken somewhere and have met a warm welcome from the organizers and the audience, show us the videotape of the report - this will significantly speed up the decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of performance.  Class performances in the past is one of the important criteria that traditionally guides our program committee. <br><br>  Beginners should not be afraid either - we will definitely communicate with everyone.  Moreover, if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the technique of performance, timings and presentation, in general, to prepare the perfect report with you, for this we even started a special section in the blog. <br><br><h2>  <b>Community Talks</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5da/7fa/ae7/5da7faae7fc04077bc596bc1c153d0fd.jpg"><br><br>  However, if you want to share experience, or your own work, and there is not enough information for a full report, we plan to make a special platform where any participant of the conference will be able to make short presentations. <br><br>  Minimum moderation and almost complete freedom of speech - all this will be available to those who pre-register Community Talk at the conference.  We have not yet decided on this format, so we would very much like to hear your opinion: <b>Should we introduce such a format?</b>  <b>Do you need such an opportunity to communicate the participants?</b>  <b>Would you personally prepare such a short talk to discuss pressing issues with fellow developers?</b> <br><br>  Share your thoughts on this topic with us in the comments or email our program director: <a href="http://program%40mobiusconf.com/">program@mobiusconf.com</a> . <br><br><h2>  <b>Discussion areas</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/cca/609/d33cca60961f4445af0112232e1c8c8e.jpg"><br><br>  Another key change is the appearance of discussion zones in the conference program.  Surely, you know the feeling when you raise your hand to ask a question, and the presenter suddenly announces: ‚ÄúThere is time for one question‚Äù - and of course, the choice does not fall on you, but during the break the speaker is hiding behind the doors of the speaker rooms. <br><br>  It is the discussion zones that answer the question ‚Äúwhy go to conferences, when you can learn everything on the Internet‚Äù.  It's simple: to personally ask your personal, specific question.  Well, on Mobius 2017 all the conditions are created for this: in long breaks, specially trained volunteers will lead the speaker into the allocated space with an illustration board, sitting places and the opportunity to grab a cup of coffee.  Now not a single question will drown in timing. <br><br><h2>  <b>check in</b> </h2><br>  As usual, the conference program can be monitored <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/"><b>on the conference website</b></a> , where you can also follow the list of confirmed speakers (to be honest, there is already something to see). <br><br>  PPS If suddenly after reading the post you wanted to register - before February 1, we have an <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/registration/"><b>early registration</b></a> .  And for those who are far from St. Petersburg, there is an online broadcast. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319462/</a></p>
