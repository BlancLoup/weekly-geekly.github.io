Google has already decided this question - <b>users will pay</b> .  At least in terms of subscriptions.  Such a conclusion can be drawn from the letter that came to me this morning: <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  In 2017, the Russian VAT legislation will be changed.  As a result, the total <b>value of your subscriptions may increase by 18%</b> .  The new price will be available after January 1, 2017, when subscriptions will be renewed.  If you do not want to renew any subscription, simply cancel it.

      Regards, Google Play Support Team <br><br>  Google Ireland Ltd, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. <br></blockquote><br>  I would like to draw attention to the word "may", probably because there is no mechanism regulating the collection of VAT from foreign companies, but this will not happen - our lawmakers will try to think of something. <br><br>  We are waiting for letters related to other Google services, as well as similar letters from Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and maybe even from AliExpress. <br><br>  A similar letter about VAT on Google Drive: <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  We‚Äôll inform you that starting January 1, 2017, your value added tax will be included in your invoices for using Google Drive.  In accordance with the law adopted by the State Duma of the Russian Federation, from January 1, 2017, 18% VAT will apply to all Google Drive clients who are residents of Russia. <br>  Google cannot provide tax advice to you and recommends that you contact your tax advisor with all questions regarding this change. <br>  This service notice is sent to all Russian Google Drive subscribers.  It does not affect the status and activity of your account. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Google Drive Team. </blockquote><br>  So, if someone had doubts that foreign companies would not pay VAT on the new Russian laws, one can no longer doubt. <br><br>  UPD: the initiative becomes relevant: " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282928/">AKIT offers to block the websites of foreign stores that do not pay VAT in Russia"</a> <br><br>  UPD: A similar letter came from AWS <blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/537/7ae/b7d/5377aeb7d66ce5a04cfbd66cc3fe5f80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Welcome to Amazon Web Services, <br><br>  We inform you that from January 1, 2017, a new procedure for imposing VAT on services in electronic form, according to which Amazon Web Services, Inc. will come into force, will take effect.  (‚ÄúAWS‚Äù) and AWS Marketplace there will be an obligation to charge VAT at a rate of 18% for services rendered to Russian customers who are not registered as legal entities or individual entrepreneurs, that is, do not have the corresponding basic state registration number (‚ÄúOGRN‚Äù) or main state registration number of an individual entrepreneur (‚ÄúOGRNP‚Äù). <br><br>  If you are in Russia and are a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur, please read the following information carefully: <br><br>  To confirm your status as a legal entity or individual entrepreneur in order to apply the existing billing procedure without making changes, AWS needs to obtain information about your OGRN or OGRN and check its compliance with official data. <br><br>  As early as possible, but not later than December 31, 2016, please enter information about your OGRN (13-digit number) or OGRNP (15-digit number) on our taxation page ( <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home">https: //console.aws.amazon. com / billing / home # / tax</a> ) for each of your AWS accounts.  In case of a successful update, you will receive a confirmation message from us. <br><br>  If you do not provide information about your OGRN or OGRNP by December 31, 2016, AWS will be forced to charge VAT at the rate of 18% for the relevant services.  You will always have the opportunity to enter information after the specified date (via the link above).  In this case, after making changes and receiving our confirmation message, you can send a request for a refund of VAT paid after January 1, 2017 regarding each account for which relevant information has been submitted to customer support via the link: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/support">https: / /aws.amazon.com/support</a> . <br><br>  You can find additional information regarding the new procedure for imposing VAT on services in electronic form on the website of the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation: <a href="http://lkio.gnivc.ru/en">http://lkio.gnivc.ru/en</a> (English version) or <a href="http://lkio.gnivc.ru/ru">http://lkio.gnivc.ru/ru</a> (Russian version). <br><br>  Thank you for using Amazon Web Services. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  Amazon Web Services, Inc. </blockquote><br><br>  UPD: Despite the fact that in the comments they said many times that: ‚ÄúEveryone loves money, the buyer will pay VAT‚Äù - not everybody does this! <blockquote>  Game Tax: <a href="http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/pc-browser/1/nds/">Will World of Tanks Prices Change</a> ? <br><br>  Dear players! <br><br>  From January 1, 2017 in the Russian Federation a new value-added tax (VAT) of 18% is introduced on all in-game payments. <br><br>  <b>We made a decision to meet the players and fully take the VAT on ourselves.</b>  From January 1, there will be no change in prices for gaming assets in World of Tanks. <br><br>  Next, to the new victories in World of Tanks by the old rules! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400073/</a></p>
