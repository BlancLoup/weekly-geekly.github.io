These are 10 really very cool projects.  I am absolutely convinced that these are the strongest 10 projects in the entire time that we are making such ratings.  More and say nothing.  Under the cat you will find 10 excellent startups, some of which you will definitely like.  In the meantime, voting for the title of the best startup May will begin very soon.

      <a href="http://getconfiture.com/">ru.getconfiture.com</a> Confiture is a tool for online backup of your data.  Now you no longer need to keep at home a pile of dvd-disks, or a portable drive.  You can just go to the confiture and save important data easily and conveniently.  They will remain available for you both in months and in years. <br><br>  <strong>Yury Zayats (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúConfiture is almost the only online backup system released for the Russian-speaking market.</em>  <em>For some regions, the cost of unlimited access is still too high, but this situation is constantly improving.</em>  <em>We believe that after a while online backup will become the mainstream for home users.</em>  <em>The internal implementation of the server allows you to easily change the billing system and file storage server, replacing them, for example, with similar provider systems. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  9th place </h4><br> <a href="http://gamer.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef2/780/1a5/ef27801a53677a1f607a05c475959e3d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://gamer.ru/">gamer.ru</a> Gamer.ru is a new video game project that announces itself as the main hit of the season and the best Runet website about games.  The site itself is also made in a truly gaming style.  Habra-like model is diluted with additional features of the game plan.  For example, by filling your reputation, you will be able to ban other users, intercept their nicknames, change their profiles.  Real pirates of the 21st century. <br><br><h4>  8th place </h4><br> <a href="http://elama.ru/"><br><img src="http://elama.ru/bitrix/templates/new_elama/images/logo.gif"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://elama.ru/">elama.ru Elama</a> is a platform with the help of which you can easily plan, launch and manage contextual advertising companies on the Internet.  The project is similar to the recently launched blonde.ru.  It can be seen that the niche is very fertile if, at once, several such ambitious projects are launched in it within a short time. <br><br>  <strong>Alexey Dovzhikov (Service Director):</strong> <em>‚ÄúAccording to our estimates, eLama saves the advertiser more than five times the time to prepare and launch an advertising campaign.</em>  <em>Moreover, once a prepared campaign can be saved as a template and in the future it can be used an unlimited number of times to launch other campaigns - for example, in other regions or at other sites.</em>  <em>For advertising agencies, it is possible to create a file in Excel for Yandex.Direct, XML for Runner.</em>  <em>In the future, it is planned to implement unified consolidated reporting and rate management.</em> <br><br><h4>  7th place </h4><br> <a href="http://lab.integrator.in/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d80/cbb/5c6/d80cbb5c6b24dab1e7fc5627b9cd1a30.jpg"></a> <br>  <a href="http://lab.integrator.in/">lab.integrator.in</a> Laboratory is a set of <a href="http://lab.integrator.in/">sample</a> commercials that are very easy to adapt to the needs of each individual client, while their cost is prohibitively low compared to similar clips made at production studios.  Of course, such a clip cannot count on Cannes Lions, but it is quite acceptable for cable television. <br><br>  <strong>Yevgeny Volk (Author of the idea):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe whole trick is that the cost of the work is set not by the heads of production studios, but by the designers themselves, without any extra charges, but the video itself is sold several times, just in different clothes.</em>  <em>The source code in the catalog can be changed beyond recognition, specifying when placing the order: what text and logo should be inserted in place of the current one.</em>  <em>Upon payment, within 24 hours, the customer receives an exclusive commercial of air quality directly to the e-mail "</em> <br><br><h4>  6th place </h4><br> <a href="http://holywars.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af7/48a/cd0/af748acd0e257e524f75388a726ac36e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://holywars.ru/">holywars.ru</a> Holywars.ru is a project that allows you to conduct full-scale "holy wars" on the most burning topics.  Each standoff is represented on two sides, for example, ‚ÄúAMD vs.  Intel ‚Äù- you choose one of them simply by voting for it, or by commenting on your choice.  From other similar projects, holywars.ru has a well-thought-out structure and a pleasant design. <br><br>  <strong>8cinq (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúWe have a special structure, somewhat reminiscent of the lovehate project, but much more advanced specifically for the needs of disputes.</em>  <em>Flood itself feels very bad on our site, and to see a complete picture of the dispute of 2 sides is an unrealized opportunity.</em>  <em>Do not be afraid to be mined by a more numerous side, which is why some disputes do not even want to arrange.</em>  <em>Each side turns the ratings only within its group, punishing a minus for stupidity or flooding in its ranks or plus good arguments.</em>  <em>Holivars have a logical conclusion when after a certain amount of time the winner is announced. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  5th place </h4><br> <a href="http://simplacms.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edf/7ff/f2c/edf7fff2c805c8d22b7b2e692a865340.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://simplacms.ru/">simplacms.ru</a> SimplaCMS is a convenient, attractive and functional online store management system.  The interface of the control panel is very convenient and intuitive.  Perhaps the only disadvantage of this control system is its cost - $ 400. <br><br>  <strong>Denis Pikusov (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúSince I was originally involved in creating stores for end customers, I constantly had to advise them on working with the store.</em>  <em>With each new version of the control system, I took into account all the difficulties faced by the end user.</em>  <em>Thus, I came to the conclusion of what is now, namely, the simplest and most convenient control system interface.</em>  <em>The main difference from analogs is the ease of use of the script.</em>  <em>The rest are chasing a lot of unnecessary functions - and I rely on convenience. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  4th place </h4><br> <a href="http://roomix.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21e/8a9/19f/21e8a919fbc81ec0b705abfd163c0b94.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://roomix.ru/">roomix.ru</a> Rumix is ‚Äã‚Äãa web application that allows you to fully plan / reschedule your room / apartment.  You can completely change its dimensions, proportions, location of doors, windows, furniture.  It is possible to view the made room on top and in 3D.  The monetization of the project is successful - having chosen a sofa or a chest of drawers, and having found a place for him in his newly planned apartment, you can immediately purchase it by clicking on the link from his personal card to the store's website. <br><br>  <strong>Ilya Lagutin (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúIn a virtual room you can place three-dimensional models of cabinets, sofas, chairs from the catalog, paint the walls, lay carpets, hang your portrait on the wall and get a list with all the goods and contacts of stores in one click.</em>  <em>We focus on the availability of a simple user interface and easy navigation in the application, so we try to make it so that every housewife or office plankton can use it. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  3rd place </h4><br> <a href="http://iii.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/dc0/888/aa7dc088896ef2b965af008c9f91c68b.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://iii.ru/">iii.ru</a> The project called "Garage" realizes the old blue dream of mankind - the creation of artificial intelligence.  Now each user of this project can create a character for himself, adjust his character and appearance, and begin to gradually teach correct and full communication, and also use him as a contact person on his projects or blogs. <br><br>  <strong>Shick (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe idea is that anyone can create their own character (we call them info), who will communicate with the interlocutor in natural language and say adequate things.</em>  <em>Character and appearance are customizable.</em>  <em>Infa can be taught using conversation logs, adjust its reactions to the interlocutor's actions, change the behavior of the linguistic "engine" by substituting your answer options for pre-installed topics (the engine "guesses" about the topic of conversation) "</em> <br><br><h4>  2nd place </h4><br> <a href="http://tinza.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f98/f04/121/f98f041213e0eb007b4ab74938b9e35c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://tinza.ru/">tinza.ru</a> Tinza.ru is a youth social network, for the promotion of which a real American start-up development specialist was invited.  The topic of children's and youth social networks is now in great demand in RuNet.  At Tinza, you can chat with youth idols, participate in duels to reveal the very same thing, exchange flirtings and in a couple of minutes make a high-quality photojob. <br><br><h4>  1 place </h4><br> <a href="http://taba.ru/"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/195/39c/d9f/19539cd9f932a4ee1d0807b49727fa62.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://taba.ru/">taba.ru</a> Our April champion is Russia's first full-fledged designer of social networks, an analogue of Western Ning.com.  Now everyone can create a social network and make it quite simple.  The project has already created hundreds of local social networks.  Themes are the most diverse: football, real estate, astronomy, cars, and so on. <br><br>  <strong>Antig (Developer):</strong> <em>‚ÄúThe main feature of the designer is the extremely simple and intuitive management of its network, which allows even a user who does not know all the subtleties of website development (programming, layout, hosting, etc.) to make a full-fledged website.</em>  <em>Another difference from classic social networks is openness.</em>  <em>To view any network, registration by default is not needed, which allows you to freely go through the project.</em>  <em>Soon the network creator will be able to regulate access to his social network by setting up the system of rights.</em>  <em>The future belongs to thematic social networks that will unite like-minded people and help them find friends by their interests.</em>  <em>This is the task that the project performs. ‚Äù</em> <br><br><h4>  Other startups of April: </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://auto-calc.ru/">auto-calc.ru</a> Control fuel consumption and its savings <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://avtoprodaga.com.ua/">avtoprodaga.com.ua</a> Resource for car enthusiasts <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://diofant.ru/">diofant.ru</a> Tasks for mind training <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://flamap.ru/">flamap.ru</a> The first visual social network of a new generation <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://flatta.ru/">flatta.ru</a> Constructor for creating real estate portals <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://fotoklassniki.ru/">fotoklassniki.ru</a> Creating avatars for the largest social network <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://fuzzle-cms.ru/">fuzzle-cms.ru</a> Simple <a href="http://fuzzle-cms.ru/">content</a> management system <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://jobba.ru/">gematanzen.com</a> Quickly create gif-animation <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://jobba.ru/">jobba.ru</a> Job Search 2.0. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://kvartirakrasivo.ru/">kvartirakrasivo.ru</a> Internet exchange on repair of apartments and offices <br>  ‚Ä¢ loudcloud.fm Platform for combining novice musicians <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://mp3cut.ru/">mp3cut.ru Cutting service</a> mp3 online <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://mydots.ru/">mydots.ru</a> Building the optimal route in two capitals <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://myhandmade.ru/">myhandmade.ru</a> Online catalog of handmade things <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://navystavke.ru/">navystavke.ru</a> The first online exhibition on IT <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://notea.ru/">notea.ru</a> Organized notes <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://personalpict.com/">personalpict.com</a> Gallery of your personal images <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://promdex.com/">promdex.com Trading</a> and search engine <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://seumka.ru/">seumka.ru Position</a> verification service in search engines <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://sparlike.ru/">sparlike.ru</a> Website for online disputes <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://turbobit.ru/">turbobit.ru</a> Create your file sharing service! <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://twitterlinks.ru/">twitterlinks.ru</a> The most popular links in the Russian twitter community <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://ubot.ru/">ubot.ru</a> Automatically voiced text news <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://vokrug.tv/">vokrug.tv</a> Social network dedicated to television <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://want2say.com/">want2say.com</a> Information about any person, company or event </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60128/</a></p>
