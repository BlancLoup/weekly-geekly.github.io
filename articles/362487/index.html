But, succumbing to hysteria on smart gadgets and seeing the price, he took the Lemon W100 ‚Äúsmart scales‚Äù of a certain Chinese manufacturer Mecare for <strong>69 yuan</strong> (at the current rate it is about <strong>$ 12</strong> ).  Yes, I live in Beijing, I ordered it on the spot, so prices for other countries will differ: a quick search on Aliexpress showed prices around <strong>$ 65</strong> with delivery. <br><br>  The manufacturer claimed the following plain functionality: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Weight display on LCD display with backlight;</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Sending data via Bluetooth to iOS / Android smartphone;</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Keeping graphics on your smartphone.</strong> </li></ul><br>  To be honest, when ordering, I was plagued by vague doubts: what kind of scales would I get for $ 12?  So‚Ä¶

On the front side - a schematic depiction of scales and the manufacturer's logo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0eb/603/7b0/0eb6037b094d48ae9ede8bc7d3202a62.jpg"><br>  On the back side, the application interface is also schematically drawn, and the technical characteristics are listed below (in Chinese): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e78/cc6/173/e78cc6173fa948798fed4aa23fe8b704.jpg"><br><br>  Inside, the scales are packaged in a fun pack with an inscription ‰Ω†Â•Ω ("Hello!"): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0af/3d2/7b9/0af3d27b9dce46bd9fb05591fa1d4cf3.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <strong>Appearance</strong> </h3><br><br>  The gadget is sold in three colors - yellow (actually, "lemon"), green ("lime") or white: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/d64/486/b8cd64486cdf49bbb67ab1e447247b8f.jpg"><br><br><br><br>  I chose white: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/f6b/d93/a66f6bd93bd546a0b67709825a03c48b.jpg"><br><br>  The upper platform is completely glass, with the product logo at the bottom: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/912/649/8df91264982e488eb1c217919cc05e57.jpg"><br><br>  Glass 7mm thick: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65b/cb1/383/65bcb1383c824eba8b60666d310f4046.jpg"><br><br>  In the upper part there is a backlit LCD-display (the backlight is off in the photo): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4de/c37/395/4dec3739592d420890caeb4cadb1316d.jpg"><br><br>  And here - included: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b0/8e2/3b7/3b08e23b72de48a2ab12a28d3c0b72c6.jpg"><br>  The lower half of the device is made of rough plastic with four rubberized legs and a battery compartment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/63c/599/ff163c5990934cee901d33c64af9cecb.jpg"><br><br>  The batteries were already included, it only remained to remove the cap: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/280/9e1/ab7/2809e1ab7b75457e9488466132cb2b7b.jpg"><br><br>  There are no control limits for the scales.  Inclusion is carried out automatically when you get up on them.  After ~ 10 seconds, the scales fall asleep. <br><br>  The appearance and build quality was generally pleasantly surprised.  I did not expect to meet normal plastic without burrs and real glass in such a budget Chinese device.  Minimalistic design pleases the eye. <br><blockquote>  <em>I will add that the manufacturer has a more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù model - Lemon 2, which does not even have a display, and the scales can only be used when there is a smartphone.</em>  <em>It seemed to me that the display is still needed, so the choice fell on the first version.</em> </blockquote><br>  Also included were two brochures: instructions and warranty card (completely in Chinese). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be3/d7f/734/be3d7f7340674e61abf48b3ac602eb06.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cea/121/65a/cea12165af714bed9916e9317ebe9e19.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4af/7ac/21f/4af7ac21f9634114829f0f8e3b1341bc.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <strong>application</strong> </h3><br>  Of course, the scales can be used without a smartphone - just stand on them and see the weight.  But after all 21 century in the yard!  :-) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eeb/306/aa4/eeb306aa45b34618b748023d2d12784f.jpg"><br><br>  To download the application, it is proposed to scan the QR code from the phone.  He leads here on this page: <a href="http://lemonapp.mecare.cn/">lemonapp.mecare.cn</a> .  For known <a title="about which services in China are blocking" href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ifree/blog/238379/">reasons</a> , the <strong>Android application</strong> is not on Google Play, but simply lies in the form of an <strong>APK</strong> .  For <strong>iOS, the</strong> application is posted in the <strong>official AppStore</strong> . <br><blockquote>  Unpleasant moment: the official link for Android is version <strong>1.1</strong> .  This application refused to receive data from the scales.  I use the <a title="review of this phone" href="http://blog.wtigga.com/hongmi-about/">Hongmi Note 4G</a> phone with a built-in market from <b>Xiaomi</b> , which offered an update to <strong>version 1.4.2</strong> - and now everything has worked on it as it should be.  It is surprising that the manufacturer took care of updating on a third-party market, forgetting about its own page. </blockquote><br>  The application is called " <strong>Â∞èËõÆËÖ∞</strong> ", which means " <strong>slender waist</strong> ".  The literal name is missing, but the interface is translated into English quite bearable. <br><br>  First you need to create a profile - enter the name, email address, password, as well as the date of birth and height.  After that, we have three main cranes available: ‚ÄúMe‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù and ‚ÄúMore‚Äù.  Their purpose is not entirely obvious, so I will briefly describe what is what. <br><br>  <strong>"Me"</strong> shows your current weight and tells you how healthy it is (body mass index - BMI) <br><br>  To measure the weight, simply turn on the application, open this screen and stand on the scales.  Within a couple of seconds, the current weight will be displayed on the smartphone screen, and after about 5 seconds it will be recorded in the measurement history.  Yes, no need to synchronize or pair the device: apparently, the data is sent via Bluetooth in the open form. <br><br>  In the upper left part there is a button "+", which hides under the items "Input" (input weight manually), and "Manager" - managing records of weight.  There you can view all measurement records by date, and delete any of them, if necessary. <br><br>  In the center - the nickname of the current user.  On one device, you can create accounts for other family members. <br><br>  In the upper right corner of the button with the image of the graph, you can see the history of the change in their weight over time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c25/3e5/01f/c253e501f0db4110bb9ec164cea8c1a6.jpg"><br><br>  " <strong>Discover</strong> " hides under itself ... the alarm-reminder settings that it is time to weigh in.  Yes, not obvious. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúMore‚Äù</strong> - setting up an account, changing the password, checking for updates.  There is a Device Management item, but, apparently, it works only with a more advanced version of the scales. <br><br>  The iPhone application is completely similar. <br><br>  There are no social functions in the application, except for binding to the <strong>QQ Health Center</strong> , about this in the section below. <br><br><h3>  <strong>Bugs</strong> </h3><br>  You should not have expected the perfect product for $ 12 :-) In the Android application, sometimes there is no weight recording in history.  Not yet revealed what it is connected with. <br><br>  Another application bug is the impossibility of binding to the <strong>QQ Health center</strong> .  Binding simply does not happen, and so far it is not possible to share your dietary achievements with friends.  Of course, for foreign users this loss is not great, because very few people use QQ in their smartphones outside of China. <br><br><h3>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> </h3><br><br>  I still have positive impressions.  Extremely budget device in good technical performance, with a simple application, and not overloaded with a bunch of functions.  Good old scales, which now have a drop of hi-tech.  I think this is a good option for those who just started to surround themselves with smart technology, and decided to lose weight. <br><br>  <strong>Pros</strong> : <br><ul><li>  Nice design of the device, quality materials </li><li>  Normal design of the application, albeit with minor flaws </li><li>  Price </li></ul><br>  <strong>Cons</strong> : <br><ul><li>  Over the stability of the application should work </li><li>  Quite a large measurement error (see characteristics at the beginning) </li><li>  No hope of support for Google Fit / Apple Healthbook, etc. </li><li>  Overpriced at dealers. </li></ul><br>  What do you think about having smart scales at home? <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362487/</a></p>
