Together with Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, they founded Intel in 1968.  In 1979, he became president, and in 1987, he became executive director.  From 1997 to 2005, Andy Grove served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company.  During all this time, he was one of the most influential figures in the technology industry, the author of books, including the famous "Only the Paranoid Survive" (1999). <br><br>  Andrew Grove has become a real hero for many young IT entrepreneurs, for example, Steve Jobs turned to him for advice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Andrew Grove was born in Budapest on September 2, 1936, into a Jewish family.  He and his parents managed to survive the fascist occupation and avoid Soviet repression, writes Intel, and in 1956 he emigrated to Austria, and then to the USA.

      Andrew settled with his uncle in the Bronx, entered the local college at the Faculty of Chemical Technology, worked as a waiter. <br><br>  Then he went to study at the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a doctorate degree in 1963, worked for Fairchild Semiconductor, becoming a director of research and development.  Fairchild Semiconductor is one of the first silicon semiconductor manufacturers.  Gordon Moore worked in the same company (director of R &amp; D, head of the npn transistor development group) and Robert Noyce (on his initiative in Fairchild Semiconductor created a semiconductor development department). <br><br>  In 1968, colleagues left the company and founded their own company called Intel.  In subsequent years, Andrew Grove played a key role in changing the Intel business model from memory chip production to microprocessor manufacturing.  He created the world famous brand "Intel".  During the leadership of Andrew Grove, the company released numerous models of popular chips, including the 386 and Pentium processors, and the annual income increased from $ 1.9 billion to $ 26 billion. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt combined the scientist‚Äôs analytical approach and the ability to engage others in an honest and deep conversation that supported Intel‚Äôs steady success as the personal computer market, the Internet, and Silicon Valley were on the rise,‚Äù said current chairman Andy Bryant about his colleague. <br><br>  In the 90s, Andrew Grove was diagnosed with prostate cancer.  In an article in the magazine Fortune in 1996, he explained why he chose unconventional treatment, which eventually turned out to be successful.  But with Parkinson's disease could not cope. <br><br>  Andrew Grove was married for 58 years, with two children and eight grandchildren left. <br><br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/712073584194105344">Tim Cook</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca">Mark Andressen</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/712125877593645056">Satya Nadella</a> and many others brought their condolences to relatives and friends of Andrew Grove. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392001/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392001/</a></p>
