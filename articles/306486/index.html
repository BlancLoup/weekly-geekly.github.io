Each of them has its pros and cons, different functionalities, paid or free versions, as well as mobile or only desktop options. <br><br>  This article will discuss the two most famous and popular applications: Radmin and TeamViewer.  Their advantages and disadvantages in benchmarking with remote connection to the remote desktop (RDP) from Microsoft. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First consider the program Remote Administrator (Radmin) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/96e/6f1/3b996e6f11c344e4997f1dd89c1fe8c6.jpg">

      <i>Radmin was created by Famatech, which is one of the world leaders in the development of remote computer control systems.</i>  <i>Since its founding in 1999, they have been developing some of the best solutions in their field, which are widely used to provide technical support for users, administer corporate networks, work remotely and solve many other tasks.</i> <br><br>  Distinctive features of the program is ease of use at great opportunities and not a high price. <br>  The main advantages that allow you to use it with maximum opportunities for you are: <br><ul><li>  Unsurpassed speed with DirectScreenTransfer technology </li><li>  The highest level of security standard AES </li><li>  Hardware-based remote management with Intel AMT technology </li><li>  Full compatibility with Windows </li><li>  Compatible with Wine (remote access from machines running Linux) </li><li>  Secure file sharing with the "resume" function </li><li>  Multiple simultaneous connections support </li><li>  Bilateral work with the clipboard with Unicode support </li><li>  Password guess protection with a delay after five consecutive failed attempts </li><li>  Record in the log file of the user name and DNS decryption of his address </li><li>  Easy to use </li><li>  A 30-day trial version is available. </li><li>  Benefits for registered users: <br><ul><li>  Perpetual license </li><li>  Full technical support by e-mail </li></ul></li></ul><br>  However, the program has only a test free version with a 30-day period, after which you will need to refuse from further use or purchase it.  At the same time, Famatech provides flexible licensing options.  Only the server part of the program - Radmin Server is subject to licensing, the client part - Radmin Viewer is distributed free of charge and can be used on any number of computers. <br><br>  The next of the most popular remote access solutions, we looked at the TeamViewer program. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/862/0b4/7b9/8620b47b9634491d8b31ef4a05557c96.png"><br><br>  <i>TeamViewer is familiar to many of you as an application for creating conferences, team access and collaboration.</i>  <i>In its activities, the development company specializes in technologies that use cloud resources to provide online support and real-time interaction around the world.</i> <br><br>  The program has gained great popularity and the number of downloads, according to the information on their website, has reached 1 billion! <br>  The main advantages that have led to such high rates are as follows: <ul><li>  Multiplatform </li><li>  High security </li><li>  High performance </li><li>  Hidden view of the desktop, file transfer, organization of chat and interactive conferences for 25 people </li><li>  Video recording of work with a remote desktop, making screenshots </li><li>  Availability of portable and mobile version </li><li>  Wake-on-lan </li><li>  Synchronous clipboard </li><li>  Teamwork </li><li>  Connect to mobile devices </li><li>  Linux systems without a graphical user interface </li><li>  Works from the browser </li><li>  Terminal server support </li><li>  Free for test and personal use. </li><li>  Clear interface </li><li>  Available in over 30 languages. </li></ul><br>  The disadvantages of the TeamViewer program include the need for initial registration and its high cost. <br><br>  The last of the possible ways to connect to the server, consider the standard Windows program, which in the Russian localization Window is called ‚ÄúRemote Desktop Connection‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b7/72e/c36/6b772ec367794ecab85d91fbc687c59b.png"><br><br>  <i>This program is presented in all editions of Windows since version XP.</i>  <i>It is quite simple and easy to use, even for inexperienced users who are just starting their familiarity with virtual servers.</i> <br><br>  The main advantages can be identified as follows: <ul><li>  The program does not require installation if you have all devices on Windows </li><li>  Supports connecting external devices from your computer to the server </li><li>  The ability to connect local drives and USB-devices </li><li>  Uses shared clipboard.  Allows you to directly copy files </li><li>  Allows you to run an unlimited number of connections </li><li>  Ability to adjust color quality and screen settings </li><li>  Setting up in the client autorun of various programs when connected to the server </li><li>  High security, authentication and authorization </li><li>  Free use for administration purposes </li></ul><br>  There are several points to possible disadvantages: <br><ol><li>  the need to buy / rent a <a href="https://ultravds.com/licence">RDS CALs</a> license, when using a server, not only to configure and administer it, or if more than two simultaneous connections to the server are required. </li><li>  no possibility of creating a conference </li></ol><br>  The determining issue for many users when choosing a means of remote access will be the question of cost.  Licensing terms are different for everyone, but for most of our hosting clients, the most popular task is to organize simultaneous access to the server for up to 1 to 10 people (rarely seek a large number of RDSCALs). <br>  The corresponding comparison table is offered to you: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54d/8d6/943/54d8d6943cde4d13a5292522d2d1c7c9.png"><br>  * Provided free of charge for non-commercial use. <br>  ** Cost varies depending on the company providing the service. <br>  The cost for the purchase or rental of licenses is indicated at the time of this writing. <br><br>  When choosing a tool for remote access to the <a href="https://ultravds.com/">VPS</a> , in addition to the cost, you can pay attention to how actively these programs use the resources of your computer and your network. <br>  To find out which of the programs uses your resources least of all, we conducted the corresponding load tests in the two most significant situations: <ol><li>  normal server work </li><li>  Watching a 720p video on YouTube on the server to check how effectively the desktop image is transmitted (the comfort of your work largely depends on this) </li></ol><br><br>  The latest version of the Google Chrome browser was used to view the video on the <a href="https://ultravds.com/">virtual server</a> , and the standard Windows Resource Monitor program was used to monitor the load on the client. <br>  The obtained indicators were presented in the form of a table, which gives us the opportunity to see how the indicators have changed during normal operation and when watching a video in full screen. <br><br>  Table 2. Comparative table of indicators for the load <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/106/316/31f1063168cb48ac8ed683e89f9702b6.png"><br><br>  The data transfer rate in the table was translated to Mbps, while in the screenshots it is shown in bytes / sec.  The colors indicate indicators of the load on the equipment, the green indicator highlights the minimum indicator, the red indicator highlights the maximum indicator. <br>  We must note that the video quality (frames per second) was disgusting in all cases: 2-3 frames per second <br><br>  After testing and examining each of the programs, it is possible to draw conclusions under what conditions they are best used: <br><br>  A standard <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ultravds/blog/305672/">remote desktop connection is</a> perfect in cases where you do not want to install a third-party application and you do not need rich functionality, but only access at some time points to the remote desktop server to configure it. <br><br>  The Radmin program allows you to use it comfortably in all situations, in combination with great functionality, low cost and minimal load on the equipment of both the server and your PC. <br><br>  TeamViewer program is wise to use if you need to organize jobs for a large number of employees.  And at the same time, you would like to get all its capabilities to provide online support and real-time interaction of employees, despite the heavy workload it generates. <br><br>  The resulting screenshots at the time of testing you can see below. <br><br>  Radmin under load during normal operation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2f/5de/a81/c2f5dea8118e4a16a3345c7bdd4fbeab.png"><br><br>  Radmin under load at the time of viewing on the server video size of 720p <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a1/e29/8b8/0a1e298b8dce46439ba00ad13791861e.png"><br><br>  TeamViewer under load during normal operation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/761/016/f38/761016f38f654b25ad311c55bb4d6b27.png"><br><br>  TeamViewer with a load at the moment of watching a 720p video on the server <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9f/a52/f9c/d9fa52f9c6ab489283594b1954b2b9f3.png"><br><br>  RDP under load at the time of normal operation <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/672/67d/76f/67267d76fc4e4b568356eaa177949a4e.png"><br><br>  RDP with load at the time of viewing on the server video size of 720p <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/497/32c/322/49732c3225bd4091b92aafa3cb2c89a4.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306486/</a></p>
