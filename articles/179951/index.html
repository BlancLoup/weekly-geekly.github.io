  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lexand LPB-78W: router and "socket" to the country and in travel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past few weeks, the thermometer's column has more or less kept steadily above the 20 degree mark, and on some days it gives off all 30-35 Celsius.  This motivates a variety of recreational activities, coupled with staying away from home.  The problem for me is that no matter where I am, I always want to access the Internet.  By luck, in my hands was a Lexand LPB-78W, which (as far as I know) cannot boast with a large (and indeed at least some) number of competitors.  In one small box with dimensions of 111 x 63 x 23 mm, a combination of a number of extremely useful functions was found. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/262/83e/ab0/26283eab08c7be017d1dba3967877039.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  3G for people <br></h5><br>  Number one, we insert a 3G modem into the Lexand LPB-78W (4G support is on the way), if necessary, drive in the settings and get an access point at the Wi-Fi output.  Of course, we saw quite a few portable routers.  But so that with its own battery - one, two and miscalculated.  And absolutely nothing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75d/04a/b3d/75d04ab3dd1936b9a5eba53c18c9cee0.jpg"><br>  I have a mobile network in the country working in the best field traditions, with varying degrees of signal strength in all three planes.  Moreover, within the home, the signal at the beginning of the second floor was found to be the best experimentally.  Leaving my smartphone there for understandable reasons, I was not at all ‚Äúwarming up‚Äù.  You could get stuck with some kind of three-meter USB extension cable and carry a modem from a laptop.  However, this is a) dependence on the included laptop b) some kind of completely non-modern design.  Therefore, the received for temporary use Lexand LPB-78W was installed on the top rung of the stairs, from where it successfully ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù for a smartphone and a laptop. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7de/1a0/76f/7de1a076fbd4f79a8883628801f9e0f1.jpg"><br>  As an option, the distribution connection Lexand LPB-78W may be useful on the road.  For example, during a long trip in a car, passengers ‚Äúfeed‚Äù centrally, as an option - they drop off to pay for traffic together. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e7/34e/70f/7e734e70f79db346ce2622d01a9c616f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Outlet from pocket </h5><br>  Number two is charging devices.  The capacity of a removable Lexand LPB-78W battery is 7,800 mAh.  I think it will not be difficult to calculate how many times you can charge a mobile phone or tablet.  In total, the Lexand LPB-78W itself spends no more than 5‚Äì8% of the battery on maintaining its performance.  Moreover, charging can be carried out simultaneously for two devices.  Only because of the busy pair of USB connectors will it be impossible to connect a modem. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce9/78d/dc7/ce978ddc7600066d7fcf5db135385848.jpg"><br><br><h5>  We save in a hotel </h5><br>  Number three is an Ethernet port.  I did not immediately realize why he is needed here.  However, I remembered that in the expanses of our Motherland, as well as beyond its borders, cunning hotel owners love to take money for the Internet.  "Zamanuha" is as follows: the room has free access, but only wired.  That, as you understand, is not entirely convenient.  For Wi-Fi, you must give the n-th sum.  Savvy harakhabrovchane, I think everyone already understood.  We stick in the cable to the Lexand LPB-78W and enjoy the Internet at least within the hotel room.  Just do not forget to set a password to the access point, in order to avoid uninvited wireless "guests". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32f/3db/98e/32f3db98ee57f883ac068e7ce19fa360.jpg">

    <h5>  Files without wires </h5><br>  Number four is the file storage option; there are two approaches.  First of all, we can ‚Äúplug in‚Äù a USB stick or an external hard drive.  And get a wireless file server.  Either we remove the cover, take out the battery and insert a microSD memory card into a single slot.  Access is made through the browser - we will talk about technical details later.  The resulting file splendor comes in handy in the situations already mentioned - on the road and on vacation / summer cottage.  It‚Äôs more convenient for me to put a Lexand LPB-78W next to me and watch movies on the tablet ‚Äúwith it‚Äù than to watch a drive hanging from an OTG cable.  As an option, you can consider the Lexand LPB-78W as an ultrabudget similarity of a NAS for home or office. <br><br><h5>  Details  Equipment </h5><br>  Nothing transcendentally unusual was found in the box: the ‚Äústring‚Äù of microUSB, warranty, instructions and a cover.  For the case - thanks, taking into account the "shipping" orientation of the model.  The instruction turned out informative.  Here is the rare case when the ‚Äútutorial‚Äù is better to read before using the device, and not after.  I know for sure that in the Lexand LPB-52W model (the same thing, but a 5,200 mAh battery), an additional "bending" adapter is also attached.  With it, the modem does not stick out of the case, but "fits" into the dimensions of the router. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea6/55c/61f/ea655c61fc24f1701c7968a9675d5cd6.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Exterior </h5><br>  In the case of Lexand LPB-78W there is a lot of free space, which naturally led to the ability to extract all sorts of sounds when squeezed.  But in general, the device does not give the impression of a flimsy product.  Theoretically, I could say that the model uses a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù material, a metal upper plate.  However, the coating is made of aluminum, which remarkably lends itself to deformation in the form of small scratches.  And even despite careful handling, I did not manage to avoid a small mark.  The rest - the usual plastic.  On the ends of matte, with silver color.  The cover, unfortunately - black, with a glossy surface. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05d/d56/10b/05dd5610ba057ea1c6f275f1cf0b06a4.jpg"><br>  Now about the more interesting, buttons, connectors and (in passing) their work in different situations.  On the left side is the power switch.  What exactly makes the intermediate position ‚ÄúC‚Äù I did not understand, but refused to tell me the instructions.  Maybe someone in the know?  On the right, I proposed to switch two positions: "3G" or "DHCP" (also known as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).  The ‚Äú3G‚Äù option means that we either work with a modem or interact with files on a connected drive.  When you need to access the content on the memory card, select the position "DHCP".  Accordingly, it is a pity that it is impossible to simultaneously use two sources of files or simultaneously distribute both the Internet and content. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a6f/3d0/3cc/a6f3d03cce5b711218d57a37812fd157.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/f24/010/78bf2401072a950e33c528c90eaf3322.jpg"><br>  From above, with minor clarifications, the assignment of indicators is understandable by icons ‚Äî showing battery charge level, Wi-Fi operation, battery status (charging, working in normal mode or the need for charging), Ethernet status (on / off or data transfer in progress).  Apparently, I got a bit of a buggy specimen.  When you press a single button on top of the indicators should show the remaining battery charge.  Instead, they arranged color music for me, three times lighting up alternately. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2e/cdb/01d/a2ecdb01df2f55dae78c5c27a4adf7b0.jpg"><br>  On the back side we see two connectors: a microUSB for recharging directly the Lexand LPB-78W - and a recess, designed to reset the settings to factory settings, and also enable / disable the Ethernet port.  It all depends on the duration of pressing.  According to the instructions, the disconnected port saves a fifth of the battery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/409/9ae/3f7/4099ae3f767221519a2bb1b551bf1103.jpg"><br>  Remained "connector" front.  One USB connector is suitable for modems, drives, and charging devices.  The second, to the left of the Ethernet, is only suitable for recharging.  Why do I need to explain the central port, I think it is not necessary. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c7/297/10f/3c729710f193e74ea9f6c0558a89d342.jpg"><br>  Under the lid, we get acquainted with additional network information and try to insert a memory card into a holder that regularly falls out of the slots.  "Press" the battery - that's all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d9/0a1/b3a/6d90a1b3a5625c43f4edaf10b08152e4.jpg"><br>  Battery: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f3/ff0/78a/8f3ff078a0baed57826047a78e941f75.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Settings </h5><br>  For both the file server and the connected modem, it may be necessary to make network settings.  According to Lexand, in the future we are waiting for the firmware with smart mode and automatic setting parameters.  At the same time and the interface will make the Russian. <br><br>  To begin with, whether it be a computer or a smartphone, we find in the list of wireless networks a ‚ÄúLexand 3G Router‚Äù point.  Connect.  To get access to the settings, we type in the browser line 192.168.100.1.  Enter the login / password and find ourselves in the required "optional space".  All features and tools are clearly visible in the screenshots.  Again, all the settings can be equally made from a computer and from a mobile device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a12/2a6/e0e/a122a6e0ea7f87288d046af9957faefa.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d6/183/8f1/2d61838f1f902d473e14d370600ac661.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d6/de9/037/9d6de9037c050d63ec57af5ac77c3a20.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d81/439/cf7/d81439cf7e2bc7156610d3bbc6e31e27.jpg"><br><br>  I note that to access the drive (it does not matter to the card or the connected flash drive) in the browser type 192.168.100.1:6060.  Content played fine in streaming mode.  Only music is not particularly listen.  In any case, on Android I had to run each track separately. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Lexand LPB-78W costs about 4 500 rubles.  If you count a separate purchase of ‚Äúincluded in the set‚Äù devices, it turns out about just such a sum.  I can not say that during the test, the model revealed special drawbacks.  Basically - niggling like a strange button-level battery or a weak holder microSD.  Otherwise, if you see in Lexand LPB-78W a solution to situations that are relevant to you, I can safely recommend this device.  Of course, as an option, you can save money and order a similar device from China.  Having received a ‚Äúbonus‚Äù bag with sand instead of a battery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1fc/7c0/a51/1fc7c0a51b2ec205602748e7a0b56c6b.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179951/</a></p>
