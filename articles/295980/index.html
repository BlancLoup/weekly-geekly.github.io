The use of drones for commercial purposes can bring the national economy $ 82.5 billion.  The main obstacles are government regulators and time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/739/488/6e8/7394886e8e9498e4d6cbb0f34c90b0c7.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Drones couriers in the US and in the world </h4><br>  In the United States, companies involved in aerial photography, power line inspections, cartography, video broadcasts of sporting events, and monitoring of private property have permits for the commercial use of drones.  And only one company delivers drugs. <br><br>  This does not prevent the use of drones illegally.  On July 29, 2015, in Mnsfield Prison, Ohio, security guards discovered a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/259770/">package with tobacco and two types of narcotic substances</a> thrown into the prison.

      Amazon offers delivery called Prime Air - customers receive packages within half an hour after placing an order.  The maximum mass of the parcel is 2.3 kilograms - this is the maximum mass of 86% of the goods sent by the retailer. <br><br>  Google in the framework of Project Wing tested delivery by UAVs in Australia and in the USA.  Google devices fly at speeds up to 160 kilometers per hour at altitudes up to 120 meters.  The company has developed an algorithm in case of loss by the communication apparatus with operators on Earth.  But if Amazon openly talks about its goals - about the delivery of goods by drones, then the purpose of Project Wing is unclear. <br><br>  In Russia in June 2014, Fedor Ovchinnikov attempted to introduce <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/227133/">pizza delivery by drones</a> in Syktyvkar.  The story ended well: the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242576/">court overturned a fine of fifty thousand rubles for delivery</a> . <br><br>  In June 2015, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/251728/">Invitro tested an Octocopter</a> to deliver tests to Kabardino-Balkaria.  The biomaterial overcame twelve kilometers in 15 minutes, and the path along the roads for a car would have been forty minutes.  For the experiment "Invitro" received all the necessary permissions and coordinated the flight with Rosaviatsia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13f/b0e/cc2/13fb0ecc2bd22f7292f6fba7c0e0eabe.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Obstacles in the form of laws </h4><br>  All drone operators used for commercial purposes must be real pilots with an appropriate license.  Flights must be made within the direct line of sight of the operator - this problem is solved thanks to the <a href="http://www.robo-geek.ru/letayuschie-roboty/v-ssha-razreshayut-ispolzovanie-kommercheskih-bpla">exclusion of the ‚ÄúSection 333‚Äù</a> , which includes more than a thousand amendments to the legislation regarding the operation of unmanned aerial vehicles. <br><br>  An important problem is the airspace problem.  Amazon, for its solution, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/259644/">proposes to allocate a separate airspace for high-speed drones</a> .  According to the company's plan, drones should move in space at a height of from sixty to one hundred twenty meters at a speed of 111 kilometers per hour.  Amazon wants to make the height from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and fifty meters completely fly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38c/53f/c0b/38c53fc0b4076e0cda616d17b990d771.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Time does not play on the side of retailers.  In March 2015, Amazon received a license to carry out test deliveries of goods using UAVs.  But the process of obtaining the document took a year and a half - during this time the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/247854/">drone is outdated</a> , the company has updated the drones.  And you need to license each model separately. <br><br>  Regulators need to keep an eye on drones, as they can cause fatal accidents.  Amateurs have already shown themselves not to be at their best - including when they <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/259170/">prevented them from extinguishing a fire</a> in California in July 2015. <br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="622169862094262272"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  In February 2015, the US Federal Aviation Administration issued a draft rule for the commercial use of drones.  But this project violates the development plans of at least Amazon - the company did not provide for the constant visual contact of the operators with the UAVs.  Amazon did not refuse to work with the project, but urged management to revise the rules, taking into account the interests of the company. <br><br>  The US Federal Aviation Administration plans to develop a final version of the rules by June 2016. <br><br>  NASA and Verizon <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/251558/">are working on a drone tracking system for</a> flight safety, and Google and Amazon will test it.  The cost of this project is worth half a million dollars, the system will help keep vehicles away from restricted areas, including the White House. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f8/c5c/c61/9f8c5cc61b67efa87d404e5b8f312834.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Why do drones retailers? </h4><br>  As of August 2015, the United States Federal Aviation Administration issued more than seven hundred licenses for the use of drones by commercial companies.  But only a startup Flirtey, in collaboration with NASA, can <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/258902/">deliver drugs</a> using multicopter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d2/fb6/f1c/8d2fb6f1c6a3e6dfad15889462e0cc5c.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>The route by which medications are delivered by road from the airport in Wise County.</i> <br><br>  Amazon is already ready to send drones with purchases - all that remains is permission from the aviation department.  The company plans to reduce the delivery time of goods to half an hour.  The use of drones will reduce transport costs and will serve as a driver of sales growth in the network.  Those retailers who achieve significant cost savings will increase customer loyalty and increase market share, as shipping costs are the main reason customers refuse orders, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/delivery-fee-for-amazon-prime-air-2015-4">I'm sure</a> Cooper Smith, an BI Intelligence analyst. <br><br>  How much will the shipping cost be reduced if the time is reduced to half an hour?  Amazon Prime Air delivery costs users one dollar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9b/61d/cf4/e9b61dcf49b023e7e3810afd251e9ce0.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Walmart clearly wants to spur online sales.  For the company, this is especially true after <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/14/10/2015/561e7a8d9a79471f8c7f0545">losing twenty billion dollars in twenty minutes</a> in mid-October.  This happened after investors were warned that the return on Walmart shares in the fiscal year 2017 would fall in the range of 6 to 12%.  By reducing costs and increasing salaries at their expense, improving the efficiency of delivery and warehouse management, Walmart will be able to deal with competitors.  In total, the company will spend two billion dollars on sales promotion on the Internet in the coming year.  Walmart already has ready infrastructure for working UAVs: 70% of US residents have this store within eight kilometers. <br><br>  While Amazon and Google are planning to deliver goods from distribution centers to customers 'homes, Walmart wants to throw packages into the buyers' cars in the parking lot using drones and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/wal-mart-plans-outdoor-drone-tests-1445899727%3Falg%3Dy">launch them from the bases in truck bodies</a> - such aircraft carriers carrying purchases. <br><br>  The third innovation Walmart - monitoring commodity flows: drones will search for goods in warehouses.  The range of the average Walmart now has one hundred twenty thousand goods. <br><br>  The co-founder of the UAV company Kiva Systems, says about the cost of delivering a two-kilogram parcel of drones on the last mile of ten cents.  Land delivery will cost from two to eight dollars.  Research company ARK Investment Management says about the cost of one dollar. <br><br><h4>  Unmanned economy </h4><br>  The United States Audit Office believes that the work of UAVs in US airspace <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/671469.pdf">will bring the country's economy $ 82.1 billion until 2025</a> .  More than one hundred thousand highly paid jobs will appear in the country.  Drones <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/02/15/fact-sheet-promoting-economic-competitiveness-while-safeguarding-privacy">will become</a> transformative technology that can be used in agriculture, law enforcement, in order to ensure safety in coastal waters, in military training, search and rescue operations, the provision of emergency medical care and so on.  World annual production of UAVs can grow to fourteen billion dollars by 2025 from the current four billion, <a href="http://www.tealgroup.com/index.php/teal-group-news-media/item/press-release-uav-production-will-total-93-billion">according to the Teal Group</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295980/</a></p>
