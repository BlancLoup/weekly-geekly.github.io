  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBeacon features for exhibition optimization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/094/659/d99/094659d990028e8a4ff7ec70993d357a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the first time, iBeacon was shown at the annual World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) Apple Conference.  The technology is based on beacons that are integrated with a mobile device via Bluetooth Low Energy and run on batteries. <br>  In addition to the existing systems for personnel control and navigation in shopping centers, we decided to consider the possibilities of iBeacon in exhibition activities and made a list of advantages based on the <a href="http://smileexpo.ru/">experience of holding such events</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Accounting, statistics, control</b> <br>  Summing up the event, it is very difficult to calculate the exact number of visitors.  Someone passes by invitations, others have already purchased tickets, also do not forget about journalists, whose accreditation pops up like a rabbit from a cylinder.  Therefore, <b>when taking into account the attendance of the exhibition, beacons become just an indispensable assistant</b> . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In addition, the placement of iBeacon on the stands turns the exhibition into a kind of marketing campaign, the participants of which will be able to get accurate statistics on attendance, the number of contacts and the average residence time of guests near the stand.  Naturally, many companies will be disappointed, stand-attendants will be reprimanded, and the authorities will be horrified by the irrational expenditure of the budget, but next time the public will be met by bright posters and live exhibitors. <br><br>  <b>2. Manage the flow of visitors</b> <br>  During the construction of the exhibition can form dead zones, branches from the standard route of visitors (clockwise along the perimeter).  Therefore, companies that are fortunate enough to get a booth in the "backwater", paid much less attention.  It is precisely such imbalances that a well-constructed pocket navigation can smooth out. <br><br>  A great example is the <b>quest with the use of iBeacon beacons</b> , which will allow visitors to get acquainted with exhibitors' stands and other activities in a simple and interesting way.  Naturally, you need to work hard and create a small application, however, as practice shows, the average duration of an exhibition visit due to this function increases by several hours. <br><br>  Another hidden feature is <b>push notifications</b> .  A great way to get extra attention.  In messages you can talk about seminars and invite to participate.  You can also independently set the scenarios for sending these notifications depending on the movement of visitors (do not go to the right - go to the left). <br><br>  <b>3. Eye contact</b> <br>  The organizers of CES 2014 have an interesting experience. Visitors were invited to use a special application to <b>build a collection of virtual icons</b> for which prizes were given.  The resourceful way to stimulate research on an exhibition stand was perceived with a bang and next year was copied by other companies. <br><br>  Alas, the organizers of the exhibitions are too busy or do not want to spend budgets for the additional service of participants, but no one will forbid your company to install lighthouses on their own, which can distinguish your stand from the rest and attract additional guests. <br><br>  <i>This is only a small list of iBeacon features, however, based on our experience, even these functions are quite enough to conduct a high-quality exhibition campaign.</i> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aGWdxiKM44%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpfYHcXcEGc-ttI03VU6KXIhGvRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374827/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374827/</a></p>
