Part 1.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you know, the State Duma adopted <br>  amendments to the fourth part of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation: ‚ÄúAllowed without the consent of the author or <br>  other copyright holder and without payment of remuneration reproduction <br>  a citizen when necessary and solely for personal purposes is legitimate <br>  published works.  As always, the terms are vague, <br>  fuzzy definitions - all according to the old Russian tradition: ‚ÄúThe law that <br>  the tongue, as I turn, and left. ‚Äù  The need to have to prove so <br>  same as the need for self defense when attacking. <br>  Earlier, the Supreme Arbitration Court passed a resolution on ‚Äúinnocent responsibility‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  23. By virtue of paragraph 3 of Article 1250 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, <strong>no guilt</strong> <br>  violator does not release him from the obligation to stop the violation <br>  intellectual property rights and does not exclude the use of <br>  violator of measures aimed at protecting such rights. <br>  With this in mind <br>  courts should bear in mind that the repression is <br>  regardless of the presence or absence of guilt of the offender. <br>  The absence of <br>  guilt of the violator does not exclude the use of other measures of protection <br>  exclusive rights, including in the form of recovery from the violator <br>  or compensation. <br>  At the same time, the court considering the case on recovery <br>  compensation from the offender in the amount of from ten thousand to five million <br>  rubles, takes into account the absence of his guilt when determining the size <br>  compensation (paragraph 43.3 of this decision). <br></blockquote><br>  Read more <a href="http://bablaw.livejournal.com/49371.html">here</a> . <br>  I hope it is clear that if you go online and read this post <br>  - the browser will make a copy of it before displaying it on the screen. <br>  Since I obviously did not give you the right to copy, then cook five <br>  million  Thanks to the genius of the legislators, now anyone is guilty. <br>  Naturally, the ruling also applies to unlicensed software. <br>  security.  For the sake of interest, I went through my laptop and did not find anything <br>  unlicensed and illegal, surprisingly.  Presently <br>  the situation is such that for each paid software <br>  the package exists its absolutely free analogue or commercial <br>  a program that is incomparable in cost, and pirated software is put only from <br>  ‚ÄúFamiliarity‚Äù and lack of education.  Well, nothing, millions of fines, <br>  I hope the people will reason.  So, I present to your attention a small <br>  a list of software necessary for life, some of it is free, some - <br>  worth the money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Operating system. </h3><br>  Of course, there are better, faster and faster operating systems. <br>  more reliable than windows.  Unfortunately, the situation in Russia was initially <br>  so that on the home and office computer special sense to put <br>  Something besides Microsoft products is not.  And a crucial role in choosing <br>  OSes are played here by familiarity, clarity, availability of the necessary <br>  software and drivers.  Try, for example, to force <br>  work under Linux printer-processor Epson RX610. <br>  In the end, here we have no alternative, and deny yourself a bottle <br>  average whiskey or lunch at a sushi bar, with this money we buy <br>  licensed Windows.  Laptop owners have no problem, found in <br>  Selling a laptop without Vista preinstalled is now impossible. <br>  By the way, Microsoft is now completely free distributes Windows 7 in order to <br>  testing.  I must say, even this beta version is much faster <br>  and more stable than all previous products. <br><h3>  Office </h3><br>  Licensed Microsoft Office 2007 for home use costs about 2500 rubles.  But it does not make sense, since <a href="http://ru.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> <br>  from Sun completely covers the needs of home and office, while remaining compatible <br>  file formats.  Why do people prefer stolen Microsoft Office <br>  - a mystery.  Probably need to introduce the death penalty for use <br>  unlicensed software to force an ordinary user to draw <br>  focus on alternative products. <br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb.png" height="234" width="240"><br>  For those who are too lazy to bet anything, you can use it for free <br>  Online office packages Google Docs or Microsoft Office Online. <br>  Guess which one is slower and eats up more traffic. <br><h3>  Graphics. </h3><br>  Professional photographer or designer without branded products from <br>  Adobe can not do.  Just because of a decent alternative. <br>  Photoshop and other products just do not. <br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb1.png" height="145" width="240"><br>  For the needs of the site developer, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimp">Gimp</a> (more sophisticated) or <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint.NET">Paint.net</a> (simpler and more bright) are quite enough as an analogue of Photoshop. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff8/5f6/1e4/ff85f61e4eb3d0b757a62858a190b493.png" height="181" width="250"><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape">Inkscape</a> can be used as a vector graphics editor instead of Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator. <br>  As a result, save $ 3000 and not go to jail. <br><h3>  Video. </h3><br>  Oh miracle!  Windows Vista has everything you need to process your home video! <br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb2.png" height="184" width="240"></a>  AT <br>  The composition of the operating system includes Windows Movie Maker for cutting, <br>  editing, effects and subtitles and DVD studio recording <br>  result on discs. <br>  For Windows XP, all this can be taken for free from the Microsoft website. <br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb3.png" height="177" width="240"></a> <br>  Alternatively, you can use - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VirtualDub">VirtualDub</a> , <br>  it can do the same, but its developer has deprived the interface. <br>  There is practically none.  But VirtualDub is much faster, because <br>  written in C ++ and assembly language. <br><h3>  Antivirus. </h3><br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb4.png" height="110" width="100"><br>  Since we use Windows, we have a problem of viruses. <br>  In addition to the very inexpensive Doctor Web and Kaspersky, there are free <br>  for home user <a href="http://www.avast.ru/Free_avast_home_edition.htm">Avast!</a>  and <a href="http://z-oleg.com/secur/avz/">AVZ</a> . <img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb5.png" height="134" width="180"><br>  I recommend reading the <a href="http://z-oleg.com/secur/avz/">list of AVZ features</a> , <br>  many commercial antivirus did not dream of this.  By the way, the creator <br>  AVZ Oleg Zaitsev in 2007 joined the Kaspersky Lab. <br><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb6.png" height="196" width="240"><br>  Kaspersky can be obtained <a href="http://online.yandex.ru/versions">free of charge with the Yandex messenger</a> . <br><h3>  Organizer. </h3><br>  It turned out not so simple.  There are not so many analogs to Outlook <br>  and for convenience - almost none.  The only thing in Outlook isn't <br>  Enough - this is a hierarchy of tasks.  When choosing an organizer, I <br>  guided by the following: <br><ul><li>  Outlook Compatibility for Importing Data </li><li>  The ability to synchronize with PocketPC </li><li>  Security </li><li>  Simple easy interface </li></ul><br>  By the way, Outlook also turns out to be a mail program.  =) <br><h4>  MyLife Organized </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.mylifeorganized.net/">Has a version</a> <br>  for Windows and Windows Mobile, remarkable hierarchical-contextual <br>  task system.  Disadvantages: buggy, severe, completely non-intuitive <br>  interface (task editing window contains hundreds of parameters, with <br>  this elementary category sublighting is not implemented), is absent <br>  calendar as a class.  As a result, the program instead of assisting in the distribution <br>  time he devours.  Cost does not match the quality. <br><h4>  Google calendar </h4><br>  There is another problem - only the calendar is implemented, there are no tasks.  But <br>  The calendar is the best I've ever seen.  Shows a place on the map <br>  meeting, sends an SMS with a warning, integrates into sites. <br>  Syncs with anything.  Disadvantages - web application, no tasks, <br>  the need to donate all your private Google data (according to <br>  with license). <br><h4>  Mozilla sunbird </h4><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb7.png" height="120" width="159"></a> <br>  Mediocre organizer without claims.  Outlook 97 features are not synchronized with anything.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/">Lightning</a> is the same with mail client. <br><h4>  do Organizer </h4><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb8.png" height="220" width="240"></a> <br>  The most powerful and featured program of the described.  Maybe at all <br>  everything.  And multiplayer, and calendars for you and tasks, and bookkeeping, <br>  and hierarchies, and memory cards, and a project manager ... <br>  The developers tried to stuff everything they saw around into the product. <br>  Hence the problems - a huge nesting of windows and menus, non-obvious <br>  communication between the modules (it is clear that different people wrote).  Synchronized <br>  but not with all devices and not always. <br>  The result was a package for devouring free time, <a href="http://www.gemx.com/%3Fpage_id%3D931">but at an affordable price of $ 50</a> . <br><h4>  EssentialPIM </h4><br> <a href=""><img title="image" alt="image" src="http://dvf.su/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/image-thumb9.png" height="180" width="240"></a> <br>  Almost complete Outlook 2003 clone, while disproportionately smaller <br>  size, faster and more convenient.  The task structure is hierarchical, <br>  syncs with Outlook, Windows Mobile devices, Palm, iPOD, <br>  Google calendar  Encrypts AES databases, automatically creates backup <br>  copies.  The cost <a href="http://www.essentialpim.com/ru/%3Fr%3Dbuy">is quite adequate</a> , I bought it and the synchronization module. <br>  There are drawbacks, but the merits do not overlap.  Failed to sync with <br>  occasionally, you have to clear connections, delete all PIM data <br>  on the device to sync again.  Problems recovering from <br>  tray in vista  Just turned off the minimize option to tray and planned <br>  back up more often. <br><br>  In the next part of the article I will tell you about memory cards, knowledge bases and development tools. </div>
