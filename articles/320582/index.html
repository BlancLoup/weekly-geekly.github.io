More than a year of development has passed, 24 experimental versions have been released.  And now the first stable release of the open implementation of the Win32 API with us.  As indicated in the title, more than 6,600 changes have been made to this release.  There is a lot of interesting, in particular, it supports the launch of 64-bit applications under Windows on macOS.  Plus, the developers managed to realize all the features that are needed to run Microsoft Office 2013. <br><br>  Wine claims full support for 4450 programs for Windows, 3828 programs run with minimal configuration and external DLLs.  Another about three thousand applications have minor problems in their work, which, however, do not interfere with the intended use of such programs.  Soon, the developers promise to bring to a logical conclusion HID support, graphics drivers for the Android platform, and the messaging mode for named pipes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Earlier, Wine developers announced that significant releases will now be made once a year.  But let's see what has changed or been added in the new release.
