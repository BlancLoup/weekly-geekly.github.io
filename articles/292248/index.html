Every day he cut thin pork of a farm pork liver in slices, stuffed snails in Burgundy, fried mussels in deep fat.  Soon he was terribly bored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/690/3b1/b8a6903b1895447b855f32897aa69599.jpg" alt="image">

      And then I met a school friend.  Tumbling the fifth IPhone in his hand, he told about his successful online business.  Sales, conversion, landing pages - everything is so exciting.  He began to look for goods that can also be traded on the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Due to the nature of his work, his interests were limited to cooking and cooking utensils.  Gradually, he came to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãselling multicookers.  ‚ÄúAfter all, it‚Äôs a good thing,‚Äù he thought.  With such a thing, every hostess will cook soup and snails. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the elite restaurant they paid well, so our hero had a stash, for which he bought the first batch of multicookers.  It must be said that at that time it was a fairly new product on the market.  Of course, the "pumped" housewives used this engineering marvel, but quietly, without undue agiotage.  And manufacturers only probed the market. <br><br>  Anatolia was lucky with the supplier.  He offered a little-known but very high-quality brand, which, moreover, cost less than similar models on the market.  The supplier "probed" the market and agreed to a minimum lot of 20 pieces. <br><br>  Anatoly ordered Landing, texts for him, bought contextual advertising for $ 200 (freelancers helped to set up for a small fee). <br><br>  Here it is - business!  Sit and wait for orders. <br>  But they are not ... <br><br>  Anatoly is looking at Yandex.Metrica and does not understand anything.  It seems that people are going to the site, and shopping is zero.  For greater persuasiveness, even Google.Analytics has installed - the same picture. <br><br>  Bought for a month from Anatolia as much as one multicooker. <br><br>  The design is good, the texts are selling, the advertising is customized, even the buttons of the desired colors and sizes.  And sales - 1. <br><br>  Tell me who will like this: started a business and was on the edge ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8e/531/384/d8e5313841174cbe8fe0d3315306878c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>... on the edge, on the right, in the row of successful school buddies.</i> <br><br>  Another would have become discouraged by such a conversion, but a person capable of cooking lamb cutlets in Roussillon would not give up so quickly. <br><br>  One evening he sent a short letter to ten women I knew: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúHello, small!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Won't you be so kind, go to my website and say why you can‚Äôt buy goods that are sold on it.</i>  <i>Be honest and frank.</i>  <i>With me coffee and candy.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Tolik "</i> </blockquote><br><br>  All answered Anatolia.  One young lady even ordered a slow cooker.  Aha  ‚ÄúEmail marketing!‚Äù A young entrepreneur made a note in his notebook. <br><br>  In general, the respondents did not have any complaints about the product.  It is understandable, because no one used.  But there were many questions: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>- Is it possible to cook borscht?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- How fast is pilaf?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Does it consume a lot of electricity?</i> </blockquote><br><br>  He began to respond to girlfriends, but then it dawned on him!  Here it is - a puzzle, without which the picture did not develop. <br><br>  I dug in the Internet and saw what the missing link is called content marketing. <br><br>  He has a good product, but only people know nothing about it.  Talk to them with each other about this product is nothing.  They do not trust multivarks, do not know this brand, who is this and why this thing will make life easier for them. <br><br>  Anatoly collected all possible questions about the multicooker and launched a blog on the site.  Each post - the answer to the question.  Some articles in the women's forums published.  Then the copywriters made him some big and sensible articles about multicookers, about the dishes that can be cooked in them and all this went to women's sites.  Video shot about his product - a link on the social network. <br><br>  A month later, he looks into analytics - search traffic has grown, there is a direct one, there are transitions from articles.  He sees that people linger on his site, read, study.  And now there are more returns.  I remembered about the entry in the ‚ÄúEmail-marketing‚Äù notebook and made the newsletter: ‚ÄúThe best dishes in the slow cooker‚Äù. <br><br>  Since then, three or four years have passed.  Anatoly N. is still selling multicookers, but not only them.  He has a small online store that sells kitchenware.  Special pride - Japanese knives for professional chefs.  On his newsletter signed 30 thousand people, mostly women.  Periodically, he posts articles about his products on various websites and forums.  But the main content is a blog with articles and reviews.  He believes that it was the content that helped him sell the first batch of goods. <br><br>  Recently, we met again with Anatoly, he complained about the crisis and the general decline in trade, but he looked confident. <br><br>  <i>- At least, my shop works, unlike some.</i>  <i>I invest the budget only in seo, context and content.</i>  <i>I'm going to launch a new project - the sale of elite products.</i>  <i>Have you ever tried Burgundy snails?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292248/</a></p>
