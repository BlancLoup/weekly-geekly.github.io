Of course, different types and classes of amplifiers in their own way ‚Äúpaint‚Äù the sound, but there are not so many choice problems as with headphones.  They have to convert electrical signals into a sound wave as the owner would like, while comfortably accommodating on the head, to be light and comfortable to use.  The company HiFiMAN states that one of the new products - Edition S - fits all the above criteria. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/284058/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/342/cea/b53/342ceab5339c73215b1dc2d3729ed065.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The box is black, framed in an ‚Äúaudiophile‚Äù style - strict contrasting images, clear sans-serif fonts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/764/ed7/702/764ed77028504274424a186f38bd14c6.jpg">

      Dense cardboard and foamed filler reliably protect the contents from mechanical damage.  A large compartment is reserved for headphones, a small one for connecting wires and adapters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94a/b19/5f9/94ab195f969cb90416d3530c47e80728.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://hifiman.ru/products/headband/edition-s/">Edition S is</a> positioned for portable (or, in the usual language, mobile) application, and therefore comes with a convenient plastic zippered cover that prevents mechanical damage in the folded position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ad/7e1/586/8ad7e1586e00a2fa5baac4a9fda4f5e1.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones in the traditional way - cups inside the headband.  Practical and simple, does not require the introduction of additional hinges in the mounting mechanism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1c/8c9/8cd/c1c8c98cd6eb08e2e078a47bc42af65c.jpg"><br><br>  In the "working" state of the Edition S look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86a/d50/4f5/86ad504f5821ccdb05dd18e0b5e23fc0.jpg"><br><br>  Metal springy headband with plastic lining on top and soft insert inside.  The shape of the bow is a regular semicircle, and the irregularly backed from the inside foam rubber roller does not allow headphones to hang on the crown (a frequent disadvantage of cheap models with a hard headband, which here, fortunately, is taken into account).  Continuous five-hour absorption of musical compositions does not cause any discomfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05f/cea/148/05fcea1489e89dba17da4b4880f62caa.jpg"><br><br>  Suspension cups are made of metal, as well as all joints.  A big plus with active and not very careful use.  The metal surface is anodized - no corrosion and solid appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23e/39b/c0e/23e39bc0e2b60b7d19191a4d17427efd.jpg"><br><br>  Embouchures made of leatherette and velor of considerable size: height 23 mm, width 15 mm.  The inner space is 65 mm high and 40 mm wide - a rare ear does not fit into the "cup".  The considerable springy force of the headband is softened by the ear cushions and is evenly distributed over the entire area, therefore, the pressure is tight and ‚Äúcatchy‚Äù, and the Edition S shaking will not exactly come off.  The range of adjustments for the length of the headband - 40 mm on each side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/0c9/967/0ac0c9967ef06453d003108e1dba13c9.jpg"><br><br>  The signal is fed through a mini-jack (3.5 mm TRS) on the left ‚Äúear‚Äù with a complete cable of oxygen-free copper 1.24 meters long.  There is a volume control on it (20 cm from the connector) and a small clothespin for fixing on clothes.  Included are two adapters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d94/94d/1ee/d9494d1eeef3de8f33cc3182f8ebb32f.jpg"><br><br>  The type of radiator is dynamic, the diameter of the membrane is 50 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/842/ca6/09e/842ca609ec54056ec50fc9cd93c6bc4c.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the low impedance (18 Ohm) Edition S, it gets along well with ‚Äúsimple‚Äù audio sources - smartphones, non-audio players, USB audio cards of primary and secondary levels. <br><br>  The manufacturer calls this model headphones-transformers for removable covers, allowing a couple of hand movements to turn closed headphones in the open and vice versa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/167/323/57c/16732357ccb558a2baf4fe2eaa0e027c.jpg"><br><br>  Covers are held by magnets and, thanks to a good fit, are easily removed by hands and do not fall off from sharp jolts and contacts with garments or things in the bag. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94c/589/464/94c5894646df4ac073a344d3fb36c3fc.jpg"><br><br>  Dismantled covers can be stored in a pocket without special covers;  no division into left and right, which eliminates the visual control during installation. <br><br>  The back side of the cups with the overlays removed is still presentable due to the black perforated mesh.  It also protects the gentle emitter from damage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d14/4bd/898/d144bd8982961b4e6be28dbd08e90a4e.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Edition S seems to be a well-developed and easy-to-use product.  And it's not just a well-thought-out design, but also a good sound quality.  Unaccustomed to it may seem deaf even with the HiFiMAN HM901U native player, but several test tracks (read well familiar and repeatedly heard on different sound reproducing equipment) of different genres convince the opposite: the sound is clear and pleasant.  The complex creations of System of a Down, Slipknot, Within Temptation, Ministry sound well and detailed.  The classic is pure and accented.  It is noteworthy that the ‚Äútransformation‚Äù from closed to open headphones is best seen from orchestral recordings: the volume is added, the tools are less distinguished from the entire audio stream, but not blurred.  It‚Äôs good that a couple of quick movements are enough for modification - this allows you to quickly find a more comfortable playback mode and change it from time to time without removing the headphones from your head. <br><br>  "Marching" headphones - one thing, but for home use it would be convenient to have something less squeezed in size, more comfortable and impressive, like a familiar chair with a headrest and footrest.  Under this definition is quite suitable another model - <a href="http://hifiman.ru/products/headband/edition-x/">Edition X</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60e/8d0/193/60e8d0193ad59e6ffa7d0ba88306dd95.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b7/bfe/346/6b7bfe34659b7b9a023818fd98f76647.jpg"><br><br>  It strikes from the threshold ... No, not by form or even by price, but by packaging: a box covered with leatherette with clear diagonal lines on the sides and a dark silver inset on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/21f/022/b82/21f022b829432204c034751f1d93a1d3.jpg"><br><br>  It opens in the manner of a casket, with one flick of the wrist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3f/213/84d/f3f21384d6ead0b82b1eabff706e46ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f6/a0b/7ac/5f6a0b7ac0ce9625dacc9a6292c8c1b3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e18/eb6/979/e18eb6979631a7e2e3f3025cbfada553.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones are resting in a velvet-covered bed ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02e/a48/5ab/02ea485ab8535ff34b79d455c7d285fb.jpg"><br><br>  ... And in the center, under a small cover - connecting wires: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7da/32a/e43/7da32ae439e2e8b9a159c9637d03661c.jpg"><br><br>  The marketing move with the box is sensible: this will immediately tell the buyer about the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù of the brand as a whole and of this product in particular, and the walls of multi-layered cardboard will protect against mechanical damage. <br><br>  There is something to protect: the <a href="http://hifiman.ru/products/headband/edition-x/">Edition X</a> model is designed in an original way, putting a sin in a simple cardboard box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60e/8d0/193/60e8d0193ad59e6ffa7d0ba88306dd95.jpg"><br><br>  Two large oval cups (130 x 97 mm) are suspended on plastic holders, which, in turn, are fastened through swivels on a metal spring-loaded headband. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/929/3d4/c45/9293d4c45931679e42bd47fbc6a2c2b7.jpg"><br><br>  Under the headband - an insert of imitation leather with adjustable height (31 mm) to adjust to any size of the skull. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16b/6f9/5dc/16b6f95dc6fba029518f04d1a582f8d5.jpg"><br><br>  The isodynamic emitter: instead of the usual coil, there are metal tracks on a thin membrane, on both sides of the membrane are magnets in the form of rods.  There is a current along the paths - the membrane bends, sound is born.  Parts of this clever system can be seen through the fabric inside the cushions and the metal protective grille on the back side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a9/1d7/014/2a91d70148f76f46c962936ac8270d2d.jpg"><br><br>  The elasticity of the steel headband at such sizes of cups just right, provides a tight fit around the perimeter.  Ear pads 22 mm high and 20 wide, velor does not cause the effect of sticking, and the relatively low weight of the whole structure allows not to remove the Edition X from the head for as long as you like.  Inside the ear cushion will fit any ear, and even half of the temple will grab: the internal space under the auditory organ is 90 x 55 mm. <br><br>  Jacks for connecting the signal cable are on both cups, both are 2.5 mm TRS: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b06/58b/b21/b0658bb215c0f0f8ffa478f145c4b5bd.jpg"><br><br>  There are two connection cords: one half meter with a standard mini-jack (3.5 mm TRS) ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/371/1cd/c823711cd0803ae350c31255e164d043.jpg"><br><br>  ... And a six-meter with a big jack (6.3 mm TRS), both in fabric braid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bcc/f8c/e89/bccf8ce89b7d59c94c459f514418f490.jpg"><br><br>  Such a strong difference in length is due to the specifics of the application, and a simple adapter or extension cord adapter will be less practical with frequent use than a pair of separate cables. <br><br>  Of course, shaking Edition X is more difficult than Edition S, but good sensitivity allows you to do without an additional amplifier in most cases, and low resistance gives a chance to ordinary "home" players not to fail a compatibility test.  The HM901U has no problems in this regard, there is enough volume with a margin, and thanks to the specific structure of the emitters, the sound is very clear and rich.  Industrial, rock, alternative on Edition X sound lively and vigorously, the soundtracks of Hans Zimmer caress the ear, and jazz ‚Äúplayed‚Äù with new colors.  In my personal taste, a little is not enough high, but this is more the power of habit than constructive criticism. <br><br>  Characteristics of <a href="http://hifiman.ru/products/headband/edition-s/">HiFiMAN Edition S</a> headphones: <br><blockquote>  Frequency range: 15 Hz - 22 KHz <br>  Sensitivity: 113 dB / mW <br>  Impedance: 18 ohms <br>  Emitters membrane diameter: 50 mm <br>  Emitter Type: Dynamic <br>  Connection connector: TRS 3.5 mm <br>  Weight: 248 g </blockquote><br>  Characteristics of <a href="http://hifiman.ru/products/headband/edition-x/">HiFiMAN Edition X</a> headphones: <br><blockquote>  Frequency range: 8 Hz - 50 KHz <br>  Impedance: 25 ¬± 3 ohm <br>  Emitter type: isodynamic <br>  Sensitivity: 103 dB <br>  Cable length: 1.5 and 3 m <br>  Connection connector: 3.5 mm TRS, 6.3 mm TRS <br>  Weight: 399 g </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370013/</a></p>
