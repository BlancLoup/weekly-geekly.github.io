  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook announced the imminent release of App Center for iOS, Android and HTML 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúDetection‚Äù of applications is a big problem for all users of mobile devices, and therefore developers and stores.  We wrote about this quite recently, for example, in ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/143470/">Development for iOS: 60% (or more) of applications do not discourage costs,</a> ‚Äù all studies show that the number of applications downloaded outside the Top 100 tends to zero, and independent developers break into Tops Without significant marketing budgets, it‚Äôs almost impossible.  Apple, apparently, is actively working to solve this problem, as things are in Play is unclear, but ahead of everyone, apparently, Facebook, which already announces the App Center application search system, which is not based on ratings, but on quality applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/64b/513/03f/64b51303f123b0f50a6467e828fc0047.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now the application search system on Facebook prefers the most popular names with the largest number of users.  Facebook decided to change this situation, in connection with which it <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/05/09/introducing-the-app-center/">announced the imminent launch of App Center</a> , a single personalized hub to search for the highest quality games and utilities with the integration of a social network for web and mobile devices.  And for the first time, Facebook is launching beta testing options for developers, which will allow them to sell prepaid web and HTML 5 applications.  You can access the App Center via the web or from mobile devices, and you can also send applications that you find on the web to other devices.

      App Center can very well affect the growth of sales of applications in Facebook, especially those of them, which, despite their quality, are not particularly popular.  If everything goes as planned, the App Center will help us enter a new era when your news feed will be filled with applications that can really interest you, and not just those for which manufacturers spend more money to promote. <br><br>  App Center will not offer all available applications.  We are talking only about those who have the highest user rating, user involvement, session duration and indicators of voluntary exchange.  App Center will dynamically display different applications depending on your habits.  If you play games, you will be offered games.  If you think games are a waste of time, and you are only interested in useful applications like <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/foodspotting.html">Foodspotting</a> , they will appear in the news feed. <br><br>  Here are some more details about App Center: <br><br><ul><li>  Facebook completes the App Center design.  It appears that the home page will show applications recommended based on what you already use;  based on applications that are often used by your friends;  leaders of ratings, trends, most successful applications, ‚Äúapplications of the week‚Äù, etc. </li><li>  Unlike the Apple App Store and other stores, there will be no objective end-to-end ratings on the App Center.  Instead, the user will see different sets of applications.  This should force developers to focus on quality, rather than on installing meters and other metrics. </li><li>  Indicators that will affect the frequency of naming offerings to users include user ratings, session length, user return, frequency of sharing with other users, similarity with those applications that you already use, use by friends, spam messages and the total number of users. </li><li>  With lists (listings, in this context, an application page in a social network is meant) App Center will replace the currently automatically generated App Pages.  To fill the lists, developers will need to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/apps">send data about their applications</a> , it is on them that users will get from the application search in the App Center.  <b>Applications that follow the guidelines for filling, and which will be sent before May 18, will benefit when the App Center is launched.</b> </li><li>  Developers will get a new way to measure the quality of their applications.  They will be able to monitor the progress of their application to see how the changes they make affect the way users treat their product. </li><li>  Facebook is not trying to compete with iOS and Android, but contributes to the success of social networking applications on these platforms.  Lists of native apps on the App Center will direct users to the App Store and Google Play. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143562/</a></p>
