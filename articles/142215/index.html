As a rule, the place on the site where you get after registration is called the personal account.  Sometimes it contains various functions or tools that are not available on the site by default.  Online stores use a personal account as a means of customer retention, since re-purchases are made faster and more convenient. <br><br>  <b>Wholesaler: ‚ÄúI want a personal account on the site‚Äù</b> <a name="habracut"></a>

      By analogy with online stores, wholesale companies that want to simplify the process of placing orders for their customers decide to get a personal account. <br>  The planning of functions that will be available to dealers begins.  As a rule, the main ones are: <br><br><ul><li>  the dealer must see the remains of the distributor's goods in the LC as a product catalog with the quantity or be able to download it in the file; </li><li>  the dealer must be able to order the goods, that is, choose from the catalog, put in the basket and send the order; </li><li>  it is desirable to give dealers the opportunity to see financial information (debts, account balances) </li></ul><br><br>  Approximately in this form, the task goes to the developers. <br>  After a week or two, the functionality appears on the distributor site, but for some reason nobody uses the personal account. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, to hell with him!  ‚ÄúIt means no one needs it,‚Äù thinks the initiator of this whole undertaking. <br><br>  <b>The wholesaler does not need a personal account on the site online store.</b> <br><br>  We are accustomed to think out of pattern and there is nothing wrong with that, it is our nature.  The brain tends to save energy.  Facing a task, we try to find a solution to a similar task and apply it to this one.  Unfortunately, this often leads us to undesirable results due to incorrect analogies.  I want to say that a personal account that wants to organize a wholesale company for its customers will be similar to the personal account of a regular online store, just as this article is similar to the work of Goethe. <br><br>  <b>The principal differences of the personal account of the wholesale company from the personal account of the online store.</b> <br><br>  The first and most important difference that many others derive from is the need for a distributor in your account to have such an entity as ‚Äúorder‚Äù and the ability to work with it according to certain rules. <br><br>  The second is the absence of a basket in the LC, because instead of it the ‚Äúorder‚Äù is used.  In contrast to the "basket", when working with an order, you must have such functions as: <br><br><ul><li>  reservation of goods </li><li>  removal of goods from the reserve </li><li>  formation of several orders at the same time </li><li>  order status tracking </li><li>  order creation from EXCEL file </li><li>  clearance of goods under the order </li><li>  order delivery </li><li>  printing invoices based on order </li></ul><br><br>  The third is security.  Since the distributor shares in his personal account information with his client, jur.  by a person with confidential information, such as stock balance, the issue of data security is one of the most significant.  When creating a LC for an online store, this issue is much less important. <br><br>  Fourth, there is no point in starting a project without integrating LC with the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERP">ERP-system of the</a> wholesale company.  Integration with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERP">ERP</a> (often 1C trade management) and allows you to automate most of the actions of managers of wholesale companies related to the processing of incoming orders and entering data into the ERP. <br><br>  The fifth (the last but not the least) - the goal of creating an effective personal account of a wholesale company differs from the goal of creating a personal account for an online store.  For an online store, as I said before, this is primarily a marketing tool.  For a distributor, it is the automation of business processes, and only then the solution of marketing tasks.  Automation allows you to seriously reduce the resources spent on processing orders, to be able to take orders around the clock and increase the capacity to receive orders. <br><br>  <b>And what about without a basket?</b> <br><br>  You will not need a familiar basket in your account of the wholesale company.  Of course, the place where ordering will take place in the LC can be called a basket, but this will not be entirely true, because this section will have a completely different functionality.  Working with an order implies a slightly different user logic than working in a basket. <br><br>  Below is an example of an order. <br>  The client of the wholesale company scores in the search line the name or article of the product that he wants to buy, and receives a drop-down list of products with information about the availability of the product and its price.  After selecting the right product, the purchasing manager will add it to the order. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/839/d44/d18/839d44d183732176725e7f13f9500667.png" alt="creating an order in the personal account of the wholesale company"><br>  When an order is created, you can save it, and in the case of a personal account synchronization with the wholesale company's ERP system, the order will be automatically placed. <br>  Then the wholesale company manager will be able to change the order status in the EPR system, and the dealer will track them in his personal account. <br>  It is also possible for the dealer to download a list of articles of goods with the quantity in the personal account, which is determined by the system as a new order with these items. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the basket in the CMS to the required functions?</b> <br><br>  Of course, you can try to create a personal account in the CMS site, but you could just as well use a bicycle pump for a car.  CMS Content management system (Content Management Systems) created for other tasks.  They do not contain opportunities for working with business objects and business logic, therefore, to create a full-fledged personal account for a wholesale company, you need to use the platforms designed for this: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/ru/products/middleware/index.html">Oracle Fusion Middleware</a> , <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.sap.com%252Fcis%252Fplatform%252Findex.epx%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFg4NGK2Rpb9zqArcry8dE4MIKrPQ">SAP NetWeaver</a> , <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fwww.mysitex.com%252Fsitex%252Fabout%252Fmain.htm%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFBdHg-JJ0r5iW7pPx8Dj4Ik1b0dw">SiTex</a> , <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fsharepoint.microsoft.com%252Fru-ru%252FPages%252Fdefault.aspx%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNGiiL2KrQ7E2ZXswj4YZc6KXPJaUA">SharePoint</a> , <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fcentrobit.ru%252Fagora%252Fagora-abilities%252F%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNEc10nGVrFf6ByQDCYxoXEl8qh5xQ">Agora</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142215/</a></p>
