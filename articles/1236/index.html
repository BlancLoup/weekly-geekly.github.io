  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In Russia, in order to fight spammers, they want to introduce a fee for outgoing messages, and I suggest another way :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  A high-ranking defender of the rights of Russian consumers spoke in favor of fighting spammers by introducing a fee for outgoing e-mail messages.  Industry experts estimate this proposal negatively, but express satisfaction with the fact that the problem of spam has finally bothered not only information security experts and ordinary consumers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dmitry Yanin, chairman of the board of the International Confederation of Consumer Societies (KonfOP), proposed to fight advertising emails by introducing outgoing payments.  We pay for paper letters, but not for e-mails, although e-mail performs almost the same functions as the traditional one;  as a result, we pay for such ‚Äúfree cheese‚Äù with a huge amount of unsolicited correspondence, says Mr. Yanin.  In his opinion, the introduction of a fee for outgoing e-mails could be an effective means of combating this evil.  At the same time, users will agree to pay if they receive quality service, and sending unsolicited messages will be unprofitable.  This tool will be effective only with concerted actions of all postal operators, notes Dmitry Yanin. <br><br>  However, his proposal was criticized by experts on a number of points.  First, e-mail is not free, consumers pay for the services of Internet access providers.  ‚ÄúIt is pleasant to see that not only technical specialists are beginning to think about the problem of spam.  This is good, because spam really represents a serious threat to electronic communications.  By itself, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan economic ‚Äúwhip‚Äù is understandable for spammers and, in general, it has been in the air for several years already.  But there are serious objections to it, says Anna Vlasova, the head of the group of spam analysts at Kaspersky Lab.  - If some kind of payment is introduced, it means that ordinary users will pay twice for the same services.  In fact, this is a pay increase without any reason for this. ‚Äù <br><br>  When sending spam through networks of ‚Äúzombie‚Äù computers, the bills for outgoing ones will be sent not to the spammer, but to the user who is guilty only of the fact that his computer was hacked.  Also, the introduction of outgoing payments will cause economic problems for legitimate mailing list organizers.

      Now the main economic burden for the fight against spam lies with the providers of Internet access, postal services and owners of corporate mail servers.  They spend money on receiving, processing, storing and filtering mail.  The introduction of users' fees for outgoing letters, at first glance, should bring additional revenue to providers.  However, it is not.  ‚ÄúFirst of all, it is the reorganization of the entire postal infrastructure.  You will need a system to control the number of sent messages, tracking messages, the development and improvement of electronic payment systems, support services for all these systems, and much more.  The development, commissioning and support of such systems can be costly.  Most likely, these expenses will ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the income received from the payment of messages, ‚Äùsays Anna Vlasova. <br><br>  In addition, according to Ms. Vlasova, such solutions as the introduction of e-mail fees should be introduced throughout the world community at the same time, otherwise their effectiveness will be low or even zero.  In the meantime, neither from an organizational, nor from a technical point of view, there is no clarity on how one can really implement such an idea. </blockquote>  Source: <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/287780.php">SecurityLab.ru</a> <br><br>  It seems to me that the entire Internet community will not be very happy to introduce a fee for outgoing messages. <br><br>  Why not bring the following message delivery scheme to life: <br>  Each and every user has one purse tied to his mailboxes, let's call it PurseID, which has a certain amount of virtual money. <br>  When you send a message from this wallet removed some of the "cash".  But when the letter reaches the addressee, and he confirms the receipt of a letter of a <b>non-advertising character</b> , the money spent on delivery is returned to the sender back to his PurseID.  If spam is sent from the box, the spammer‚Äôs wallet will quickly run out, since no one will confirm his letters. <br><br>  But, in my proposed scheme, there are two problems: <br>  We need the simultaneous introduction of such a scheme all over the world; We need to ensure that only one such wallet is attached to one person (and this will already be difficult to implement). <br><br>  I propose here to discuss the problem of spam and to reflect on how to deal with it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/1236/">https://habr.com/ru/post/1236/</a></p>
