  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Qualities of a promising employee</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I can not say that from the first day I was a great performer.  I was green and did not understand much of what was expected of me, did not what was necessary.  Encountering good managers, working with excellent leaders and, later, directing others, I learned many valuable habits.  I started working as an assistant to the rector in a commercial university, and, by a strange coincidence, in the next two companies, I also had to work closely with top management.  And with exactly the same as I was at the beginning.  Reflecting, I began to understand what is valued in employees, from the point of view of a manager. <br><br>  I decided to write out the most important thing - advice, knowing that from the very beginning, I think, I would now achieve much more.  Applying them will make it easier for you to understand your boss, and it will be easier for you to work with you, you will be trusted, delegated, entrusted to others (in which you, by the way, will appreciate the same thing). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, in order from more important to less:

    <h4>  1. Give results more often </h4><br>  The goal of any time spent is the result.  While there is no result, it is impossible to determine whether you are wasting time effectively or not.  If the result is late, you are likely to waste time inefficiently.  Or do what you did not ask, or what is not so important now.  Or maybe just depict a stormy activity or wipe your pants.  In short, cause concern. <br>  Result examples: new functionality, layout, prototype, call, report (about mental work done, for example), document, letter.  The main thing that he was finished.  Not necessarily perfect, because time is almost always the priority of excessive quality. <br>  A side effect of results orientation - you become a great team player.  Because the finish (or intermediate result) of any task is usually the start for others.  For more interactive sharing of any project on the principle of 80/20, in order to complete the critical part in the shortest possible time, so that others can begin to work with at least something. <br>  It is also important to complete tasks one by one, rather than doing several things at the same time.  The total time is almost the same, but in the latter case, you often delay others. <br><br><h4>  2. Charge only yourself </h4><br>  Any failure is just your fault.  Not provided, not warned, did not change for the better.  It does not matter whether someone let you down in due time (you had time to find out the status and sound the alarm) or gave stupid advice on how to proceed (you should consider the consequences and make a decision consciously) - there is no fault of yours only when the boss was timely warned of the possible consequences and gave the go-ahead (already under his responsibility). <br>  Do not let everything at random, ask the status of others, warn of possible consequences and sound the alarm on time.  When the irreparable happened - write <s>three letters a</s> list of actions that (most of them you need) to take to avoid these problems in the future.  And take them. <br><br><h4>  3. Do not repeat mistakes </h4><br>  One of the important principles of self-improvement: no matter how many mistakes you have already made - because of inexperience, they are all made - it is important not to repeat the same mistakes twice.  In this case, your trust is lost for a long time, because it will be a mistake to believe in you again. <br>  The most critical mistakes are better, of course, to avoid. <br><br><h4>  4. Prevent, do not resist </h4><br>  (in English more capaciously - be proactive, not reactive) <br>  Instead of dealing with the consequences of accidents, do not let them.  Prioritize actions that, in your opinion, will prevent future problems and point the authorities to the need to allocate time for them.  This is a knowingly winning strategy: you either eliminate the problem, or take responsibility for it to a higher level. <br><br><h4>  5. Record your decisions. </h4><br>  At any meeting, conversation with the head, write in a notebook, so that later you don‚Äôt forget what you need to do.  Worse, there is no employee with whom you need to constantly remember what you have already said, decided and assigned once.  Rallies are (sometimes) not an empty talking room, and any small change that is approved for execution will most likely be assigned to you.  For each solution, it is useful to immediately find out the deadline or priority, and once completed, write a report to all those interested. <br><br><h4>  6. Make a list of problems </h4><br>  Every time it seems unreasonable to you that you are doing something wrong, but through no fault of your own, which is constantly being brought down: imperfect processes, errors in the program, other employees, departments, etc.  Write everything in a separate place.  A recorded and unforgotten problem is half the solution.  If this problem only hinders you, then understand that no one will solve it for you (think about it and you will find a solution sooner or later), and if she has someone else, then speak out - maybe the decision will be entrusted to another. <br>  (If you are still very young, you will find a bunch of things that no one will allow you to change. Starper, archaic and conservative methods to beat your forehead against a wall, etc. This is very good, because you will find and remember them a) sooner or later the decision and change everything, and until that moment b) you will be a realist and a strategist.  The main thing is not to be reconciled, and then you yourself become an old marketer :-) <br>  A long list (even of small things) is your argument when you are convinced that something is imperfect.  And without writing down, you will lament for every scanty reason that will not characterize you from the best side. <br>  It is important not to forget about problems, remind them to those who are interested and responsible.  In the event of failure, previously unanswered problems will be perceived as a manifestation of irresponsibility. <br><br><h4>  7. Avoid routine </h4><br>  According to Parkinson's law, any work will take about as much time as you allocate to it.  If you monotonously do something that does not end long (you like something), you have a chance to become indispensable and valuable.  Only until some young and smart one closes the tap, leaving you without work.  In our century, repeated operations are entrusted to a computer, so if you mow under a robot, sooner or later you will be replaced with a robot. <br>  If monotonous work arrives and arrives, determine where to flow from and eliminate it.  If this is not possible - find a way to automate repeated operations, minimize the monkey labor. <br><br>  Well, in my opinion, and all that is needed.  Everything else is also very important (learnability, sociability, dedication, initiative, sense of humor) you already have.  Well, at least in the summary;) <br><br>  Casual topics covered: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://local.joelonsoftware.com/mediawiki/index.php/%25D0%259E_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B4%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC">Joel Spolsky on the dangers of multitasking</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">Pareto's law or the 80/20 principle</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Parkinson's Law</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44947/</a></p>
