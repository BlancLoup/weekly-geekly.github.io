      Joshua Bloch is a senior engineer at Sun Microsystems, Inc., who serves as an architect at the Core Java Platform Group.  He designed and implemented the successful Java Collections Framework, worked on the java.math package, and contributed to the creation of many other parts of the Java platform.  The book demonstrates how to solve problems that most developers face every day.  A comprehensive description of the techniques used by experts - the creators of the Java platform, makes it possible to understand what follows and what should not be done to get clear, reliable and efficient program code.  Each rule, presented in the form of a short completed essay, contains a description of the problem, examples of program code, as well as cases from the practice of this unusually competent author.  The essay includes special tips, a discussion of the subtleties of the Java language, and examples of programs are chosen as illustrations.  The book critically assesses the common idioms of the Java language and design patterns, gives useful tips and techniques. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eba/9a9/67a/eba9a967a9fd4eb8ad483a0d81dc6d9b.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</b> <br>  Posted by: <b>Robert Lafore</b> <br><br>  Robert LaFore has degrees in electrical engineering and mathematics.  He worked as a systems analyst at Lawrence Berkeley Lab, founded a software development company.  This book focuses on the use of data structures and algorithms.

He is referred to as the creator of the first serious business programs for microcomputers and is often called the ‚Äúfather‚Äù of Visual Basic.  For the past 15 years, Alan has been creating a new design methodology for successful software, which he calls a goal-oriented process.  Working with both start-up companies and Fortune 500 companies, Robert Reiman led dozens of collaboration projects in such areas as e-commerce, portals, personal productivity, content creation environments, medical and scientific devices, wireless technologies, and portable devices.  As head of research at Cooper, Reiman led the development and improvement of many of the goal-oriented methods described in this book.  In 2005, he became the first president of the Interaction Design Association (IxDA, <a href="http://www.ixda.org/">www.ixda.org</a> ), a global non-profit organization uniting interaction designers.  He is currently responsible for designing the interaction experience at Bose Corporation. <br><br>  David Cronin - Cooper Interaction Design Manager.  He helps design products for surgeons, museum visitors, marketers, investment analysts, online shoppers, hospital personnel, drivers, dentists, financial analysts, logistics, the elderly, and people with disabilities. <br><br>  The book is written for interaction designers and interface designers.  When the first edition saw the light (in 1995), the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdesigning products, focusing on user needs, seemed revolutionary.  But over time, the design of interaction has become an extremely important discipline.  The book describes in detail the holistic approach developed by Cooper and applied in many projects, focused on user‚Äôs objectives, in interaction design.  A distinctive feature of the book is its practical orientation - a significant part is occupied by a detailed analysis of the principles and patterns of interaction design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/b20/1ed/723b201ed7e845d2b497bd88555018da.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>Web Design.</b>  <b>Elements of Interaction Experience</b> <br>  By: <b>Jesse Garrett</b> <br><br>  Jess James Garrett has been working since 1995 on web projects for AT &amp; T, Intel, Boeing, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and National Public Radio.  His contribution to the development of interaction experience consists, among other things, in the development of Visual Vocabulary (literally - ‚Äúvisual dictionary‚Äù) - an open notational system designed to document the information architecture and is now accepted in many organizations around the world.  Web design is more than error-free code and catchy graphics.  A truly effective site serves strategic goals while simultaneously satisfying user needs.  Jesse Garrett's book reveals the complex topic of web design through clear explanations and clear illustrations, focusing on general ideas, not tools and techniques.  The author draws a complete picture of the development of interaction experience on the website - from strategy and content requirements to information architecture and visual design.  This background information will allow any web development team to design a successful interaction experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/c54/28f/ca0c5428f46e493db6f2441e673763c6.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>Designing for the Digital Age</b> <br>  By: <b>Kim Goodwin</b> <br><br>  Kim is engaged in consulting in various fields: in the aviation industry, consumer electronics production, retail.  For the past few years, he has been Vice President of Cooper (in charge of industrial designers and developers who work with Cooper).  Today, the creation of a successful product or service requires a team of specialists in the field of interaction design, visual, industrial design and other disciplines.  It is necessary to consider every detail of the product, explore the needs of users and find the best solutions.  This book is dedicated to all these questions.  It discusses the problems of team selection, planning and implementation of research, data analysis, the use of scenarios for the development of requirements and design, cooperation between different departments and many other issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e2/b3e/4f7/8e2b3e4f7cc942969c6ab745b6238370.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>This is Service Design Thinking</b> <br>  Authors: <b>Mark Stikdorn, Jacob Schneider</b> <br><br>  This book summarizes the knowledge and experience of 23 professionals in the development of services.  You will learn how to develop and promote friendly services, how to plan the interaction between the service provider and users.  The book is divided into three parts: <br><ul><li>  basics: five basic principles that should guide the development of the service; </li><li>  tools: describes a number of applications and techniques used in the development; </li><li>  examples: cases from the experience of several companies that have created several interesting projects. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266065/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266065/</a></p>
