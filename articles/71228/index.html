  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My experience with three mobile platforms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past 4 months, I had somewhere in my whim, and somewhere in the will of fate to change three phones <b>HTC Touch Diamond, Blackberry Bold, Apple iPhone</b> , which represented three competing platforms.  I want to tell about the experience of using these devices in terms of business, I think it might be interesting to those who choose a device on a particular platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps I'll start with the "drowned¬ª HTC Touch Diamond.  In general, with this phone and with the Windows Mobile platform, as a person who loves to dig into a variety of settings and appreciates the flexible platform, I have only pleasant memories.  It is the ability to freely install any!  Applications downloaded from the site, downloaded from friends or simply bought on the disk and attracts me to this device.  Plus, I like the proprietary interface bolted over the standard WM6, and if it gets bored there are always alternative shells. <br><br>  In terms of use for business, everything is very good, here and Exchange mail (by the way, all the devices I use are different), and the free reading and editing of Microsoft Office files and the favorite by many Opera Mobile.  It is worth noting that it is for the WM platform there is a huge variety of navigation applications, and the same Google Maps easily supports the analogue of the ‚Äúelectronic compass‚Äù, displaying the direction of movement on their maps (a stone in the garden of the iPhone).  I like very much that the phone can be freely connected as an external USB flash drive and upload movies to music, books, anything directly from the conductor.  In general, in terms of convenience, there are only a few drawbacks, this is a crooked job with finger interest (although there are third-party developments), not the best on-screen keyboard and high power consumption.  In general, deep integration with Outlook and the ability to reshape the interface to your taste is very attractive. <br><br>  The second phone that has been in my hands is the Blackberry Bold about which I <a href="http://seriylis.habrahabr.ru/blog/70038/">wrote earlier</a> .  I won‚Äôt repeat too much, I‚Äôll just point out that this phone is fully created for business, here both increased data security and linking to my own server and generally using it, I always felt that the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù was watching and taking care of me :) So that I did not lose confidential information and stayed in touch always and everywhere.  Although it was unusual to switch to the buttons after the sensor, I quickly adapted to it.  In general, as a corporate smartphone, for ease of operation and ease of habituation, he left me with the most pleasant impressions, and as a workhorse I would not refuse myself to have this :)

      Well, the third device was recently presented to the technophone iPhone 3G. Actually, this is its own ideology, which, after a very open WM, had to get used for quite a while.  I was very upset by the impossibility of simply adding files by dragging and dropping onto the device and the impossibility of working with it without iTunes.  In general, the copyright policy of Apple is sometimes paranoid. <br>  But it is worth paying tribute that in terms of the user interface, this is probably the most user-friendly device, although due to the synchronization mechanism that is not very clear to me, I decided to store my data and contacts ... in Google Sync.  So for me everything looks like a mixture of technologies, I have a binding to the corporate Exchange and Google Sync personal, which quite peacefully coexist on my device.  Somewhat saddened by the impossibility of sharing music on bluetooth and the impossibility of simply using pictures, on the other hand, this is not so often necessary. <br><br>  Total: <br><br>  WM <br>  + flexible platform <br>  + full Exchange support <br>  + ease of loading files and transferring them <br>  + many navigation systems <br>  + many alternative browsers <br>  + full office support <br><br>  - crooked finger interface <br>  - light brake system <br>  - battery gluttony <br><br>  Blackberry <br>  + data security <br>  + user-friendly interface <br>  + traffic optimization tools and control communication costs <br>  + easy data recovery <br>  + extended corporate integration <br>  + application download center <br>  + tenacious battery <br><br>  - Big brother is watching you ) <br>  - bind to corp server is required <br>  - few third-party software <br><br>  iphone <br>  + stylish design <br>  + convenient finger interface <br>  + application store <br>  + exchange support <br>  + enhanced music features <br>  + fast embedded browser <br>  + many programs using the user's location <br><br>  - sync via iTunes only <br>  - it is impossible to edit Office files without third-party applications <br>  - a small number of navigation programs <br>  - apple's paranoid copyright policy <br>  - lack of a normal book reader </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71228/</a></p>
