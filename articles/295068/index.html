This is 50 000 rubles a year then.  50 000/12 = 4166 rubles per month.  I said - yes, how much money can be earned on a blog.  But it will be the only 4166 that he will receive per month. <br><br>  Look for another way to make money, run a blog from the heart and in the case.  Maybe sometime in your blog will accumulate materials so that the banner network, or even individual banners will begin to bring some income. <br><br>  PS add essentially <br><br>  <i>It is planned with the help of this blog to collect a certain community before launching the project, it is possible to find intelligent programmers and raise initial capital for the development of the project.</i> <br><br>  Target audience and seed capital are more effectively sought in other ways.  Through already known popular sites where the target audience already lives.  Through exchanges where developers live.  And through the sites where the capital lives.  I will say that only a blog, especially in the first six months, will not give any audience or capital. <br><br>  However, the success story of startups were different and information about this could be absolutely inconsistent. <br>  Some started from scratch, made only a promotional site (conventionally, like a blog, but with a stretch - there are very few pages) with reliable and high-quality information about the idea and at every corner shouted about their project, attracting audiences and capital.  If the audience was going, they started to make a massive product. <br>  Some made a high-quality product for a limited audience, a small batch, prototypes, and only then engaged in promotion, having a real product and real reviews.  At this moment they created a blog or a promo site. <br><br>  <i>It seems to me that this idea is taking place, but we have problems with the calculation of profits and, accordingly, the prediction of costs and break-even point in the business plan.</i> <br><br>  I do not want to stop the flight of fantasy and the fountains of enthusiasm.  On the uplift a lot of good things have been done.  However, I think someone from your team needs to surf the Internet and buy books on the organization of their business, that is, about startups, business models, business plans, marketing, project management.  In fact, this is a very interesting topic for self-education. </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/google%2520analytics/interest_questions"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b42/fca/d99/b42fcad99833435e85879c911ed72cb9.png" align="right"></a> <h4>  <a href="https://toster.ru/tag/google%2520analytics/interest_questions">Google Analytics section</a> </h4><br>  Interest Ask: <br><br>  - <a href="https://toster.ru/q/249016">‚ÄúHow to remove a canceled order from Metrics and Analytics statistics?‚Äù</a> <br><br>  <i>Good day,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The metric is integrated with the site.</i>  <i>E-commerce is set up in Anlytics.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As soon as a person transfers from the site to payment, the amount of his order is recorded in the statistics and displayed in the "Revenue" column.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There are those who have not paid.</i>  <i>Their amounts are substantial and spoil everything.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How to manually delete canceled orders later?</i>  <i>To their amount disappeared from the "Income".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A) to Analytics (I've heard for a long time that you need to send the same request, only the order amount should be with a minus).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>B) in Metric</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Maybe someone solved the problem.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Or met the link where it is described in detail.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Or give a piece of code, instead of a thousand words.</i>  <i>The programmer will figure it out.</i> <blockquote>  1.

I recommend, for simplicity, to create a story map project: storiesonboard.com <br><br>  Then divide everything into releases, select those features that should be included in the MVP (not yet a finished product, but that minimal set of features that makes the product already minimally useful). <br><br>  Well, something like this.  As far as I understand, you want to do something in the spirit of ask.fm or similar nonsense, and therefore there will be nothing super complicated here.  The only question is the sequence of how you will organize the development process itself.  If the service starts to grow (‚Äúbig‚Äù service is a very subjective thing) - you can think about microservices. </blockquote><blockquote>  By experience I will say this: <br>  1. Read what schemes of the application already exist. <br>  2. Draw a basic diagram of the interaction of application components. <br>  3. Think over the logic of each component and connections on the leaf, in a notebook. <br>  4. When the figure shows that all components are marked, all the connections are drawn, and the scheme as a whole is finished, then ONLY then start programming the components. </blockquote><blockquote>  start with API.
