Want to know why this happens even in large online stores?  We go under the cut, do not be shy, tickets are paid ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Every time I read another review / post / complaint, etc.  about the ‚Äúbad work‚Äù of the online store (IM) I want to scream from the universal innocence and short-sightedness.  Immediately I will warn probably among the audience of Habr people about whom I will tell little, because everyone here understands IT and is less or less adequate.  But the majority of buyers are ordinary mortals, some of them do not even know how to use the browser, so the cases are very different. <br><br>  So, what often complain about: <br>  - the <b>goods hang on the website in stock, but in fact it is not in stock.</b>  <b>Are you not there you can hire a girl who will follow this?</b> <br>  Well, there may be a thousand reasons. <br>  1. For example, suppliers send balances twice a day, at the time of the formation of these balances, the goods were in stock, after the file was sent out after 10 minutes another customer arrived and took it. <br>  2. The product is in stock, but it is defective, until no one came to order it.  Every day, going to touch the entire warehouse is impossible <br>  3. The product was one thing, it was simultaneously ordered by 2 clients and had not yet had time to update the information.  Accordingly, one customer will not see the goods.

      <br>
      <b>- by phone they said that the goods are in stock, they said they would bring it, and on the day of the delivery they said that there was no product.</b> <br>  There are many reasons: the car from the supplier did not reach, arrived at the wrong time (the supplier may be from another city), broke down, the goods were hit while they were being transported. <br><br>  - <b>again the product is not available, is it really so difficult to buy everything at the warehouse and wait for me to be beautiful while I decide to buy from you?</b> <br>  If you call an e-book store, then yes, you can keep a warehouse, but if 40-50 thousand goods are sold on the site for example and the average cost of a position is, for example, $ 100 - consider it yourself (and there are a lot more goods sold per day than 1 piece, that is, in the warehouse you need to keep a lot) + what area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe warehouse you need to have.  In fairness, I will say that small shops, highly specialized, or shops belonging to a supplier, of course, can afford to keep everything in stock.  But this model is not for everyone. <br><br>  - <b>there is only one price on the site, but in fact it turned out to be more expensive, are you breeding me?</b> <br>  Several suppliers have this product; at the time of loading the prices, the lowest price is chosen.  When the supplier with the lowest price sells the goods, and the prices have not yet been updated (this happens often), there is an eternal problem of humanity, either to tell the person that the product is out of stock, or to offer at a higher price, everyone here does it at their discretion. <br><br>  - <b>in the description it was stated that the compressor of the Philippine assembly and turned out to be Malaysian, you are deceivers - take my refrigerator back.</b> <br>  Suppliers do not provide such detailed information, and at times they themselves do not have it, so it is impossible to automate the process of updating the content to such trifles.  If the manufacturer (for example, Samsung) found this compressor good enough to insert it into its products - do you really care how it will be? <br><br>  - <b>hello, this is Vasya, what did they promise to bring there with my order in the evening, already 18.05 and no one had even called?</b>  <b>I refused the order.</b> <br>  There are two chips at once, one of them is my favorite.  Vasya does not come to mind that Vasya today was more than 100. Plus the eternal method of Stirlitz, who knew that only the last is remembered.  When a person is told that the delivery will be after 18, (on the website it is indicated more precisely from 18 to 21) he is firmly convinced that after 18 it is obligatory at 18.02 and then you have to call the swear. <br><br>  - <b>yesterday they brought me a bread machine, and now when on the 4th program I fall asleep the yellow flour at the full moon, smearing borax fat in front of this, the dough doesn‚Äôt go up to Feng Shui and the energy of qi leaves bread before I eat it.</b>  <b>And my friends have the same and there does not leave - take it back, return my money.</b> <br>  1. READ the instruction, and only then call to swear that something is not working.  You can‚Äôt even imagine how many people can‚Äôt put batteries in banal form, and they call with swears, what kind of shit they brought. <br>  2. Even if the goods are actually faulty, this fact must be confirmed by the service center, otherwise IM will not be able to return it back to the supplier, therefore, for all the pleas that "you just brought it to me yesterday and it does not work - please take it away" There will be one answer - go to the service center, we don‚Äôt really know whether it works or you have already managed to break something.  We would be happy to immediately replace with another one the same, but we cannot. <br><br>  <b>- in your service centers terrible service, you do not care about customers</b> <br>  Not everyone understands that an online store cannot contain hundreds of service centers throughout the country - these are service centers of vendors selling certain goods, and they have nothing to do with the quality of customer service there <br><br>  - <b>I came to pick up the goods and waited 2 hours in the queue, what a mess?</b> <br>  This happens from time to time if it was in the courtyard on December 28 or March 7, and half the city came to the same store for gifts - you had to think earlier.  You do not complain about Auchan that you need to carry a cart on your hands on weekends? <br><br>  - <b>I immediately buy 10 goods for 5k dollars from you, and you don‚Äôt want to give me a normal discount</b> <br>  IM really wants to make and discounts, and many other utilities, and whenever possible give gifts and additional free services, BUT it should be understood that the goods and margins are very different, for example, on electronics, they wind up 5-7% on average ( no one ever believes, but it is), and on jewelry, maybe 300% -400% (forgive me jewelers) because these are standard numbers for industries.  Therefore, even if you buy 10 laptops, unfortunately no one can give you a 50% discount. <br><br>  Of course, in addition to the above cases, there are situations when employees of the MI have failed or failed to see it, but let's look at it differently: there are 15 people in the processing chain of your order, what is the probability that one of these 15 will make a mistake over 100 orders?  Mistakes happen to everyone, the same people as everyone else work in IM.  And nobody ever makes a mistake in your work?  Does everything work like a clock?  Are you always 100% working through every little thing, or sometimes close your eyes to something?  Nobody is perfect. <br>  From what quickly came to my mind, everything seems to be, if there are more questions that have not been answered - ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114060/</a></p>
