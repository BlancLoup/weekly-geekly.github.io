  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to spend less time in social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An Internet user spends almost 2 hours a day on social networks *.  And this time is growing every year.  If you are not ready to give up social networks altogether, but want to free up some of your time, first you need to separate the flies from the meatballs and figure out how this time is spent.  All <b>activity in social networks can be divided into 3 types:</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>Communication</b> - the creation, maintenance and development of relationships.  It is dictated by our natural needs for communication and interaction.  Productivity depends on how much this communication enriches you and others, improves your relations with people important to you. <br>  2. the <b>media</b> .  Almost all groups in social networks, as well as many personal pages are nothing more than the media.  It is about creating content (photos, videos, text materials) and posting it in order to gain an audience and influence it (commercial, political and / or personal).  The created promotion channel is sold, leased (advertising) or used for the personal purposes of the owner.  If you are purposefully acting in social networks, as the media, of course, this is a productive activity for you.  Pereposta someone else's content are not media activity.  In this case, you simply become part of someone else's promotion channel. <br>  3. <b>Content consumption</b> .  This view news feeds, chronicles, "walls", etc.  This is where most of the time is usually spent, and quite unproductive.  Everything that we consume can be curious, useful and necessary.  Curious is all that satisfies our curiosity and entertains us.  We will call useful what, in our opinion, can be useful in the future.  The right is what we need now.  Depending on the person and the situation, the information necessary for one may be only useful for someone, and simply curious for another.  For example, this article for a person who is now seriously engaged in self-organization may be necessary.  For someone who complains about the lack of time, but thinks of doing this ‚Äúsometime later,‚Äù it will be simply useful.  And for those who have not thought about it at all - information may, at best, seem curious. <br><br>  <b>What is informational garbage</b> <br>  Information that has at least one of the signs: <br>  a) Does not relate to your goals. <br>  b) Is outside our sphere of influence. <br>  c) Negatively affects you. <br>  A typical example of informational garbage is all sorts of news (not only in social networks).  This may seem strange, but if you think about it, you will see that they often meet all three criteria. <br><br>  <b>What to cut off</b> <br>  1. The consumption of information garbage (now you know how to determine it). <br>  2. Consumption of any content other than the desired one (in the context described above). <br>  3. Communication with people and interaction with channels that broadcast information garbage (if they are not cut off, they will still push this information into you). <br>  The first and second constraints can be entered sequentially.  The third is parallel.
