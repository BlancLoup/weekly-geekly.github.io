  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Officials and businessmen began to use instant messengers twice as often</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Corporate customers of telecom operators are going to communicate via instant messengers.  The largest telecom operator in Russia MTS in the first half of the year recorded a sharp increase in traffic in this segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74e/2bf/917/74e2bf917b0c47e38fddfd5fd84d50cb.JPG"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Grows with operators</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Corporate subscribers began to actively use messengers like WhatsApp, Viber, etc. The MTS operator recorded a twofold increase in the consumption of similar services: in the traffic structure of MTS corporate clients, this segment grew from 4 to 9% (first half of 2015 to the same period of 2014), told the representative of the MTS Dmitry Solodovnikov.  According to AC &amp; M Consulting, MTS is the leader in the corporate communications market in Russia with a share of 40% of subscribers; in monetary terms, MTS accounts for more than 35% of the market, leads the statistics of Solodovnikov.

      The overall structure of using mobile Internet is changing - more and more often companies are using all available communication channels, including not only mobile mail, but also instant messengers, online conferences, special mobile applications, to improve business efficiency, notes Solodovnikov.  Every second new MTS subscriber in the business segment uses not only voice services, but also mobile Internet: Internet usage penetration among corporate clients increased by 10% at MTS, the operator‚Äôs spokesman said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúVimpelCom‚Äù and ‚ÄúMegaFon‚Äù refused to give data on the change in the traffic of instant messengers. <br><br>  The appearance on the market of new mobile devices, business applications, the development of cloud services has led to the fact that the average monthly consumption of data traffic in the b2b segment of VimpelCom grew by 175% year on year (the second quarter of 2015 compared to the same period of 2014). ), said the representative of "VimpelCom" Anna Aybasheva. <br><br>  The revenue structure of mobile operators is changing and will continue to change towards the provision of data services.  The President of MTS, Andrey Dubovskov, on announcing financial results for the second quarter of 2015, emphasized that voice communication should sooner or later be free, and the operator concentrates just on data transfer revenues. <br><br>  In recent years, all mobile operators have a distribution of revenues towards increasing the consumption of traffic from mobile gadgets, says Sergey Kravtsov, the creator of QIP and 4talk messengers.  People start using the Internet more, messengers, prefer to send SMS less often and call much less - this is primarily due to the emergence of a standard such as LTE, thanks to which the Internet has become fast, it has become much more convenient to use, Kravtsov believes. <br><br>  <b>Grows with instant messengers</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The audience of the eight most popular messengers in Russia (Facebook Messenger, Hangouts, ICQ, Mail.Ru Agent, Telegram, Skype, Viber, WhatsApp) in June 2015 amounted to 11.6 million people (in cities of Russia with a population of over 700 thousand ; 12-64 years), follows from the study of TNS Web Index Mobile.  From January to June, the audience of the WhatsApp mobile application grew by 11.4% to 7.2 million users, Facebook Messenger - by 14.3% to almost 1.5 million people. <br><br>  According to App Annie's statistics, on September 1, the top most popular services on the iOS platform include WhatsApp messengers (fourth place) and Viber (sixth), Google Play WhatsApp ranks second, Viber - fourth. <br><br>  Messenger traffic can grow and grows like an avalanche, says Content Review editor Sergey Polovnikov.  With the help of instant messengers, they send photos, files, make calls, that is, such services have long ceased to be ‚Äújust about text‚Äù, which naturally affects traffic, he concludes. <br><br>  <b>Threat from above</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Slow the rapid development of instant messengers can the state.  The question of using foreign IT services, including WhatsApp, is now raised at the very top. <br><br>  On Wednesday, August 26, Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev criticized the officials who were working for foreign services.  According to Patrushev, the use of such solutions harms the security of state and municipal information systems. <br><br>  Patrushev's words were also developed by State Duma deputies.  Vice-Speaker of the lower house Social Revolutionary Nikolai Levichev on the same day on the TV channel "Russia 24" spoke about the need to prohibit civil servants to use foreign computer programs and applications not only at work, but also on personal electronic devices.  A member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption United Russia party Ilya Kostunov also proposed to introduce sanctions for using products from Google, WhatsApp and other services. <br><br>  On Thursday, August 27, the readiness to block employees access to document exchange services and to instant messengers was reported by the Moscow Region government.  According to the press service, it would be done from October in pursuance of an action plan approved by Governor Andrey Vorobyev for switching to Russian Internet services and software.  And in the future, the Moscow region officials will use a ‚Äúunified messaging platform‚Äù in which ‚Äúthey use cryptographic protection tools licensed by the FSB‚Äù. <br><br>  Operators are also supporting the trend to fight messengers.  In mid-July, in an interview with Russia 24, MegaFon President Ivan Tavrin spoke of the need to regulate WhatsApp, Viber and Skype.  According to Tavrin, messengers work in a gray zone, outside the regulation adopted in the telecommunications industry.  The head of "MegaFon" then stressed that they are used by terrorists and organizers of spam mailings, and this problem must be solved, because "security must be above all."  At the same time, Tavrin admitted that it is convenient to use WhatsApp and Viber, since you can create groups in them and using them it is easier to send photos than via SMS. <br><br>  The attempt to oblige officials to abandon public postal services and instant messengers is not made for the first time, says leading analyst of the Russian Association of Electronic Communications Karen Ghazaryan: ‚ÄúFrom a security point of view, officials should not use public services, both American and Russian, as they create a serious the problem of leakage, especially given the low literacy in information security.  However, in personal conversations, officials admit that they use mail, for example, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù instead of service, because it is convenient.  These are the results of the ‚ÄúElectronic Government‚Äù program, for which billions of rubles were allocated, ‚Äùconcludes Ghazaryan. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDespite the fact that the instant messengers that are now common in Russia are a foreign product, there are ways to protect information from unauthorized access.  In addition, it is advisable to develop alternatives for corporate needs, to offer such a tool for intra-corporate communications, which will be guaranteed to be protected, ‚Äùsays the director general of TMT Consulting Konstantin Ankilov. <br><br>  <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/01/09/2015/55e59fe49a794729b451f7a4">RBC</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294182/</a></p>
