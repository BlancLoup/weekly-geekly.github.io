Strange as it may seem, but the atavisms of that time are still alive today - many professions are traditionally considered to be purely masculine, and not many people manage to break this ideological barrier. <br><br>  There is no need to go far; the ratio of female to male <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/">among the residents of Habrahabr</a> is less than 1 to 10 (At the time of writing the post - 101448 men against 7772 women). <br><br>  Most of the IT teams are like a monastery.  Girls are found in advertising, marketing, a little less often in design and graphics, but very rarely in the "holy of holies" - in programming.

      There are not so many girls in the large Mail.Ru team, but there are some.  And one of them - Catherine Trefilova <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lecharton/" class="user_link">lecharton</a> - developer from <a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/">Mail.Ru Poster</a> , we decided to take a short interview. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e54/3db/6e9/e543db6e92bee077e1d466e0f583f478.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>When did you first start programming what prompted you to do this?</b> <br><br>  When I was 11 years old, my father brought a computer home.  It was installed for me a few toys and Photoshop.  But the most interesting thing for me was to watch what was inside the car itself.  With a computer, my father brought a book that told you what and how it works.  One of the few instructions to the technique, which I carefully read :) <br>  This, of course, is more familiar with computers, and I started programming when I was 13. I got a book with Pascal in my hands.  Any stars and squares.  I was amazed that the ability to correctly describe the task allows you to do so much.  From that moment on, I fell in love with programming. <br>  Besides, I always loved drawing.  Familiarity with Photoshop turned into a passion for web-design, which, in turn, grew into an interest in web-development. <br><br>  <b>What editor do you use for development?</b> <br><br>  VIM, he is great!  I used Sublime for a long time, tried Komodo and Geany.  But I always wanted to twist something, improve.  Then I met VIM.  I read about the commands and settings.  Now I can‚Äôt even imagine how to use something else, I always want to finish the work by typing: w <br><br>  <b>When and how did you meet Perl?</b> <br><br>  At his first job.  I studied at the 4th year.  At the university, we wrote our projects mainly in Python, and at work it was necessary to maintain the old and develop new functionality in Perl.  At first it was hard.  There was no experience, everyone around knew nothing about Perl.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt immediately stumbled upon the book "Learning Perl", which I regret very much.  It would save a lot of time.  On the Internet, I met Yaroslav Korshak, he helped me a lot then.  He told that it is necessary to read and what is desirable. <br>  When I figured it out a bit, I fell in love with Perl.  You can do everything in different ways.  This incredible freedom won me! <br><br>  <b>What other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare you interested in working with?</b> <br><br>  Recently, functional Lisp, Haskell programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare very interesting to me.  A wonderful feeling when the brain "cracks", rearranging.  But to write something serious on them is not possible.  Very often I work with JavaScript.  Sometimes I play with Perl6 to know what is happening to it, what's new in it. <br><br>  <b>What do you think is the biggest advantage of Perl?</b> <br><br>  His freedom!  Probably, this can be considered a disadvantage, but for me, Perl's elasticity is an advantage.  It allows you to solve any problem in different ways.  You can not just do everything, you can do everything the way you want. <br>  And of course, one of the main advantages of Perl is the people who write on it.  Perl has a beautiful, friendly community, I have not seen this in any of the other languages.  People just live it, enjoy their work, do something new and share it with each other. <br><br>  <b>What properties do you think the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the future should have?</b> <br><br>  I think the languages ‚Äã‚Äãrun in the browser are in an advantageous position.  I'm still waiting for someone in this area to compete with JavaScript.  If we assume that such a competitor has appeared, then it should have an intuitive syntax.  If you look around you will notice that more and more people are interested in programming.  They should be comfortable and pleasant to write code. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d50/c38/4b6/d50c384b6f956daf971b926781f3084f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>How do you think it can be explained that the majority of programmers are men?</b> <br><br>  Probably a matter of stereotypes. <br>  I studied at the school, and in my group there were more girls than boys.  Mathematics and programming are given to women in no way harder, and sometimes even easier, because we are diligent and better adapted to the hard work.  But at the end of the university, almost all the girls chose some other profession.  This was influenced by public opinion that the programmer is a man‚Äôs job. <br><br>  <b>Have you ever felt discriminated or biased by male colleagues?</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately yes.  It is very difficult to work with such men. <br>  When I encountered this attitude for the first time, I was very worried, trying to prove that I was being underestimated.  And angry, very angry.  And then I realized that this did not concern me at all.  After all, from the fact that someone does not believe in my abilities, I do not write worse code.  Just stopped paying attention, and life has become easier. <br><br>  <b>Recently, more and more gender-related scandals have arisen in the programmer environment.</b>  <b>Does this problem really exist, or is it contrived?</b>  <b>Does the gender of a programmer differ in different language communities?</b> <br><br>  Honestly, I have not heard of such scandals.  Most programmers are smart, polite people who are not prone to chauvinism.  Many, on the contrary, are glad to the girls in the community and are willing to help them to settle.  Do not judge by several exceptions. <br>  Does attitude differ in different linguistic communities?  The fewer girls write in this programming language, the more men from his community are skeptical of them.  But still, these men will be very few.  Most happy girls in their ranks. <br><br>  <b>Is it necessary to specifically register CoC at conferences?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Tricky question.  Do you mean some rules governing communication between men and women?  I think such rules are not needed, men and women are equal and the rules can be general. <br>  If we are talking about the observance of general norms of behavior, then such rules, of course, should be.  After all, this is a public event, and everyone should be comfortable with it. <br><br>  <b>What tasks have to be solved using Perl?</b> <br><br>  Now I work as a programmer in Mail.Ru Group, one of the largest Internet companies in the Russian-speaking Internet, in the Mail.Ru Poster project.  The backend of the project is completely written in Perl, so that all the tasks that I solve, I solve in this language.  I am engaged in the support of the existing functionality and the development of a new one.  I was very lucky with the team, these are talented and enthusiastic people.  It is interesting and pleasant to work with them.  It's very cool here! <br><br>  <b>How to introduce girls to programming?</b>  <b>Should I advise you to learn Perl?</b> <br><br>  I think you need to stop believing that female programmers are something special.  And that "not a feminine thing."  Choosing a profession, many are afraid of such an attitude. <br><br>  Should I advise you to learn Perl?  Of course it is!  This is an excellent language to do so many interesting things! <br><br>  <b>Do you like to attend perl conferences?</b> <br><br>  I adore Perl conferences.  My first conference is YAPC :: Russia + Perl Mova 2012. There I saw how many interesting things are written in Perl and met interesting people.  After that, I was so energized that I moved to Moscow! <br><br>  <b>Did you like speeches at the conference?</b> <br><br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/22589150&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgfIDMeOpWDXe1AvEAkI85uV0aB4w" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  I really liked it, I plan to repeat it. <br>  Speaking is very useful, while you are preparing, you can look at the topic differently.  During the speech, you realize that there are people who are interested in this topic, they may have similar problems and completely different solutions.  It is very motivating. <br><br>  <b>Describe some interesting "chip" that you implemented on Perl.</b> <br><br>  It was interesting to develop an integration system for the company I worked for and its clients.  Think over the architecture, make it convenient for users and administrators of the resource.  I had to work with certificates, means of cryptographic protection of information.  Difficult and confusing, but very exciting! <br>  The funniest thing was to implement a tool for printing tags from the administrative panel.  Quite a different feeling when the hardware interaction with the code goes beyond the mere display of information on the screen. <br>  Now in our project we solve many interesting problems related to the load.  You can always write code that works faster, I like to learn it from my colleagues. <br><br>  <b>What interesting foreign resources inspire you?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://perlhacks.com/">http://perlhacks.com</a> is one of my favorite blogs!  Often described some little things that are difficult to learn on their own.  Very inspiring to write code, taking into account the features of Perl, its capabilities. <br>  And, of course, <a href="http://blogs.perl.org/users/perl_5_porters_summaries/">http://blogs.perl.org/users/perl_5_porters_summaries/</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b77/54a/8a6/b7754a8a60ccfc85c48fe1fa17cd34cb.jpg"><br><br>  PS The purpose of this interview is not to launch a feminist movement in Habr√© or provoke a holivar in the style of ‚ÄúBattle of the sexes‚Äù. <br>  We placed it on our blog with the only purpose to show the girls, who are thinking about choosing (or changing) a profession, to ‚Äútry to taste‚Äù programming.  Believe, it captures no worse than embroidery! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220519/</a></p>
