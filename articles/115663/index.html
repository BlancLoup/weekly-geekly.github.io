Nevertheless, advertising of any copies on the web can be seen with tiring regularity - contextual advertising systems are not protected from such advertising.  However, Google is going to deal with "replicas", which was reported in the company's blog.  The beginning of the struggle was marked by the closure of more than 50 thousand accounts that placed ads of this kind. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For the sake of fairness, it is worth noting that in the AdWords rules, there used to be a clause about banning advertising of counterfeit goods.  However, the rules are rules, but who observes them in our time?  Moreover, the corporation itself is not very actively tracking such advertisements.  Yes, something was blocked, but it is a drop in the ocean.  Now, Google is going to start draining this very sea, for which it has invested heavily.  According to the corporation, 95% of advertisements of counterfeit goods have already been blocked.

      By the way, advertising of any kind of online movies and pirated content in general is also prohibited in AdWords, but this prohibition is quite easily avoided by those who need it.  Let's hope that blocking advertising of illegal goods will be really effective.  In principle, if Google will fight with fake products in AdWords advertising as well as with content farms in its own search results, then maybe after a while such advertising will really become much less.  It is unlikely, of course, all this will disappear completely, because there is always a way around the filter or algorithm, but for the most part the advertising of fakes will disappear. <br><br>  To increase the effectiveness of the fight against advertising of illegal goods, Google introduces new methods of work: <br><br>  - reduction of the response time to the consideration of a complaint about advertising fake goods to 24 hours; <br>  - the prohibition of placing AdSense on sites where replicas are sold; <br>  - simplification of the procedure for filing a complaint against fake advertising; <br><br>  Presumably, very good news for corporations that produce original products.  As for the Chinese, producing various kinds of ‚ÄúNokla‚Äù, I think they will have no special problems, at the present time the demand even exceeds the supply. <br><br>  Well, let's see how the situation will develop in the future. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://googlepolicyeurope.blogspot.com/2011/03/keeping-counterfeits-out-of-ads.html">googlepolicyeurope</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115663/</a></p>
