Anger Management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/029/36c/6e9/02936c6e9cb43647abd2676c5980b665.jpg"><br>  The format of the blog involves close and direct communication with its reader, which, in fact, it is valuable.  However, sometimes interactive brings negative emotions.  What if your post is gaining negative comments?  How to treat them?  What to do?  We bring to your attention a translation of two short articles by a journalist and the regular author of the blog at <a href="http://software.intel.com/blogs">Intel Developer Zone,</a> <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/user/540419">Wendy Thomas</a> , who answers these questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Correctly work with negative comments. </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d25/ba1/5d1/d25ba15d1d3cf7278e8b3b26fc0e9da5.jpg">  So, you wrote a blog post, and this post saw the whole world.  Of course, you hoped to bring something useful and interesting to the world, or simply to express your opinion.  Everything looks quite good, until you notice that your post is starting to collect negative comments. <br>  What to do? <br>  It must always be remembered that negative comments are not personal attacks on the author (although this happens sometimes), but simply an expression of someone's opinion.  Someone does not agree with what he just read, and expresses it in a rather sharp form. <br>  You should not also conflict with such a commentator.  After all, this thread of mutual insults will be seen by all your readers, which will not in the best way affect the reputation of your company. <br><br><h5>  If you can not, then you can not </h5>  Determine in advance whether the comments in your comments are obscene or, for example, ‚Äúpadonkaffsky‚Äù slang.  If it is unacceptable - then boldly delete such comments, leaving a note for other readers that the comment has been deleted for violating the rules of the resource. <br><br><h5>  Does it make sense in negative comments? </h5>  Negative comments are also comments.  If this is not just trolling and offtopic, but an angry comment containing at least a piece of rational criticism - pay attention to it.  If the problem really exists and it is your company's fault - do not be afraid to apologize (or return the money if you are the owner of an online store, for example).

    <h5>  Point to errors </h5>  If the commentator is wrong (and on the Internet someone is always wrong), point out to him the mistakes in his arguments.  Let the following readers notice this and not take his delusions for the truth.  Only this must be done correctly, without provoking further fights. <br><br>  Do not just ignore negative comments.  Either delete them, or respond to them, trying to figure out the problem.  But do not leave it all to chance.  After all, if such an angry comment will just hang on your site without an answer, other readers will think that the commentator is right, and the administration is simply unable to respond to his claim. <br>  And keep in mind that how you solve such problems is always observed by many visitors to your site.  Handle negative comments wisely - this will allow you to keep your audience loyalty and find new customers. <br>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/07/16/dont-let-them-get-you-down-handling-negative-comments-with-grace/">Original</a> <br><br><h4>  3 types of negative comments and ways to deal with them </h4><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/632/f85/101/632f85101d3bec97c4eedb0aff403073.jpg">  There is a good old statement - "Black PR is the best PR."  It can be safely attributed not only to advertising or reputation, but also to the comments on your site.  After all, even the most bilious and wrathful comment may well play a good role for your resource. <br>  After all, if the comment is emotional and sincere - he invites others to participate in the discussion.  Every time someone sees a revival in the comments, there is a high probability that someone will definitely want to join. <br>  Plus, negative comments quite often initiate the beginning of useful discussions among your readers, advocates of your resource / product will leave comments on the topic, helping others to solve problems.  But this is the user interaction that you would like to see. <br>  Imagine that you are a resource manager on which such comments often slip.  Here are some ways to deal with them. <br><br><h5>  1. Offensive comments </h5>  <i>- What, seriously?</i>  <i>Then your developers are mu * aki armless!</i> <br>  If you are the owner of the resource, it means that you control its content.  And if you, as an owner, do not accept mat, insults and such things on your resource, just delete them.  Just do not delete them completely - you need to leave a message that there has recently been a comment, but now it has been deleted by the administration.  This will show other users that the resource does not just have some rules, but that violating these rules entails some sanctions.  As a result, there will be fewer such comments in the future. <br><br><h5>  2. True indignant comments </h5>  <i>- Damn, guys, yes I can not believe that you still have not fixed it.</i> <br>  If the comment contains a piece of truth (that is, an indication of a real problem), admit it.  Even if the comment is harsh and angry, just admit your mistake in a tactful manner, confirm that there really is a problem.  The best way to prevent a quarrel is to show a person that they have heard and understood him. <br><br><h5>  3. - Yes, I can write here all day </h5>  Trolls are everywhere.  If you notice that someone simply has nothing to do provokes useless correspondence, do not enter into a war of words with the commentator.  It is enough to answer him once or twice, if at the very beginning his comments somehow relate to the topic.  There is no need to delve into the discussion of things that are not related to a specific problem. <br><br>  Trolling is generally an interesting thing - if your regular readers (or members of the social community) feel that some of them are being troll, threatened or intimidated, they will defend him, supporting his point of view. <br>  Thus, discussions should be conducted as part of an adult conversation, comments should follow the rules of good form.  Try to stay professional.  Calm and mutual respect is our everything. <br>  <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2012/07/31/3-types-of-negative-comments-and-how-to-handle-them">Original</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166247/</a></p>
