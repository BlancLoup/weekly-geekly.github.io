All the guests on the stage answered the questions of the moderators, <a href="http://tc.digitaloctober.ru/bio/mike-butcher">Mike Butcher</a> and <a href="http://tc.digitaloctober.ru/bio/emma-barnett">Emma Barnett</a> , thereby replacing the usual reports with a lively question-and-answer discussion.

I will tell about it and many other things under a cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conference in Moscow differed from its European counterparts by the presence of high-ranking officials - presidential adviser Arkady Dvorkovich and Minister of Communications Igor Shchegolev, who behaved very naturally and gladly answered questions from participants. <br><br>  The first to answer the questions of the inimitable Emma Barnett was the honor of Arkady Volozh, CEO of <a href="http://yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> . <br><br><img src="http://img253.imageshack.us/img253/3015/86259063.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of interesting things, Arkady said that <b>Yandex is</b> starting to search for startups.  So, on September 1, with the help of <a href="http://www.glavstart.ru/">Glavstart,</a> they bought a subway map for the iPhone.  The next such joint event they are going to hold in December. <br><br>  When asked whether <b>Yandex</b> is going to create its own social network (like <b>Google‚Äôs</b> <a href="http://orcut.com/">Orcut</a> ), Arkady replied in the negative, adding that this is not necessary, as they are friends with all existing ones and this is enough. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="web statistics"><br>  The main priorities <b>of Yandex</b> for 2011: <br><ul><li>  Improved search; </li><li>  Search personalization (query history); </li><li>  Capture the Ukrainian and Belarusian markets. </li></ul>  The algorithm of search advertising is subject to constant improvements.  <b>Yandex</b> plans to optimize it based on user behavior, which will significantly improve the CTR.  At the same time, the meaning of contextual advertising will not change. <br><br>  Next on the stage were invited developers from <a href="http://zeptolab.com/">ZeptoLab</a> , created <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/cut-the-rope/id380293530%3Fmt%3D8">Cut The Rope</a> . <br><br><img src="http://img585.imageshack.us/img585/518/50259371.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Semyon and Efim Voinov are a digital graphic artist and programmer, respectively.  The brothers worked in different companies and joined together to create their popular project.  So was born <b>Cut The Rope</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img530.imageshack.us/img530/5158/cuttheropefirstprototyp.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After developing graphics and sound, Semyon, Yefim and other <b>ZeptoLab</b> employees chose a publisher - one of the most successful companies on the App Store of <b>Chillingo</b> .  Over the first week, more than a million users downloaded their game, and at the time of the conference the number exceeded 3 million. <br><br>  The guys showed a very cool video of their game using a fan song about the game: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjjFrd3Tu5E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi775IOr_UwhWoBaxqm4cgj8eMXcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When asked about the popularity of the game, the guys responded ‚ÄúTo <i>most iPhone and iPad users, it makes absolutely no difference what kind of graphics the game has: two- or three-dimensional.</i>  <i>The main thing is to be fun to play</i> . ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbc/dea/389/fbcdea389084a9dc91ce08c5989112d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next invited guests were Damian Doberstein from <a href="http://kupivip.ru/">KupiVIP.ru</a> (who came from Germany to conquer Runet) and Kirill Makharinsky from <a href="http://ostrovok.ru/">Ostrovok.ru</a> (who returned to Russia after studying at Oxford and the creation of <a href="http://www.younoodle.com/">YouNoodle</a> ), who were interviewed by Anton Borisovich Nosik! <br><br><img src="http://img697.imageshack.us/img697/3303/66140845.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anton Borisovich began with the words: ‚Äú <i>I'm speaking from my heart</i> ‚Äù, quoting the last <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNx5k7jKGQyU">‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù of</a> our sports minister, and in the end he joked that he lives in the suburbs and on the opposite side of Moscow from Skolkovo. <br><br>  Both respondents told why creating start-ups and starting their own business is better in Russia.  Damian said that in Germany everyone wants to work in a big company (Nosik jokes about socialism), and in Russia to be an entrepreneur.  Entrepreneurial sentiment is very strong in Russia. <br><br>  Elena Masolova ( <a href="http://addventure.to/">addventure</a> , <a href="http://www.darberry.ru/">darberry</a> ), Pavel Durov *, Dmitry Stavinsky ( <a href="http://www.evernote.com/">EverNote</a> ) talked about <b>‚ÄúWhat does Russia need - clones or original startups?‚Äù</b> <br><br>  * Of course, one of the main disappointments of the conference is the absence of Pavel Durov.  Many came to listen to him, but - alas. <br><br>  Everyone, without exception, should have remembered Elena Masolova‚Äôs bright and very energetic speech.  In her opinion, there is nothing wrong with copying successful projects.  As an example, her project ‚Äú <b>Darberry</b> ‚Äù was given, which, as is known, is an exact copy of the site ‚Äú <a href="http://www.groupon.com/">Groupon</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/1599/17099953.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dmitry Stavisky did not agree with Elena, saying that the creation of a clone could turn into a struggle with his prototype, where the alignment of forces would most likely not be in your favor. <br><br><img src="http://img31.imageshack.us/img31/240/77637985.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Emma Barnett was already bored as it was time to interview Dmitry Grishin with his <a href="http://mail.ru/">Mail.ru</a> success story.  In my opinion, this was the most interesting discussion throughout the conference. <br><br>  Dmitry made the whole audience smile, describing one popular game, the principle of which is conflict: ‚Äú <i>You were killed in the game, you go and buy powerful weapons and take revenge.</i>  <i>Your opponent buys even more powerful weapons and kills you again.</i>  <i>Then you call friends ...</i> " <br><br><img src="http://img88.imageshack.us/img88/1206/68418578.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking about <b>Mail.ru</b> , it was said that the main goal now is to make an integrated communicator, combining mail, messenger and social network.  And in the future - add to this mix and more fun.  The main competitors <b>of Mail.ru</b> Grishin consider <b>Facebook</b> and <b>Yandex</b> abroad and in Russia, respectively. <br><br>  Not paid attention to successful IPO on the London Stock Exchange.  This is an excellent course for attracting the attention of foreign investors to the Runet and an opportunity to raise Russia's prestige in the eyes of specialists who treat us with suspicion. <br><br><img src="http://img101.imageshack.us/img101/1818/74674070.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He finished his interview with Dmitry with plans for social networks, which at least slightly compensated for the absence of number 1 on Vkontakte.  Mail.ru is owned by 50% <b>of Odnoklasnikov</b> and 25% <b>of VKontakte</b> .  Now the market is growing, and all networks (including <b>‚ÄúMy World‚Äù</b> ) are developing and gathering users.  In the future <b>, Mail.ru will</b> unite these networks, making it possible, through <b>Vkontakte,</b> to communicate with <b>Odnoklassniki</b> , for example. <br><br>  Towards the end of the conference an interesting incident occurred.  Anatoly Karachinsky, speaking with Demyan Kudryavtsev on the topic <b>‚ÄúWhat to expect from online media?‚Äù</b> , Spoke in Russian, and asking how many people did not know Russian in the hall, asked the two unfortunate people to respond, give headphones to not spend time translating.  Ten minutes later, the presenter, Mike, recalled that hundreds of foreigners were watching the broadcast online and asked to be translated into a live broadcast.  As a result, Anatoly became the hero of all the jokes and anecdotes on Twitter. <br><br>  Toward the close of the event, Arkady Moreynis ( <a href="http://www.glavstart.ru/">Glavstart</a> ) conducted the ‚Äú <b>Battle of Startups</b> ‚Äù in his extravagant manner.  The main prize was boxing gloves, signed by Moreynis himself, Arkady Volozh and Mike Butcher and Dmitry Grishin.  It should be said that all startups passed the hard selection and there was definitely no ‚Äúleft‚Äù in this battle. <br><br>  1. <b>Glavbot</b> ( <a href="http://www.glavbot.ru/">www.glavbot.ru</a> ) - a project dedicated to the introduction of augmented reality technologies in web games. <br><br><img src="http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/681/33490738.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Great presentation.  The guys even brought a car for the demonstration. <br><br>  2. <b>Yam</b> ( <a href="http://www.yamlabs.com/">www.yamlabs.com</a> ) - a platform for gathering information during rallies to record the progress and decisions made. <br><br><img src="http://img43.imageshack.us/img43/4801/96822640.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Through open protocols integrated with <b>Outlook</b> and <b>Google calendar</b> .  They plan to take over the world through integration into existing successful tools like Skype. <br><br>  3. <b>Speak to it</b> ( <a href="http://www.speaktoit.com/">www.speaktoit.com</a> ) is an open and flexible platform that allows you to receive requests while answering in natural language. <br><br><img src="http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/639/28745769.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Regular presentation.  I do not remember anything. <br><br>  4. <b>ActioTV</b> ( <a href="http://www.actio.tv/">www.actio.tv</a> ) - interactive video.  You can click on the elements, which leads to a ramification of the plot and the involvement of the user. <br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/3824819.html?v=3324e49b4df81381b9c5c2fa2ebecc7b </video><br><br>  The main theme of the presentation Evolution vs Revolution.  If hypertext (html) was a text revolution, then ActioTV is a video revolution. <br><br><img src="http://img594.imageshack.us/img594/3621/14233013.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They offered a free editor for creating interactive video with Flash, SilverLight and HTML5 support. <br><br><img src="http://img690.imageshack.us/img690/7961/42936035.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They had the most ‚Äúadult‚Äù presentation, an excellent slide design.  The guys exist for a long time and it is strange to position them as a startup.  They didn‚Äôt meet the time and didn‚Äôt want to leave the stage, ‚ÄúOne more slide ...‚Äù. <br><br>  5. <b>Social Catcher</b> ( <a href="http://www.socialcatcher.com/">www.socialcatcher.com</a> ) - a service that automatically builds a wish-list on accounts in social networks. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/16698356&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhis5gxf2E74ZOJ_M_P3HdSEdrxAZQ" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Social catcher" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Service was developed year.  Already have a website and application on Facebook.  Soon they will complete a widget for online stores that will tell you what you want to buy. <br><br>  Mike Butcher checked the service after the presentation and was shown the book ‚ÄúHow to make good presentations‚Äù.  The speaker said that this is rather what he himself needs :) <br><br>  6. <b>Zingaya</b> ( <a href="http://www.zingaya.com/">www.zingaya.com</a> ) - button on the site for customers.  By clicking on it, they can call the support service from the browser for free.  The call is broadcast on skype / phone / sip. <br><br><img src="http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/2082/42180843.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Claim that they are better than competitors because of the quality of sound transmission.  The trick is to use the hidden features of Flash. <br><br>  7. <b>Speech cloud</b> ( <b>speechcloud.com</b> , launch in 2011) - build a text index for video and audio files.  Later you can search for any textual information, and the system will find in which file and in which place they talked about it. <br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/9244/54640251.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The guys keep the core developers team a secret so that they will not be lured away :) <br><br>  8. <b>Goozzy</b> ( <a href="http://www.goozzy.com/">www.goozzy.com</a> ) is a meta-Internet project about which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/107564/">they wrote</a> on Habr√©. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fce/23f/c24/fce23fc24466de7cbdeccc5dc6bf4f23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the beginning of the speech, the speaker made a <a href="http://twitter.com/">tweet</a> from the stage. <br><br><img src="http://img440.imageshack.us/img440/510/42660888.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Energy did not leave anyone indifferent, and all of the jury expressed their opinion.  Mike Butcher spoke sarcastically that this is more of a feature than a company. <br><br>  9. <b>Mixxmuse</b> ( <a href="http://www.mixxmuse.com/">www.mixxmuse.com</a> ) - iPad-based applications for creating mixes from samples with the original interface. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLT3gBKI5Xc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDDEkGDJnHYAfsIDCdfDbTXhhFRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Half of the presentation was taken by the video, as they did the hip-hop mix with the help of this piece.  The guys claim that they are going to create new way to sell music, break it into pieces and sell as tracks. <br><br>  According to the results of voting, the jury won <b>MixxMuse</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img225.imageshack.us/img225/4550/49001549.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that the first international conference of TechCrunch Moscow 2010 was held at a very high level.  Among the advantages I would like to note: <br><ul><li>  <b>Venue</b>  The Digital October Technopark, in which they invested about $ 10 million, became an excellent place for holding a conference of this magnitude. </li><li>  <b>Excellent organization</b> .  No waiting lists for registration, delicious food and no problems with accommodation. </li><li>  <b>Leading</b> .  Mike Butcher and Emma Barnett made up a very organic tandem. </li><li>  <b>The public</b> .  As Damian Doberstein said in an interview, "In Germany, everyone wants to work in a big company, and in Russia, to be an entrepreneur."  TechCrunch Moscow was visited by just such Russians. </li></ul>  I would like to say a separate respect to Edik Shenderovich for organizing such a large-scale event.  It remains to hope that the organizers of the conferences will continue to try to keep the bar set at <b>TechCrunch Moscow 2010</b> . <br><br>  Who else was with Habra?  How do you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110083/</a></p>
