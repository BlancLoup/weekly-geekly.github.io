  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scrap for monitoring site traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, I became interested in this question: <br><h4>  And what are the utilities for monitoring site traffic? </h4><br>  The task was to find a program suitable for the following points: <br><br><ul><li>  Sufficient amount of visitor information. </li><li>  Counting accuracy </li><li>  Convenient and intuitive interface </li><li>  Various parameter analyzers (path, backlinks, keywords - well, the more the better) </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For a start, I have familiarized myself in some detail with the aWstats utility running on the server side and reading directly the web server logs from the domain as a whole, no matter how deep the nesting is. <br><br>  <b>aWstats</b> <br>  I think this is one of the most accurate tools for counting unique users of your site.  A huge utility problem is a very limited set of functions.  There is no analysis of the paths, neither for the search queries, nor a detailed article for every visitor.  Perhaps there are any add-ons (plug-ins) for <b>aWstats</b> , which include the above items, but I don‚Äôt know about them and I‚Äôll be very happy if you tell me. <br>  In general, <u>I would rate it on a solid 6 out of 10</u> , solely because of its accuracy.

      The second guinea pig: <b>Google Analytics</b> (GA) <br>  All known Tula, provided by webmasters to help, for in-depth analysis of site traffic.  The program is very advanced, with a bunch of functions and capabilities, at the moment one of the most worthy statistics, which are provided free of charge.  Only here is a small snag: Indicators of unique users per day are very different from each other.  I didn‚Äôt like it, because in theory a <b>Google analyst</b> simply cannot be more accurate than a program that reads the web server logs - because the web server knows about every user without exception !!!  therefore, despite the code set on each page of the resource, google-analytics does not take into account some important indicator ....  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/artemp/" class="user_link">artemp</a> !, explained that GA (like other js-based) does not consider those who do not download them (adblock, noscript etc.) and / or do not execute (disabled js).  <b>GA</b> <u>I would put 7 out of 10.</u> <br><br>  Well, let's continue our research ... <br><br>  <b>tracewatch</b> program <br><br>  A php script that works like an ordinary counter.  Configured by introducing add.  code in the skin of the site.  The installation is quite simple, the setup is also not very complicated.  The most important thing is functionality - I‚Äôll say that large, large, with text inside, clickable flash rectangles on the user‚Äôs paths page provide excellent navigation and ease of visual perception - this is undoubtedly a plus, it has many necessary functions.  The program is done quite qualitatively, keywords, path analysis, backlinks, search engine queries - almost all the necessary functionality is present ... ... but again the numbers do not want to match the indicators of <b>aWstats</b> and the work with search bots is terribly realized - it‚Äôs not clear whether the glitch is what, or something else, but it does not show the number of hits made by bots and the number of hits by bots.  As far as I understood, without delving into the essence of the question strongly, there it is necessary to add something in the database or in the config file.  Again, when installing the code in the forum, there were problems with indexing a specific forum page.  since it only showed links of this type /forum/viewtopic.php, it was necessary to correct the configs again to cure it - it was bad. <br>  <u>program rating: 8 out of 10</u> <br><br>  What is it?  I tried 4 programs, all 4 with the ‚Äúname‚Äù and they all differ in the readings !!!  Where is the truth ?! <br><br>  We do not have the patience, go to google looking for programs to analyze traffic to the site.  The first thing that came to my hand was the <b>phpTraffiCa</b> program - another analyzer of incoming and outgoing traffic to the site, naturally open source code, respectively, for free ... well, we don‚Äôt use others, install the whole thing on the host, configure it, again, set up and install it‚Äôs impossible to set up the standard ‚Äî go to configs, upload to the host, web install is done.  The same garbage with the setting: php code in the header, footer.  In general, anywhere on the site, would be shown to all pages.  So, the first login to the admin: <br><br>  Pleases: by default there is Russian! (Respect and Respect, it was necessary to install it in addition) <br>  pleases: there is no username input line! (as it turned out to be very convenient, we register the admin nickname along with the pass in the config file, and then we enter only with a password) <br><br>  The main functionality: the whole set.  Path analyzer, query analyzer from search engines, referrers, keywords, bots visitor counting and filtering them from statistics.  And the most important thing!!!  we are approaching the performance of our <b>aWstats</b> .  <u>My score is 9 out of 10</u> <br><br>  I want to say that aWstats takes information on the domain as a whole, and not on specific pages of sites located within the domain, since all the other above mentioned programs do.  It should also be noted that my resource consists of 2 parts, a forum and a website.  The forum is many more years old than the site, respectively, and the traffic to it is slightly higher.  The task was to look at the separate statistics on the site and the forum, so that they approach the indicators of <b>aWstats</b> . <br><br>  At this stage, it is too early to give a final assessment of these tests, as it is necessary to add some statistics.  But I think that in 2-3 months I can say exactly which program I choose. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42590/</a></p>
