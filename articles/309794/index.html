  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference ISDEF: the course of military grab and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the second weekend of October, near Moscow, 3 km outside the Moscow Ring Road, the 15th Annual Conference of <a href="http://2016.isdef.org/">ISDEF 2016</a> will be held.  Our ISDEF is a warm tube meeting for those who founded and developed IT companies that live on their earnings, without grants and investments.  That is, self-funded IT startups, founders and tops, to put it in terms of a start-up party party. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c24/859/7b2/c248597b29fd41e48dde600e51345378.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">‚ÄúThat's what happens with small business owners ... they are constantly under pressure.‚Äù</font></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Can not stop </h2><br>  Having your own business that feeds you and your employees, develops according to special laws and listens to you alone, this is an incredibly cool feeling.  Perhaps even adrenaline: an explosive mixture of mind, experience, ideas, failures and successes, fears and decisions.  And if earlier a businessman could compare himself with the captain of a ship, slowly chanting a pipe and contemplating from the bridge, endlessly gave a blue ocean, then today an entrepreneur in the IT business is a racer who rushes on a car on a dangerous highway, and from the side, behind, or in front, competitors and technology giants, who regularly overturn the principles of IT products and services consumption, push, cut and push out from the track.  And at some point you start looking for: the best solutions, new markets, new products, and sometimes a new team.  Such a picture will seem nervous to the simple reader and almost unreal, but now the colleagues of the IT companies probably share feelings, face the same problems, successfully solve non-trivial tasks.  It seems it's time for networking and learning. <br><br>  <a href="http://2016.isdef.org/">The ISDEF conference is</a> happy to give such a platform to everyone.  For 15 years, few uncovered topics have remained for founders and top managers of their own IT businesses.  But we found the strength to gain new topics.  This year, 40 of about 100 applications for growth from zero to significant niches in the market in a few years, sales development in selected regions, a review of new market niches - IoT (Internet of Things), robotics, chat bots, fintech and medtech were selected.  Almost all the speakers have already been announced <a href="http://2016.isdef.org/">on the ISDEF website</a> , but on what topics we recommend to pay attention ... (By the way, our speakers are not hackneyed ‚Äúsofa‚Äù sales and motivation trainers, but are also representatives of the IT business, pure practices who say not according to a piece of paper or a manual, but confidently tell the most critical moments - always with burning eyes, because they are the main characters of their reports.)

    <h2>  IT business: sellers of innovation </h2><br>  Products of modern IT business are diverse: this is a technique, solutions for the Internet of things, and software B2B, B2C, B2G.  They differ in interfaces, response speed, purpose, technology stack, but it is always a complex technical product.  So, a business has tasks that a team must solve.  And with these tasks come difficulties. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Sales</b>  How to sell, in what markets, how to study the audience and attract its attention - these are the first questions that arise after the release.  But they do not end there.  You can sell without a product.  And our task is different - how to select and train a sales person, because he must be not only a salesman, but also a product expert?  Or will our site, marketplace or partner sell? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Marketing and PR.</b>  What methods work, and what turns into a drain on the advertising budget, whether PR is needed and what content marketing looks like, what to do with social networks and whether this whole complex will pay off are issues that require experience and a professional team. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Advertising</b> .  What is it: offline or online?  In which formats to invest online, do banners work, is it worth ordering paid reviews and discussions on forums like Reddit or doing it yourself?  And is advertising and marketing for $ 0 in software? <br><br></li><li>  <b>Markets</b>  Regional features of markets, pricing policy, competition, personnel management methods in a foreign country and the path of remote work - these problems are faced by everyone who tries to bring the product out of the Russian market. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Infrastructure:</b> how and where to place servers, how to license, what payment system to choose and is it possible to do with PayPal, how to design and conduct mailings? <br><br></li><li>  <b>The staff</b> .  The main concern, the main resource, reliable support - the team of your business.  And if this is a time bomb?  How to manage a team so that it remains just a team and not become a state? <br></li></ul><br>  And these are questions that arise not on the first day of the company's existence, but at each successive turn of development, be it a new product or a new region of presence.  And at each turn, different answers are given to the same questions, since there is a deep breakdown of existing business processes.  And it would be great to discuss it with someone. <br>  Actually, the idea arose to hold <a href="http://2016.isdef.org/">ISDEF</a> - an annual conference on how to effectively increase profits and develop intensively.  The value of the conference is that representatives of a mature business meet there and share real cases.  In fact, this is a great offline meeting of the extra professional community.  The speakers at ISDEF are not mentors or lecturers, they set general directions for discussion, but already on the sidelines, at lunch, ideas and solutions are born at night, which the next day are capable of bringing real benefits to the companies of the participants. <br>  At ISDEF, no one is afraid of competition - simply because businesses are not set up for a carbon copy, and the same solution can be completely different in different companies.  And of course, networking, dating, connections and real business friendship. <br><br><h2>  In a strange monastery </h2><br>  This time there will be a lot about the problems of cyclic grab in the global IT market.  In general, there it is not for you here.  And this is serious.  Here are some facts about the foreign IT markets B2B and B2C.  So to speak, for warming up. <br><br><ul><li>  The Germans do not trust cloud systems - if your servers are not hosted in Germany, but the application language, the sales person and the site are not German, you are <s>not a true Aryan who</s> can lose the battle for the German market. <br><br></li><li>  The French are ready to buy any software for private use, in advertising which uses a national identity: send letters of congratulations on Bastille Day, and you "took" Paris. <br><br></li><li> Americans are great innovators and experimenters.  It is difficult to find a product that does not find a use and fans in such a huge country.  But be careful - if you target advertising incorrectly, all clicks will steal your latinos, willingly clicking on all the links that they only meet on the way.  And it doesn‚Äôt matter to them that they were looking for a Honda CRM 250 motorcycle, and you offer them CRM for pharmaceutical companies. <br><br></li><li>  But Eastern Europe, it‚Äôs like Russia, is a freebie to offer, not to pay. <br></li></ul><br>  Such subtleties can be learned only by experience.  Exactly the same as the methods of market development, sales channels and the most difficult and important - the laws of the countries where you are moving.  We in Russia do not know everything, and even more so.  So, it will not be superfluous to listen to those who have gone through the wilds. <br><br><ol><li>  <b>[Harrasment and motivation]</b> Oleg Fedorov, CEO of Oxygen Software, has a stunning case study on how to build American-speaking employees in Russian. <br><br></li><li>  <b>[Mentality and sales]</b> How does a small company from an ex-USSR start selling software in the USA, the main consumption centers in the USA, especially lead generation and direct sales, will tell Mikhail Averbakh, a serial entrepreneur from St. Petersburg and New York. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Overseas prospects</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <strong>[Exports until autumn are considered]</strong> What institutions of support for the export of Russian software do you know?  In the autumn at ISDEF2016, Nikita Ryumin, head of IT export business at the Russian Export Center autonomous non-profit organization, will talk about mechanisms for financial and non-financial support to exporters and how to cover risks. <br><br></li><li>  <b>[Greetings from RIO]</b> Pay attention to the speeches of Viktor Sheremetker from the branch of the Trade Representation of the Russian Federation in Rio de Janeiro.  We find out how promising Latin American countries are for selling software, and what financial and non-financial mechanisms of state support (and they exist!) Exist. <br><br></li><li>  <b>[Imposition and denial]</b> And again, Oleg Fedorov will explain how to kill several birds with one stone: leave the ‚ÄúKIK‚Äù law (on ‚Äúcontrolled foreign companies‚Äù) and transactions between interdependent companies. <br></li></ol><br>  <b>Where do the <s>kids</s> money come from</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>[Where to take on business, Zine?]</b> A very popular topic is where to get money + competencies and connections that an investor gives?  That is what is called beautifully Smart Money.  The experience of an entrepreneur, IT entrepreneurs and an investor in more than one new business will be shared: <br><br>  - Alexander Andreev (Softjoys, Kuznech, Almaz Capital), <br>  - Ashot Oganesyan (DeviceLock, a company with a history of sales of its software in all US embassies), who entered money and experience into the Entensys business, <br>  - Valentin Butyugin, who led more than one hardware project through acceleration in Singapore and California and crowdfunding for US sales, <br>  - Mikhail Averbakh and Sergey Fradkov from the Ideal Machine start-up accelerator, who have already managed to sell their American business to Google. </li></ol><br>  <b>Reformat the software business so that it works</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>[Rake B2C projects in the US market]</b> Dmitry Dubograev, Femida.us, will share practical tips on how to tune in to the wave of the current technological revolution, avoid critical miscalculations, and what legal steps to take to build a successful business architecture. <br><br></li><li>  <b>[Bourn tu bi frii]</b> Not every similar business works equally well.  In the section ‚ÄúGrowth of business‚Äù we recommend to be surprised at the annual finds of Dmitry Kalaev, director of acceleration and educational programs of the IIDF, about finding your market even where everything has been tried.  A great theme for those who feel that they have already buried themselves in the "glass ceiling" of growth. <br></li></ol><br><h2>  How much </h2><br>  Only this week, until the evening of Friday September 16, you can <a href="http://2016.isdef.org/">get participation at a reduced price of</a> $ 200 per person.  An alternative after this time is also there: register two employees for the price of one ($ 300 from September 16 until the registration closes on October 1).  We did not teach individual discount tricks for the registration form, so if in any doubt ask ISDEF at <a href="">executive@isdef.org</a> <br><br>  Independent business today is not easy: you are developing, and your competitor has already been flooded with a full tank of investments, which it zealously burns.  But each of us, representatives of a business that does not depend on other people's money, is free - in decisions, spending, development vector.  Yes, in a crisis, it is more difficult, sometimes some political factors interfere, but there are also forces.  And ISDEF is an excellent opportunity to offer all Russian-speaking IT businessmen to again exchange international business experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309794/</a></p>
