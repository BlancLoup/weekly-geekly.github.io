  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What you need to know about the promotion of mobile applications in iOS 6</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The transition to iOS 6, like the release of the iPhone 5, did not make a revolution (perhaps with the help of the Alarm Clock application), but rather became a logical step for the development of the App Store.  The task was complicated for both application developers and advertisers.  But when some tools disappear, it is worthwhile to quickly find a replacement for them. In this article I want to briefly go through the changes in the App Store and share working recommendations on the promotion of mobile applications. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.pocket-lint.com/images/HzP6/ios-6-coming-ipad-iphone-soon-0.jpg?20120912-191049" alt="image"><br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/">http://www.insidemobileapps.com</a> in October 2012, to get the free app to the Top 100, 13,000 downloads per day are needed.  The condition of getting into the Top 10 is 54,000 downloads per day.  This figure is lower than before due to the mass cleaning of bots, but it is quite high anyway (and, I repeat, bots will not help out anymore).  Instead of spending the missing money on an expensive promotional campaign, you should make your application appear in the search for the first keyword request and please the consumer with the high quality of the product.

    <h5>  New App Store sharpened by design.  The search engine request gives the user several applications represented by the name, icon, review stars and the first screenshot.  Yes, it is for these parameters that the user will choose what he wants to download. </h5><br>  When choosing a name, do not stop at the ‚Äúbrand‚Äù - the unspun phrase, because it will not say anything to the consumer.  Be concise, understandable and intriguing. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The icon has become almost 2 times larger, which makes it more informative.  Take this chance. <br><br>  Here I would like to mention the frequently mentioned comparison of a cup of coffee from Starbucks for $ 4 and an unfamiliar application for $ 0.99.  If you are not familiar with it, I will explain that the user would rather like coffee.  You know what you get from a drink mug and have no idea what you see inside the app.  How to protect yourself?  Pretty simple.  Just look at the count and rating review.  The more positive reviews you already have, the more likely to get new ones.  It depends mainly on the quality of the application, so you should definitely listen to users who report bugs. <br><br>  The last item, which is probably the first in importance, is the first screenshot.  This is the largest color and informative spot, on the basis of which the decision to purchase is made.  Make sure that it does not fall on its side and display the highlight of a particular application.  Apple products are intuitive, logical.  Your application should be the same.  If you have never studied design, it is better not to deal with this issue yourself, because it is logical for a developer, it will not necessarily be the same for a housewife. <br><br><h5>  Not always entering the name of the application you get exactly on it - the search is conducted by keywords.  Horizontal scrolling kills the desire for a long time to seek out and select the application.  Therefore, you should take care of ASO - App Store Optimization. </h5><br>  The main changes are as follows: <br>  - No need to spend precious symbols on the category and price policy - Free / Paid / Game / Utility, etc.  appear automatically <br>  - Similarly with phrases and multiple forms: just type in the words separated by commas in the singular <br>  - The description does not work.  Its task is to tell about the application and you should not stuff it with keywords like on Google Play. <br><br>  No matter how good your application would be, it should be reported to the first buyers who will lead the subsequent ones.  Do not deny the possibility of smart marketing, if you really want to download. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154577/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154577/</a></p>
