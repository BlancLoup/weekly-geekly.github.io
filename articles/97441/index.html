And I just can not ignore this event and summarize everything that seemed to me significant and useful. <br><img src="http://thenokiablog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nokia_developer_summit_2010.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even hope that such a giant would be able to quickly adjust to the market so quickly and easily.  But the last two years have shown that Nokia seriously intends to hold its position in the mobile market and will fight.  That last week I was just surprised and delighted with the events. <br>  As it was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/qt_software/97227/">already written before</a> , the Qt Nokia SDK release for Windows and Linux was released, and beta for Mac Os.  But this joy is just beginning. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  1. Nokia has announced a free signature program for the Symbian platform. </h4><br>  Moreover, applications can be either native C ++ or Qt or Flash light. <br><img src="http://russia.forum.nokia.com/pics/signed.gif" alt="image"><br>  For those who do not know, I tell.  Previously, it was necessary to pay big enough money to sign their applications.  Unsigned applications had functional limitations (they were not allowed to execute a part of the API).  This was done for security purposes, but it severely limited individual developers.  You can calculate how much it cost: <br><ul><li>  $ 200 a year was worth getting a Publisher ID, issued by the <a href="https://www.symbiansigned.com/app/page">Symbian Foundation</a> , here you can read <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_symbiandev/1290.html">about the experience of getting</a> ; </li><li>  10 or 100 euros to sign the application express or certified key, respectively, the difference lies in the levels of access to the API; </li><li>  50 euros for registration in the OVI Store, as a publisher, and it was necessary to have an TIN of the company. </li></ul><br>  Of course, it was possible to do without obtaining a Publisher ID through <a href="http://horizon.symbian.org/">Symbian Horizont</a> sponsorship, or not to sign it at all.  But in both cases, it would be extremely difficult to make money from its program and promote it. <br>  The need to have a TIN, closed OVI for individual developers. <br>  <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Distribute/Packaging_and_signing.xhtml">This program</a> is in beta testing, but open to all.  In order to sign your application for free, you must write a letter to publishtoovi.support@nokia.com with your Ovi Store name (as a publisher).  In response, receive instructions. <br>  The application approval process (approve) was also reworked, as a result of which the time to check the application (review) before publication was reduced from 4 weeks to two (this is about the OVI store). <br><br><h4>  2. Now the individual developer can become a publisher in the OVI store! </h4><br>  This is just a mind blowing event.  Hooray!  It is finished.  Now another source of realization of their ideas has been added, with the possibility of making money on it (‚Äúanother one‚Äù, I mean, there is already an Apple Store and Android Market). <br><img src="http://gpsobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/developer-main-image-top.png" alt="image"><br>  Of course the service is not free, it still costs 50 euros.  But the price is comparable with competitors: $ 100 Apple store and $ 25 Android Store.  I am sure that ‚Äúmembership fees‚Äù are not needed to make money on this.  The main purpose of them is to filter out the ‚Äúrandom, trash public‚Äù and inactive developers / publishers (you didn‚Äôt renew the ‚Äúmembership‚Äù - you are excluded from the club). <br>  There are no country restrictions, as the ‚Äúbourgeois‚Äù usually do: first, the priority list, and then all the rest.  Everything is immediately available to all.  You can <a href="https://publish.ovi.com/register/country_and_account_type">see for yourself.</a>  At the very first step of the registration wizard, you will be asked to choose a country and type of account (company or individual developer). <br>  The main goal is to lure / lure developers to Nokia platforms.  After all, it is no secret that it was thanks to this model that the iPhone broke into the market.  You can argue with me, saying that initially there was no store and third-party applications.  But the fact that Jobs at each presentation emphasizes that under the iPhone (now the iPad) there is a big firebox of applications, in addition to the amount of documentation (very high-quality) and materials (examples, videos, presentations) for developing for these platforms themselves for myself.  This is profitable, and who still doubts, then please watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8To-6VIJZRE">this video</a> from the second Steve. <br>  And this step from Nokia once again proves that they need us no less than they need us, and maybe even more! <br><br><h4>  3. The first official release of Nokia Qt SDK 1.0 has been released. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/216/06c/89a/21606c89ad1c336783b9daba8de58a8d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This event <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/qt_software/97227/">has already been discussed whiz</a> on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/qt_software/97227/">Habr√©</a> .  Unfortunately, the author ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/paul/" class="user_link">Paul</a> ) does not quite understand the essence of the issue.  Therefore, the title reads ‚ÄúQt SDK 1.0‚Äù, and implies the Nokia Qt SDK. <br>  Let's understand the difference between the "Nokia Qt SDK" and the "Qt SDK". <br>  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/downloads">Qt SDK</a> : <br>  <i>The Qt SDK is a cross-platform application.</i> <br>  Explained, Qt SDK is a set of tools for writing cross-platform (writing, not talking about cross-compiling for all platforms) applications using Qt.  And this toolkit is available as a single installation file: downloaded, installed with one click and everything is ready for writing, debugging and building.  The structure includes Qt libraries (already compiled), source codes (if you need to rebuild libraries), Qt Creator, and auxiliary utilities (Qt Linguist, makeqpf, packager, QLARL, and a lot of other good stuff). <br>  <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Tools/">Nokia Qt SDK</a> : <br>  <i>The QT SDK QA SDK is a concept of how to use it.</i> <br>  This is also a set of utilities in one bottle, but for developing applications for mobile platforms from Nokia (this is what the word ‚ÄúNokia‚Äù informs about in the title, and not that Nokia bought TrollTech).  It contains compiled libraries for Symbian and Maemo, the corresponding SDK and toolchain for these platforms.  Here we are talking about cross-compilation (build a project on a desktop under Windows (for example) on an i386 architecture, and it will work on Symbian / Linux on an ARM architecture, do you feel the difference?).  In addition, Qt Simulator, Qt Creator, Qt Mobility, Nokia Smart Installer, and other tools are included.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/94075/">I already wrote in more detail</a> . <br>  <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/products/qt-for-mobile-platforms">The official comparative table is here, at the very bottom.</a> <br><br>  So what am I talking about?  BUT!  Well, he came out.  So how is it different from beta, which <a href="http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/11470_Nokia_Qt_SDK_in_Beta-cross_pla.php">was already available</a> before? <br>  And here is a list: <br><ul><li>  The SDK includes the first official release of the <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Nokia_Smart_Installer_for_Symbian">Nokia Smart Installer</a> , which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/qt_software/84321/">I already wrote about earlier</a> and now it is part of the Nokia Qt SDK (and not a separate product, as it was before); </li><li>  <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2010/06/23/qt-creator-20/">Qt Creator 2.0</a> - release in which integration with SDK for mobile devices is improved; </li><li>  <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qtsimulator-1.0/index.html">Qt Simulator 1.0</a> is also a release; </li><li>  <a href="http://wiki.forum.nokia.com/index.php/Nokia_Qt_SDK_Remote_Compiler">Nokia Remotecompiler</a> - experimental support, this component deserves a separate discussion.  In short: a cloud service for building Symbian applications on any platform (press a button, source codes are sent to the server, they are assembled with the necessary tools and executed, and you see the result in the emulator via a special remote access protocol). </li></ul><br>  You can read more <a href="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2010/06/23/nokia-qt-sdk-and-ovi-acceptance-a-good-start-for-qt-on-mobile/">in the blog</a> and <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2010/06/23/nokia-qt-sdk-10-released/">in the laboratory</a> . <br><br><h4>  4. MeeGo is already moving in leaps and bounds and the first device with MeeGo is the N900. </h4><br>  I understand that this item is a bit provocative.  Nevertheless, MeeGo for ARM is already there, and <a href="http://repo.meego.com/MeeGo/releases/1.0/core/images/meego-n900-open-armv7l/">it is only for the N900</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e82/f6a/9c1/e82f6a9c1f71d46c92e6d69a5ca5a749.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The development of the platform just pleases its pace.  According <a href="http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/handset-version-meego-set-june-30-release/2010-06-21">to this information</a> , we will be able to see the first MeeGo GUI for phones on June 30.  And I'm pretty sure that the demonstration will be held on the base of the N900.  Thus, the N900 is both a mainstream device based on Maemo and a prototype of a new product line based on MeGo. <br><br><h4>  5. In the Ovi store, you can publish Qt - applications for Symbian and Maemo. </h4><br>  This is the final chord.  Now all that is needed is to start experimenting, to earn and grow. <br><img src="http://www.fonehome.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/n900meego-300x300.jpg" alt="image"><br>  You can implement any of your ideas and get a response from a multi-million dollar audience.  From that moment, for me, the Ovi Store is open.  Before that, I treated him like a beta test.  And I'm pretty sure that given the previous points, there will soon be a lot of good Qt programs running on Symbian and Maemo and ready for MeeGo. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The attentive reader can look at the name of the topic and exclaim: "And where is all this here at all?!".  Very much and. <br><img src="http://maemo.nokia.com/img/want-to-be-a-developer.gif" alt="image"><br>  With all of the above, I tried to lead the reader to the conclusion that came to me two hours before writing this article: ‚ÄúNow you can make good money developing applications for the N900!‚Äù.  Why is that: <br><ul><li>  the market is already saturated, but with commercial projects a vacuum, people would be happy to buy, but there is nothing; </li><li>  ‚ÄúCorrectly‚Äù written application for N900 on Qt can be automatically entered in the future as an application covering the market of MeeGo's phones and tablets (devices that have a touch screen), and without alterations or with minimal interface modifications; </li><li>  thanks to the use of ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù development patterns or (as a special case) the use of <a href="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/2010/02/15/meet-qt-quick/">Qt Quick</a> technology to develop a user interface will allow you to target the product to a very wide market with minimal costs: MeeGo Intel platform through the Intel AppStore and communicators based on Maemo / MeeGo / Symbian on the market very, very much (and also make a desktop version for Mac OS / Window / Linux); </li><li>  requires minimal cost to try; </li><li>  Qt's development dynamics is very impressive, and the sooner you enter this market, the easier it will be to consolidate your position on it; </li><li>  based on existing markets Apple AppStore and Android Market, you can conduct market research and get an assessment of the popularity of the products, select the desired product and implement it (success on someone else's experience); </li><li>  if you make a popular product and it will stay on the market in the lead or as a uniquely long enough time, then you can do without the costs of promotion, viral advertising, word of mouth and Nokia itself will do everything for you; </li><li>  N900 is now the only representative of the future mobile branch of MeeGo-based devices. </li></ul><br><br>  Why for N900, but not for Symbian?  What is the difference?  And the difference is precisely that the N line will be top and, accordingly, will cover the most solvent audience.  This is just a selfish question.  By targeting products for Maemo / MeeGo phones, you are primarily focused on profits (in my opinion this is obvious).  And the only representative of this future line today is the N900. <br><br>  Given the fact that the official prices for the N900 <a href="http://store.nokia.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/productdetail_10500_10101_-1_10000367">in the United States have already fallen below $ 500,</a> we can expect a successor in this line and an increase in popularity. <br><br>  You can continue the list, but I think you caught the main idea: ‚Äúwriting an application under the N900 is now profitable and you need to start it as soon as possible.‚Äù <br><img src="http://blog.qt.nokia.com/files/2010/03/Quick_Screens_Composite.png" alt="image"><br>  As a proof, I started developing a small and easy application.  I leave the appointment and the essence of the application a secret so far (at the same time I will check my instincts for market demand and my analytical ability to study the market).  I think in a month I can already release it in production.  It is with this application that I intend to prove in practice all the arguments that I cite here. <br>  Those who are brave and bold can start their own project along with me and it will be very interesting to compare the results.  And who is prudent and skeptical, can wait a month and a half (with a thought like: ‚Äúlive - see‚Äù) and make sure that he just lost that time waiting, instead of releasing his applications !!! <br><br>  And so the experiment begins and some parts of this experiment I will try to bring to small examples of development for the N900 on Qt. <br>  The first step in installing and configuring development tools <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/94075/">can be considered as already implemented</a> . <br><br>  All right, I ran to write :-) <br><br>  <b>UPD: added 4th item.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97441/</a></p>
