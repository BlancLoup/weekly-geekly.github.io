  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Housing problem</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday I quarreled with the owner of the apartment, I have been renting from her already 2/3 years.  Quarrels have arisen before, but somehow I restrained myself and did not get involved, because  not a quarrelsome person.  I pay for the rent regularly under the contract, on time and in full. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The quarrel emanated from her, the subject was that I was not my apartment corridor, I didn‚Äôt defrost the refrigerator during (some kind of latch doesn‚Äôt click there), and I dry my underpants on a heated towel rail (he can rot this out, in her opinion).  Although during the whole stay, I adapted to all of her idiocy and realized that it was better to do what she said than not to do.  You can laugh from such reasons for the quarrel, and so everything came up on an elevated tone, the epilogue was that she said that she would throw me out with a police outfit.  Legally, she does not have the right to do this, but when a person breaks down a tower, she says that in a deep subconscious.  Those.  I am not very sympathetic to her as a tenant. <br><br>  My girlfriend and I started renting an apartment in August - for 24,000 rubles, when prices fell we made an additional agreement that we would continue to rent for 21,000 rubles.  Everything was done through the agency is absolutely legal, with the consent of the parties.  The owner of the apartment at that time lost her job, so did I, but I somehow worked on the hack and, in fact, my second half fed me the first month, but I earned money on renting an apartment.  After a couple of months it became simpler, I found a new stable job, plus some hack remained.  And this is where her roof began to leak.  Yes ..., also - I didn‚Äôt allow my girlfriend to communicate with the Istrian housewife because I understood that it would be just a scandal.

      I am a Kiev resident, I live in Moscow for about 5 years, I received citizenship, I work in printing on poppies.  During this time, I changed 4 jobs and am already changing my 7th place of residence: I managed to live with my sister in Khimki, in Altufyevo, Mitino, on Skhodnenskaya in 2 places, on Kievskaya center, and now on Baumanskaya. <br><br>  I had some friction with tenants before that, although the man is not quarrelsome.  I somehow did not return the deposit of 17,000 rubles. I was thrown with the selection of housing.  I know that many people have come across such things.  Absolutely all the people who shoot - they want independence for the money they pay.  Regardless of whether you legally competently made a deal or live on bird rights, how you will live - with or without quarrels - is entirely dependent on the landlord. <br><br>  In general, I can characterize 2 types of apartment owners: <br><br>  <b>Type 1</b>  A person, as a rule, young, working and not bad earning, having a family and considering renting an apartment as a secondary income, is an <i>optimist</i> .  This person is always all right.  He is pleased with life and easy to communicate. <br><br>  <b>Type 2</b>  <i>Pessimestically</i> looking at life, a person who considers renting as the main income, because  salary is significantly less than the rent.  Even if it is not, then the cockroach in my head - the sea.  In some ways, even a flawed person, who usually complains about his difficult life, burdened with all sorts of worries and problems. <br><br>  I realized that something between these 2 types simply does not happen, a person progresses and becomes either defective or successful.  It is important to understand the tendency to communicate, what type he will become an <i>optimist</i> or a <i>pessimist</i> (thumb up, thumb down). <br><br>  In my case, we will terminate the contract with her, which we must do in writing 30 days before our congress.  The reason - the constant quarrel with the owner of the apartment.  If she terminated the contract with us - we could not return the security deposit.  Now she does not want to return it, but I am determined to sue her, I will just spread it.  After talking with a realtor, I realized that the employer is always right in court.  And it‚Äôs absolutely not a crisis when the brains of people are leaking. <br><br>  With all this, I have a better position than hers.  Apartments are now a lot.  She tenants instead of us, will not find soon. <br><br>  I donate an idea for a startup, with a pity I work in another industry, but I would like to at least help something if anyone is interested in this.  A startup that really will work, help people and allow you to track the history of apartments.  Believe people will thank you.  It seems banned the publication of "black lists" on the Internet.  Let it be just reviews tied to specific addresses, to the geography of the city.  It is important just the opinion of the person, many information is not needed.  Apartment owners, realtors or firms are gaining stars, like cognac or go to the minus. <br><br>  Sites for renting apartments darkness.  But, not all of them are honest.  There are some "black lists of realtors", but they are scattered.  People write folios, about what they suffered, of course, in such lists are all bad, I could not find a list of decent people.  I have been in real estate firms, where the guards have a broken face in the blood, whose people have been deceived.  I saw realtors who want to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the bare walls without keys from these walls with a grandmother who, like a shadow, walks along the walls and eats ‚Äúeucalyptus leaves‚Äù.  We met the owner, who was drunk in our kakahu, came out of the apartment with us and went for more beer.  I rented from a woman who demanded money out of time, 2 weeks before the date specified in the contract, to pay for housing, because everything is bad for her.  You never know what situations exist. <br><br>  Below are some recommendations.  Many people relate to the choice of an apartment after rushing to conclusions, or because of a lack of money, they rush to everything they see.  In general, no one goes with any list of what he wants.  But this is important, you can always bring down the price because of this and that, that does not correspond to the item on your list.  Realtors will treat you like a gray mass, many apartment owners don‚Äôt want to knock it out to create acceptable living conditions.  The search for housing should be treated as a search for good work, where you will want to work until the end of your days.  So the list for which not a lot of money will be paid: <br><br>  1. Price.  The most important factor. <br>  2. Distance from the metro.  For me, no more than 10-15 minutes is interesting.  walk because  otherwise I spend extra money on ground transportation. <br>  3. District of the city and infrastructure.  I have happened to be in areas where the blue is complete, the industrial zone and the working class are having fun, and in the evening you are barking dogs.  Love yourself, why do you need this distrust around. <br>  4. Preferred metro stations.  You know which branches are overloaded in the morning, you have the right to have housing near the work - this is normal. <br>  5. Washer.  Not domestic for 1500 rubles. And a normal washing machine.  You want to have crap - erase on our cheap machines.  A person does not do anything with a monthly rent of an apartment; he can buy 3-4 normal imported cars. <br>  6. Condition plumbing.  In the so-called "grandmother's apartments," neither of which has ever really been repaired.  There is a century of ruining, and even if it somehow works, then soon it will stop working.  Under the bathroom can be moss, and the toilet, really kind of "toilet". <br>  7. Appliances and furniture. <br>  The kitchen must have a refrigerator, a stove (not primeval), a kitchen set, a normal sink, a table and chairs (nothing should be loose, there should be enough handles and doors everywhere, everything should be complete and normal). <br>  In the room: wardrobe 1 or 2, sofa or bed, table. <br>  As a rule, almost everywhere is a wall, do you think it will fit all your belongings in this wall, how functional it is?  If the sofa is a grandmother - everything will be visually understandable to you. <br>  8. Telephone, Internet.  No Internet - when will it be possible?  we reduce the rent. <br>  9. Loggia or balcony.  Preferably glazed, because  I like to smoke and in the winter. <br>  10. Questions: <br>  - can I smoke? <br>  - Is it possible to get animals? <br>  - who else has the keys to the apartment? <br>  etc. <br>  11. The apartment is not below 3 floors.  Apartments on the 1st, 2nd floors in the 5-storey floors freeze through in winter, it is very damp there. <br>  12. If a carpet hangs on the wall or in the kitchen you have the feeling that everything is in fat - we leave immediately. <br><br>  Have a nice day, everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56832/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56832/</a></p>
