    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="http://bvcp.ru/"><b>Baring Vostok Capital Partners</b></a> <br>  A company with a very long history.  The Internet is not its only direction.  Investment in communications, media and technology accounts for 27% of the capital of funds.  This fund invests in already launched projects that have a management team, a clear business idea, the project should occupy a leading position in the market, as well as have an internal rate of return of at least 40%. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.finam.ru/investments/projects00001/default.asp"><b>Finam</b></a> <br>  Perhaps the most active player who is often heard.  It allows you to determine the estimated investment conditions yourself.  Finam intends to spend $ 100 million on investments and the purchase of projects.  Projects: Badoo.com, Mirtesen.ru, Begun.Ru, Mamba.Ru, Buka Entertainment, MoneyMail, ALAWAR. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.abrtfund.com/"><b>ABRT</b></a> <br>  The venture fund is ready to invest in startup stages, early stages and growth stages.  The combined capital under the management of the fund is more than $ 300 million. To launch the first product and organize sales and marketing, ABRT is ready to allocate from $ 200 thousand to $ 2-5 million. The Fund plans to hold ‚ÄúStartup Days‚Äù 4 times a year, where you can make a presentation of your project.  ABRT is one of the <a href="http://www.quintura.com/">Quintura</a> investors. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.e-trustgroup.ru/"><b>E-trust</b></a> <br>  E-trust is an informal association of private investors.  They invest at the startup stage and can offer two types of investment, venture and investment loans.  In order to receive funding, you must already have a team, and the project‚Äôs costs before reaching self-sufficiency should not exceed $ 1 million. Also, the required potential of the project must be at least $ 10 million in annual sales. <br><br>  <a href="http://dpep.ru/"><b>Delta Private Equity Partners</b></a> <br>  DPEP invests from 5 to 10 million dollars for a period of three to five years, in already running projects with professional team managers. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.seedfund.ru/"><b>NSF - Foundation on the basis of MSU Science Park</b></a> <br>  The foundation provides support for prototyping, project launch, company formation, and initial business development.  He is ready to allocate $ 50-150 thousand for this. The foundation also takes on all the ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù issues (accounting, office, legal issues).  Moreover, when the project requires the next round of investments, NSF is ready to find them on its own.  It is worth being prepared for the fact that at the stage of starting a project, you will have to be content with a small salary.  This step is logical, as the creator starts to create his own business, and is not a hired manager.  Foundation projects: <a href="http://www.mooteam.ru/">Mooteam,</a> <a href="http://www.langster.ru/">Langster,</a> <a href="http://alpha.doitforme.net/">Do It For Me.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://web2people.net/"><b>Web2People</b></a> <br>  This project helps to take the first (from the formulation of the idea to the creation of the company) steps on the approach to the tip of the iceberg.  You can come to a startup center with bare ideas, and if they see a real leader in you, they will definitely support the project.  The center allocates 4 seasons and 2 sessions per year.  The session duration is 3 months, for which the team must realize its goals in order to proceed to the conclusion on investments.  The whole process of cooperation with the center takes no more than 6 months.  After creating the alpha version and preparing the documents, the team (at least 2 people) will be allowed to the presentation to the investor.  It is possible that the investment you do not receive, Web2People do not guarantee this.  The center provides good conditions for fruitful work, but you need to have your own laptop.  The average share of the center in the project is 10-15%.  In order to participate in the session you will need to move to St. Petersburg (at least for 3 months), each participant will be paid 100,000 rubles (housing, food). <br><br>  <a href="http://qd.ifmo.ru/"><b>QD Student Innovation Center</b></a> <br>  The site of the center does not inspire confidence in the seriousness of the organization, but still they assist in the formation of the team, can help with the search for an investor, and also provide an opportunity to study in a number of educational programs for which you will have to pay extra. <br><br>  In total, 12 ‚Äúorganizations‚Äù were considered who can invest or help to find investments for your project.  I am sure that this is only the beginning and perhaps not a complete list. <br><br>  At the turn of the blitz interview companies. <br><br>  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/romanzolotarev/" class="user_link">romanzolotarev</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/squirrel/" class="user_link">squirrel</a> for targeting other investors :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36629/</a></p>
