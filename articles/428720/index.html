But one way or another, digital detox ideas are becoming more common, which manifest themselves from retreat and Vipassana to practical guidelines for improving the quality of <a href="https://habr.com/post/413239/">interaction with devices</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/post/371245/">using monochrome</a> and advice to build <a href="https://habr.com/post/205344/">The Phone Stacking Game</a> in meetings with friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9i/sv/yn/9isvynpaopnkegkg_0yd78yhw58.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ofcome, the British Communications Regulator (Ofcome - a non-profit organization that regulates the communications industry, including the radio / television broadcasting, wireless networks and postal services) reports in its report that 95% <br>  16-24-year-old smartphone owners check their devices on average every 12 minutes.  At the same time, 10% of respondents from the same study noted that getting rid of network access would allow them to gain some level of freedom. <br><br>  And if by itself a digital detox is difficult to implement without losing, for example, work or loved ones, there is a technological solution that takes into account the recommendations of using the phone for its intended purpose - dumb phones or stupid phones.

      <b>Basic features of dumb phones</b> <br><br>  The technology, which is essentially a piece of ‚Äústupid‚Äù iron, is an extremely simple phone that eliminates all smartphone features that develop procrastination, and leaves only the functionality of a traditional device.  Simply put, the minimum it can only call and write, although some representatives of this type of phone may include advanced features, such as an alarm clock or a card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/_c/l1/lj_cl1rg6fdervebabprhyb6j1q.jpeg"><br><cut></cut><br>  <b>Dumb phones models</b> <br><br>  On the ‚Äúdumb‚Äù market of devices, models of different price categories are presented: <br><br><ul><li>  Alcatel 10.66G with minimal functionality - $ 20 </li><li>  Nokia 130 with a limited set of applications that can erase your mark on social networks - $ 50 </li><li>  Caterpillar Cat B25 / B30 Push-Button Phones - $ 50 </li><li>  Kyocera DuraXTP E4281 from a series of basic (basic) phones - from $ 70 </li><li>  Light Phone, Apple in the line of dumb phones, usability and design of which will cost $ 300- $ 400 </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9z/cj/ce/9zcjce2fz9ou9tbdko6bpiy8i2y.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, these are often quite strong phones that will remain with you after falling onto hard surfaces or into water. <br><br>  <b>Practical profit "dumb phones"</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúDumb‚Äù devices are a tool that allows you to balance the practical profit of using the phone and unconscious consumption of information in search of entertainment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8s/tb/qh/8stbqhsz9tewxnjrc7jjvxzekom.jpeg"><br><br>  Willpower is one of the most desirable personal qualities, but smartphones reduce your chances of rocking this skill and increase the chance of deviating from the tasks.  Regarding social networks, ‚Äúdumb phones‚Äù allow you to concentrate in the world of procrastination (constantly incoming signals from the outside distracting your attention). <br><br>  So, on average, adults spend half their day on media consumption.  This does not mean that they are wasting it, but ask yourself the obvious question, do I value my time or do I unconsciously consume media content, postponing the achievement of my goals? <br><br>  <b>"Dumb phones" - no denial of technological progress</b> <br><br>  There is no denying that the creation of technology is an inevitable phenomenon and should be taken for granted.  Technology development is also the greatest achievement of the 21st century, which demonstrates the new digital world in its close relationship.  But technology itself can be the answer to the redundancy of the information age.  For example, the creators of Light Phone are positioning their product as a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù phone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7h/ep/ig/7hepig4fk2brmrxorqszn6susly.jpeg"><br><blockquote>  Light phone seems to us as an addition, not a replacement.  This is the first and only phone that was created to be your ‚Äúsecond phone‚Äù, such as, for example, you have different shoes and clothes for different occasions.  The carpenter has different tools for each type of work.  There is no tool that can fit for absolutely any task, at least not fit for everything well.  Then why is a giant phone good for checking emails or flipping Instagram feeds and for taking us to the beach with us? </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/rb/63/farb63ufhttcnwzzygn_ybxeyj0.jpeg"><br><br>  Regardless of whether the dumb phone will become mainstream, it can be said that the technological revolution will not end soon.  When the radical digital detox is still an impractical solution in everyday life, the main goal pursued by users of the dumb phone is how to leave traces of the digital world invisible to themselves. <br><br>  The article to some extent includes the critically rethought ideas of the article on the Medium <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/the-dumb-device-counterculture-74b4972b7dcc">"The Dumb Device Counterculture"</a> <cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428720/</a></p>
