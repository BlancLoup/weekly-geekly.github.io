  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The decision of regional TV channels or Telebreeze Cloud Technologies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past few years, talk of Russia's transition from analogue to digital broadcasting is gaining momentum.  Indeed, many problems are associated with this.  One of them is the installation of the necessary equipment throughout Russia for a relatively short period of time.  Another, more acute problem is which channels will be included in broadcast multiplexes.  We will dwell on the last problem in more detail. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d70/05a/505/d7005a505201b1c21fa4a8a146ef4e79.jpg" alt="image"><br>  There are three multiplexes containing channels that will be broadcast on the territory of Russia in digital quality.  The first multiplex of digital television included all-Russian and publicly accessible TV channels, according to the decree of the President of the Russian Federation, such as Channel One, Russia 1, Russia 2, Russia-24, Russia-K, Karusel, Petersburg - Channel 5 ‚Äù,‚Äú NTV ‚Äùand‚Äú Public Television of Russia ‚Äù,‚Äú TV Center ‚Äù, as well as one regional. <br>  What about the second multiplex, with him by this time, too, everything is already defined.  It includes all-Russian non-obligatory publicly accessible TV channels, which were identified as a result of the Roskomnadzor competition on December 14, 2012.  Such channels are ‚ÄúREN-TV‚Äù, ‚ÄúTNT‚Äù, ‚ÄúSTS‚Äù, ‚ÄúDomashniy‚Äù, ‚ÄúSport‚Äù, ‚ÄúSport Plus‚Äù, ‚ÄúZvezda‚Äù, ‚ÄúMir‚Äù, ‚ÄúMuz-TV‚Äù. <br>  And with the third multiplex, things are not so transparent at all.  This is the so-called regional-federal package of digital channels, which is only planned to be created.  It had to be formed from 7-8 regional channels of SD quality and one federal HD quality.  And here regional channels have even more problems and questions, because not all of them will be able to get into this multiplex. <br>  But this is not the worst thing that could happen to regional TV channels: quite recently, at the Spektr-2013 conference, the decision was made to change the composition of the third multiplex.  Instead of the above option, they intend to include in it mainly federal TV channels that are not included in the first and second multiplexes, such as Russia Today, 2 √ó 2, Friday, O2TB and others.  Such channels in the third multiplex should be 7-8, and regional TV channels will get only 2-3 places.  With that, one of them will be occupied by the VGTRK channel.  All this has complicated the fate of regional TV channels even more.  The very same broadcast in the third multiplex regional TV channels will cost from 6 to 12 million rubles a year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first public multiplex, where there is only room for one regional channel, will be able to enter only the "elect".  And to enter the third multiplex it will also be necessary to win the competition.  Representatives of local channels fear that after the transition to the ‚Äúdigital‚Äù they will simply lose their place in the market. <br><br>  Regional channels are concerned about this problem and are looking for ways to solve it.  There may be several ways. <br><ol><li>  Maximum preparation of the channel for the competition and try to win it to be in the third multiplex.  Here there are quite large risks to spend a lot of resources on cooking and eventually lose the competition. </li><li>  Switch to cable or satellite TV.  This requires the purchase and optimization of new expensive equipment, which will certainly entail large costs and loss of time.  And now, when there is high-speed Internet in almost every home, switching to cable or satellite may not be the easiest solution.  Therefore, the third solution to the problem is the most interesting. </li><li>  Broadcast via the Internet.  And here again, local TV channels have options: <br><ul><li>  Completely stop broadcasting in real time and use existing paid and free services that provide video hosting services.  For example, such as Youtube, Rutube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, etc. </li><li>  Make a player on your site and use it to broadcast the broadcast channel.  But first, such a player will need to be created or ordered / purchased.  But what about the old viewers who need to be informed that now their favorite channel will have to look on the Internet?  To all this, the problem of site promotion is added to increase the target audience and visits. <br>  But this is still a small part of the problem.  For broadcasting over the Internet, a special server and various other equipment are needed.  If the management of the channel has never encountered such situations, then an independent transfer of broadcasting to the world wide web can be a rather complicated enterprise. </li><li>  And it is precisely in this situation that the next solution can be quite simple - the services of third-party companies that can provide all the necessary equipment and software to move the broadcast to a worldwide network.  Television companies all this will cost a monthly fee, which easily pays off with a sufficient number of viewers through advertising.  Such a decision can not only help maintain the position of the television company, but also increase its audience, thereby increasing its profits. </li></ul><br></li></ol><br>  One such company in Russia is Telebreeze, founded by people from Elecard.  The latter is a recognized leader in the development of software products for encoding, playing, processing and editing video and audio data in various formats.  The Elecard Group of Companies was established in 1988 and currently delivers solutions to 9000 companies from 79 countries of the world.  Due to this experience in this field and the features of the services provided, Telebreeze cannot help but draw attention to itself. <br>  The main activity of the company Telebreeze is to provide its customers with a ready-made IPTV solution.  Television companies that use their services receive all the necessary equipment and software, including a special player, for broadcasting and watching the television channel on the Internet.  In addition, viewers will be able to watch the channel on TV, if they have specialized set-top boxes for them.  The latter will help keep some of the old viewers. <br>  But what is most interesting, Telebreeze has its own free player, which can be downloaded from the free Internet access.  The TV channel can agree with the company on broadcasting to this player, where there is already an audience of viewers.  Those.  he will be able to simultaneously broadcast on his website and on the Telebreeze player.  And to increase the number of viewers, and consequently, income, can be engaged in promotion and advertising both of their site and player. <br>  If the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting can strike a regional television station's profits, or even bring its existence to an end, the access to the Internet can give a second wind to the television channel by expanding the audience of viewers.  Profit can increase by several times, which can be seen on a simple example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/542/3b4/4b7/5423b44b763ae050386a60a5802715b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Take the standard subscription fee of a television company using the services of the same Telebreeze company: an hour of viewing by one client - 1 ruble.  What should a company do to recoup these costs?  Advertising on television is usually sold by slots, for example, 250 rubles for 20 seconds of showing one thousand viewers.  Then the income from one advertising slot per viewer is 250/1000, i.e.  0.25 ruble.  Showing four of these slots per hour will already pay for the cost of a monthly fee (1 ruble per hour viewed by one viewer).  And this is about 10-20% of the amount that TV channels usually receive for advertising placed in an hour of their time.  All the rest is an additional profit of the TV company. <br>  Or another example: if a television company has an average advertising cost of 250 rubles for a 20-second advertising slot (i.e. a display for 1000 viewers), and the number of slots per hour is 20, then the additional profit from one hour of Internet broadcasting will be 4 rubles per person.  And from this you can get very interesting and "tasty" numbers: 100 thousand hours of watching a channel a month on the Internet will give 400 thousand rubles of additional income.

      In addition, as stated on the company's website, to connect to the service does not require high-speed Internet connection in the office of the television company, because  Telebreeze uses its servers and delivery network for content delivery. <br>  The solution of broadcasting a TV channel to the Internet with the help of a third-party player as a whole looks quite simple for TV channels, despite the fact that it also provides new technologies, and with them features such as: <br>  ‚Ä¢ the possibility of broadcasting in standard quality and in HD; <br>  ‚Ä¢ automatic quality adjustment depending on the speed of Internet users; <br>  ‚Ä¢ own personal account for each TV company, where there is access to the statistics of views, reliable rating of programs; <br>  ‚Ä¢ targeted advertising; <br>  ‚Ä¢ placement of programs in the record; <br>  ‚Ä¢ broadcast to the whole world. <br>  Such a solution seems to be the most optimal, but the problem is that the TV companies will have to engage themselves in the promotion and advertising of their channel, increase the number of visitors to the site and attract viewers both to the site and to the player. <br>  Summing up, one can say with certainty one thing - regional TV channels are not expecting the easiest fate in the coming years, and they had to start taking care of their future yesterday.  Only those TV channels that will actively begin to solve this problem will survive and take care of their future themselves: find new ways to distribute content, take up promotion and advertising of their channel, take care of broadcasting their content on the Internet: both on the website and on third-party players. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205750/</a></p>
