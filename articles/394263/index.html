  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Delete or not delete groups in the VC? .. That is the question</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Film companies are demanding more stringent measures regarding social networks in which groups and communities increasingly receive copyrighted content.  Whether rights holders will not just demand the removal of materials, but generally ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù such suspicious groups, which have about a million participants, that is the question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/351/1b1/6563511b11354c2693aa539d1775db34.png"><br><br>  VKontakte (or Russian Facebook, as it is often called) is the largest social network, where about 300 million users are registered, a third of them are active users.  VKontakte "accepts" content from users, mostly without questions, so it turns out that in VK you can easily find a huge amount of counterfeit films, music, and television shows. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Like other similar sites, VKontakte has groups and communities dedicated to infinite numbers of topics.  The theme of cinema and TV shows is no exception, such groups are a treasure trove for those who want to get content for free.  Of course, copyright holders can remove these materials using regular deletion messages, but, like their counterparts in the West, they are tired of being poured from empty light. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/508/467/8a4/5084678a4da943279bc39afbdd66d4d9.png"><br><br>  In order to combat piracy, the copyright holders decided to unite and demand that the VKontakte social network remove entire groups that contain content that violates copyright.  The focus was on 10 of the largest groups, the main topic of which were films and TV shows.  The number of group members inspires. <br><br>  Aleksey Birdin, general director of the Internet Video Association, told Izvestia that each group has at least 1 million users, and the first place is taken by a group with more than 7 million participants. The requirement for the group of copyright holders is simply to remove these groups from VKontakte spaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4e/19e/bf0/e4e19ebf06834c8ab1936e52482b8454.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúWe repeatedly appealed to the groups themselves, with urgent requests to remove content, but, as we see, it did not give any results,‚Äù said Olga Valigurskaya, CEO of Web Control, adding that the VKontakte social network should either remove all pirated content or the entire group in which file data is located. <br><br>  However, VC owners see the situation a little differently. <br><br>  The representative of the social network VKontakte explained: ‚ÄúIn most cases, we refuse to block communities specializing in video content, since we consider such a measure too extreme.  We delete certain videos that violate the rights of a particular copyright holder, but on condition that all necessary documents confirming the rights have been provided.  Administrators of such communities are notified of the inadmissibility of placing illegal content. " <br><br>  Recently, the topic of widespread anti-piracy actions demanded by right holders is widely heard and often discussed online.  Such a "war" of words is played out both in the USA and in Europe, where many sites have been censored. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62f/98f/c11/62f98fc110e84148be38befaed99feeb.png"><br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the fight against the spread of pirated content, you need to be tougher.  If there is no possibility to stop copyright infringement in any other way, as soon as through the removal of the entire group, it means that the entire group must be removed, ‚Äùsaid Leonid Agronov, chairman of the National Federation of the Music Industry (Sony, Universal, Warner, EMI).  Repeatedly, he expressed his position on copyright. <br><br>  Agronov‚Äôs position was rejected by Sergey Grebennikov, Director of the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies (ROCIT).  He insists that deleting all groups is illegal.  After all, copyright holders do not have copyright on groups, but on video files, and therefore such a measure should apply only to pirated content. <br><br>  Without a doubt, the issue of online content acquires the character of a ‚Äúglobal battle‚Äù not only between copyright holders and actual pirates, but also between copyright holders and social networks, video hosting sites such as VKontakte, YouTube, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394263/</a></p>
