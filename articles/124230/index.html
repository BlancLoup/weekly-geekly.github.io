Someone with a frenzy, someone with a philosophical serenity.  Someone through friends, someone through recruiting sites, someone (we ourselves, however, do not really believe in it) through ads in the media.  Some even find. <br>  The creators of the service "Yakson", analyzing the recruitment sector, decided to make their own project, which would allow all these ten million to find a job.  It is desirable in the specialty.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/operating-times/">+++</a> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0e/552/4e1/f0e5524e10798648c82e30b45a703319.png" align="left">  Imagine for a minute that in a couple of days you have an important event (for example, <a href="http://russia.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> ).  The event urgently needs to collect helpers - girls who will register participants, treat them with tea and coffee, as well as answer questions about the location of key locations (such as a toilet or a conference room). <br>  After a day of scattering calls on LJ-community freelancers, you understand that the right girls do not exist in nature (or they do not have the Internet).  And go to the site <a href="http://workee.ru/">Workee.ru.</a>  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/under-the-action/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/under-the-action/"><br><br><br><br></a> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cb/1f6/510/2cb1f6510dee09e39133b9cd1f952a53.png" align="left">  The description of the <a href="http://www.gruzolot.ru/">Gruzolot</a> project in the presentation begins as a trailer for the disaster film: ‚ÄúAfter November 2009, when the market fell into stagnation, the volume of freight shrank dramatically, carriers began to abandon leasing contracts, stop operating part of the fleet, and dismiss unnecessary drivers.  There has been a structural change in the market. ‚Äù <br>  In the right catastrophe film, there is always an extremely positive hero who saves everyone.  In our case, the hero is the team of Gruzolot, who undertook to solve all the problems that appeared on the structurally changed market.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/reloading/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34c/9b2/a29/34c9b2a29d947172c3912a9b8b2d6705.png" align="left"><br>  Since the slogan ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù has been secretly squeezed into one row with Orthodoxy, autocracy and nationality, services automating access to public services have begun to spread with enviable speed. <br>  Among other things, there are more and more websites that allow you to enroll to the right doctor without getting off the working chair (by the way, most likely the reasons for your spontaneous visit to the clinic).  As a rule, each of these sites is linked to a specific region.  The idemkvrachu.ru service is also a local phenomenon (the authors of the project live in Perm).  But with ambitious ambitions.  True, their ambitions relate only to private clinics, bypassing government agencies.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/overall-pain/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/41e/c78/a1c41ec7892ca69efe1002a5c23079ff.gif" align="left">  While we were studying the <a href="http://www.look-at.net/products/p1.html">JNova CMS</a> project, its author Tigran Ambaryan was trying to explain exactly how the interaction of private companies and government funding should be used, and what about the American shuttles, revolutions in Africa, and what the patriotism of state officials is.

According to the authors, this project has no analogues in Russia yet.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/overnight-with-a-bonus/">+++</a> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c9/121/19a/5c912119afc131088f64784b1f31d801.png" align="left">  ‚ÄúFinancial Strategies‚Äù is a trading platform that allows you to sell and buy securities automatically, based on user-defined parameters. <br>  With the help of the strategy constructor, the user can assemble a suitable trading strategy without using programming, and then let the system float free: all other actions will be performed automatically, the user can only watch.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/on-the-machine/">+++</a> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124230/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124230/</a></p>
