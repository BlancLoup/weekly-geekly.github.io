Seriously try them all - unreal.  So when I first got acquainted with the world of engines for sites, I had to choose at random.  Below I will describe my impressions of acquaintance with one or another engine for one purpose or another.  To some I will attach a brief description of the features, the impression of the others consists only of peering into the admin panel.  These notes were compiled and edited for a long time, but now I have decided that it is better to publish them in their current form than to edit them a little more for six months or a year without adding anything fundamentally new. <br>  The advantage is given to free engines.  Paid will be considered only for comparison or hopelessness, i.e.  if there are no free analogues.  Also technology limitations: php.  I didn‚Äôt hear more about engines on pearl and python, I had to do it with sharpe and java samopisnymi. <br>  So are considered <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">General Purpose CMS.</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Information sites, business cards, blogs ...</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Multifunctional monsters.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Galleries.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Social networks.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Forums</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92607/">Online shopping.</a> </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  General Purpose CMS.  Information sites, business cards, blogs ... </h3><ul><li>  <a href="http://max-3000.com/" rel="nofollow"><b>MaxSite CMS</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  There are few comments, I am the moderator of the official forum and in general one of those who have been following this system since birth.  Therefore, if anything, we will talk about MaksSayt separately. <br>  The system is written on the framework, therefore, any functionality can be added as you please.  Yes, and the system itself on top of the framework provides a large number of service APIs.  Therefore, it is no wonder that it will be found in other sections. <br>  The structure and clarity of the engine is initially blogging, but as the example of the same WordPress shows, this is not a limitation.  The advantages: good architecture and strong caching give good performance, convenience when writing extensions - the entire service part of the system takes over, flexibility of settings - the conditions for displaying widgets, building links, designing data types allow you to make sites very different in structure from blogs. <ul><li>  <a href="http://neutrino.net.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>Neutrino CMS</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  There are still some forki, someone's heir, and so on.  It seems to be a neutrino - the mosquito heir, and a neutrino atom edishn - fork neutrino.  CMS that does not use the database (and it took me one time and that).  For unpretentious business cards and blogs is fine.  Moreover, plug-ins can be written to her, and some of them already exist.  There is a publication tape, categories and tags, search (case-sensitive), patterns, CNC.  In atomics - in templates you can control blocks (very convenient, in fact). <br>  <b>Upd</b> .  <a href="http://atomic.neutrino.net.ru/" rel="nofollow">The Neutrino Atomic Edition will</a> still be better, although see below for even better. <ul><li>  <a href="http://mqblog.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>Mosquito Blood Mary</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  I had to try out the whole company: Neutrino Classic, Neutrino Atomic Edition, Nanote and Mosquito Blood Mary.  Of all of them, the mosquito made the best impression with a considerable margin.  It all started with the installer - no one else listed has it anymore.  Then absolutely all manipulations are done through the interface, and not manually.  Everything is convenient and clear.  A minimalistic system on files, but for so many cases it is enough.  Plus the most user friendly plugin documentation.  And by the possibilities of plus or minus, all are equivalent, maybe the mosquito is the most functional, and the nanote is the least functional.  Blocks, tags, comments and everything about them, rss, cat, minimalistic file upload, etc.  <a href="http://mqblog.ru/page/O_dvijke" rel="nofollow">More about the engine</a> . <ul><li>  <a href="http://reloadcms.com/main/" rel="nofollow"><b>ReloadCMS</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  One of the authors of this engine at the time created the gallery Pikateka, about which below.  This is another engine that does not use the database.  The engine on the files, but not the same as the above.  As modules of this engine there is a forum (the most primitive), a catalog, ratings, and even, it seems, a shop.  Also, the engine supports registration, user rights, and any other miscellaneous. <br>  The problem is the same as with Picateca - the project died in 2007. Another problem, judging by the reviews, with active use, the indexes of the file database are damaged, i.e.  needs a constant backup.  And I mention only then that sites that do not use databases are very well kept under version control systems. <ul><li>  <a href="http://imagecms.net/" rel="nofollow"><b>Image CMS</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  The third Russian-language engine I met on Codeigniter.  The first two are MaxSite and Cogear respectively.  If MaxSite is at the heart of the blogging, ‚ÄúWordPress Killer‚Äù and Kogir is a social network, then Image CMS, as far as you can see at a glance, is more of a portal engine.  At the moment, he is still sick with some childhood diseases, the first of which is a few supplements.  But otherwise it is a good engine, somewhat reminiscent of modx.  The functionality is standard: category tree, tags, comments, widgets, photo insert and gallery.  Additional fields allow you to design content types yourself.  There is a simple_cart.  And the main advantage over the first two engines: multilingualism out of the box.  I, however, did not investigate it, but at first glance it was made better than at MaksSayt. <ul><li>  Also, for general purpose sites, you can use Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and almost any favorite CMS ... </li></ul><br><h3>  Multifunctional monsters. </h3><blockquote>  The versatility of monsters lies in the fact that there is a lot of plug-ins for them, due to which you can build a portal, even a multiblog, even a store, even a gallery, even a social network, even though it all happens at once. </blockquote><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.joomla.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>Joomla</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  I started dating the year back in 2006 or 2007. Then the first branch still lived and developed.  The system was, as they say, not for the programmer.  From the admin can be designed absolutely everything.  But at the same time felt slowness.  One of the main drawbacks, but I still did not know that this drawback is the lack of Unicode.  But at the same time there was a gallery (and not one), there was some kind of opportunity to organize CNC, multilingualism (buggy, but better than nothing), something else ... <br>  Now had to face again.  Version 1.5.x is relevant.  Unicode is.  A bunch of already gov plugins.  CNC, forum (s?), Galleries, social network (and?), Shop (s?) And so on.  The sluggishness basically remained, but still I recommend the system to those who know it more or less and to whom it suits (or those who already have a project in Jumla) - I agree.  Surely caching can fix a lot. <br>  Russian-speaking communities, as far as I remember, were competing with each other.  joom.ru, joomla.ru or something like that.  Now they are pretty much more.  Which facilitates the search for information and answers to questions. <br>  <b>Upd</b> .  I had a chance to work with Joomla seriously.  Developer's impressions are completely obscene.  User experience is very favorable.  You can design everything.  But choose from the same plug-ins the least loading system, the least buggy one and the one that will not be abandoned (or transferred to a paid basis) for the next version of Joomla ... Quickly write yourself (not under Joomla, of course).  In general, if you are familiar with Jumla for at least a couple of years and know the picture and prospects of the plugins you need, then good.  And, yes, you should also have a powerful server, which is not afraid to roll a CMS with several thousand files and monstrous queries such as a sample of one entry per cycle. <br>  Another problem is that a lot of information that can be found belongs to Jumla 1.0.x, whereas version 1.5.x bears the same name simply due to a misunderstanding.  Internally, this is a completely different system.  And presumably this year should be released branch 1.6, which is pretty different already from 1.5. <br>  <b>Another update</b> .  Tested 1.6 beta 2. It was twisted. <ul><li>  <b>What is good</b> : more amenities in the admin panel.  Indeed much more powerful ACL.  Obviously for serious portals.  It still needs to be studied and customized.  SEF out of the box. </li><li>  <b>What is neutral</b> : the functionality is still the same Joomla. </li><li>  <b>What is promised</b> : compatibility with extensions 1.5, tag hierarchy, many improvements in the framework, new add-ons - libraries (they used to stand monolithically in the core), getting rid of the old legacy (and copy-paste) in the code. </li><li>  <b>What is bad</b> : except for ACL, a quick glance did not find anything from the promise, a lot of bugs on the simplest things (the order of menu items does not change, query errors come out on simple content hierarchies, etc.) one was not even established). </li><li>  <b>What is in retrospect</b> : one major version in three years, a very loose community, many add-ons are abandoned in the version for j1.0, about which material still appears.  Programming Guide for j1.5 is still not fully translated into Russian. </li><li> <b>What is in perspective</b> : release 1.6 is unlikely to be earlier than autumn.  Normally it is run in, porting the main add-ons, write manuals, and so on, not earlier than in a year.  Only then will it be possible to begin serious projects on j1.6.  Before that, only your own small Saitics, where everything is under control, and in which case you can fix the trap itself. </li></ul>  So it goes. <ul><li>  <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>Wordpress</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  To which he passed, leaving from Joomla - WordPress.  Admin WordPress after Joomla was the height of consistency and simplicity.  Moreover, the branch about 2.0.x was then relevant.  Unicode was already supported then.  Already immediately in the box were normal CNC, customized to the same.  At the same time, CMS turned over and was downloaded via FTP much faster than Joomla. <br>  The more I learned about WordPress, the more imbued.  Plugins - a lot.  These are galleries, and a forum, and multilingualism, and all kinds of catalogs, and shops, and devil with horns.  You can do anything from WordPress.  And with the assembly WP MU - also set multiblog satellites. <br>  But at the same time, as my knowledge improved and my WordPress version grew, I was increasingly terrified by the growing voracity.  And limitations in some way.  On version 2.8.0, it was possible at certain moments (when accessing the archive of a large site) to see 12,000 queries to the database.  This is one of the most impressive, but not the only example of what happens when a project has no leader and the roadmap is determined by voting. <br>  Again, this system can be recommended.  But at the same time it is desirable to know and be able to tune to maximum performance.  A big request to WordPress fans is not to make holivars here, because I express a subjective opinion, but confirmed by experience. <ul><li>  <a href="http://drupal.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>Drupal</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Another monster that can do everything, to which there are lots of plug-ins for all occasions. <br>  In the minuses the greater complexity of this system.  It so happened that for a long time trying to study it, I didn‚Äôt live with it.  Mice cried, pricked, but continued to eat the cactus. <br>  And yet in the minuses serious gluttony, no less, and sometimes more than the previous two engines. <br>  The main advantage of the drupal is a very developed and thoughtful system of hooks, which allows redefining practically any system event.  Plus, the two most popular modules, cck and views, allow you to construct arbitrary data types and their display. <br><h3>  Galleries. </h3><blockquote>  Once I have not seen normal galleries in the framework of other engines.  Therefore, explored individual galleries. </blockquote><ul><li>  <a href="http://coppermine-gallery.net/" rel="nofollow"><b>Coppermine</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Whether the first, or one of the first galleries with whom I met.  There are some complaints about the interface, subjectively, not everyone likes everything, but this is because the gallery is sharpened for multiuse, multi-albuming and so on.  User roles, user albums, limits, moderation, and so on. <br>  There are many translations, skins (tabular and handicraft), there are plugins.  Integration with Joomla and probably some other systems. <br>  The branch with which I got acquainted, develops for several years very sluggishly, mostly bug and security fixes.  The next branch has long been in svn, but only recently reached the status of beta and the "official" download. <br>  I would say that you can put it if the gallery is the main part of the site.  Moreover, there is a plugin that implements the simplest cms, so as not to put some other engine for several pages.  By the way, for the sake of several pages, you can put a neutrino. <br>  After years of four, at least the development has laid out version 1.5.x. <ul><li>  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pikateka/" rel="nofollow"><b>Pikateka</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  In contrast to the Coppermine, I really liked the pic patec.  Gallery pretty much easier.  Easy fast and convenient.  Almost everything you need, almost nothing more.  Instead of albums - tags.  Multiuse is, but basic.  The watermark in the code seems to be implemented, but it is not used by a separate function (class method), i.e.  enable from the admin can not be.  And the main inconvenience: links by tags use all the same tags, so for Russian add-ons, the links are terrible. <br>  Abandoned at the end of 2006. No plugins supported.  Of-site sunk into oblivion.  If you merge from svn, then not the last revision, but revision 179. There, by the way, there are bug fixes compared to the last archive. <br>  I wrote her some little things.  Little by little I port in MaxSite.  Tom just lacks a good gallery plugin. <br>  Ps Now I found out that the author was involved in the creation of ReloadCMS - a fairly large CMS that does not use a database. <ul><li>  <b><a href="http://gallery.menalto.com/" rel="nofollow">Gallery2</a></b> . </li></ul><br>  Monster from class galleries.  The code is ten times more than that of all the galleries.  There is integration with different CMS.  But since I never needed such power, I never really put it. <br>  Now I looked, I saw that in February, after several years of development, 3.0RC1 was released.  It turns out that the third branch was rewritten on Kohana.  As a result, she thoroughly lost weight.  Also from amusing: the project started for ten years now.  Perhaps this is the oldest project php-gallery of the remaining afloat. <ul><li>  <a href="http://minigal.dk/" rel="nofollow"><b>MG2, Minigal</b></a> .  <a href="http://www.simpleviewer.net/simpleviewer/" rel="nofollow"><b>Simpleviewer</b></a> </li></ul><br>  If you need a gallery without a database.  Two small, one - fork the other.  Abandoned in ¬± 2005. Simple, with basic capabilities (except that there wasn‚Äôt a lightbox then, but it‚Äôs easy to adapt). <br>  Simplviuver - one more thing without a database.  Flash viewer was interesting just in the absence of lightboxes and other special effects.  Although if you need a flash, you can adjust now.  The viewer itself is free, but there is a version for it with the surts, the lack of a link to download, etc., and a free plug-in for WordPress.  I'm thinking about how to adapt it to MaxSite.  But not very active, because for large volumes of photos he is not very adaptable. <blockquote>  Galleries without databases in the network you can find a great many, that on the suorsforge, that in phpclasses, that somewhere else.  And it‚Äôs quite simple to write or assemble such a script from pieces: navigating based on existing folders, reading files in these folders and displaying thumbnails, a bootloader with a pre-fixed authorization.  And the minimum program is completed.  You can attach a lightbox, and in the process of loading put watermark. </blockquote><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.zenphoto.org/" rel="nofollow"><b>Zenphoto</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Recently stumbled upon such a sample.  There are in the plugins: cms, slideshow, googlemaps, flwplayer.  It is a question of support for Ajax, multilingualism, skins, password protection access to albums.  There are awards that the gallery received.  Development began in 2005 and continues to this day.  There are rewards. <br>  Put on the third Denver did not want a mistake with five hundred - something she lacks. <br><h3>  Social networks. </h3><blockquote>  The functionality of social networks can be organized by any of the multifunctional monsters.  And even some forums.  I will especially mention MaxSite.  While one social network is deployed on it and more is being done.  But the system is pretty much not ready for this.  It is necessary to add a lot (architecture allows): admin panel for registered (well, not let them in the admin panel of the site), ratings, downloads, so that everyone has isolated and no access to the main one, photo albums are also isolated from foreign interventions and attached to users, tree comments.  Samborsky does not lay out his work, but to repeat them is more ready-made tools.  Although I still plan to repeat my own development for and so that you can use your favorite tool all the time. </blockquote><ul><li>  <a href="http://livestreet.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>LiveStreet</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  The first instance with whom he met in this field.  Although, I lie, the first was drupal.  :) So, in terms of functionality, this is quite a great social network.  Almost complete analog of Habr.  Personal and collective blogs, ratings, topics-polls, topics-links, invites.  Unfortunately, the gallery is paid, and even the top photo report is paid. <br>  And so the system is an excellent platform for social networks and adding the necessary functionality.  The most technologically advanced of those that I have seen, and so on.  There is actually a very good OOP, much like Java.  It can replace the forum if users are not too conservative about this and if they work a little with a file. <br>  As to the components: Smarty is used for display, mootools is used for client side.  To work with DbSimple data, for caching DklabCache (memcache is highly desirable).  To search for Sphinx, which accordingly must be installed on the server.  Well, a number of libraries. <br>  Actively developing (from September 2008 to June 2010, 940 commits, two active developers and several dozen third-party add-ons undergoing quality control).  I recommend if the functionality is enough for your purposes.  The advantage over the drupal and the company is that the drupal to the necessary functionality still needs to be finished. <br>  Now about the shortcomings.  There are two of them.  Despite the good optimization, for a full-fledged visited social network requires a dedicated server, i.e.  system requirements are not the smallest (see paragraph about memkesh and sphinx).  And to fine-tune the site on LiveStreet, you need to pledge certain resources of time and money or independent efforts.  This is not WordPress for you, which has free plug-ins and templates, but few are ready-made assemblies for all occasions. <ul><li>  <a href="http://bigstreet.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>BigStreet</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  The engine, in spite of which was created "Live Street".  Some time ago was in limbo.  Recently sold, after which its development resumed.  But it seems to be agonizing again.  The choice between these two is a matter of personal preference.  But personally, I did not really look.  Therefore, I only know that for a lively street, blogs on subdomains are implemented by a paid hack, and for a large one, it seems to be as standard. <br>  <b>Upd</b> .  The new developer evaluates the kernel as functional, but generally handicraft.  He is thinking about the correspondence of the kernel from scratch and perhaps on the framework - Zend or Kohana.  And the speed of development is still behind the development of LiveStreet. <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.explay.su/" rel="nofollow"><b>Explay</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Another copy.  Each thread is rewritten.  <s>A</s> third is <s>coming soon</s> .  But still, the code is very much abused.  I will not investigate more closely, because  enough tools and without it. <ul><li>  <a href="http://icore.net.ua/" rel="nofollow"><b>iCore</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Fork Expley.  More corrected, more secure, and in the upcoming release pretty much rewritten.  But even though the author claims that the project is alive, there is no evidence of this.  The latest release and the latest commit in svn in the fall of 2008. The latest publications on this topic in the spring of 2009. Further developments in public are not laid out.  Sites of the author on his own engine - are buggy.  The project is clearly dead, unlike its predecessor. <ul><li>  <a href="http://cogear.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>Cogear</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  <b>Description rewritten</b> .  Social network written in Codeigniter.  Of all the engines seen by the author of this - the most serious approach to the documentation, appearance, and all and every little thing.  And in general, the author made a giant dash when writing this engine.  Thoughtful architecture allows, if you have knowledge, to do anything on Cogear, although the engine is sharpened on the social network.  The disadvantages are that the whole author pulls on himself alone and is clearly tired.  Although threatens to rewrite from scratch and not on CI.  There are now a dozen add-ons and not a single topic in the plug-in catalog, but writing extensions is very simple and fast due to the architecture and the hook system.  Also, jambs sometimes occur, and the engine is completely unrelated to wine-hosting.  But the author responds very quickly to bug reports. <br>  Along with LiveStreet is a very technological engine, lagging behind LS only by the size of the community. <ul><li>  <a href="http://instantcms.ru/" rel="nofollow"><b>InstantCMS</b></a> . </li></ul><br>  Found by chance and was fascinated.  The engine that offers out of the box: a portal, personal and collective blogs, personal and collective photo albums, friendlists, clubs, ratings, guestbooks in profiles and file uploads in the same place, catalogs, FAQ, message boards, shop (modest complete and more serious as separate paid component), forum and devil with horns.  <s>What is missing is registration by invite.</s>  I‚Äôm getting better: already there, although a third-party add-on, but very, very functional. <br>  There are seventy tables in the database, but according to the load this is a completely sane decision, anyway, any social network needs a good server. <br>  The biggest drawback: the lack of unicode.  The second is that the table prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãfixed.  But the developers promise to fix it (I‚Äôm getting better, I already have one).  The project is live and code is not true.  Those.  I recommend, especially if there are enough opportunities for goals, and there is little time and knowledge. <br>  The organization of the admin panel and some logic are very similar to Joomla, sometimes it even seems that this is an assembly of Joomla with a different admin skin and an already selected set of components, modules and plug-ins. <br>  I don‚Äôt even know why I didn‚Äôt refer to multi-functional monsters. <br>  <s>Oh, and I also learned that a good forum is being written and soon released under this system.</s>  <s>Although if you consider that even the built-in is quite good, then this (with integration into the system) should be super at all.</s>  The forum is very modest, integration with third-party is needed.  In principle, the community has instructions for integrating with smf, but is slightly outdated. <br>  In general, the best BOX solution for a social portal. <ul><li>  <b>vBulletin, IPB, Vanilla</b> . </li></ul><br>  The first two forums are paid.  A vobla (paid, alas) has plows for galleries, blogs, etc.  It seems, at IPB - it is similar.  Vanilla is originally written on web-ideological ideology.  Very flexible architecture and pluggability.  I didn‚Äôt feel all three forums, but I‚Äôm planning to try vanilla.  But in principle, a popular social network can be built on any good forum. <ul><li>  <b>Social Engine</b> .  <b>DataLife Engine (DLE)</b> . </li></ul><br>  The most famous and common paid options.  DLE is commonly used for varezniki and news underground portals.  Plugins, skins and so on.  I didn‚Äôt see either one or the other from within, I mentioned it only because they are very common. <br><h3>  Forums </h3><ul><li>  For consideration: phpbb, other bb, vanilla, smf, something else.  PhpBB - very heavy, heaped up, powerful.  Very difficult to administer (I even dreamed of nightmares).  For simple cases, I do not recommend. </li><li>  In contrast, punbb - easy, smart and simple.  Somewhat unusual is that the extensions should be in the xml-files, but quickly got to figure out.  In the miniature and simplicity lies two dirty tricks.  First: if there is no functional, then it is not.  Second, many extensions modify the database structure and commit other mockery of the basic forum delivery.  Forum - for simple cases - the most it.  And judging by forum.mozilla-russia.org - you can take a chance and put this forum for a serious project.  Just keep in mind that forum.mozilla-russia.org has its own build of this forum, which already seems to be incompatible with the original.  But open. </li><li>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://vanillaforums.org/">Vanilla</a> (I have not tried it, but I will definitely test it) is a forum that was originally declared ‚Äúnot like others.‚Äù  Due to the modularity and more than 450 plug-ins, you can create forums of very different functionality and orientation.  The ease of the forum itself and the ease of learning, originally a web-based ideology, its own framework for writing extensions, the ability to embed the forum in a variety of engines.  Version 1.1.10 was released in November 2009. Version 2.0 is available in the repository, they say, the RC has just appeared.  The Russian community is modest and half-dead, but they pin their hopes on the output of two. </li><li>  Forum plugins have wordpress, drupal (in standard), it seems, Joomla ... </li><li>  For MaxSite, a primitive and very buggy forum in a limited circle is found one more is written.  Perhaps it will develop, including by my forces.  Up to about punbb functionality.  But it will not be soon, if at all. </li></ul><br>  In the comments I was provided with a supplement on <b>IPB and Wobble</b> .  Thank you <a href="http://lastdragon.habrahabr.ru/">LastDragon</a> 'u and <a href="http://devart.habrahabr.ru/">DevArt</a> ' u. <ul><li>  <a href="http://community.invisionpower.com/" rel="nofollow">IPB</a> </li></ul><br>  0) Off.  website: <a href="http://community.invisionpower.com/">community.invisionpower.com/</a> (link to the forum itself) <br><br>  1) It only makes sense to buy the third version (3.1.0 will be released soon) <br>  2) Paid: IP.Gallery, IP.Blog, IP.Downloads, IP.Content <br>  3) There are also free for clients: IP.Tracker (bug track, use themselves), IP.Shoutbox (chat), etc.  (can be found on their website) <br>  4) It is very easy to develop modifications (minor functional changes; in most cases, you can do without modifying the forum code) and applications (such as IP.Gallery, IP.Blog, etc.).  It is also very convenient to edit the templates (after turning on the design mode).  Unfortunately, it requires quite a lot of manual work when developing and especially assembling releases, but most of them have already been automated by me. <br>  5) All the documentation is on their website (EN), also available in Russian (not all) <br>  6) Disadvantages: there is a copy-paste and govnod (part of it is heritage), there are bugs, but they are promptly corrected.  Poor BB code parser (periodically doped). <br>  7) Multilingualism (not complete - not several languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan be translated into ACP at once, public part - all translated) <br>  8) Skin support (+ mobile version, + xml version).  IE6 is not supported.  Out of the box there are bugs in IE7 / 8. <br>  9) CNC (several types, support depends on the specific application) <br>  10) Enough resource demanding <br>  11) Sphinx support out of the box (you can create plugins for your own applications) <br>  12) Support for caching - out of the box uses the database, but the required cache is included in one line (memcached, eaccelerator, etc.) <ul><li>  <a href="http://vbulletin.org/" rel="nofollow">vBulletin</a> </li></ul><br>  The official site here is <a href="http://vbulletin.org/">vbulletin.org</a> , the official kammyuniti developers <a href="http://vbulletin.com/" rel="nofollow">vbulletin.com</a> , Russian not official technical support <a href="http://vbsupport.org/" rel="nofollow">vbsupport.org</a> (the oldest and most complete knowledge base in runet on this engine). <br>  Initially, vbulletin was developed by JelSoft, later all products and JelSoft itself were purchased by InternetBrands.  Accordingly, the developers have changed.  At this point, the release of the vBulletin 4 line was ripe, and nothing foreshadowed trouble.  For half a year already, the 4th version is still cheese, humiliatingly disgustingly compounded from what came of the programmers.  Even on the official list in the tag cloud, the ‚ÄúvB 4 Is gay‚Äù tag is a lot of fun.  If you want to try the engine in business - I advise version 3.8.  Reliable, stable. <br>  For vBulletin there are a huge variety of modifications.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Some are translated into Russian, you can look for example here </font></font><a href="http://devilart.net/nashi-relizy-99" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">devilart.net/nashi-relizy-99</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> or at the same vbsupport.org, and some are created by Russian developers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A lot of paid and free hacks. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For vbulletin there is a fairly large number of skins, there are many large, well-known forums on this engine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">VB has always been a leader in reliability and safety in the field of forum engines. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Relatively nice, clean code. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Modifications, CNCs are written simply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are many components that make life easier for SEOs. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Admin is simple and pleasant, multilingual support is supported. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Fultext is used as a search. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Full Russian translation engine (admin / user part) for all versions is.</font></font><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Online shopping. </font></font></h3><ul><li>   ,       . <s>     </s>      - (      ).     .           .     prestashop  ecshop.  magento. <s>      - ‚Äî  </s> (   ). </li><li> <b>osCommerce</b>     . </li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sometime with the phrase online store you could only submit a subject. Pioneer or not, but this is the first open source store that has become prevalent. Unfortunately, the osCommerce release was already in 2003, and the next branch is still in rc status. Personally, I have no desire to poke around in the code that carries the legacy of those years of development. There it is difficult to suspect the existence of a good object model, the division into functional, display and data, and so on. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since the license is gpl, then over the years the store has got a lot of clones and forks, both free and very expensive. There are many communities, and in general - there are so many things around osCommerce that you probably have the opportunity to find your own Holy Grail. Just look for him to be long and hard.</font></font><ul><li>  Magento </li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unlike osCommerce, Magento is a rather young engine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the Sourceforge Community Choice Awards 2008, Magento won the first prize in the nomination ‚ÄúBest New Project‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The engine is built on the Zend Framework, which immediately determines its monstrosity. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">He is big and heavy. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But also powerful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But also raw.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the company that develops it takes money for customization and support, so they have no reason to make a boxed candy. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The best choice if you know and be able to Zend Framework and not be afraid of incomplete Russification and gluttony. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It makes sense on large projects.</font></font><ul><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prestashop</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A project that I really liked.</font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is French mogazin, which I personally would create enough problems. But by the forces of the Russian community, the engine speaks Russian almost like a native. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is put on Denver without any problems. The installer is good, with ayaksovy checks. System requirements seem to be minimal. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">From the very first steps, security concerns are taken: the system enforces the need to rename the admin directory and remove the install directory. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The possibilities at first glance are impressive. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More than 130 tables in the database. I'll take a look at the load, but on the local machine it moves quite quickly. Although some people complain of voracity.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unpacked, it takes 14.5 MB, but more than three megabytes per tools, modules, img (demo data). One and a half meters js (jquery, tinymce and other stuff). 800 kb admin, 400 kb theme, 350 kb installer. 800 kb for 80 classes. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At first glance, OOP is pretty (php5), partly MVC, but not too ActiveRecord. I just do not see that the model was separately rendered. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Very serious service approach. Only the ‚ÄúTools‚Äù menu contains: CMS for creating several static pages of type FAK. There is a generator .htaccess and robots.txt. Backup database (right in the store), work with subdomains, import from .csv, customizable quick access menu in the admin panel, customizable widgets, localization.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, a lot of settings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Localizers worked very well, it is a pity that for Russia, not Ukraine. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are discounts, tax accounting, referral programs, etc. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Dofiga modules, four payment methods are supported (counting webmoney), statuses of goods (waiting for payment, goods ended, canceled, delivered, etc). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Naturally, a bunch of statistics. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By God, at first glance I really like this store by features, interface, and service! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Moreover, both for the admin and for the buyer.</font></font><ul><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ECShop</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chinese share. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately impressed: the first entry on the face gave 30 queries to the database, and the next - 4. Memory is also very economical.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">performance concern, caching ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The first entry into the admin panel gave 28 requests. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Over 70 tables in the database. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And more people tested - recognized this store as the most economical for the server. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can make optimization, backup and even direct queries from admin panel: ‚ÄúSQL query works directly with the database. You must understand what you are doing. ‚Äù </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are crowns. There are, as in presto, customizable quick menu items. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More advanced CMS: not just pages, but categories by tree / types. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is an integration with the forums, including roach (3.x), ipb (2.1 \ 2) and phpbb (2.x). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Guestbook, user groups (clients). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mailings, affiliate programs, banners, SMS, delivery \ payment, bonuses, sales.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Translated well, but not as thoroughly as presto. However, the work goes. There is a nuance: translation 1.6.2, 1.7.0 and further - on a paid subscription. Therefore, I watched 1.6.1. Although later on nulleda found a translation for 1.7.2. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you choose between this store and presto, I do not even know what to choose. Presto liked more, especially the way it is translated and adapted, but here there is integration with forums and something else. In addition, there is guaranteed strong caching. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3.5 mb inclusions, incl. FCKeditor. Of these, 1.3 MB is something about the Chinese codepage. 2.8 mb admin panel 1.5 mb theme. Some more data, js, api, wap, etc. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is almost no OOP, and the impression is that it will be much more difficult to deal with the architecture and write modules \ etc. But in general, a worthy candidate.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It seems like a smartizer template, but something strange is there. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, the templates have a non-standard extension.</font></font><ul><li> <a href="http://www.opencart.com/" rel="nofollow"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OpenCart</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">People who are horrified by the osCommerce code and the magento voracity recommend OpenCart. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The comparison table on the site promises that the engine can do more than osCommerce and prestashop. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is Russian, there are several dozen (maybe a couple hundred in total) modules, templates, etc. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The next time you search for the perfect store, this is a research candidate.</font></font><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Plugins </font></font></li></ul><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are plugins of different capabilities to different CMS. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often, if you already have a website and you need to add a store to it, then it is best to find a plugin for the CMS on which the site is built. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Drupal these are: Ubercart (recommended) and e-Commerce. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Joomla: virtuemart (there are no alternatives and I recognize that the plugin is powerful, but more than a thousand files are something with something. Considering the several thousand Joomla files and the general awkwardness of that system, what a plugin is). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For WordPress a couple of plug-ins are. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you need a social network with a store, I will recommend InstantCMS ...</font></font></div>
