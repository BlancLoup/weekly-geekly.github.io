  <section class="page js-page"><h1>George Soros first invested in the Ukrainian IT market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ukrainian Redevelopment Fund LP, a George Soros Development Fund of Ukraine, acquired a stake in the Danish company <a href="http://www.ciklum.com/">Ciklum</a> .  Ciklum provides outsourcing services.  Ukraine has its largest development office.  It is known that the fund acquired less than half of the shares.  He bought out the stake owned by <a href="http://www.horizoncapital.com.ua/ru">Horizon Capital</a> (it ranged from 10% to 25%), as well as part of the stake owned by Majgaard Holdings Ltd, the company Torben Maygaard, the founder of Ciklum.  This transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2015. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a very dynamic company in the industry, which represents the future of Ukraine.  It is also an investment in what I call the ‚Äúnew Ukraine‚Äù - a country of young, well-educated Ukrainians who are eager to say goodbye to the past and build an open society.  I hope this deal will serve as an example for other investors, ‚Äùsaid George Soros, commenting on the deal. <br><br>  The transaction was moderated by the well-known Ukrainian investment fund <a href="http://rusbase.com/investor/view/aventures-capital">AVentures Capital</a> .  It was thanks to his partners that the investment team of George Soros met with the Ukrainian IT industry, with its representatives and products, including Ciklum. <a name="habracut"></a>

      According to AVentures partner Andrei Kolodyuk, his role in the negotiations was that Ciklum management, representatives of the Soros Foundation and Horizon Capital would not only get to know each other, but would also agree on favorable terms of cooperation.  After that, Andrei was invited to join the board of directors of Ciklum. <br><br>  The fund will be a strategic partner for Ciklum, says Kolodyuk.  With such financial support, the company will be able to open new offices around the world, including the United States.  And in the end - perhaps, will be released on the IPO in New York. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Soros fund already has more than 40 deals worldwide.  This is not only the first investment in Ukraine, but also the first in the field of IT services (outsourcing).  For all IT, the arrival of a new investor on the market is very important, especially such a large one.  This is a signal for all the world's leading investors that it is possible and necessary to invest in Ukraine.  We have both companies, ideas, and talents - no need to be afraid to enter the country, make deals, ‚ÄùKolodyuk <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/11/18/616333">told</a> ain.ua publication. <br><br>  The founder of Cyclum, Torben Maigaard, previously participated in joint ventures with AVentures: last April they <a href="http://ain.ua/2014/04/17/520385">participated</a> in a new round of investments in the Ukrainian company Coppertino, and also in a <a href="http://ain.ua/2014/04/15/520044">deal</a> with Augmented Pixels. <br><br>  Ciklum is an international company that develops software and outsource IT services.  The company was founded in 2002 by the Dane Torben Meygaard (also the chief executive officer of the company - IF) in Kiev.  It has offices in Ukraine, Great Britain, Switzerland, Denmark, Belarus and Pakistan. <br><br>  Ciklum is one of the largest outsourcers in Ukraine.  According <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/08/17/598102">to the</a> DOU in August, about 2,300 people worked in the Ukrainian offices of the company. <br><br>  In 2012, Ciklum <a href="http://ain.ua/2012/04/25/82326">received</a> investments from Horizon Capital - now this share has passed to new owners.  Horizon this year made another big deal - he <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/07/13/591473">invested</a> in the largest online store Vanet "Rosette". <br><br>  The Development Fund of Ukraine is a private investment fund that focuses on special situations and private investments in Ukraine, as well as companies with significant transaction volumes in Ukraine.  The main investment advisor to the Development Fund of Ukraine is Soros Fund Management LLC, a private investment advisor to several private investment funds that work exclusively for clients of the Soros family. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296474/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296474/</a></p>
