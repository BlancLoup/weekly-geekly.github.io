That is why I wrote that the OT, while not motivating, but keeps well at the current place of work. <br>  But can all employers take advantage of this ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúworking‚Äù methodology? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What happens if they all increase the RFP? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e0/957/e74/4e0957e7406939ad25e57ce485825b08.png"><br>  Programmers, of course, will live better.  But the picture will remain the same.  Half the salary will still be below average.  Just by definition mean.  But the tangible advantages of the position of the OT will again be enjoyed only by a few who have moved well to the ‚Äúright‚Äù. <br>  That is, purely mathematically, <b>most of the companies can not keep employees with high wages.</b> <br>  This is a sad but inevitable reality. <br>  And in this reality, everyone finds their place.  Every employer and every employee. <br><br>  Let's talk a little about which companies can approach which strategy?  Maybe you can select the criteria? <br><br><ul><li>  A large company makes a sophisticated product innovation.  Dismissing leading developers can have a very negative impact (especially if they go to a competitor).  Technologies are unique.  Will they overstate salary?  Will be. </li><li>  A large company writes software to order.  The process is well-established, developer care is not very expensive.  The company has a well-known name, a good training center, a stream of projects and for a beginner it‚Äôs an opportunity to gain a lot of experience.  Will they overstate salary?  There will be, but only for the coolest specialists, and for the main mass - even to understate. </li><li>  The company makes sites.  A lot on the conveyor.  Site builders are many.  Dependence on developers - low.  Technologies are used standard.  Called * web * soft *.  Do they need to overstate salaries?  It seems to me - no. </li><li>  The company makes sites.  A lot on the conveyor.  Site builders are many.  Dependence on developers - low.  Technologies are used standard.  But this, say, Lebedev Studio.  Will they have higher salaries?  I think they will. </li></ul><br>  What is the difference?  No, we must run into Lebedev, our rating does not increase for the number of comments.  We conduct cluster analysis, identify the influencing factors.

      Lebedev Studio is positioned on the upper price segment of the market.  And that is why their sites are more expensive, design is more expensive, specialists are more expensive. <br>  But after all they are arranged almost the same as * web * soft *? <br><br>  The market will always have a top price segment.  And there will always be companies operating in this segment.  And all things being equal, they will have everything more expensive.  And above the RFP.  And as a result - the opportunity to hire the best.  So, make the product on average better quality.  And thus positioning itself on the upper segment of the market.  The circle is closed. <br><br>  Like it or not, we will always have an uneven distribution of wages.  Which is true in general, given the uneven distribution of talent. <br>  However, it never hurts anyone to find a job more interesting and with a large income. <br>  The main thing is to desire, to strive and move in the chosen direction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167683/</a></p>
