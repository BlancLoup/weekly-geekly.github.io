  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opera will answer for everything</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/820/5a9/7cc/8205a97cc309549a69d3d8dd7d36d460.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As many may have noticed, recently Opera has constantly surprised the well-educated public: either the Unite revolution starts, then suddenly, for no reason at all, it dumbfounded by a tenfold (or already more?) Increase in the speed of the browser, and only about any innovations in interface or in support of future web standards can be mentioned a little weekly.  There are also surprises with a negative effect, after which users get tired of turning the mouse wheel, looking at the lists of fixed bugs in the next weekly build.  In general, every sensible person has a reasonable question: damn it, what's going on in them in this Norway ?! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The question is, of course, interesting.  But it would be much more interesting to find out the answer to it - all of a sudden it will help preserve a million or other nerve cells or just make the general direction understandable - where the thoughts and dreams of Opera browser developers are directed.  Well, this problem is solved.  And this topic serves as a kind of announcement of the new initiative - <b>"Opera Habragost"</b> .  The idea is simple and uncomplicated: every month, one of the Opera Software employees will answer questions from Habrahabr visitors, with each virtual interview focusing on a specific topic - for example, the browser interface, the new JavaScript handler named Carakan, Unite technology, the mobile browser Opera Mini or even the process of fixing bugs - why not?  In this case, the questions will be answered by people who occupy not the last place in the staffing table - up to the director of the company or even the chief financial officer.  Of course, they will not tell everything (there must be some mystery in this company), but I am sure that, for example, communication with one of the co-founders of Opera Software will not be boring.  However, to a greater extent, everything will depend on the quality of the questions.  Therefore, some time is allocated for their preparation - suppose, a week.  Quite a sufficient time. <br><br>  By tradition, we will make the first pancake a lump (then we'll fix it - we won't be used to it) - for example, until I say exactly when the interview will be published: according to my plans, this will be something around the second week of July - it still takes time to collect and translate questions, and then also translate the answers (which also take some time, as it were).  In the future, a certain day will be chosen (maybe the last Friday of each month?) For publication on Habr√© of the next interview.  As for the topic of questions - a little later I will spend in a separate topic ‚Äúreferendum‚Äù in order to compile a list of the topics that are most relevant to you and only then build a schedule taking into account the availability of the direction of interest: after all, people work (yes, it happens) and some (such as those responsible for the <a href="http://my.opera.com/chaals/blog/">Chaals</a> web standards) generally live on airplanes.  In general, over time, I hope, it will turn out to make quite a stable and interesting in all respects dialogue between developers and users.  I think that both we and you will benefit only.

    <img src="http://files.myopera.com/IlyaShpankov/files/johan.jpeg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Let's get down to business, actually.  The topic of our first interview will probably not be very ‚Äúhot‚Äù: Opera Software‚Äôs <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/opera/blog/92535/">acquisition of the</a> Australian FastMail.FM mail service and, as a result, what can we all expect from this acquisition in the future.  The questions will be answered by the vice-president of the company Opera Software, the head of this new direction for us - <a href="http://my.opera.com/borg/about/"><b>Johan Borg</b></a> , who previously headed the team of managers and developers of the desktop version of Opera.  Based on the post, it will be much more interesting to ask him questions of a more global nature, rather than go into technical subtleties. <br><br>  Questions will be accepted <b>until June 25</b> inclusive; if there is an opportunity to immediately issue a question in English, I will only welcome it.  Comments to the questions, of course, can be added, but it‚Äôs not worthwhile to dilute very extensive discussions or disputes - this will create certain difficulties in drawing up the list of questions. <br><br>  So, to fix: <br>  <b>Opera Habragost</b> <br>  <i><b>Topic:</b></i> Opera + FastMail.FM - what will happen now? <br>  <i><b>Who:</b></i> Vice President Johan Borg <br>  <i><b>When:</b></i> In early July <br>  <i><b>Reception of questions:</b></i> until June 25 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96798/</a></p>
