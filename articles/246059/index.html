  <section class="page js-page"><h1>This is not a simple mobility.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  December 4, 2014 in Moscow held a conference "PROmobility", dedicated to the use of mobile technologies in business.  In fact, a much wider range of issues was discussed.  The main trend is remote execution of tasks and related features. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/d1f/217/67fd1f2170c948ca83d479305478874f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Recently, we most often associate remote work and the processes associated with it with the physical absence of an employee in the office.  For some time now it has become fashionable to work from home, another city, another country.  Fortunately, technologies allow it for a long time, and the results of such work are easily sent by e-mail or through cloud technologies.  However, the question is much broader.  The category of mobile workers includes not only "off-site", but also all sorts of repair and rescue teams that need centralized coordination of work and reliable communication.  Specialists who go on business trips to remote sites also need an appropriate infrastructure, which allows them to organize work on site efficiently and with maximum comfort.  However, the number of mobile workers is increasing.  And they all need to provide high-quality communications and reliable equipment.  And, if the responsibility for the reliability and availability of mobile networks lies with the operators of these networks themselves, then the question of providing mobile workers with the necessary infrastructure lies on the shoulders of the developers of both hardware and software.  And representatives of these developers gathered at the PROmobility conference. <br>  Hardware issues have been raised by big players like Intel and Lenovo.  In principle, both companies made a close partnership, proposing joint hardware solutions.  The technology for the mobile business has several specific requirements.  Super performance is not so important here.  But the reliability and long battery life is extremely necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f7/e57/7ea/6f7e577ea6d444e0b2f73332c49b6a98.jpg">

      Lenovo has a variety of hardware solutions.  For example, the physical protection of the company‚Äôs ThinkPad notebooks is well developed.  Magnesium-aluminum frame protects laptop filling from falling, carbon-fiber body with fiberglass makes the design noticeably lighter and stronger than ordinary plastic.  In the presence of protection against water - Lenovo ThinkPad notebooks are not afraid of the liquid spilled on them.  By the way, in this case, the keyboard can still be periodically washed, thereby improving the sanitary and hygienic state of the gadget.  The most common problem with the fall of laptops is damage to the hard drive with the loss of all data.  Lenovo offers an APS system that controls the device‚Äôs position in space.  In the event of a sharp change in this position, the system promptly ‚Äúparks‚Äù the magnetic heads of the hard drive and stops the rotation of the magnetized disks.  Most often this is enough to ensure that the data on the disk is not lost. <br>  Interesting branded dual power system.  In addition to the regular capacious battery in the design of the ThinkPad, an additional battery is provided to ensure uninterrupted operation of the device.  The main battery itself is made with the principle of hot-swappable.  That is, it is possible, without interrupting the work, to replace the dead battery with a charged one, and then put it on charge.  By the way, Lenovo implemented RapidCharge fast charging technology, which reduces charging time by an average of 2.5 times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b34/1d8/8bb/b341d88bb252410f86edbb69d13d0250.jpg"><br><br>  Intel representatives in their report focused on hardware security issues.  The Intel Core vPro 4 generation processor introduced by the company was created specifically for business.  In addition to low power consumption, this processor allows you to organize computer protection at the hardware level.  This solution is not a panacea, nor is it the NOD32 software antivirus technology from EsSet presented at the same conference, but it effectively protects the system from external unauthorized impacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bd/fe3/f77/3bdfe3f771f840ca8a298ee446f77ec8.jpg"><br><br>  The same platform allows you to organize remote access to the system if necessary.  Here, Intel raised another problem of mobile work - it is often difficult for an employee, being away from the support service of his company, to fix the problem on his own.  The solution from Intel, which, by the way, is actively used in Lenovo laptops, allows you to quickly restore the system after a failure.  This function has proven itself in a business environment where a very low number of users have specific knowledge in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrestoring the operating system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/1a7/4ac/f791a74aca7c4e13b1708269423fd68c.jpg"><br><br>  The software part of mobile business software is a broader concept than hardware.  This includes the organization of remote management of employees and the distribution of tasks between them in accordance with their competence and distance to the object.  For example, the international company ClickSoftware that participated in the conference demonstrated its own version of the HRM-system for remote employee management.  The basic principle is to maximize the simplicity of the interface for end workers and a clear picture of the workflow for the dispatcher.  The real-time manager on the map sees the location of the employee and the degree of his employment, as well as his level of competence to solve the task.  After that, it makes a decision on its appointment to this or that employee.  The system has two options for work - it is a physical installation on the server, computers and gadgets of the client company or providing it with access to its cloud service. <br>  Many companies participating in this conference offered different ways to solve remote work issues.  However, almost everyone agreed that there were many more questions than could be covered at this event.  For example, psychological problems of remote work were mentioned in passing.  And this is a whole powerful layer of various aspects related to the effectiveness of such work.  For example, the regular lack of personal communication of employees, which takes place in a traditional office, leads to the loss of personal communication skills in principle.  This plays a negative role in employee motivation.  In addition, remote work blurs working time, reduces concentration on the task.  This adversely affects the efficiency of such labor.  And everything depends on the internal ability of an employee to self-organize and self-motivate, which, although not a direct topic of the last conference, is one of the key issues regarding the organization of mobile work.  And here those very decisions that relieve workers from the worries and worries associated with the organization of work away from the office play a big role.  Let's go back to the Lenovo ThinkPad example - an employee doesn‚Äôt have to worry about an operating system crash.  If that happens, then he should press the cherished button on the keyboard - and after a few minutes he will receive a fully working system in the form in which it was before this annoying failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a61/9f2/a16/a619f2a168d74d5b8d0d0f5e308f39c1.jpg"><br><br>  So what is the mobile business today?  Today, this trend, which is gaining more and more popularity, has many positive aspects.  This includes savings in workplaces, lower costs for depreciation of equipment and resources, prompt resolution of issues away from the head office.  This is a new philosophy of business organization in general.  So far, there are not so many competitive solutions to this issue - most are just being created.  But the already existing ecosystem, consisting of hardware and software solutions, makes it possible to effectively apply it in various fields. <br><br>  But, is there any future for the universal transition to the mobile work of all areas where it is possible, is not yet clear.  Too many questions to answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f87/811/66c/f8781166ccb9421fb99ba0a6ba81982b.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246059/</a></p>
