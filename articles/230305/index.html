Personal life analyzer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Continuing to acquaint you with interesting gadgets, today I got to the device W / Me.  Last time, we at MedGadgets looked at a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/225005/">Polar Loop</a> bracelet that performed fairly standard functions: a pedometer, a heart rate monitor, and calorie counting.  In W / ME, everything is not so, therefore it cannot be called a fitness tracker in the usual sense of the word.  Let's just say, the most common thing he can do is measure heart rate.  But I didn‚Äôt see any other functions in bracelets at all.  Well, we begin to understand? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f73/28e/adf/f7328eadf184ff055216fe7ad5e7bdd7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By tradition, let's start with the box.  Here it is ordinary, but not quite simple.  In a carton package, this wooden case is hidden.  Beautiful, but no functionality, only takes place.  Inside the bracelet itself and instructions.  No adapters, covers or anything else, everything is very concise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddd/1f1/6f5/ddd1f16f5269caf288bdd9d1d3c73c60.jpg">

      Bracelet looks pretty standard.  It differs from other models, perhaps, the arch concave inside.  It does not press on the arm, but is needed to ensure that the metal plate for measuring your indicators fits snugly to the arm.  You should not be afraid, this part of the W / Me is made of plastic and covered with a rather soft rubber, so there‚Äôs nothing to rub in this place, and I didn‚Äôt feel any discomfort when using the bracelet.  But, thanks to this design, the bracelet is suitable for any wrist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b97/062/8f7/b970628f72ae1ff0a162f89c61975807.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, this part of the bracelet can be replaced.  It is enough just to unbend it strongly, as the lower part will click off and the bracelet will split into two halves.  This is hardly useful, unless you want to change the color, but these are trifles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/136/697/ad1/136697ad1ff4733fcb48be2751b1a7eb.jpg"><br><br>  On the front side of the device are several items.  First, it is a screen made from a set of LEDs, but about it a little later.  Secondly, it is a button to control the bracelet.  However, it also performs the functions of a conductor when measuring the pulse.  Just put your finger on it, the second metal element on the inside of the bracelet is already touching your hand, and the pulse measurement begins.  Alas, measurements occur only when the chain is closed, that is, your finger is on the button, and the bracelet is worn on your hand.  It is a pity, of course, it would be useful for many to measure the pulse during training, when it is inconvenient to hold your hand on the bracelet.  Well, there is also a latch with which you can unfasten the bracelet to remove it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/321/72d/4c6/32172d4c6ff8050b8085e8674064a843.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, as for charging the bracelet, everything is as in Nike Fuelband, the USB connector is hidden in the bracelet itself, it is very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/392/e85/8cd/392e858cd3dfbb97ab6ddc0d494cbe9e.jpg"><br><br>  I like that the bracelet has a screen, it is made of 120 diodes.  This allows you to not get a smartphone every time you want to see the pulse, time or something else.  However, most of the data can be seen, of course, only in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e20/8ca/53f/e208ca53f14c691a2702d8e690e4928e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/620/cff/b6f/620cffb6fa6d900dae98167e066b79df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e01/ea7/de2/e01ea7de2608cfda1bd1cb71fee030d8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now I‚Äôll tell you how this bracelet is different from all the gadgets on the market.  Just want to say: this is not a fitness tracker.  It will not measure how many kilometers you have run, how you slept, etc.  His analysis is more interesting.  Usually for measuring heart rate electrodes are used that need to be lubricated.  Phyode immediately developed a dry electrode that performs several counting cycles.  This allows you to use the sensor more conveniently.  The device uses measuring amplifiers, filters, ADC and digital signal processor.  The gadget collects and processes the original microvolt signals to show you the state of the body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/829/d0c/70e/829d0c70ec9fabbda64d04728ce90b75.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6a/519/016/a6a519016a3db1b8f22a8c444cbeec64.jpg"><br><br>  The presentation here is unusual, I have never met before.  This so-called life spectrum analyzer is used to determine your subconscious mental state, be it balanced, pessimistic, excitable or restless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cb/140/dea/8cb140dea6a15789b5664022b30cb9ed.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63e/4d4/355/63e4d4355713f32a64bbe5f25b06efbb.jpg" width="310"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e78/dbf/3ee/e78dbf3ee1e319aad507ce79836b5461.jpg" width="310"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/453/6a2/c754536a260d29ccbebf6e0a07acfca6.jpg" width="310"><br><br>  The company worked with physicians and collected a lot of data with which you can determine the age of your autonomic nervous system.  Most often it turns out to be higher than your real one.  It can be improved by breathing exercises and making the necessary changes in your lifestyle.  The application will help you with breathing, but finding out whether you should eat less or run more is already your task, here the program is not your assistant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9da/49b/661/9da49b661157db287e647ee02210ebfe.jpg" width="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7db/dc9/8d7/7dbdc98d7d8e05c82e87ca9742f78e09.jpg" width="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fea/fd5/ab9/feafd5ab974a9603b3d44980fb948d56.jpg" width="235"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94f/367/f9c/94f367f9cabcde2cc7f44937ff55fef0.jpg" width="235"><br><br>  The application has a coaching platform with 5 different levels for training diaphragmatic breathing.  Each level is determined by a different respiration rate.  So, if you have not learned how to breathe properly, the program will teach you.  Thanks to these controls, you can improve your autonomic nervous system.  Following the prompts you can set the optimal pace of your breathing and choose an acceptable level.  In training mode, ECG, heart rate and system status data is displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce2/e63/0a6/ce2e630a66483829c12f1b7ea6189ddb.jpg" width="310"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17e/490/cd9/17e490cd9c61b6212ddb70e3717af7f7.jpg" width="310"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab4/7f4/4ea/ab47f44eaa6b283cf59c04d2f79e55d5.jpg" width="310"><br><br>  In the application, you can see the history and analyze the changes.  All figures are given with explanations, so when using the program everything should be clear, there will be no problems.  This bracelet just needs to be used and looked after its dynamics.  If your condition worsens after your changes in life, then you are doing something wrong.  Thus, the bracelet has essentially two modes of operation.  The first is monitoring your vital signs: heart rate and respiration, as well as analyzing a person‚Äôs condition based on this data.  And the second is the instruction mode - in which the app and the gadget teach you proper breathing. <br><br>  But if this function of the bracelet had ended, it would be rather boring and the creators would hardly have collected the necessary amount on Kikstarter.  If there is a screen, then Phyode was made here and the clock.  Very convenient, no need to get a smartphone to watch the time.  In addition, if the bracelet is still connected via Bluetooth, then why not display notifications on it from the phone?  Therefore, if you connect the bracelet to your smartphone, then when you receive a call or SMS, the W / Me will vibrate.  But if you have a vibrating alert, you can‚Äôt make an alarm clock - this is a rather strange decision, it would be useful for many. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/221/9a9/b14/2219a9b144c0de7ca6610b6e426033c8.jpg"><br><br>  However, this is also not all.  There is a smartphone search function here.  Press the button and the application on the phone will start to make sounds.  And if the phone suddenly turns out to be out of range of the Bluetooth bracelet, then the gadget will vibrate and say that the user has left his phone somewhere.  Well, another little thing - the bracelet button can be used to remotely launch the phone‚Äôs built-in camera.  But the ‚ÄúFlashlight‚Äù function, as it seems to me, is still superfluous in the bracelet.  Although, if the LED screen is still anyway, then why not give the opportunity to light them all at once and, perhaps, help to insert the key into the keyhole or to find the phone in the dark.  But it looks, of course, funny.  The gadget is compatible with both iOS devices and Android.  If only there was Bluetooth 4.0, it will not work without it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/758/961/13e/75896113e414e765a85a4915e267f7b9.jpg"><br><br>  Phyode w / Me bracelet is a very interesting device.  This is no longer a fitness bracelet in its standard sense, but a monitoring system.  The combination of hardware and software module allows you to determine the state of the nervous system and conduct training to normalize breathing and generally lead a healthy lifestyle.  It is a pity, of course, that this bracelet does not measure the number of steps and other physical activities.  But it can be useful not only for athletes, but for everyone who wants to monitor their body.  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/braslet-w-me.html">The bracelet</a> costs about 7,500 rubles, which is quite an adequate price for such a gadget.  In general, I liked the bracelet, this is an interesting thing, geeks should like it.  Not without cons and oddities, of course, but the gadget is entertaining. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/230305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/230305/</a></p>
