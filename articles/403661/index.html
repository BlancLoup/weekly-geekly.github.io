  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Screwdriver Zen or Masthev for DIY Ninja</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Geektimes!  Here, for example, you finished your long-suffering repair, but minor household chores do not end there (adherents of this craft will not let us lie): somewhere you need to tweak, somewhere to solder, and so on.  In addition, if you have not even touched your household chores, you cannot even do without special equipment - the DIY-ninja must always be armed.  We took the liberty to make a selection of tools, without which it would be difficult to know Zen. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/288925/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/041/cb1/651/041cb1651f70643a8375093ad7eb80e1.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  No, we are not talking now about punchers with screwdrivers - here you will surely manage yourself, the needs are different for everyone.  Today we will talk about the tools for minor repairs, which ideally should be every DIY-master in the box. <br><br>  Let's start with something simple - for example, a soldering iron.  If earlier it was big tools with power supply only from the socket, now you can easily get a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/other-tools/pp_240618.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">USB soldering iron</a> (5V / 1.6A / 8W).  The kit already has everything you need for quick soldering and for only five dollars.  The main thing, as they say, is to <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/soldering-supplies/pp_397753.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">have enough consumables</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c23/651/1e2/c236511e220368f91b8651f4b8f2f48b.jpg">  Such a device is more suitable for small tasks, but if you want to do soldering like a real pro, you cannot do without a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/soldering-supplies/pp_315075.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">full-fledged soldering station</a> (60W).  There is at least one obvious advantage - the ability to regulate the temperature.  Heats up quickly and cools down, which is important if there are small children in the family, and the whole structure looks much more reliable.

We have a lot of such tools in the store (including pneumatic ones), with different sizes: here‚Äôs <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/soldering-supplies/pp_311749.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">a simpler device for a couple of dollars</a> for a small soldering or a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/other-instruments/pp_453057.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">more powerful unit</a> with a piston with a double oil sealer, a durable anti-corrosion spring and a lightweight removable tip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/84b/cd9/e38/84bcd9e384310d1957d63eaf3110e527.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/38f/f74/0c4/38ff740c4df187ec2609f07e72842cd8.jpg"><br><br>  And there are generally <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/rc-parts/pp_27702.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">ready-made kits</a> for $ 10, where you already have the necessary consumables, a simple tin pump and a couple of screwdrivers (and why not).  In general, as you understand, we are fine with the soldering Zen, go to the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/soldering-supplies-c_11374%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">appropriate section</a> and choose what you like - there are a lot of pleasant discounts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/054/30e/453/05430e453da135be5cf973631d7d2281.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Not soldering uniform </h2><br>  Of course, only a small amount of homework is not limited to soldering.  In this case, obviously, one cannot do without a screwdriver - but not ordinary, but magnetic, it is desirable that there are still a lot of nozzles in the kit for all occasions.  There is such a set, it costs about 12 dollars, <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/screwdriver-screwdriver-set/pp_351005.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">and even 52 bits in a box</a> , so that if something happens, you can repair everything.  With it, you can repair home electronics, toys, household appliances, and tools for repair, for that matter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/990/162/477/9901624774be13770ff060500ea69dbc.jpg"><br><br>  Or, at least a cool thing - a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/hand-tools/pp_211613.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">‚Äúsmart‚Äù head for a screwdriver</a> (from 7 to 19 mm).  Everyone is familiar with the situation when you first need to unscrew one screw, screw another excellent type, accompanying all this with a change of nozzle and a corresponding loss of time.  A single "smart" head itself recognizes the type of screw, so you can unscrew the shelf mounts, hang the roller blind and pull the wheel off the bike with one nozzle.  The piece is small, and replaces a whole decent set. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2df/043/623/2df04362358613b651e05582704c84c5.jpg"></div><br>  And since we started talking about all-in-one tools, it is impossible not to mention the <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/wrenches/pp_343015.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">adjustable socket wrench</a> (from 7 to 19 mm).  An indispensable assistant not only for the DIY-enthusiast, but also when conducting automotive work on metal and wood. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a8/556/472/2a85564723f36eb1c781739d17152e3e.jpg"><br>  Previously, in the classroom for work, every workplace didn‚Äôt have to have large massive grips ‚Äî when it was necessary to cut something with a hacksaw or trim it with a file, it was hard without them.  Of course, you cannot put such a thing at home, even if you are a DIY enthusiast with experience (except in a garage or workshop), so for limited space we have <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/pliers/pp_342897.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">compact grips</a> for $ 4, which can be useful for any work - for example, repairing a small technology.  If the latter is well fixed, it is much more convenient and easier to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03f/13d/784/03f13d784166503e264a8138c4033f99.jpg"><br>  Often minor repairs are not accompanied by the use of a screwdriver or a soldering iron, but by working with glue.  Regular glue from a tube is hardly appropriate here - it is not too resistant to moisture, it can leave traces on the materials, and then you will get tired of washing your hands.  It is quite another thing - a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/soldering-supplies/pp_605454.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">glue gun</a> , with which you can perform any repair work, where glue is involved.  It is not only more convenient, but also more reliable, for good reason many people use glue guns in their hobbies related to the fastening of small parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8b/c2d/79a/b8bc2d79a9876c7c4a618eda4205a1d7.jpg"><br><br>  One more tool from the arsenal of our ninjas is connected with the network - more precisely, with the work on its creation.  This is a set that includes crimping pliers, four RJ45 and RJ11 connectors, as well as equipment for testing network performance, so that you do not have to run around the house with a laptop to test each Ethernet outlet.  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/pliers/pp_386542.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">It costs only 12 dollars</a> - you can buy only the ticks in the shops for such money. <br><br>  Well, since all this needs to be somehow systematized so that everything is at hand, throw <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/storage-supplies/pp_364346.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such a bag</a> into the basket - on the farm, as they say, useful, but do not run into the tool box every time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb4/fde/26c/fb4fde26c8d055c039e49f7024ef8f3c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3d/4d3/e8b/a3d4d3e8bb6f26c5665f6d07b429eb37.jpg">  When carrying out minor repairs, it is often impossible to do without glasses - but not protective ones, which we wrote about last time, but special ones for working in conditions of insufficient lighting.  You can, of course, fasten a helmet with a flashlight on your head, but this solution will not work for fine work.  Unlike such <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/watch-accessaries/pp_92978.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">points with built-in lights</a> and a set of lenses in the kit, with which you can perform work at a distance of up to 0.5 cm. And you will look like a watchmaker, not a miner.  Such thing will cost only 8.30 dollars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fc/4c3/138/9fc4c31382ac4ca256f6e9243008f3eb.jpg"><br>  Even if you have your own home workshop, it‚Äôs better to save space in order to fit as many useful tools as possible.  Therefore, a complete machine is often impractical to put (and expensive), but what if there is a need for it?  For such cases, a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cutting-tools/pp_226095.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">6-in-1 mini-machine</a> is available in our store, with which you can both cut and drill and trim - such an assistant will save you a lot of work and time, not to mention the convenience of using it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5af/0b5/7dd/5af0b57dd22b12c8f6c3d962189a7881.jpg"><br><br>  Returning to the screwdriver theme, we note that in addition to universal kits with many bits in the kit, there are also tool kits for specific tasks - for example, it is very difficult to remove even the MacBook cover with a conventional Phillips screwdriver without damaging anything.  For these and many other purposes, you can take, for example, <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/screwdriver-screwdriver-set/pp_342903.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such a set</a> - a screwdriver and 28 bits, among which are T2, T3, T4, T5, M2.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.5 and others, all in a convenient case.  This set is enough to replace the iPhone battery, and to repair the camera, the handle on the glasses can be pulled up in the end.  In general, the farm is not superfluous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ac/354/9ea/4ac3549ea58d13e2cb2b1a85eb2eeced.jpg"><br><br>  But this <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/other-tools/pp_527127.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">set for $ 13 is</a> positioned more as a tool for repairing watches (and even the watch movements themselves), but it can be useful for an ordinary radio-controlled toy, where there are so small details that the usual tool simply does not fit through. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/258/d2d/641/258d2d641cfbeef4a0b7b5bfa3cfd306.jpg"></div><br>  Well, if you already work with electronics, a couple of antistatic tweezers are always useful - both convenient and safe.  At cost - <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/tweezers/pp_330574.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">less than two dollars</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c4/48f/a95/2c448fa95e35cc164abd83afe96dbaae.jpg">  Keys do not happen much, especially when it comes to DIY.  Here you will find both conventional wrenches, and adjustable, and hex sets, and plumbing, even automobile ones - the range is so large that it is difficult to single out any one position.  Well, for example, a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/wrenches/pp_218823.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">pocket set of hexagons of</a> different sizes (for the assembly of furniture it is the most) or an <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/wrenches/pp_359257.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">angular key 21 mm</a> .  In general, it is better to look <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/wrenches-c_11377/2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">into the category</a> , there are many interesting offers, you will surely find something necessary. <br><br><h2>  Measure me completely </h2><br>  And, of course, in our business can not do without various testers and meters.  It‚Äôs one thing when you did the repairs yourself (or at least you have a cable routing plan), and it‚Äôs quite another if someone else did the repairs yourself in violation of all regulations.  Here will help <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_613036.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such a multimeter</a> (which can be used in this and many other cases), and then decide to hang the closet in the kitchen and accidentally interrupt the cable.  There are a lot of variants of such devices - there is <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_613029.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such a cheaper one</a> , and <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/measurement-analysis/pp_157930.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such</a> and many others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edf/cd3/96c/edfcd396ca9676b73ea5008392c285ec.jpg"><br><br>  It will not be superfluous to acquire <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/multimeters-fitting/pp_266195.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">a battery tester</a> - for $ 5 in the tool box you can find a place for it.  By the way, about the boxes - we have a lot of this stuff too, both large and smaller, and on the belt, and pocket ones.  It is better to go <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/storage-supplies-c_11375%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">to the category</a> and find the right one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a7/375/97a/9a737597a810e06b0a7ad97ac27ce373.jpg"><br><br>  So choose what you need, because everyone can comprehend screwdriver Zen - the main thing is to have a desire.  If suddenly we missed something important - share your DIY life hacking in the comments.  Well, just in case, we remind you that we have a version of the site adapted for Russia, where you <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion--special-1297.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">will find many interesting things</a> on special offers and low prices. <br><br><h2>  Happy Victory Day! </h2><br>  And yet, the Victory Day Gearbest offers discounts on smart equipment, accessories and sporting goods! <br><br>  Victory Day is a special day not only for Russia.  Victory in World War II ended the Second World War.  In honor of this event, the first salute thundered above the Moscow Kremlin 72 years ago, the sounds of which we will hear this year, in every city of Russia. <br><br>  In honor of Victory Day, the Russian version of Gearbest launches <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/promotion--special-1313.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">a sale-sale</a> .
