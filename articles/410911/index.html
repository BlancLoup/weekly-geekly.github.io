      This is a story about the life of Alexander Hamilton, one of the founding fathers of the United States, in an atypical genre for Broadway - rap in half with R'n'B.  Despite the fact that the main characters of Hamilton are predominantly men (politicians, rulers and military men, including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and even King George III), for female characters, Skyler sisters are one of the most memorable songs of the musical. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vn2nEHrFxIs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Like the whole musical, set design and choreography of the number also have their own meaning - the platform revolves around the heroines, symbolizing the active and eventful social life of New York, where the American Revolution begins to mature.  The main musical theme of the song is harmony among the sisters (vocal and family), although each of them is presented separately.  Social norms are reversed (in this the artistic intent of the musical): Skyler sisters at the Hamilton are strong women who historically could not play a large role in the events described, but in the space of the musical take a more proactive stance. <br><br><h2>  Wicked Elfab's Witch </h2><br>  One of the most long-playing and iconic performances of Broadway was coolly received by critics after the premiere in 2003, but won spectator love.  In 2017, Wicked (‚ÄúEvil‚Äù) <a href="http://www.playbill.com/article/wicked-surpasses-the-phantom-of-the-opera-as-second-highest-grossing-show-in-broadway-history">outstripped</a> ‚ÄúThe Phantom of the Opera‚Äù and became the second highest grossing musical in the history of Broadway - only ‚ÄúThe Lion King‚Äù was ahead. <br><br>  The story of Wicked develops in parallel with the events of the book "The Amazing Wizard of Oz" by Leimen Baum.  Two heroines (Elfaba, the future Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the future Good Witch of the North) grow up, compete with each other, try to improve relations and resist the Wizard tyrant. <br><br>  Defying Gravity performed by Idina Menzel is one of the iconic songs in the history of the musical. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3g4ekwTd6Ig" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Elfaba decides to leave Oz, where everyone looks askance at her because of her unusual appearance, and breaks with her past life, the Wizard and his values ‚Äã‚Äã- this song has become a metaphor of the courage to be yourself in spite of everything and get rid of the opinions of others. <br><br>  Interestingly, Wicked is one of those musicals, where most of the songs are united by several common leitmotifs, which are transformed depending on the mood and meaning of the song and are performed by different instruments. <br><br><h2>  Nala and Rafiki from The Lion King </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/the-lion-king-is-now-top-earner-in-box-office-history-331145">The</a> highest grossing and popular Broadway musical is The Lion King, based on the Disney cartoon of the same name. <br><br>  There are noticeable differences between the cartoon and the musical - in general, the musical turned out to be more serious and gloomy.  For example, in the musical, becoming King, Scar begins to gradually go crazy and insists that Nala become his wife.  She, in turn, refuses and decides to go in search of a more fertile land and help. <br><br>  About this - her party Shadowland, tense and heavy, one of the most emotional songs in the musical.  It sounds like "in contrast" with the frivolous and relaxed life of Simba far from the lands of Pride.  The song is performed in a mixture of English and Zulu. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9okDHFH86gc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Rafiki in the musical is a female role, because the creators noticed that <a href="http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/buyi-zama-plays-rafiki-a-wise-female-baboon-in-the-lion-king-6394805">there was no</a> central female role in the original cartoon.  The heroine has a very <a href="https://style.disney.com/living/2017/10/30/backstage-lion-king-on-broadway-rafikis-makeup/">complex</a> and multi-level costume and make-up with many layers and details that help make her story, not very revealed in the musical, deeper. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNy6IC85iuA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Elle Woods from Legally Blonde </h2><br>  Classic musical, where the plot, the concept turns into a stereotype, "turned inside out."  Legally Blond (Legally Blonde) is a Broadway musical based on a film with Reese Witherspoon with a similar name (which, in turn, was based on the novel by Amanda Brown).  The film was released in 2001 and was well received by viewers and film critics and nominated for a Golden Globe.  In 2007, the premiere of the musical on Broadway took place - the production quickly became financially successful. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZzZQYmCB-JM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is a very energetic and funny musical with large-scale dance numbers and a great deal of humor, which is also reflected in some stage decisions - for example, the role of the traditional Greek choir, which serves as a narrator and commentator for events, is played by a group of cheerleader girls.  Despite the glamor and apparent lightheadedness, the musical (as well as its heroine) proves an important thesis - people cannot be ‚Äújudged by the cover‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Eponina from Les Mis√©rables </h2><br>  Les Mis√©rables is a musical based on Victor Gugo‚Äôs novel "Les Miserables".  This is one of the most long-running musicals in history - it was first staged on the Parisian stage in 1980.  In London, he has been performing since 1985. <br><br>  Eponina is in love with Marius, who, in turn, is in love with Cosette, the adoptive daughter of the main character, former convict Jean Valjean.  Eponina knows that Marius will never share her feelings, but this does not prevent her from helping him during the revolution.  In the end she dies in his arms.  Eponina On My Own is one of the most emotional and beautiful in the musical.  In this scene there is almost no movement and other actors - Eponina is in complete isolation, alone with the feelings that cause her almost physical pain. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjfmP7h3gBw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the history of the musical many important, beautiful and vivid scenes (although female roles in musicals and in general in the theater are statistically <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/harmony-france/what-if-musical-theatre-was-made-for-women_b_9698202.html">less</a> than the male).  However, women's songs and numbers can be very different - we remembered only some of them. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Our cultural and historical rubric - additional reading:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/298677/">"Non-artistic" reading: memoirs, essays and music studies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/298277/">"Sound in the Museum" - industrial design and creative experiments</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/298461/">Weekend reading: 5 books about music and musicians</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5569.html">Forgotten Formats: Flexible Records</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5579.html">"Innovative Conservatism": The History of Bang &amp; Olufsen</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5429.html">‚ÄúMinute Sound Studies‚Äù: on the cultural sense of sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5557.html">"Wall": remember the legendary album Pink Floyd</a> </li></ul><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410911/</a></p>
