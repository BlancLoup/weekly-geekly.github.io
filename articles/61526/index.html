  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Let me work!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No, you do not understand.  I did not say "work."  I said work.  The difference between these two words is huge!  By giving a person a job, you give him a salary.  By letting him work, you give him the opportunity to honestly work out this salary.  Honestly, to the fullest, as he can.  Giving him the opportunity to squeeze all the juice out of himself, to surrender to the work completely, without reserve, with the whole mass of his professionalism.  All facets of their knowledge. <a name="habracut"></a>  By the way, about the edges.  If you put a nut in a cylindrical hole, there will be gaps between the nut and the wall.  In order for the nut to be able to occupy the entire volume of the hole, it must be placed in the same hex hole.  Or the walls of the hole should be elastic. <br><br>  There are people for whom their profession is the only way to make money.  That's not bad.  These people are also needed, many of them conscientiously do their jobs, they are diligent and punctual.  This IT-Tajiks, they do what they say the head A.  They submit their projects on time.  I have known many such people.  Everything is good when they work at their place, and once a month go to the cashier.  Bad when they have ambitions.  Sometimes, they remember how long they have worked in this position and decide that it is time to become a boss.  At least some.  And what, and the salary is more, and work is less.  And then they begin to take a new frontier.  And they take it.  They are diligent executive.  Such like the authorities. <br><br>  There are others.  There are those who burn at work.  Those who are not satisfied with just the task.  For them, the value is not the fact of the task, but the result.  As an artist, for whom it is not enough to paint a picture.  The picture should be beautiful.  And each next should be more beautiful than the previous one.  For such IT-artists, the time spent on the execution of the next task was in vain, if during this time they have not received new knowledge.  If the quality of their work is not higher.  If during this time no new frontier has been taken.  These people cannot have ambitions.  Ambition, this is their permanent state!  But these ambitions are not always associated with a new position.  They work for the result.  For the sake of knowledge, for the sake of experience.  Their ambitions are of a different kind.  They need to be a specialist.  Yes, it is with a capital letter.  Pro, Guru!  The object of admiration and worship of less experienced colleagues.  And there comes a time when their current work cannot satisfy their ambitions.  They already know everything they can in this position.  Each new task is already so trivial that causes boredom.  And at this moment they decide that it is time to change jobs.

      I got into such situations more than once.  Every time I am very grateful to my previous place of work, because there it was always possible to take a new frontier.  Somewhere I was helped to comprehend the basics.  Somewhere I first learned about MVC, somewhere I learned what 5 million hits per day are.  Each place of work is associated with a certain new stage, a new step up the ladder of excellence.  And every time I left with the words "Sorry, I have nowhere else to grow here" <br><br>  I understood.  In words.  But in fact, they sighed with relief, because they got rid of the main troublemaker.  It was he who constantly proposed to introduce all kinds of incomprehensible things like SVN, for some reason he believed that we needed some kind of strange MeVeTse, he cursed with scary words like Ektivrekord and Singleton.  It was he who interfered with the work of the staff, pestering them with stories about TedeDe.  Well, he just did not work then?  And IT-Tajiks remained.  And they were praised: ‚ÄúWell done, it does not change the work like gloves.‚Äù  And they finally waited when the new department was opened, and they were put in charge, or the head left, and took his place.  Patient guys.  Diligent. <br><br>  And I came to a new place.  And with the greed of a hungry bum who got into the kitchen, he began to sort out new dishes, absorbing what he hadn't tried yet.  New technology, new knowledge, new approaches.  Filling the whole space, until it again became cramped, until your glittering edges rested against perfectly round and rigid walls of a cylindrical company.  And it seems that there is still a lot of space, but it is impossible to fill it. <br><br>  And I thought, well, let's cut it right here, then polish it, cut it here ... let's go!  "Works?  Don't touch anything! ‚Äù- sounds in response.  Because your bosses are yesterday's IT-Tajiks.  They are paid a salary, it means everything is good, it means there is no cause for concern, it means it is not necessary better.  Suddenly they will not notice, and will not raise the salary.  And then what's the point?  What if it gets worse?  God forbid!  Works?  Don't touch anything! <br><br>  And to look for more and more new ‚Äúcylinders‚Äù of a larger size, it is becoming more and more difficult.  They are tightly cemented by IT-foremen, former IT-Tajiks.  Deadly clinging to his place.  They are diligent, nothing threatens them.  The main thing is not to show what is best.  What can be better and faster.  The main thing that everyone would think that the cylinder is ideal. <br><br>  And again it remains only to come to work and get paid.  There is nowhere to work.  The walls of the cylinder interfere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61526/</a></p>
