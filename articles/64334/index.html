Over the last year of work, it has almost doubled.  Our services are now available in <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/worldwide/">Latin America, the Middle East and East Asia.</a>  Almost complete coverage of European and CIS countries was achieved.  At the moment, the number of countries is not only unique on the Russian market, but also noticeable on a global scale, which has begun to attract not only Russian but also foreign partners.  Along with the increase in the number of countries, we have strengthened positions in those of them in which we have been working for a long time, connecting many new numbers and tariffs with high costs.  This was an important achievement against the backdrop of the global crisis, as it gave many of our partners the opportunity to accept payments from new countries, the connection of which was previously irrelevant due to the too low cost of SMS messages. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The staff of the company has developed a number of <a href="http://smscoin.com/software/">ready-made modules</a> for all known site-building systems, which greatly facilitates the installation and configuration of services.  Now it became much easier to connect SMS-payment to your site for thousands of site owners built on standard engines.  Along with this, we have significantly improved <a href="http://smscoin.com/info/services/">our services</a> by adding a number of new technical capabilities.

      We have also significantly improved the quality of our support.  In addition to standard chat communication methods, you can contact us by local phones from more than 10 countries of the world.  The information content of the site has significantly improved, a section with <a href="http://smscoin.com/faq/">frequently asked questions</a> and a full library of ready-made scripts have appeared.  Many partners began to work with their personal managers, which greatly accelerated the process of solving problems and strengthened our relationship with partners.  To solve all the problems, the company‚Äôs staff was almost doubled, which resulted in optimization of the overall workflow. <br><br>  A kind of a gift not only to our partners, but also to ourselves was the change of site design to a brighter, more pleasant and convenient.  The new design served not only as a wonderful completion of the past year, but also as a good start to a new one.  Despite the apparent saturation of the market, we are able to implement new ideas, surprising partners, colleagues and competitors.  We have ambitious plans that we intend to realize, and years of work have shown that we keep our promises.  Working with the SmsCoin project, you not only get global coverage, unique solutions and exclusive opportunities, you get the reliability and experience of market leaders who have earned their name solely by doing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64334/</a></p>
