  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the IT ecosystem of Omsk, enthusiasm, community and conferences</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to 2GIS in Omsk, 134 web studios.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/nem/" class="user_link">nem</a> , seeing this figure, at first stunned.  After all, everyone has heard about 3-4 large companies, several design studios and several small and medium-sized outsourcing offices.  Everything on this horizon ends. <br>  But no, 134! <br><br>  Well, naturally, they began to figure out what kind of IT companies such are.  As a result, the overall picture was superimposed on the experienced or heard stories, and something like a classification was born.  We do not claim its ultimate truth, but it seems to describe the situation completely. <br><br>  In order not to overload you with words, draw a picture.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc9/d57/3da/dc9d573dad1019dfeae57a572143cb5a.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The first</b> , fortunately, a little, they quickly fill the minimum experience, to get off in a bevy and go into the second group. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> is the majority.  They can do two things in essence: <br>  1) to style and finish websites on WordPress, Joomla or Drupal <br>  2) use free templates or draw something in Photoshop. <br><br>  Some of this group is pumped over, and can already solve puzzles more difficult (goes into the <b>third group</b> ): for example, writing something from scratch in PHP, sometimes in Rails or Django.  Although almost always it is not claimed, because local customers need just a website or just an online store, and for this you already have ready-made engines. <br><br>  One way or another, these ‚Äúcompanies‚Äù often fall apart due to a lack of management skills, and often smart fragments go to freelance on oDesk as a programmer or as a freelance designer.  Less intelligent - on freelancers programmer or on oDesk designer.  The best go to the next level of the pyramid or leave. <br><br>  <b>Fourth row</b> companies <b>are</b> heterogeneous.  If they decide to become design studios, they hire good designers and create their CMS to speed up the development or use ready-made.  If they are more interested in the development, they begin to engage in more high-tech things.  It can be Java, Python, Rails, development for iOS or Android, sometimes all the same PHP.  Almost always, this high technology is a consequence of the founder‚Äôs obsession with new technologies and self-education.  This obsession is enough to educate employees and to drag all managerial issues.  The key difference is that they almost never work for the local market, their customers most often from far abroad. <br><br>  The companies in this category have already learned: <br>  1) do well and on time <br>  2) sell your services for a good price. <br><br>  In the <b>fifth line</b> - offices large by Omsk standards - Luxoft-Omsk, IssArt, Thumbtack, Gehtsoft. <br>  Each of them has its own way.  The history of their occurrence, too, leave out of this post.  What do they have in common: <br>  - almost one hundred percent of customers - abroad. <br>  - organizations have already managed to acquire bureaucracy of varying degrees of branching. <br><br>  Obviously, the higher the level, the more interesting tasks it is necessary to solve, the more complex technologies to master ‚Üí as a result, the work is more interesting and highly paid. <br><br>  Another detail to the portrait.  In Omsk, there is not a single well-known food company, a la Novosibirsk 2GIS and Parallels or SKB Kontur from Yekaterinburg.  By the way, we would put such companies on the <b>sixth level</b> . <br><br><h5>  Where to go student? </h5><br>  The most intelligent students begin to do something in terms of self-study course on the third or fourth. <br>  The rest understand that they were deceived ... after graduation, when it turns out that the employment options in the specialty "mathematician" or "physicist" are, conditionally speaking, two: in some mossy scientific research institute or back to university by a teacher.  There are also a small number of companies, for example, a branch of <a href="http://www.itpgrad.ru/">Grad</a> , in which they solve problems sufficiently related to mathematics, but this is rather the exception. <br><br>  The situation is aggravated by the fact that school teachers and university teachers often do not know that there is a labor market in IT in Omsk, and openly advise the best guys to go here as soon as possible. <br><br>  If everything remained as it was described, IT in Omsk would have been acidified naturally over several years.  For the best personnel, having relied on, would continue to leave for the capitals or further, and many immediately after graduation. <br><br>  But not so bad, gentlemen!  Forces of enthusiasts, which is becoming more and more, the situation begins to change for the better.  What is already happening: <br>  1. Companies began to realize that personnel should be taught themselves, and this should be invested.  They organize special courses in universities and internships for students and graduates with the help of their employees.  For several years, special courses on modern technologies in software development at OmSU, OmGTU, SibADI have been conducted.  Many companies willingly take students for an internship, paying them a salary. <br>  2. Individual enthusiasts gather in interest groups and create communities like <abbr title="Google Developers Group">GDG-Omsk</abbr> , <abbr title="Linux User Group">Omsk-LUG</abbr> , <abbr title="MongoDb User Group">Omsk-MUG</abbr> , <abbr title="Javascript">Omsk-JS</abbr> , hold hackathons, seminars and mini-conferences. <br>  3. In Omsk, a <a href="http://www.rupy.ru/">RuPyRu</a> conference existed for several years, which was then transformed into <a href="http://margincon.ru/">MarginCon</a> .  Unfortunately, it ceased to exist due to the departure of the organizer to the USA. <br><br>  However, these activities are still very local in nature, and the vast majority (especially the first three levels of the pyramid) simply do not know about them. <br><br><h5>  What is it all about? </h5><br>  Of course, we did not just study Omsk web studios.  We undertook the organization of the <a href="http://happydev.ru/">first large IT conference in Omsk</a> and decided to understand who its potential participants were.  What is interesting - the idea to make a large conference in Omsk almost at the same time came to the mind of two more people, which shows its relevance. <br>  But we were unexpectedly lucky to be pioneers. <br><br>  We were at a bunch of conferences and trainings in Novosibirsk ( <a href="http://codefest.ru/">CodeFest</a> , <a href="http://sibinetweek.ru/program/7/profitconf">ProfitConf</a> , <a href="http://agilecamp.ru/">AgileCamp</a> ), Moscow ( <a href="http://devconf.ru/">DevConf</a> , <a href="http://events.yandex.ru/events/yac/2011/">YAC</a> , <a href="http://msk12.agiledays.ru/">AgileDays</a> , etc.), Yekaterinburg ( <a href="http://dump-it.ru/">DumpIt</a> , <a href="http://ekbpy.ru/">EkbPy</a> ), Samara ( <a href="http://2011.404fest.ru/">404fest</a> ) and St. Petersburg ( <a href="http://spb.agiledays.ru/">AgileDays</a> ).  We do not imagine how else we could expand our horizons so much and meet so many interesting people.  Look at the pictures from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/%3Fq%3D404fest">404fest</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/%3Fq%3Dagilecamp">AgileCamp</a> , for example, in order to feel the atmosphere at least a little. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.evtuhovich.ru/blog/2012/09/08/railsclub-2012/">Here is what</a> ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evtuhovich/" class="user_link">evtuhovich</a> ) <a href="http://blog.evtuhovich.ru/blog/2012/09/08/railsclub-2012/">writes</a> about conferences: <br><blockquote>  Although changes in the IT-world do not occur instantly, but a couple of years are enough to keep up with the technological train.  The easiest and fastest way to find out what's new, what trends and what colleagues think about is to attend a profile conference.  One or two days, which you devote entirely to getting new information, usually give much more than reading blogs.  Moreover, it is impossible to learn something about some approach or tool, the existence of which you do not know.  In my opinion, conferences are the easiest way to stay afloat. <br></blockquote><br><br>  And we wanted to bring all this to Omsk.  We consider it abnormal that such events are distributed throughout the country in such a way that we constantly need to go somewhere or fly.  And then, quite naturally, we asked ourselves the question: ‚ÄúSo what are we sitting and doing nothing?  You just need to take and make a great IT conference in Omsk!  And let Boromir wipe out :-) <br><br>  PS <a href="http://happydev.ru/">HappyDev</a> conference was held in Omsk in September 2012. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151569/</a></p>
