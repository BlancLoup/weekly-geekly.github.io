Starting from improving your signature dish and ending with the redevelopment of the house, this is a natural thought to human nature. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/278928/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aaa/faa/c09/aaafaac094e5ddf02b68748aef716acd.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  The Lenovo engineering and design team asks this question every day.  Before starting work on the creation of a new device, we first of all think what the future gadget should do.  Understanding opens the way to rethinking the product and leads to the emergence of new solutions. <br><br>  Almost four years ago we introduced Lenovo Yoga - the device became the world's first laptop-transformer.  Thanks to the special hinges, you could expand the laptop 360 degrees.  Then no one understood why such an opportunity is needed at all.  However, this made it possible to solve an important problem: the need to carry both a laptop and a tablet.  At the time, such a gadget was new.  Later we added the possibility of vertical installation of the laptop, like a triangular tent. <br><br>  And this year we presented <abbr title="Based on reviews for sites of leading PC manufacturers as of May 19, 2016">the thinnest transforming notebook</abbr> Yoga 900S, consisting of 813 parts.  But we didn‚Äôt even stop at what we‚Äôve achieved: it gradually became clear that it was possible to work on mobility and communication.

      Wireless technologies are of great importance in the modern world.  Lenovo engineers and designers put them on the forefront.  Usually, the Wi-Fi antenna in mobile devices is located in the lid or next to other components, but with a 4-in-1 device, this solution can degrade the signal when the laptop is open or in tablet mode.  The task was to create a stable connection regardless of the current form of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4de/1c0/1d5/4de1c01d51154da87d4efc63445ac4af.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The Chinese team of engineers literally plunged headlong into work on improving the connection in Yoga 710</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/538/a98/bcd/538a98bcd2b694e5869bd23f4a48b659.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Antenna Testing</font></i> <br><br>  Initial sketches suggested a more rational use of the area near the touchpad to install a Wi-Fi antenna there.  We achieved a stable signal with this solution, but this led to other problems that related to laptop size, weight, and restrictions on the materials used. <br><br>  Then we paid attention to products from different areas: how they changed over time.  Scooped ideas and inspiration from everywhere - cars, cosmetics, clothing, shoes. <br><br>  The moment "here it is!" Came during the study of mobile phones: in particular, clamshell models.  What if you create a powerful Wi-Fi antenna that is small enough to fit in the 14-inch hinge of the Yoga 710?  Yes, that's right: the antenna is in the hinge! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ad/aa0/411/5adaa04112f0c8642425028bafb94c94.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Swivel antenna in 14-inch Yoga 710</font></i> <br><br>  The use of such a solution guarantees a stable signal in any mode - that was our goal.  The design team immediately inspired: before, they were limited in the choice of stylish materials, because some of them influenced the quality of wireless connections.  And since now the communication module has been moved to the joint, then beautiful premium metal can be used.  Also, there is no longer any need to occupy valuable space under the antenna, so a frameless display is in the laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3f/4f4/06c/e3f4f406c624793043a0dc8226fb0f7a.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">In the 14-inch Yoga 710 almost frameless screen - it appeared due to the installation of the antenna in the hinge</font></i> <br><br>  In addition to wireless connections, we also paid attention to other aspects of the Yoga 710. For example, modern travelers go on the road light.  No one wants to carry portable hard drives and cables.  The laptop is equipped with a capacious SSD storage, a USB slot and a noise-canceling microphone that is always ready to charge devices, which will clearly convey your speech from both a noisy cafe and a quiet home environment.  For quick work, we installed a Core i7 processor on the Yoga 710. <br><br>  You no longer need to walk around the cafe and lobby of the hotel in search of an access point.  As a result of all the improvements Wi-Fi power increased by 20% <abbr title="Compared to previous-generation models (for example, Yoga 700), the 14-inch Yoga 710 with an antenna integrated into the hinge showed an improvement in communication by up to 20% in tablet mode">compared with previous models</abbr> .  This allows you to safely work in any place where there is Wi-Fi, even if the signal is weak due to a distant point, interference and obstacles.  You can upload files faster without reducing the productivity of your work and even show the best results in online games.  With the innovative 14-inch antenna, the Yoga 710, modern travelers can do a lot more on the go. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396327/</a></p>
