  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From each by text, by each view</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Among foreign bloggers, one way or another connected in their activities with the news and publishing industry on the Web, in recent days there has been a lively discussion of the fact revealed in a <a href="http://www.podtech.net/blog/blog/1514/check-out-maryam-and-mary-jo">video interview</a> that blog Podtech took from Mary Jo Foley, in the past the author of one of the most popular columns on the <a href="http://zdnet.com/">ZD Net</a> . <br><br>  Mary mentioned that ZD Net is conducting an experiment now: all of its authors (the format of this publication presupposes paying much attention to the personal opinion of several analysts-columnists) are paid based on the popularity of their creations, which is estimated in the traditional way for the Internet - by the number of readers . <br><br>  In this experience, CNET, which recently acquired ZD Net, wants to take a closer look and run into a scheme that other major online publications may soon accept for themselves.

      <b>The main advantages of</b> such a system are obvious.  This will be a logical continuation of the new content model, when most of the useful material is created by the readers themselves and is born in discussions on third-party resources.  The more popular the post, the more vigorous the discussion it causes, the more transitions to the site, the more advertising revenue.  Therefore, it is straightforward for the authors to pay a percentage of the income they bring ‚Äî a solution that suggests itself. <br><br>  However, the <b>disadvantages of</b> this approach, which in practice will necessarily manifest themselves more and more as it is implemented in small editions of the ‚Äútail,‚Äù also lie on the surface. <br><br>  First, the pursuit of light glory has always been characteristic of young authors.  And even more so on the Internet, where, as they say, nothing comes so easily and is not valued as highly as fame.  Putting journalists in direct dependence on the traffic, which will attract their texts, the employer will push many to move into the genre of hot rumors and "yellow" headlines, completely forgetting about important, but "dry" events.  And this is definitely a dead end direction of evolution for publications that want to earn at least some respect.  And the atmosphere in the team, in which everyone is chasing the news about Google and Apple, clearly does not promise to be warm. <br><br>  Secondly, only resources that are gaining popularity cannot boast of super-large incomes, as a rule, they generally barely make ends meet and receive money from advertising that makes them embarrassing to take interest.  Especially in the underdeveloped online advertising market, as in our countries.  In any case, the authors cannot pay a decent salary from them. <br><br>  In general, although the prospect of switching everyone and everything to the Pay-per-View scheme seems already inevitable, there is still something to discuss.  Especially on the threshold (I really don‚Äôt know how soon) the introduction of the billing system on Habr√©. <br><br>  Some links to blogs in which there is a discussion of a question: <a href="http://www.micropersuasion.com/2007/01/cnet_tests_payf.html">Micro Persuasion</a> , <a href="http://www.newassignment.net/blog/david_cohn/jan2007/17/pay_per_view_jou">New Assignment</a> , <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2007/01/payperview_jour.php">Rough Type</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4969/</a></p>
