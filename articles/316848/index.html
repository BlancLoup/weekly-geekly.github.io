Good captain </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cda/311/b69/cda311b69f0b43e0ab6aced82b127c1f.jpg" alt="Boris Dyakonov"><br>  <i>Photos from the site 66.ru.</i>  <i>Boris Dyakonov (right) and Bank24.ru (left)</i> <br><br>  Boris Dyakonov once in Turkey, handed over the yacht in a charter.  Acceptors - people are meticulous, for any scratch can count a fine.  But this sailor-Turk examined the yacht and said that there are no fines.  Then he added meaningfully - ‚ÄúA good captain is the one who drowned the ship‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The meaning of these words Dyakonov understood when he lost his Bank24.ru.  It is impossible to become a truly good captain if you do not sink your ship once.  You will not be resistant to the crisis, if you do not survive it, starting anew from the bottom. <br><br>  In September 2014, Boris Dyakonov sat in his office and sobbed, he was ashamed to appear to his colleagues after the Central Bank revoked the Bank‚Äôs license24.  But the team, united around the bank, and thousands of its clients supported Boris.  He realized that now he could definitely become a good captain, settled for the old debts and founded the bank for entrepreneurs Point, which already this fall was breaking even.  Now, under the wing of Otkritie Bank, which is on the list of systemically important credit institutions formed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, something and Dyakonov are unlikely to be threatened in the near future.  Otkritie Bank is the 4th bank in terms of assets after Sberbank, VTB and Gazprombank. <br><br>  Now Dyakonov is the senior vice president of the Point, the chairman of the board is Dmitry Mizgulin, there are other chiefs from Discovery, but for experience, for technological developments, for the bright public speeches of Boris, he can be considered the person and leader of the Point bank. <br><br>  Dyakonov is unique in his honesty (any other bank with a revoked license simultaneously loses abroad and leading bankers with numerous fortunes, but not Deacons, calculated on a penny debt), this honesty sometimes borders on outright rudeness (take at least a <a href="http://ura.ru/news/1052155798">story</a> with an operator who left for lunch instead of serving the customer who stood in the queue).  He likes to publicly express such ambiguous expressions as ‚ÄúI am in a rush,‚Äù ‚ÄúI am really plodding,‚Äù and the following.  But Dyakonov is a talent, that is why it is not in vain that he occupies a place on our list. <br><br><blockquote>  Quote: ‚ÄúYou can do the same thing, be sad shit and peck stones, and you can build a temple.  And I believe that those who build the temple, they have a temple and it turns out.  And with the temple comes and earnings.  He will be honest, he will not have to be shy. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h3>  2. Last name - not an indicator </h3><br>  - Have you thought about IPO? <br>  - Of course, this is another step for the development of the company. <br>  - when? <br>  - Well, I look forward to 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/443/646/d72/443646d725f945fe83eb1fc789d32200.jpg" alt="Vsevolod Fear"><br>  <i>Photos from the site VC.ru.</i>  <i>Fearless Vsevolod Fear</i> <br><br>  This interview Vsevolod Fear gave the TV channel Rain in 2013, without assuming that in a couple of years his Sotmarket will not see not only an IPO, but even any seedy, accidental customer who has come. <br><br>  At school, Vsevolod was engaged in pentathlon, was close to a sports career, but realized that <b><i>‚Äúmonetizing the head, not the muscles‚Äù</i></b> would be much more effective.  As a result, he won the All-Russian Olympiad in Economics and entered the HSE Business Informatics Faculty for free.  At the age of 17, he created his first website for selling data cables, from which Sotmarket, an online store, began its life.  Investment in 20 thousand rubles in 8 years brought a turnover of 4.15 billion. In 2012, Ulvi Kasimova himself seemed to justify the plan for pooling capital under the wing of the IQ One fund. <br><br>  Fragment from the <a href="https://vc.ru/p/intervyu-so-strahom-kak-prevratit-20-tyisyach-rubley-v-1-milliard">interview</a> : <br><br>  - Have you sold a controlling stake to Utinetu? <br>  - Not Yutinet, IQ One.  For me, this is critical.  I do not communicate with Yutinet, adhere to the opposite path of development, we will never go along the path of inflation, as they are. <br><br>  As a result, the contradictions that Vsevolod Fear spoke of became an insurmountable obstacle to coexistence after the unification of capital.  Perhaps the role was played by the trick of more experienced partners, who took Vsevolod into debt to IQ One.  The Russian sanctions crisis of 2014 was a major factor, and at the beginning of 2016, Sotmarket, along with Yutinet.ru, was closed, and there were no buyers for one store. <br><br>  Vsevolod Fear is a unique person in this TOP.  He is the only one who is in the process of entrepreneurial development after a deep decline.  In August 2016, it was reported that Fear, together with new partners, is going to launch a new marketplace for the sale of jewelry.  This impulse is associated primarily with the lifting of the ban on trade in jewelry online, discussed in the Government of the Russian Federation.  Surely your fear will take. <br><br><blockquote>  Quote: ‚ÄúFor me, investors, turnovers, money - this is not something to brag about.  For me, you can brag about the ideas to which we are going, or the functionality that we have developed. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><h3>  3. Not a copy, but a double original </h3><br>  If Fear was familiar with Tony Shey from the turquoise company Zappos (‚ÄúIf you have the opportunity to grow without funds, do it to the last‚Äù), maybe you would go your own way until now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86a/01b/ff4/86a01bff49e64358b568e6cd01f4597e.jpg" alt="Alexander Sysoev"><br>  <i>Photos from expert.ru.</i>  <i>Alexander Sysoev looks into the future with interest and explains to him how to be</i> <br><br>  But Alexander Sysoev quote Neck loves.  And investors as his company 2Gis was not, and no. <br><br>  Sysoev is a pioneer in Internet mapping.  His company earns the most in this area in the world and started doing it first.  The scenario of Alexander‚Äôs achievements is simple: the first step is a passion in 1994 and an aerial photograph of Novosibirsk costing $ 300.  The first digital map of Novosibirsk for own use.  Then hobby has grown into a family business.  Now users of 2Gis are 20 million people, 282 cities from 6 countries.  The service is used by 37 thousand advertisers.  Revenue in 2014 amounted to 3 billion rubles. <br><br>  The conquest of Moscow stands apart in the life of 2Gis, and Sysoev entered the market only in 2011, when Yandex and Google already dominated there.  After the status of a regional company, to conquer the capital market is only possible for a unique product. <br><br>  - Hello, this is DoubleGis. <br>  - Double of what?  A copy of what?  - in Moscow they were absolutely not familiar with 2Gis, so even the rebranding had to be carried out in order not to become someone‚Äôs copy. <br><br>  Surprisingly, Sysoev and his 2Gis team in some segments even outstripped Yandex, including in terms of financial indicators and in the share of the mobile application market.  As a result, Moscow is now in second place after Novosibirsk in terms of turnover in 2Gis (25 million rubles against 50, respectively). <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúThe last link in our concept was formed after three years of development.</b>  <b>Called - ‚ÄúWe do everything ourselves‚Äù</b> </blockquote><br><h3>  4. Already one search engine (in Russia, in any case) </h3><br>  Yandex.  <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/yandexbook/">The biography of</a> Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich is the American dream of the Russian type.  A vivid example of how one idea can make a profit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/4b0/771/6bb4b07717104b6094251afc83761014.jpg" alt="Arkady Volozh"><br>  <i>Photo from kremlin.ru.</i>  <i>Such a funny Yandex</i> <br><br>  There is an aphorism in the United States: "Only paranoid people survive in business."  Esther Dyson, a member of the board of directors of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, precisely in the creative paranoia of the creators, sees the success of Yandex.  And while the paranoia remains, ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù faces only further development. <br><br>  Arkady Volozh indirectly confirmed the same law in several other words and in a different situation: ‚ÄúSocial networks are about a crowd.  And we are introverts, we sit for ourselves - we knock on the keys. ‚Äù  So ‚Äúintroverts‚Äù and ‚Äúsounded‚Äù since 1997 on the billionth state. <br><br>  When did Yandex come to success?  In 2001, when the search engine began to receive income from contextual advertising?  Or when choosing an investor in 2000, when Yandex escaped the dashing money of the dot-com bubble?  Or in 1997 when the Internet address yandex.ru appeared?  If you look at the time line from a certain distance, the first success for Yandex came back in 1977, when trees and computers were large, and Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich were small, and for the first time they ran for the same search results of the educational system at school.  This is the first stable connection - the most important, without it, and Yandex would be different or not at all, which is more real, because the product is unique, and is the result of the joint efforts of the unique Volozh and Segalovich and the teams around them. <br><br>  Since 1988 (when CompTek was founded, from which Yandex emerged), Arkady Volozh has so far managed to become a co-founder of the 4th search engine in the world, carry out an IPO, become a dollar billionaire ($ 1.12 billion for 2013) and develop a huge the number of services without which the Runet is no longer the Runet.  Currently Volozh continues to generate ideas for Yandex, in his own words <b><i>‚Äúrun less - think more‚Äù.</i></b> <br><br><h3>  5. Citizen of the world and St. Christopher and Nevis </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/843/49a/f7a/84349af7a5a549af9421903b0a423839.jpg" alt="Pavel Durov and Arkady Volozh"><br>  <b><i>Mega-cool photo from flickr.com.</i></b>  <b><i>Behind Durov - Zuckerberg and Dmitry Grishin (of course, a joke for the sake of truth)</i></b> <b><br></b> <br>  Pavel Durov is a controversial and bright personality.  He does not like money so much that he throws it out of the window.  He is a fan of humorous pastafarianism and philosophical Zen Buddhism.  He considers himself a citizen of the world, each month moving from country to country, but more recently, he is also a citizen of St. Kitts and Nevis, for making a donation to industrial production.  He is for freedom, but is constantly chained in black clothes. <br><br>  Durov's entrepreneurial life can be divided into two stages: Zuckerberg‚Äôs mania and freedom of speech. <br><br>  With Zuckerberg, Durov has an extremely similar biography.  Mark started with a student social network, Pavel made the first similar step at SPGU.  Mark borrowed the idea from his partners, and Paul did the same with Mark (with the essence and the interface, in any case).  Products Durov and Zuckerberg are the two most popular social networks.  The similarities end there.  If Zuckerberg is currently successfully expanding his product in China, introducing Internet censorship for a billion audience, then Pavel Durov left VKontakte 2 years ago precisely because of the restriction on the freedom of the social network imposed on him by the state security bodies. <br><br>  Freedom of speech mainly influenced the creation of Telegram.  When there were special forces under the doors of Durov's apartment, and he did not have a reliable means of communication with his brother Nikolai, an idea came.  The result of which was a securely encrypted messenger, which has already collected more than 100 million users. <br><br>  Durov spends $ 1 million on a Telegram from his own pockets, having about 20 years of investment in the reserve. Therefore, he is confident in the speedy monetization of his messenger.  The next step has been taken - its new Telegraph blog platform seriously expects to impose competition on traditional media. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúIf you are unprincipled, it can be seen, and it is possible to influence you.</b>  <b>It won't work with me.</b>  <b>Ideology is ultimately the main thing that drives people.</b>  <b>We need to create deeper convictions for people to have faith in their own strength and their opinions. ‚Äù</b> <b><br></b> </blockquote><br><h3>  6. Farz - from ‚Äúfor sale‚Äù </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/054/0cb/ca6/0540cbca63ed4c928a935d54ac7bf0ff.jpg" alt="Oleg Tinkov"><br>  <i>Photos from the site tinkoff.ru.</i>  <i>Oleg Tinkov measures his interests</i> <br><br>  Oleg Tinkov is unique in his ability to buy and sell.  For the first time engaging in fartsovka, being a cycling candidate for the master of sports at the dusk of the Soviet era, he brought his art to an almost unsurpassed level.  Tinkov was selling dumplings, beer, electronics, a cycling team, music, in a word, everything that he accidentally enjoyed, acquired good advertising and fabulous value.  He managed to sell his last name profitably to one lane in the city of Pushkin.  After a couple of decades, people will seriously believe that in the 19th century the famous brewer Porfiry Tinkov lived on this street.  A masterpiece of PR! <br><br>  The Internet Bank is also half sold, but nevertheless it is Tinkov‚Äôs longest and most successful project.  Within its framework, Oleg Yurievich is also engaged in what he loves and knows how to do best of all - to sell.  Tinkoff Bank - is one of the leaders in technology banking.  He has mastered recent contactless payment systems one of the first.  In terms of quality of service, security (which is a case of a self-captured hacker who thought to blackmail Tinkov), a variety of offers, the number of co-branded products, and a lot of what Tinkoff Bank takes the first place in Russia. <br><br>  Oleg Tinkov loves provocative statements.  He <a href="https://vc.ru/p/tinkov-durov">spoke</a> about the same Pavel Durov very impartially in connection with his refusal to sell Usmanov Mail.ru Group, and with this audacity he is very similar to Paul himself, and especially to Boris Dyakonov.  They had a very exciting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHbFcnlqbeTw">conversation</a> in Business Secrets 2.0. <br><br>  In general, Tinkoff's weakness is in his strength.  Oleg quickly loses interest in the next project, after which the project begins to languish.  Perhaps in the future this outcome awaits his powerful Internet bank. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúI am often asked:‚Äú How did you start? ‚ÄùWith the will to live.</b>  <b>I wanted to live, but not to live. ‚Äù</b> </blockquote> <b><br></b> <br><h3>  7. Not viburnum, not honeysuckle or even gooseberry <br></h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/94a/c39/16094ac39cbb4ad2bfb673e5f3af05e3.jpg" alt="WildBerries Bakalchuk Tatiana"><br>  <i>Photo from fws.gov.</i>  <i>At this place could be a photo of Tatiana Bakalchuk ...</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The wildness of Tatiana Bakalchuk‚Äôs berry is primarily expressed in isolation from the outside world itself by the owner of one of the most successful online stores.  Over the 12 years of its project‚Äôs existence, no interviews have been given.  For some time, even Tatiana‚Äôs appearance caused a lot of controversy, there were several fake photos, and only in 2014 it turned out that Tatiana Bakalchuk is the owner of an attractive Korean look. <br><br>  Her success is due to the difficulties of family life.  Having given birth to a daughter, Tatyana realized that teaching English would not bring the necessary income to the family.  Who her husband worked, it is not known, but now he is, of course, busy with WildBerries.  For the first time, having entered the Internet market in 2004, with almost no competitors, Bakalchuk quickly established herself in its segment and continues to keep the bar even with competition from Ozon.ru and its ilk.  Now the company's turnover is 36.5 billion rubles, and the number of employees is about 7,500. <br><br>  Another uniqueness of Tatiana is in close proximity to the famous Elena Baturina in the Forbes list.  Just think - how different in quality can be a billion state. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: "If you think that a person who has never given an interview or even has not even been photographed in public, there are well-known quotations, then read this phrase first."</b> <b><br></b> </blockquote><br><br><h3>  8. On the eternal guard of cyber security </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf3/356/bdb/cf3356bdb986479eaf38d4a5dca54d9a.jpg" alt="Evgeny Kaspersky"><br>  <i>Photos from the site lenta.ru.</i>  <i>Kaspersky Eugene is watching you</i> <br><br>  Almost James Bond, but without waggers and gunfire.  Otherwise, Evgeny Kaspersky will give odds to any fictional spy, even if he is real and knows everything about modern computer viruses. <br><br>  Kaspersky Lab is the most popular among similar and most closed, as it constantly contacts with the special services of Russia and other countries.  Basically, only Evgeny Kaspersky himself, who also comes from the GB-ists, is in plain sight.  He graduated from the mysterious 4th Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School (now known as the Institute of Cryptography, Communications and Informatics of the Academy of the FSB). <br><br>  Since 1987, familiar with viruses.  After 10 years, he founded the same Laboratory, at that moment already having antivirus sales revenue of more than $ 1 million. If it were not for Natalia‚Äôs wife, Kaspersky would not perpetuate his last name. <br><br>  The laboratory is among the four largest in the world, many consider it a product of the Russian special services, although Kaspersky himself claims that he does not have any investments, and the development is carried out exclusively on the profit coming.  But the apparent influence of Russian GB-ists can be seen at least in the ban on the sale of shares of the American company General Atlantic in 2011. <br><br>  Evgeny Kaspersky has a fortune of about $ 1 billion. In the same 2011, he practically became a member of a real thriller, when criminals kidnapped his son and extorted a ransom of 3 million euros.  But the happy end took place pretty quickly with the participation of the same special services. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúThe main vulnerability of the Internet is in its anonymity.</b>  <b>Therefore, in order to make the World Wide Web less vulnerable, it is necessary to accurately identify each of its users ‚Äù(as it turns out, not only states but also Kaspersky dream of identifying each person).</b> </blockquote><br><h3>  9. Actress-gamer-new-lucky </h3><br>  It is <b>new-udachnica</b> , not neudachnica, as Alisa Chumachenko calls herself in social networks.  As each new step led to a new peak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/866/286/6d4/8662866d4e494cf9a01a3c9b9887d165.jpg" alt="Alisa Chumachenko and Igor Matsanyuk"><br>  <i>Photos from the site Forbes.ru.</i>  <i>Bonnie Chumachenko and Clyde Matsanyuk (in a good way))</i> <br><br>  At 14 she was full of acting skills.  But after 10 years decided to become a gamer.  First, by chance (Sergey Zhukov from the ‚ÄúHands Up‚Äù group called her as a secretary to a new IT-territory project), then consciously (asked for it in the PR department, from there reaching the vice-president position), and then fearlessly (after selling at MRG previous project by creating your product Game Insight). <br><br>  Now she is away from GI, but her husband, Igor Matsanyuk, is the chairman of the board of directors. <br><br>  Alisa is among the 30 richest women in Forbes, and her brainchild of GI is 7th in the list of the largest Internet companies in Russia with revenues of $ 110 million and a game audience of 250 million people. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúMoney is energy.</b>  <b>They should be let into the whirlpool ‚Äù.</b> </blockquote><br>  <i><b>The hardest line is the last.</b></i>  <i><b>No more valuable than the previous ones, but at the same time valuable for its finishing tape.</b></i>  <i><b>We wanted to put here Solonina Sergey and Qiwi, Valery Kovalev and Kholodilnik.ru.</b></i>  <i><b>The youngest Russian billionaire Maxim Nogotkov (who became 20 years old, but who took up Internet business much later), and many others, deserved a place in this top.</b></i>  <i><b>However, we will give this position to a human legend, one of the first walkers to Silicon Valley.</b></i>  <i><b>The oldest (66 years old) Internet entrepreneur from this TOP.</b></i> <br><br><h3>  10. A couple of phrases, Paragraph, Parascript </h3><br>  Stepan Pachikov is a person who has made a significant contribution to handwriting recognition and the virtual reality modeling language VRML.  The author of such legendary projects as ParaGraph, Parascript, and of course, Evernote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e97/b29/2dc/e97b292dcb374fd89b6539c17af26d64.png" alt="Stepan Pachikov"><br>  <i>Photo from habrahabr.ru.</i>  <i>Stepan Pachikov and his first prototypes of Evernote</i> <br><br>  A unique person, followed by whole teams from the company to the company across the Silicon Valley.  Absolutely devoid of talent to promote the product (in the case of the ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ambar/blog/202986/">Hyperboloid,</a> ‚Äù for example), but endowed with the gift of creating fundamentally new solutions.  Pachikov was twice expelled from Novosibirsk and Tbilisi universities for dissident views, as a result he received a full-fledged higher education only in Moscow. <br><br>  Stepan Pachikov was brought up on the Strugatsky fiction, who asked very deep questions and remained unanswered in their books.  Stepan Alexandrovich has a dream: ‚Äúto assemble a team and understand in what language the Creator programs.  How does, for example, the program that controls the spider ". <br><br>  It is still connected, however, only as an architect, with Evernote, which has already gained about 100 million users and $ 300 million of investments, in addition, has a number of other projects of its own. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Quote: ‚ÄúDo not shove your contribution into your own business‚Äù and ‚ÄúInvestor is a time bomb‚Äù.</b> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316848/</a></p>
