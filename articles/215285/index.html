Inspired by this example, I made a timid attempt to dig in the direction of using games in training and created an <a href="https://stepic.org/city/">online course on designing cities</a> where video games, board games and movies are studied. <br><br>  Many games in their mechanics or legends, you can find the principles of designing real cities.  The games serve as an illustration of urban planning and economics, and thus are the first step in studying this subject area.

And using the example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boom_Beach">‚ÄúBoom Beach‚Äù</a> one can understand that not all coastal cities were used to protect fortifications, and to study the history of Venice. <br><br>  Under the cut are examples of the games ‚Äú100,000 years BC‚Äù, ‚ÄúTriple Town‚Äù, ‚ÄúCarcassonne‚Äù, ‚ÄúTemple Run‚Äù and the movie ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù.

The course is suitable for people who want to get acquainted with the design of cities, learn about the subject before a deeper and more serious study, look at the subject from the other side, or simply draw inspiration.  In addition to practical examples, the course also contains theory, in particular, small videos and links for further study. <br><br>  First of all, when creating video lessons, I wanted to get away from the format of the <a href="https://medium.com/hack-education/4ccb1723bd6e">weather forecast</a> and in no case do not take teaching <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8">selfie</a> .  Therefore, it was decided to focus on the following characteristics of the video: short, exciting attention, evoking emotions and a desire to review the video.  And as the best practices were considered the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DzDZFcDGpL4U">‚ÄúChanging Education Paradigms‚Äù</a> from RSA Animate, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dw0ffwDYo00Q">Simon's Cat</a> cartoons and the showril <a href="http://vimeo.com/70032068">The Mill</a> . <br><br>  As links, preference was given to links to articles in Wikipedia as a multilingual resource, containing a large amount of additional material and links for further reading.  Since the course is in English, it is convenient to have a theory in your native language at hand. <br><br>  I also want to note the feature of the Stepic platform on which the course is placed - a lesson with theory or tasks that you like can be pasted onto another platform, for example, <a href="https://medium.com/city-design/7e0a3bd97dd9">in a separate article</a> . <br><br>  PS Link to the course: <a href="https://stepic.org/city">stepic.org/city</a> <br>  PPS Especially for Habr, I recorded a Russian voice acting intro video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3mbdUjuKGPg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgZyflsx5uft1YwDtc3Ba9OZpfVCw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215285/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215285/</a></p>
