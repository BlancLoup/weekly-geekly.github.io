The last time was attended by a little more than 4 thousand people, and this year there were already 5 thousand participants in the first round on the Codeforces platform.  Moreover, schoolchildren and students at first went along with experienced developers and professional cyber sportsmen (although they are also often students). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19b/bcd/50e/19bbcd50ef5e42468311d689b5f54d2b.jpeg">

      In addition to the main competition in the competition scheme, for the 50 finalists there was a separate task to write the AI ‚Äã‚Äãof a combat robot (robot), fighting with other participants' robots. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  rules </h4><br>  The tournament was held in three rounds, two of which were deleted, and the last, final, was held at our office at KROK on Volochayevskaya, in order to exclude the ‚Äúhelp of the hall‚Äù.  Accordingly, complexity increased from stage to stage, and out of 5,000 people, the 50 best participants reached the final.  The rules of all rounds are the same: you need to solve the problem using any language and any development tools.  Then fix and commit the decision (after which it cannot be changed).  At this point, all other participants see the source code of the commit and can ‚Äúbreak‚Äù it, substituting any incoming data.  If at least one set of data (from basic autotests and proposed by other participants) causes a ‚Äúfailure‚Äù of the solution, it does not count, and the author of the incoming set gets some extra points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45a/e41/936/45ae4193616b441fb6e96e08db576692.jpeg"><br><br>  We paid for the road to Moscow to all the finalists.  If last year a Japanese professional took part in the tournaments, then this time Yakub Safin from the Czech Republic came to the final. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aff/95d/bf4/aff95dbf45b74449a6172ae9c21cc84e.jpeg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI wanted to get to at least some final, I didn‚Äôt go out before ... I liked it, but it was really hard to write working code.‚Äù</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/96d/7b1/ba896d7b127e482a8bbfc8d2b9ad33c6.jpeg"><br><br>  Mostly young specialists came to the last tour (the average age is about 22 years).  Many of the participants have already completed internships at Google and Microsoft in the United States or are working in Yandex, Intel, or other large IT corporations in Russia. <br><br><h4>  Final tasks </h4><br>  The final problems with solutions can be found <a href="http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44408">here</a> .  The final itself was built around these five tasks.  The remaining tasks of the championship, we also laid out in open access on the day after the final.  All other tasks with analysis of qualification and selection are also available on Codeforces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8a/ac4/298/e8aac429842548b5adb765a21a205fe2.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Winners </h4><br>  The winner of the main competition this year, as in the past, was Gennady Korotkevich under the nickname tourist (ITMO, St. Petersburg), who took 100 thousand rubles.  Iron Man, just the terminator, is very famous in the get-together. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/331/90e/93333190e3a2491cbaf18c2a1438cbd5.jpeg"><br><br>  The second place was taken by Vladislav Yepifanov, a graduate student from Nizhny Novgorod, who had previously lit up with a victory at the Russian Code Cup and took fourth place in the final of Google Jam in 2012. His prize is 70 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42a/ff8/e35/42aff8e350044b7cbf3f6e9ddf660e90.jpeg"><br>  <i>It seems that in 2011 there was an announcement on codeforces that CROC was holding a programming competition.</i>  <i>Interested, decided to participate.</i>  <i>Of the top places for such serious ones, I have one victory on the Russian code cup, and probably I have never hit the top three again.</i>  <i>I often go to the final stage of the competition and our national and international, so I have some experience of participation ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I already work as a programmer, in principle, probably, I will continue to do the same.</i>  <i>I am engaged in sport programming almost from the first class, so most of my life, we can say ... We had such a teacher in Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir Lelyukh Denisovich, and he worked with many students, among his students there were many gold medalists of international competitions, I was somehow led I liked it, I decided to continue walking.</i> <br><br>  Third place and a check for 50 thousand was taken by Alexey Dmitriev (MIPT). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8f/b7d/5b3/a8fb7d5b35e14aa78b9fe96b08978ff7.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Competition for AI Wobot </h4><br>  This competition was going on separately, since tasks are tasks, but besides them, we still need to show real combat items. <br><br>  This year there were classic robot competitions, but with batteries and mines.  Each of the participants chose their battle strategy, for about 4 hours the participants taught their robots to carry batteries, put mines and traps, shoot and move around the map. <br><br>  Then - an hour and a half of visualized fights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db1/299/25c/db129925c2ef4426a0b5aaaa04906598.jpeg"><br><br>  The prize for this competition is 50 thousand rubles, won by Ivan Belonogov (St. Petersburg, ITMO).  Here he talks about his strategy: <br><br><blockquote>  At such competitions, I usually stick to tactics that first write at least something to make it work ... - not to write something complicated at first, but to write some basic things.  First - so that she would shoot to the side, then write to go, then - to follow her batteries, first carry hers, then the following, and improve it so step by step ... There was not much time to do some clever things , everything that I added, it improved the work.  If there was more time ... There are things that I have not yet implemented, for example, working with mines.  It seems to me that the rest of the participants have also not far advanced in this matter: someone threw them, but I didn't see anything like that in order to do this effectively. <br><br>  Maxim Akhmedov performed quite well.  Well, it is clear that on preliminary testing points are always shown.  It seems that the team that earned a lot of points, they probably play well, but I had rather weak results in the first rounds, it seemed to me that it was somehow unlucky. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/353/10c/5fd/35310c5fd9bc48b9a3ed9864ee1aed0b.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><ul><li>  Here is the specification and competitive task <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzlTas6R6I1UdEowdUZtNGR1OE0/view">(PDF)</a> for the competition of the vobots. </li><li>  <a href="http://codeforces.com/contest/662">Championship tasks</a> </li><li>  Once again the <a href="http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/44408">analysis of the final tasks</a> </li><li>  A report from the past of the Russian programming championship <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/180617/">is here</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282345/</a></p>
