  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The truth about Poka Nokia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Art. Lebedev Studio announced the termination of the contract with the Finnish company Nokia.  Despite the fact that the official website of the Studio talks about its own initiative in the termination of cooperation, according to Nokia, the Finnish company itself initiated the cancellation of the contract.  Market participants are perplexed about the behavior of a famous designer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As CNews learned, the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer, Nokia, has canceled a contract with Artemy Lebedev's design studio.  Today on the official website of Lebedev there was a message about what happened.  The studio presented what happened as a result of its own initiative.  However, a source at CNews Studio said that the termination of the contract occurred at the request of the customer company Nokia. <br><br>  According to market participants, the reasons for what happened are obvious - Artemy Lebedev Studio is not a customer-oriented company, and therefore in most cases it is not able to maintain good and especially long-term relationships with customers.  Due attitude to the customer in the case of the world-famous brand Nokia was especially important, and according to some information, it was Studio‚Äôs dismissive attitude that caused the contract to be broken. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFor Nokia, in my opinion, this is a positive event.  There is reason to believe that, from this moment on, the company's Internet representation will finally begin to work and function adequately.  As for Lebedev Studio, then, most likely, the consequences of the incident may be such that the company will ‚Äúclose the doors‚Äù to the Western market, ‚Äùsaid Eldar Murtazin, lead analyst at Mobile-Research Group.  The reasons for what happened, according to the expert, are clear - the style of doing business by the Artemy Lebedev Studio often does not coincide with the norms adopted in large companies, as was the case with Nokia and MTS.

      ‚ÄúIn accordance with Nokia‚Äôs adopted business and financial reporting standards for SOX, we are obliged to evaluate all service providers at least once every 3 years,‚Äù said Victoria Yeryomina, a Nokia representative in Russia, at CNews.  - This assessment is carried out by organizing a tender, inviting other participants on equal terms.  In the case of the Studio Artemy Lebedev, which has been working with us for more than 4 years, a tender was also held, and the Studio could not win it.  In connection with this contract was terminated.  The results of the tender were announced at the end of April 2007, and according to their results, the tender was won by the Ukrainian agency E-Development, affiliated with Kvazar-Micro.  The agency has proven itself well when working on the Nokia website in Ukraine. ‚Äù <br><br>  For Artemy Lebedev Studio, this is not the first such incident - the company previously broke the contract with MTS after seven years of cooperation.  According to CNews, this happened because MTS - being dissatisfied with the timing of the work and its price - unilaterally changed the terms of the contract.  Art. Lebedev Studio did not accept the new conditions, which led to the termination of cooperation. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2007/06/27/256498">cnews.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11461/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11461/</a></p>
