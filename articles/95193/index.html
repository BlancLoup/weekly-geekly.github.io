  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employment Experience in Norway: Applying</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In response to, unfortunately, the closed topic of the original resume in the form of a USB card, I decided to describe my private employment experience in Norway. <a name="habracut"></a>  Norway is one of the most stable countries for life and work, therefore, many, having decided to work abroad, choose Norway.  I can immediately declare that employment in Norway is not an easy task.  Here there are certain rules in employment and certain phenomena and pitfalls in the work market. <br>  In general, employment in Norway is approached thoroughly.  Students long before graduation begin to think about employment and looking for the desired job.  The usual way is to get a job for the summer, get acquainted with the company, make contacts.  Norway most often chooses this particular course, for most international students this path is not available, since they are poorly oriented in the local "working" kitchen. <br>  Throughout the school year, many student and near-student organizations conduct free courses and training on employment.  I have attended several such courses.  Once there was a general course on writing the correct resume, once there was a course on behavior at the interview, and once I was on a course on finding a job for technical students.  All these courses are conducted quite regularly (2-3 times a month), and are enrolled in courses about a month before they are held (read, turn for a month).  In addition, most universities have employment assistance centers.  Their task is simple - they collect information from the recruitment bureaus, conduct courses on hiring out, do the reading of student resumes and conduct interviews with trainings for students who have received invitations to interview.  This is done completely free of charge and their goal is to reduce the time between graduating from university and getting a job.  In addition, they explain the rules of behavior in the work market.  By the way, it is on the basis of these rules that I consider a resume in the form of a USB business card to be a bad decision. <br><h1>  Experience </h1>  Norwegians love a non-error summary with some common pattern.  Patterns of a European standard are accepted, oddly enough, with skepticism.  The Norwegian template is not standardized, but the style should be maintained throughout the resume.  Mandatory information: <ul><li>  <b>education</b> (up to grade 10-11).  Be sure to indicate what was the subject of the diploma, what was the specialization.  It is desirable that education would reflect the requirement of a vacancy. </li><li>  <b>work experience</b> (not even significant, not related to education and vacancy, for example for ITshnika - a waiter in a restaurant).  This experience is important to highlight some personal qualities.  So - work while studying requires at least organization from a person; experience in dealing with people is important.  Pay attention to this. </li><li>  <b>list of abilities in IT</b> .  This field, in some respects, is an atavism.  At the dawn of computerization, it was important what programs a person can use.  For most techies, this is not very relevant, since any required software or language can be mastered quickly, but, nevertheless, this field is important when selecting a resume. </li><li>  <b>publications</b> .  As it does not sound loud, but every normal applicant it should be.  This is due to the fact that every diploma in Norway falls into a single inter-university library and can be found.  The presence of this publication in some way increases the credibility of education.  For scientific and near-science specialties, this is extremely important. </li><li>  <b>hobby.</b>  A very short note about yourself and your hobbies.  You can say about your favorite sports.  Here is the place where you can be original. </li><li>  <b>recommenders.</b>  A list of people with their phone numbers who can talk about you.  You should be associated with these people through education (for example, your supervisor), or work experience (boss).  Such people it is desirable to have no less than 3 and no more than 4. It is desirable to have a letter of recommendation from each of them. </li></ul>  Resume size - maximum 1 sheet (2 pages).  If you do not intermeddle - feel free to remove what is less significant.  All that does not go down to 1 sheet, most likely, will not be read. <br>  As explained to us at various courses (and they are held by people who are engaged in recruiting), a resume (or Curriculum Vitae) is the key for pre-selection of candidates.  The work of the personnel manager is very expensive, therefore, the preliminary selection is carried out by the one who receives less - that is, the secretary.  His job boils down to listing resumes that have come to email, sending notifications that a resume is registered, throwing out a resume, if it doesn‚Äôt come on time (yes, that's right, if the resume is late, then its likely way is to go to the trash can without looking in the content).  And also reconciliation of information from the resume with your list.  Very creative resumes may not go through ... It is believed that a creative person should show his creativity in a work task, and not in a resume.  The summary should be, first of all, the order and maximum clarity of the person.  It is from excessive creativity on the courses.  In addition, many do not have the goal to hire the best candidate.  Often there is a refusal due to excessively high qualification.  The candidate must fulfill his obligations for reasonable money.  In addition, a person must love their work.  If an employee is able and willing to do more than the employer offers, then the employee will very quickly become uninterested and he will leave. <br>  Further, if the resume has passed the preliminary selection, the entire package of documents falls on the table to the personnel manager. The second part of the statement comes into play, namely: <ul><li>  <b>application for a job</b> .  The application should be in free form, where you need to state who you are, where you found out about the vacancy, why you are suitable.  The application must be with a header (from whom, to whom, for which vacancy) and a maximum of 2/3 pages - the text of the letter.  The text should be such that from the second to third lines the applicant should make it clear that he is an actual candidate.  As a rule, it begins like this: ‚ÄúAfter reading an announcement of a free vacancy there for this or that, I became interested and decided to submit an application.  I am an experienced programmer with those and those skills and I am very interested to try my hand at such a great organization as yours. ‚ÄùAfter that, you need to confirm your experience and reveal your personal qualities with confirmation.  If the HR specialist read your letter to the end - 80% of the way to the interview is completed. </li><li>  <b>diploma.</b>  Or rather - a listing of graduation ratings.  An important part.  As a rule, in the absence of work experience, this is the only document confirming your qualifications.  Norway has a scoring system from A to F. A is a great grade, F-failed the exam.  The government's recommendation on grades at the university says that the rating should be adjusted in such a way that AE grades are distributed according to normal law.  In fact, everything turns out wrong, and when assessing the masters (masters) at the universities, teachers give a high score.  Therefore, the distribution is strongly biased in A and B, and the Norwegian employers are completely spoiled by these estimates.  The CD matches our foursome.  When translating Russian certificates, it is better to immediately adapt grades to the letter scale, since in Norwegian universities until 2003 there was a fractional numerical scale, where the highest score corresponded to the worst result.  Estimates below average may raise questions at the interview.  We must be able to explain.  Moreover, life explanations, for example, broke with a girlfriend before the exam, will be perceived better than the explanation - ‚Äúpoorly prepared.‚Äù </li><li>  <b>letters of recommendation.</b>  They should describe your previous work tasks, and describe how you handled them.  If there is no work experience, and there are no letters from the managers, there should be a letter from the head of the thesis.  They can call those who recommended you and additionally ask.  These people must be warned in advance.  It is very important. </li></ul> After sending the application, you must confirm its receipt.  Usually, the employer himself writes a letter stating that the application has been received and will be considered.  If such a letter did not arrive within two weeks, you need to call and confirm receipt. I had cases when the letter was simply lost, went into spam.  For vacancies usually put the deadline for submission of documents.  Until the end of this period, no one will deal with your application.  After the end of this period, a surprisingly long time may pass.  After 2-3 weeks, if there was no answer, you can ask about the status.  Once I was informed about the refusal after 5 months.  At that time, as it turned out, they refused only because they did not quite understand my resume.  There is a friend who received an offer to come for an interview in 8 (!) Months.  It is connected with local peculiarities. At the same time I finish the first part, in case of relevance - I will describe my experience further with pleasure. </div>
