The law does not have the concepts of ‚Äúcorporate media‚Äù, ‚Äúcatalog‚Äù, the erosion of the legislative framework.  The problem has been sucked out of hand by corporate lawyers [of foreign companies], ‚Äùsays Alexey Volin, deputy head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. <br><br>  From the beginning of 2016, a law came into force restricting foreign ownership in the media to 20%. <br><br>  At the end of December last year, the Ministry of Economic Development sent a report to Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich on the issue of removing corporate publications and catalogs of foreign companies from the scope of the law ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù.

      Allegedly, for the release of catalogs in accordance with the law on mass media, ‚Äúthe trading networks are obliged to register as mass media if such publications exceed 1 thousand copies‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a>  Roskomnadzor keeps the register of the media, but the publication Sostav.ru <a href="http://www.sostav.ru/publication/katalogi-ikea-i-metro-okazhutsya-vne-zakona-20328.html">could not</a> find in it the catalogs of retail chains. <br><br>  The Ministry of Economic Development in the explanatory note clarifies that the ban on trade networks recognizes as ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù, it can also make the Russian market unattractive for investment. <br><br>  According to the representative of Dvorkovich, Aliya Samigullina, the topic is now being discussed in the government and ministries. <br><br>  Foreign companies, including <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%25C3%25A9">Nestle</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_AG">Metro AG</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoa">Alcoa</a> , met at the end of last year with the leadership of the State Duma and Roskomnadzor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are told: do not worry, you understand that this is a law against‚Äú color revolutions ‚Äùand not against sales of fans,‚Äù explains the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia Alexey Rodzyanko.  The advertising catalogs, which are issued in large print runs for companies such as Nestle and Metro, are a matter of direct sales, he stresses. <br><br>  If corporate publications and advertising catalogs are registered as mass media, they will be subject to the law.  Otherwise, they still have nothing to fear.  But then the same IKEA and Metro will not be able to issue more than 1 thousand directories.  This is a negligible amount compared to today's circulation. <br><br>  Alcoa Russia President Maxim Smirnov <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2963721">confirmed</a> to Kommersant that the company participated in these meetings.  A company in Russia has facilities where workers do not have access to computers, so to inform them you need a corporate newspaper. <br><br>  The source of the publication said that in 2016 this newspaper began to be published in an edition of 900 copies.  But Alcoa Russia withdrew the certificate of registration of its publication as a media outlet in Roskomnadzor. <br><br>  Elena Yakunina, head of public relations department at Nestle, says that a company in Russia is currently producing a corporate publication for employees with a circulation of up to one thousand copies, acting in the legislative field. <br><br>  The company Metro Cash &amp; Carry in Russia has had a corporate publication that has historically not been subject to the law ‚ÄúOn Mass Media,‚Äù said retailer Oksana Tokareva.  At the same time, she says, the company has advertising catalogs that are produced for Russian customers with information about the products of domestic suppliers.  "Everyone is aware that these directories are not the media, so we found a solution that satisfies the regulatory authorities," said Mrs Tokareva. <br><br>  In the near future, there are no plans to check corporate publications, said Vadim Ampelonsky, a representative of Roskomnadzor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300142/</a></p>
