On this remarkable occasion, we decided to tell Habra who is a hero to ourselves, whom we focus on teaching children the professions of the new century, and to whom we take off our hat for their contribution to the popularization and development of technology. <br><br>  This article will be devoted to outstanding people who influenced the development of Web 2.0 and its triumphant march across the planet.  First of all, web programmers and technology evangelists, whose work we were inspired by.  We would like to draw your attention to the fact that this rating is completely subjective, and the location of certain names in the list is chosen more from artistic considerations than from their contributions relative to each other. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Paul Irish </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8a/6a7/ffb/a8a6a7ffbcdf20946859cf2b7b2f864e.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  A man whose face is as difficult to meet on the street as the president, and this event in itself can be a reason for a t-shirt print.  Paul appears in times of trouble for the Internet, creates several iconic projects, publishes hundreds of articles, gives dozens of speeches and, when the correct vector is set, goes into the shadows, as if Tyler Durden, allowing the community to further develop independently.

      With the post ‚Äúdeveloper advocate‚Äù in the Google Chrome team, Paul created <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> in 2010, bringing together rules and recommendations for creating HTML5 websites, which helped developers to start using new technologies in their projects, without delving into the study of thick specifications.  H5BP taught millions of developers around the world how to organize scripts and styles on a page, to provide the best user experience, what reset and normalize styles are, why accessibility is important, as well as many, many other things, while continuing to do so. <br><br>  To list all the contributions of Paul Irish in one article is almost impossible.  The author of the fundamental work on browser performance and work, the creator of many tools and whole concepts, such as ‚Äúpolyfill‚Äù and ‚Äúfeature detection‚Äù, the killer of the worst resource on the Internet in the framework of the <a href="http://www.w3fools.com/">W3Fools</a> campaign, the creator of many web development organizations.  Paul has been one of the centers of the whole web development crowd for nearly five years.  Now he is actively working on the development of Chrome DevTools and other famous projects.  Drop in on <a href="https://github.com/paulirish">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/paul_irish">Twitter</a> . <br><br><h2>  Addy osmani </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ab/299/812/4ab2998126b0678eca03f66175b915d6.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  The ‚Äúfashion herald‚Äù of the modern web, the name of Addy, is often heard at well-known design conferences with themes that only enthusiasts are talking about today, but after that everyone starts talking.  Starting with a comprehensive Backbone application development guide in the <a href="https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/">book of the</a> same <a href="https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/">name</a> , Addie‚Äôs ideas have grown to the highly popular <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">Progressive Web Apps</a> concept, actively promoted by Google and Mozilla these days. <br><br>  Creator of <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> , <a href="https://getmdl.io/">Material Design Lite</a> , <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a> and many of the tools available on <a href="https://github.com/addyosmani%3Ftab%3Drepositories">GitHub</a> .  But Addy is interesting above all not for this, but for its high-quality reports, performances and master classes.  Be sure to come to listen to it live and you definitely will not leave without inspiration to develop yourself and move the web forward. <br><br><h2>  Vitaly friedman </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4df/33d/6f7/4df33d6f7bde821317d842e2faeaef84.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  Belarusian designer and fender, Vitaly made websites when it was not yet mainstream.  Founder of one of the most famous and influential online publications for developers and designers of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a> , now almost a corporation engaged in everything from publishing books to organizing workshops and conferences.  Launched in 2006, Smashing Magazine quickly became the main news and training resource in the field of web development, notably standing out against the background of the then few competitors, the ‚Äúadult‚Äù publishing approach and the high quality of published materials. <br><br>  Over 12 years of activity only within the framework of Smashing Magazine, Vitaly wrote more than 170 articles, conducted an innumerable number of workshops and presentations.  One of the few figures in this modest ranking, who can boast that several generations of web developers have already grown up in his work and, we hope, more than one will grow. <br><br><h2>  substack (James Halliday) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e17/6e1/31f/e176e131fc3103268dab92f991a047a9.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  Hacker in the original sense of the word.  A person whose name is not widely known, but almost everyone who is involved in modern web development knows a nickname.  Remember, a joke used to be popular, that everything that can be written in JavaScript will be written on it?  So, substack <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~substack">wrote everything</a> . <br><br>  The High Priest of the ‚ÄúThe Node Way‚Äù sect, Richard Stallman from the world of the web, the man who taught us to use streams, the demostsenter and the irreparable optimist.  Perhaps the only developer on the Internet who has not written a webpack.  His programming philosophy is <a href="https://gist.github.com/khoomeister/5010943">explored</a> , and his projects are cited as examples in teaching programming under Node.js.  Live substack performances are renowned for text-based presentations in vim and on-stage programming.  If you have never seen his reports, it's time to find <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/substack/">something interesting</a> for yourself and see.  We guarantee, you will not regret. <br><br><h2>  Scott hanselman </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cf/722/a7a/6cf722a7ac5505b81df480869f9d5254.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  The only representative of the ‚Äúopposition‚Äù forces on our list, Scott represents Microsoft.  Due to certain historical events, many developers still consider this company as the main enemy of the entire web.  Internet Explorer and some of its features have significantly tarnished Microsoft‚Äôs reputation in the eyes of ordinary developers, and it takes a long time to fix it.  Scott is just one of those people who thanks to MS they don‚Äôt shy away from hearing the name, but objectively consider their new developments, evaluating the pros and cons. <br><br>  Scott's charisma, his sense of humor and many years of developer experience make him one of the most interesting bloggers in the professional field.  At the moment, Scott has several podcasts, a YouTube channel, a personal blog and <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/about/">much more</a> .  He most often talks about .NET, Azure, Microsoft technologies, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIWPgUn8tL8s">about life</a> , and is interesting.  Even if you are a militant Linux user, Scott can teach you how to run <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/Building0verkillOnWindows10SubsystemForLinux2DASCIIArtDeathmatchGame.aspx">0verkill under Windows</a> and arrange a cross-platform deathmatch. <br><br><h2>  TJ Holowaychuk </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82f/c52/56c/82fc5256c48c8d5ef96d82c40abd4466.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  Mysterious Mr. Gold.  The most productive programmer in the history of mankind according to the version of <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-is-TJ-Holowaychuk-so-insanely-productive%3Fshare%3D1">some dude</a> .  So productive that some even had suspicions that under the <a href="https://github.com/tj">TJ</a> account there is a whole group of professional developers who do all this for the sake of hype, entertainment, or simply for conspiracy.  An appropriate <a href="https://medium.com/%40kelas/how-is-tj-holowaychuk-so-insanely-productive-604818b4e9eb">investigation has been</a> published, however, which did not give any answers, but only added new questions.  Does TJ have to do with the Illuminati?  We can neither confirm nor deny this. <br><br>  But seriously, TJ created <a href="https://expressjs.com/">express</a> - the most popular web framework for Node.js, which has become an industry standard.  He has made a huge contribution to the open-source community Node.js and Go.  TJ has an excellent sense of taste in the development and all the API for its authorship are understandable even to the beginner from the very first sight.  The simplicity and elegance of his work inspire and make you think first of all about the people who will work with your library or code.  It is a desire worthy of respect. <br><br><h2>  Sergey Berezhnoy ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/veged/" class="user_link">veged</a> ) </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e0/c0c/e2c/5e0c0ce2c773779278cdb8119ea558af.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  <i>We say - Sergey Berezhnoy, echo echoes us - BEM ... BEM ... BEM.</i> <br><br>  As you may have guessed, Sergey was one of those who created all this.  Many of us first heard about <a href="https://ru.bem.info/">BEM</a> , being novice web designers in web studios, line programmers in IT corporations or forever late freelancers.  I remember reading about BEM and saying ‚Äúyes, I always did that.‚Äù  And then we imbued, BEM has become almost a national idea. <br><br>  Despite the highly ambiguous strategy of Yandex to move to the west, BEM has become for the world community exactly what it was supposed to be - a stimulus for development.  Developers around the world took all the best that BEM offered and started using it in their projects.  This is a lot of personal merits of Sergey.  A talented developer, an experienced programmer, and just a good person, he, perhaps without knowing it, became for many to follow role models, including Kodabra. <br><br><h2>  Douglas crockford </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6f/ded/ce5/d6fdedce5ead83fe115764a47673f453.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  Living legend of the Internet.  JSON Creator.  Writes to JavaScript for perhaps longer than the language itself exists.  For all my life I have not declared a single global variable.  He refused to use this, new, class, null, for and everything else, but he writes code better than we do.  He speaks at many conferences, often as the only speaker, because he takes all the time slots at once with one of his lectures.  Posted by jsmin and jslint for good.  Issued IBM's personal permission to use his software for the sake of evil.  He dreams of a post-JavaScript era, believes in the apocalypse.  Invented a new numeric type.  Knows FORTRAN.  But it is not exactly. <br><br><h2>  Mathias Bynens </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d89/eb9/6b1/d89eb96b19b68f6a90f0e6be62754dff.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  Matthias is an extremely versatile personality, but in wide circles he is known primarily as an expert on encodings in general and Unicode in particular.  He is the author of the fundamental work on the internal use of unicode by JS engines and browsers, which saved an incredible amount of time for everyone who at least once was engaged in the tasks of dynamic code generation or worked with Asian languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the site.  Matthias has an amazing talent to put in a five-minute note multi-page specifications.  And on his <a href="https://github.com/mathiasbynens">githaba,</a> you can find the JavaScript implementation of almost any existing encoding, keep in mind, it can be useful. <br><br>  Today, when the entire immense archive of Unicode seems to be studied far and wide, Matthias is working on v8 and is working on web security.  I think it is unnecessary to explain how valuable are the deep knowledge about the structure of various encodings in the study of client vulnerabilities and attacks.  But, for example, in one of the public reports on Hackerone, Matthias <a href="https://hackerone.com/reports/298">demonstrated</a> how you can use the letter direction override symbol to visually change the name of a file to not suspicious.  So be careful when playing with fonts. <br><br><h2>  Lea verou </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/dc2/218/4afdc22189e63e106682de5c67d58720.jpg" height="250"><br><br>  As you know, all web developers are divided into two camps: Ninja and Pirates.  Lia, in the literal sense of the word, is a bright representative of the Pearl team, and maybe even her captain, judging by the number of conquered CSS files and capturers captured in captivity.  She is a true virtuoso of her own business when it comes to animations, transitions, transformations and everything that is at the interface of web design and development.  But not only. <br><br>  Leah is also a good programmer with innovative thinking and a creative approach.  She came up with <a href="https://mavo.io/">Mavo</a> - a tool for creating full-fledged web applications, not using anything other than HTML.  <a href="http://dabblet.com/">Dabblet</a> is an interactive CSS sandbox.  <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism</a> is a syntax highlighting library used on MDN and the most popular sites dedicated to layout, and these people know a lot about page beauty, believe me.  Her authorship belongs to many other projects.  It is interesting to watch everyone, because every project of Leah carries some kind of indescribable warmth of the soul, originality in trifles and excellent design.  But it is difficult to convey these feelings in words, better see for yourself - <a href="http://lea.verou.me/">lea.verou.me</a> . <br><br><h2>  % USERNAME% </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6af/659/d92/6af659d9233a12dada5b9acda3ecc1b0.png"><br><br>  Our ten is not quite ordinary, because it has 11th place.  We reserved it as a springboard for the heroes of the next generation.  Bring your child to the <a href="http://itheroes.letovo.ru/">IT Heroes</a> competition, which runs from February 1 to March 1, 2018, and perhaps it will be he who can use the Kodabra springboard to be directly on one of the future lists of the most inspiring professionals of the modern world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348968/</a></p>
