  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All Microsoft Zune functionality is videotaped.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúWe will be in this business for a long time.  Many devices will be released in various categories, ‚Äùsays Matt Jubelirer, product manager at Zune, at the beginning of his interview with famous podcaster Robert Scoble ( <a href="">video, 40 min 27 sec; 120 MB</a> ), where he showed all the details Zune functionality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The launch of the Zune platform is scheduled for November 14th.  Simultaneously with the release of Zune, a specialized PC program will appear and the online music store Zune Marketplace will start working, where you can buy unlimited access to music content for a small monthly fee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/249/efb/04f/249efb04f9f3d734d6af16fd8cfb68cd.jpg" alt="Zune  " title="Microsoft product manager demonstrated Zune device in action"><br><br>  During his conversation with Robert Scoble, Microsoft's product manager took out a small suitcase with three Zune devices in different colors.  He listed all the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/920/">known features of Zune</a> , and also talked about Zune Wireless Sharing - file sharing functions.  According to him, this is the main distinguishing feature of Zune, a key feature by which the community will be created around digital music.  Today, listening to digital music is like a personal process, and with the release of Zune, the situation will change.  True, Steve Jobs has already <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/1147/">laughed at this feature</a> .

      The second important difference is the three-inch screen, which is ‚Äúdramatically‚Äù larger than the competition.  On the screen resolution, Matt Jubelrer chose to keep quiet.  The screen is covered with a protective coating, because of which glare often occurs - this is clearly seen on the video. <br><br>  The player is easy to manage.  It is carried out through a system of horizontal and vertical menus.  For example, in the ‚ÄúMusic‚Äù section, we can move across the horizontal menu ‚ÄúAlbums‚Äù, ‚ÄúArtists‚Äù, ‚ÄúSongs‚Äù, ‚ÄúGenres‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlaylists‚Äù - and the list of elements in this category is instantly updated on the screen.  So, when selecting the Albums menu, the covers of the CDs and their descriptions are displayed on the display. <br>  For each video clip or music file, you can go to the menu where there is the item ‚ÄúSend‚Äù and ‚ÄúMark‚Äù (Flag). <br><br>  After pressing the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù button, the built-in radio transmitter starts searching for devices that are within its range.  When he finds it, then after the consent of the recipient, it is possible to physically copy the file.  Copying one MP3, WMA or AAC song takes 10-15 seconds.  Video can not be copied, although it can be broadcast to other displays.  After copying the audio file remains available for three days, while you can listen to it no more than three times.  All files are DRM protected. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the protocol does not allow transferring the file to several devices at once, but only to each of them in turn.  You can send a file only to another Zune, and no longer on any device.  Thus, Microsoft hopes to create a community of users. <br><br>  Content tagging is also one of the important functions, because thanks to it the recommendation system works. <br><br>  Matt Jubelierre spoke in detail about the ‚Äúwheel‚Äù on the player, which in fact is four buttons in the shape of a wheel plus one more button in the center.  To the left and right of the "wheel" there are two more buttons, so that all manipulations are conveniently carried out with one finger.  This convenience is preserved if you rotate the Zune 90 degrees and give it a horizontal position. <br><br>  Any photo can be made a background image, so that you never confuse your Zune with someone else.  The background image remains translucent when you travel through the various menus. <br><br>  The built-in FM tuner receives not only analog, but also a digital signal in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBDS">RBDS</a> format.  It displays the name of the radio station, its genre, as well as the subject of the current program, which is now on the air.  Radio recording function, of course, is missing. <br><br>  When asked if there would be any games on Zune, Matt Jub√©lierer said that so far there is no such possibility, because Zune and Xbox are created by different groups of developers.  But in the future it is quite possible. <br><br>  Matt Jub√©lierer stressed that Microsoft has independently designed the Zune from scratch, including creating all of its program stuff, which will be updated frequently.  For example, in the next firmware version, support for podcasting and other features may appear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/43f/bb8/553/43fbb85532440803b8972df2900f7b31.jpg" alt=" Zune" title="Stylish packaging Microsoft Zune"><br><br>  Microsoft Zune will go to the retail network at the very beginning of the "Christmas Rush", November 14, only in the United States.  It will be easy to learn Zune on the store shelf: it has, albeit a small but very stylish box. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4590/</a></p>
