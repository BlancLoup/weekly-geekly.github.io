      Starting this Friday, we will publish weekly the most interesting notes about events taking place in the community of the <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/">decentralized Internet provider ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  This digest is intended to increase the interest of the Community in the issue of privacy, which in the light of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/460639/">recent events</a> becomes more relevant than ever before. <br><br>  On the agenda: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/">Medium</a> creates its web services ecosystem on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P">I2P</a> network </li><li>  Public Key Infrastructure - Why I Need <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> in I2P </li><li>  <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/">RosKomSvoboda</a> experts did not find violations of the law in the activities of the decentralized Internet provider "Medium" </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8_/ze/c5/8_zec51qxoapzhdl_wgjjzgdnmy.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Remind me - what is ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù? </h2><br>  The Medium project was originally conceived as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking">Mesh network</a> in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3">Kolomna urban district</a> , but after a while it became quite obvious that there were not enough people willing to take part in the implementation of the idea. <br><br>  For this reason, after a while, Medium has become an independent and free provider of access to the I2P network - enthusiasts set up their wireless access points so that when connecting to them, it becomes possible to use the resources of the I2P project. <br><br>  Medium at no cost provides users with access to resources of the I2P network, which makes it impossible to calculate not only the router where the traffic came from (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_routing">basic principles of garlic traffic routing</a> ), but also the end user - the Medium subscriber. <br><br>  More information about what Medium is, can be found in the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449244/">corresponding article</a> . <br><br><h2>  Medium creates its web services ecosystem on the I2P network </h2><br>  I2P (the project ‚ÄúInvisible Internet‚Äù) confirmed its efficiency in practice: at the time of publication of an article on the network, <a href="">at least 5,000 routers</a> are operating. <br><br>  Until recently, the main problem was the insufficient number of intranet services that could prove to be worthy alternatives to the most popular Internet services. <br><br>  The Medium user community decided to remedy this situation and began to deploy <a href="">its own web services ecosystem</a> within the I2P network. <br><br>  At the moment, the following general-purpose services are available to users: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84c/2fc/5e7/84c2fc5e71a328ace9bce35dbd2eb54b.png" alt="image"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">As well as special services</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/986/22b/76d/98622b76dae0dd0352f5b4192369b817.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  If you have a brilliant idea, free time, your own server and enthusiasm - you can help the community develop the ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù web services ecosystem: <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/medium/issues">create an application to add your service to the list</a> and feel free to start developing! <br><br>  Medium also has a sort <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/medium-dns">of domain name system</a> .  The operator of the Medium access point can add the service <a href="http://dns.medium.i2p/%3Fi2paddresshelper%3DnSoocrdWZtFKG03ML363mC9uMrjAOtU8zfsCW5J6gaWeS2cgvMOcXsT6jI78y2ucUcybShhxOazN~7R4yZszZ3EUWmwTA2pczbY~ModyarJnC~tKwRFGlozceXmC8WDO3kRZxDhYAtM7Rgv4wac0V8JIfN8VIuhW~M2VT1m0CPDALv~C4wTOI4XvsAKs35eCgMrFoskA55DUJOEa01lEKtwnDuy0JT5~OLvEDMBHHGVy3gHHUd2-II~3bgMnHRB8pOwXUtsbbwpPycOe1z9x2Ryx6G7zfh4iaS~651J2tU7ee-2LNPg-yfk~k7ZzwXt1GDmmWacQLuOH019MA~wZpFMLo6DrEvpgxUcygIwOIh3RS8g2d75RHLxvycHbHJxm7mFLKrPFDsfzNJ1bL4A5qLd~G~sQH2h3cawroroM5z6C6M08KIxK-fFInlrAOoRwhH7HLNMPM4YZFrrEZOW~iIlSGER7GhQX9NmtMEwFaOCqQK0ICJTQmKxLQUQGQljDBQAEAAcAAA%3D%3D">dns.medium.i2p</a> to the subscription list of the I2P router so that its users can access all the services of the Medium network. <br><br><h2>  Public Key Infrastructure - Why I Need HTTPS in I2P </h2><br>  There is no need to use the HTTPS protocol to connect to the web services on the I2P network if you connect to them through the locally working proxy server of your I2P client (for example, <a href="https://github.com/PurpleI2P/i2pd">i2pd</a> ). <br><br>  Indeed: the <a href="https://geti2p.net/ru/docs/transport/ssu">SSU</a> and <a href="https://geti2p.net/spec/ntcp2">NTCP2 transport</a> at the protocol level allows you to safely use the resources of the I2P network - the possibility of conducting a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">MITM attack is</a> completely excluded. <br><br>  The situation changes radically if you access the resources of the I2P network not directly, but through an intermediate node - an access point of the ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù network, which is administered by its operator. <br><br>  Who in this case can compromise the data that you transmit: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Access Point Operator</b> .  It is obvious that the current operator of the access point of the network "Medium" can listen to unencrypted traffic that passes through its equipment. </li><li>  <b>The malefactor</b> (the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">person in the middle</a> ).  Medium has a problem similar to that of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357128/">the Tor network</a> , only for input and intermediate nodes. </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This is how it looks.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3x/aw/tk/3xawtkt-vwyttmuhtka5yhkndho.png"><br></div></div><br>  <b>Solution</b> : to access the web services of the I2P network, use the HTTPS protocol ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_OSI">OSI model</a> level 7).  The problem is that for I2P network services it is not possible to issue a genuine security certificate by conventional means, such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%25E2%2580%2599s_Encrypt">Let's Encrypt</a> . <br><br>  Therefore, enthusiasts have established their own certification center - <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/medium-pki">"Medium Root CA"</a> .  All services of the Medium network are signed by the root security certificate of this certification authority. <br><br>  The possibility of compromising the root certificate of the certification center was certainly taken into account - but here the certificate is more necessary to confirm the integrity of the data transfer and to exclude the possibility of conducting MITM attacks. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù network services from different operators have different security certificates, one way or another signed by the root certification authority.  However, the operators of the root certification authority are not able to listen to the encrypted traffic of the services to which they have signed security certificates (see <a href="https://www.emaro-ssl.ru/support/csr-chto-eto.php">‚ÄúWhat is CSR?‚Äù</a> ). <br><br>  Those who are especially concerned about their security can use tools such as <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGP">PGP</a> and the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/globalsign/blog/446404/">like</a> as additional protection. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">You can also independently check the public keys of specific services of the Medium network.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5b/1ea/c18/c5b1eac1876dd3414ac676aca810702e.png" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  <b>By the way</b> : not only the services of the ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù network have the ability to connect via the HTTPS protocol - the <a href="https://stats.i2p/">stats.i2p</a> service has the same opportunity. <br><br>  Currently, the Medium network's public key infrastructure has the ability to verify the status of a certificate using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol">OCSP</a> protocol or through the use of a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Revocation_List">CRL</a> . <br><br><h2>  "And you can sit down as a mathematician Bogatov?" </h2><br>  <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/">RosKomSvoboda</a> experts found no violations of the law in the activities of the decentralized Internet provider Medium. <br><br>  On Monday, we <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/medium/issues/17">consulted</a> with experts from the <a href="https://digitalrights.center/">Center for Digital Rights</a> (also known as <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/">RosKomSvoboda</a> ). <br><br>  As a result of the inspection, no violations of the law were revealed.  At the moment, we are actively cooperating with RosKomSvoboda and together we draw up an appeal to the Ministry of Communications. <br><br><h2>  Kindly requested </h2><br>  In the event that you have noticed problems with the availability of any of the services of the Medium network, do not write about it in the comments to the publication - instead <a href="https://github.com/medium-isp/medium/issues">open the ticket</a> in the repository on GitHub.  So service owners will be able to respond more quickly to the failure that has occurred. <br><br><h2>  Free Internet in Russia begins with you </h2><br>  You can provide all possible assistance to the establishment of a free Internet in Russia today.  We have compiled an exhaustive list of what exactly you can help the network: <br><br><ul><li>  Share your Medium network with your friends and colleagues.
