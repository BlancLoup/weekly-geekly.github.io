At the global level, the weighted and predictive legal regulation of the digital environment is becoming a significant competitive advantage of the state, allowing for the inflow of investments and the stability of economic growth.  In the Russian realities, with such intensive work of the State Duma on the adoption of new (and often raw) laws regulating relations in the digital space, it is difficult to understand not only entrepreneurs who are or are going to conduct any business online, but also lawyers who already have experience in advising and protecting the rights of their principals.  Without a doubt, for individual lawyers and specific law firms, knowledge of the legal characteristics of relationships in the digital environment becomes the key to their success and the prosperity of their business in modern conditions. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The difficulty in understanding digital law is that, due to the global nature of the Internet, online relations are not covered by only one national law, especially now when there is a tendency to balkanization and sovereignization of the global Internet.  Many services and websites, including those created in Russia, are focused not only on Russian users, but also on other markets where completely different rules may apply.  In addition to the laws of a particular country, the standards of ‚Äúsoft law‚Äù, UN recommendations, and case law of the ECHR and the European Court of Justice apply.  Among other things, lawyers in some cases also need to know and understand how GDPR, DMCA or CalOPPA work. </p><br><cut></cut><p>  In recent years, at the state level, Russia has been actively creating a whole range of activities designed to ‚Äútry on‚Äù jurisprudence and new technologies, as well as develop a balanced legal framework for digital development, prepare lawyers for work in the digital age.  Thus, in 2017, the Digital Economy <a href="http://static.government.ru/media/files/9gFM4FHj4PsB79I5v7yLVuPgu4bvR7M0.pdf">program</a> was adopted, at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum in 2018, Dmitry Medvedev <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/5206816">announced</a> plans to begin training Russian lawyers on the digital economy development program in 2019, but apart from loud statements, so far this work did not start. <br><br>  At the same time, in March 2019, the significant law ‚ÄúOn digital rights‚Äù was <a href="https://rg.ru/2019/03/20/a1667352-zifrovieprava-dok.html">adopted</a> . </p><br><p>  The law, of course, rather narrows the concept of ‚Äúdigital rights‚Äù in comparison with the international <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0">approach</a> , but, nevertheless, lays the foundations for civil relations in terms of the turnover of digital assets.

      Unfortunately, most lawyers still do not have adequate knowledge in the digital sphere, consider key new technologies, such as blockchains and big data, as something far from them and their daily work.  But this attitude already now leads to negative consequences for some representatives of the legal community and the whole society as a whole.  Someone loses clients, suffers financial losses, and the ‚Äúdigital ignorance‚Äù of lawyers endowed with authority and, in particular, representing the interests of society and Themis, does lead to large-scale depressing consequences in the form of errors in law enforcement.  After all, often even judges, especially when it comes to first-instance judges from remote regions, limit themselves to references to the lack of special regulation and either simply ignore new technologies, or generally recognize them as prohibited.  For example, it happened in a sensational <a href="https://digitalrights.center/blog/kriptovalyuta-i-sudebnaya-praktika-prosvetlenie/">case</a> of blocking cryptocurrency sites, where, according to the claim of the prosecutor's office, information on cryptocurrencies was declared banned in Russia.  And although in this case, lawyers of the Center for Digital Rights managed to defend the legality of the existence of cryptocurrency websites and recover costs from the prosecutor‚Äôs office for the mistake they had made, for this they had to go to the Supreme Court for many years. </p><br><p>  In such conditions, it is obvious that cyber law knowledge - the industry combining elements of public and private law, with special criminal proceeding knowledge of cybercrime and the technical features of networks, computers and new technologies, are becoming more and more in demand and necessary for every lawyer .  At the same time, now separate IP and IT master programs are available only for neophytes of jurisprudence.  Perhaps the only university in the country that provides at least some knowledge of digital law is the Higher School of Economics, and even then, as part of a master's program for first-time law students.  There is still MSU, which received the statute of the National Center for Digital Economy.  The Laboratory of Legal Informatics and Cybernetics was recently established here.  However, there are still no comprehensive programs for lawyers that would give extensive knowledge of modern cyber law.  and the opportunities to comprehensively improve their knowledge of cyber law for accomplished lawyers are virtually absent. </p><br><p>  In order to correct such a depressing situation and to facilitate the study of the intricacies of cyber right in the already established lawyers, we organized a unique program - the <a href="https://cyberlaw.center/">Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãRight School.</a>  <b>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãLaw School</b> is a <b>5-day intensive</b> digital law immersion <b>with 7 different modules</b> .  A comprehensive refresher course from leading experts in their field will allow already established lawyers to quickly dive into cyber law and gain in-depth knowledge of foreign and domestic legislation, as well as emerging law enforcement practice, in the following areas: </p><br><ul><li>  <strong>Intermediaries &amp; ISP:</strong> Features of information intermediaries (ISP, hosters, search engines, social networks, aggregators, etc.) </li></ul><br><ul><li>  <strong>IP &amp; Copyright &amp; Domains:</strong> Intellectual Rights on the Internet.

Also, on our course, it will be possible to get unique practical skills: leading law practitioners will not only share their experience with participants, but also analyze real business cases in detail, including those related to company compliance and the use of administrative coercive measures for non-fulfillment of obligations and non-compliance. regulatory restrictions in the digital environment, and teach the risk-based approach when working with bringing the company's activities in line with the current and rather complicated legislation </p><br>  In addition, as part of the course, lawyers will be able to learn how to use modern technological solutions that greatly simplify the work of lawyers, as well as gain invaluable skills in various aspects of digital law in criminal, civil and international courts. <br><br><p>  Such an integrated approach makes our <b>Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãLaw School</b> indispensable for all members of the legal community interested in digital law, in particular for in-house lawyers, lawyers, private lawyers, and consulting companies. </p><br><p>  In addition to valuable knowledge, at the end of the course, all persons who have completed full training will be issued a state certificate of advanced training in the field of digital law, as well as the opportunity to join the closed ‚ÄúCyber-Lawyers Club‚Äù, where they are always happy to share their experience and best practices. and also help in a difficult legal situation.
