Maybe something else?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends! <br><br>  I am writing this material in order to discuss the current situation with the public, as well as to hear the opinions and comments of users on various theses.  My opinion: we were simply not prepared for the fact that we will seriously filter something.  And what will happen tomorrow? <br><br><h4>  1. Attempts to ‚Äúfilter‚Äù content will increase </h4><br>  As you realize that prohibitive measures do not work very well (even if you don‚Äôt look at how many telecom operators are beginning to create chaos and ban sites), it‚Äôs obvious that you need to fight differently - you need to analyze traffic and calculate not only those who makes illegal content available, but also those who consume it.

        </script>
      <br>
      But traffic analysis, in my opinion, is a serious problem on the way to freedom of information distribution.  Especially in Russia. <br><br>  <b>On the other hand, are we ready to ensure that site visitors become anonymous?</b> <br><br><h4>  2. Today there are no normal ways to resist filtering. </h4><br>  Unfortunately, I know only 2 projects that provide a more or less stable and usable bypass system of filtering attempts: this is Tor and I2P.  But more about each. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Tor</b> <br>  A wonderful solution that even has the ability to work as a single assembly (all the necessary software in one bottle), and also allows the owner of almost any site to quickly make his site anonymous (Hidden Services) quickly enough. <br><br>  However, Tor is not decentralized.  And this is a problem, because if you deny or restrict access to servers that store the list of available nodes, the system crashes.  Of course, you can use a network bridge, but again - there is no decentralization that we would like. <br><br>  <b>I2p</b> <br>  To put it mildly, a solution that is very far from normal use.  The installation can still be understood by the mere mortal, but its use is extremely far from simple. <br><br>  And most importantly - also not a completely decentralized solution - when you first start the list of nodes, it is also pulled out from the regular Internet, the addresses of these servers are written and known.  What is it worth blocking them? <br><br>  <b>And really everything?</b>  <b>Is there nothing more?</b> <br><br><h4>  3. No imputed addressing system </h4><br>  Tor - here the site address will look like this: 6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion, the name will be automatically generated from the public key of the server.  Everything is good, but remember this address is quite difficult.  The advantages include the fact that cybersquatting is impossible.  Do I need?  :) <br><br>  I2P - there really is no addressing system at all.  It seems like there is a top-level domain, .i2p, but each user can decide for himself what will open at what address, and the lack of unity in this case is bad. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158303/">An interesting idea DIANNA</a> - but I do not understand this and can not understand how the address will look like :( <b>I would like comments from experts.</b> <br><br><h4>  4. The browser manufacturer can help the user. </h4><br>  It is logical that expecting a user to download an application that will allow him to ‚Äúsee the forbidden‚Äù is somewhat naive.  First, the user generally needs to know that his access to the Internet is being filtered, and then also to figure out what to do with it.  And if it goes on like this, then the sites that help to get access to blocked sites will also be on a par with the lawbreakers. <br><br>  But if you embed this function in the browser, it becomes much easier.  But it is hard for me to believe that, for example, Yandex will integrate this functionality into its browser.  <b>Perhaps the use of Chromium to release a browser with support for anonymous networks by the public seems to suggest?</b> <br><br><h4>  5. You need some solution that will help existing sites and systems to quickly migrate to an anonymous network. </h4><br>  Conveniently now what Tor provides - setting up a Hidden Service is done on the same Ubuntu into several teams, but it is clear that this is not yet a mass decision. <br><br>  <b>It begs the need to support anonymous networks in Apache, nginx and other web servers?</b> <br><br><blockquote>  I will be extremely grateful if someone from the users tells and points to possible projects / technologies in this area that I missed. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158785/</a></p>
