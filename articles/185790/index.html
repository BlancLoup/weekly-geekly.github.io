It was March 31st.  On April 27, I was notified that my problem was solved, but now the scroll does not work.  I decided to wait until repaired.  June 1, she returned to me, with the same faulty scrolling. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I called Logitech, where I was delighted with the news that I would replace the mouse with such a malfunction, I just need to fulfill a few simple conditions: <br><br><blockquote>  Alexander, we will replace your device with you under warranty, upon provision by you: <br><br>  1. scan or photo of the document confirming the purchase (or official copy) <br>  1.a - scan or photo of warranty card <br><br>  2. A photograph of your device on top, on a piece of paper with the handwritten number of your address written on it 130603-002919; <br><br>  3. a photo of your device with readable serial numbers (P / N, M / N, PID) <br><br>  4. Photograph of the device in the water tank: <br>  - turn on the device, <br>  - remove the battery cover, <br>  - leave the battery in the device (if you use your own batteries - insert the original ones that came with the kit) <br>  - type in any, preferably transparent, water capacity <br>  - On a sheet of paper write the number of your appeal 130603-002919 <br>  - put a sheet with a handwritten reference number next to the container <br>  - put the device in a container with water <br>  - take a picture <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/664/430/5ba/6644305ba9367ebfbf6f28dbf8cd69d8.jpg"><br><br>  Also reply to this email with your zip code and telephone number.  However, we can send replacement only to certain cities of Russia (http://www.ups.com/content/ru/ru/shipping/dropoff/index.html?WT.svl=PNRO_L1) / Ukraine ( <a href="http://www.ups.com/content/ua/en/shipping/dropoff/index.html%3FWT.svl%3DPNRO_L1">www.ups.com/ content / ua / en / shipping / dropoff / index.html? WT.svl = PNRO_L1</a> ).  If you do not live in one of these cities, please send us the contact details of your authorized representative in one of these cities (name, surname, address, including postal code, telephone number). </blockquote><br><br>  I worried about the day.  And at lunchtime the next day, my mouse was already dead.  Died 5 minutes, shining indicators. <br><br>  After sending photos and scans to Logitech, I received a letter promising that the warranty department would review my files within 24 hours and within 48 hours I would receive a tracking number.  I was also informed that it was not necessary to send the defective device back, but they strongly recommend keeping it until a replacement is received. <br><br>  Tracking came on Friday at 9 pm, I received the mouse after 4 days, on Tuesday.  I was waiting for a pleasant surprise.  As it turned out, my mouse was discontinued and a new, more advanced model was sent to me: G700s RECHARGEABLE GAMING MOUSE. <br><br>  The warranty on the new device is 3 years old, starting with the start of the incident in support. <br><br>  And here is the device with the box (it was not the same as the old model): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/82c/a6f/198/82ca6f198fc1b7f34c0f90f9feb506d5.jpg"><br><br>  I thank the readers for their attention to the topic, I wish you good luck in using Logitech devices and would like to discuss with you similar cases to me. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  According to the experience of many people faced with the failures of service centers and outright hack (I, for example, broke the scroll wheel), I recommend immediately calling the Russian support by phone +7 495 641 3460. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185790/</a></p>
