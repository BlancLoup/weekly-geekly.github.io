    <h2>  Google Underwater Empire </h2><br>  Over the past three years, Google has <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/expanding-our-global-infrastructure-new-regions-and-subsea-cables/">spent</a> $ 30 billion on the development of its infrastructure.  This amount included the laying of underwater cables. <br><br>  For Google, it all started in 2008, when the corporation became the first private technology company to <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/02/about-unity-bandwidth-consortium.html">invest</a> its own funds in the construction of the underwater infrastructure.  Google has become part of a consortium working on the Unity cable system, along with five telecommunications companies. <br><br>  The goal of Unity <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2008/02/global-consortium-to-construct-new_26.html">was</a> to link the USA and Asia across the Pacific Ocean and increase the capacity on this route by 20%.  Later, Unity in the Asia-Pacific region was <a href="https://www.submarinenetworks.com/systems/intra-asia/sjc/sjc-cable-ready-for-service">joined by</a> an SJC cable.  It was laid on the route between Asia and the United States again in a consortium with telecommunications companies. <br><br>  And this January <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a15173083/google-is-about-to-build-its-own-undersea-internet-cables/">it became known</a> immediately about three new cable projects by Google - Curie, Havfrue, HK-G.  Havfrue is a joint project with Facebook.  The cable will connect the United States with Denmark and Ireland with an additional channel.  HK-G will connect Hong Kong and Guam and will be built with the participation of telecom companies. <br><br>  Curie has become a unique project - Google implements it on its own.  This cable system <a href="https://www.oceannews.com/news/communication/curie-cable-to-connect-california-and-chile">connects</a> Los Angeles and Chile.  Curie will be the first submarine cable owned by a private technology company and the first to reach Chile in the last 20 years. <br><br>  And now came the turn of the first private transatlantic cable - Dunant, as well as Curie, named after the Nobel Prize winner.  With it, Google is going to expand its cloud infrastructure on "one of the busiest routes." <br><br>  Dunant <a href="http://www.te.com/usa-en/about-te/news-center/subcom-dunant-cable-system-google-071618.html">will be built</a> in partnership with the supplier of submarine communications systems TE SubCom.  The length of the cable system will be more than 6.4 thousand km. <br><br><h2>  Who else is laying private cables </h2><br>  Today, many IT enterprises decide to build an ‚Äúunderwater‚Äù infrastructure on their own, rather than ‚Äúrenting‚Äù cables from telecommunications operators. <br><br>  Last year, Microsoft, Facebook and Telxius jointly <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/338622/">completed work</a> on laying a 160-terabit Marea from Virginia to Spain. <br><br>  In 2016, Amazon <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/05/13/amazons-cloud-arm-makes-first-big-submarine-cable-investment">made</a> its first investment in the submarine cable system.  The Hawaiki cable, <a href="https://www.computerworld.com.au/article/644105/hawaiki-cable-comes-into-service/">launched</a> this month, connected the United States, Australia and New Zealand.  Another cable project in which Amazon is involved is Jupiter.  The partners of the corporation <a href="https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/amazon-facebook-and-softbank-to-build-new-14k-submarine-cable-system">are</a> Facebook and SoftBank.  He will connect Asia and North America. <br><br>  Total technology companies today are <a href="https://blog.telegeography.com/telegeographys-content-providers-submarine-cable-holdings-list">laying</a> or have already laid more than 20 cable systems. <br><br><h2>  What does laying private cables give to IT companies? </h2><br>  An important role in the new infrastructure trend is played by cloud technologies.  At Google and other providers, cloud services are <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloud-computing-now-google-adds-more-data-centers-and-plans-its-own-undersea-cable/">distributed</a> by geographical regions, which, in turn, are divided into zones with reference to the nearest data centers.  Cables connect data centers with new regions and allow customers to access cloud services in them. <br><br>  And the laying of submarine cables on their own, although costly, gives companies greater freedom.  Here's how this freedom intend to dispose of Google: <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-cloud/expanding-our-global-infrastructure-new-regions-and-subsea-cables/">Laying a</a> private cable allows you to control the design and construction process, independently determine technical specifications and implement the project faster. </li><li>  Google already has information about the needs of its customers - in which countries they have difficulty with the work of cloud services, and in which - no.  Working on their own cables, the company can choose where to lay the new connection first. </li><li>  Cables have a limited service life - from 15 to 25 years.  A corporation can take this into account and give its guarantees to partners, and they, in turn, have the opportunity to build long-term business plans. </li></ol><br>  To summarize, its own underwater infrastructure gives large IT companies the opportunity to ‚Äúopen up‚Äù new markets for themselves and fully control the infrastructure at all stages: from design and construction to installation and operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/0j/m4/jo0jm4cj4ur4xhx1ym2t10knxws.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/torkildr/3463419826/">Torkild Retvedt</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  What are the benefits of private cabling for IT companies for users? </h2><br>  Cable routing <a href="https://www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/3988/trans-atlantic-network-latency-reduced">affects</a> <a href="https://habr.com/company/it-grad/blog/312038/">data transfer latency</a> .  IT companies aim to reduce waiting times and increase the speed and availability of services for customers.  From this we can conclude that they choose the best routes for their cable systems. <br><br>  The new Google Dunant cable is building up for the same reasons.  Cables <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/features/microsoft-facebook-telxius-complete-highest-capacity-subsea-cable-cross-atlantic/">transmit</a> 55% more data on the transatlantic route than on the Pacific.  Judging by these figures and the <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/public-cloud-europe-brexit/">growing popularity of</a> cloud services in Europe, this really ‚Äúbusy‚Äù channel required additional capacity. <br><br>  In some regions of the world, intermittent interruptions occur periodically due to physical damage to submarine cables.  This year it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/8/17207556/submarine-internet-cable-mauritania-broken">happened</a> off the coast of West Africa.  Problems with Internet access then experienced residents of several countries.  Additional cables insure against complete communication breakdown in such situations and provide users with uninterrupted access to cloud services even in case of emergencies. <br><br>  In fact, both operators and users of the infrastructure benefit from the laying of private submarine cables.  Some discover new markets for themselves, while others gain access to new services with low latency rates. <br><br>  In the future, IT companies are likely to continue to work on laying their own underwater infrastructure, which could completely change the market.  Julian Rawle, a specialist in the field of laying submarine cables, even <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2017/10/07/tech-giants-are-building-their-own-undersea-fibre-optic-networks">predicts</a> that because of this trend, for 20 years, telecommunication companies may cease to act as providers of network infrastructure. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS What else do we write in the First blog about corporate IaaS:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/resheniya/vcloud-director-kak-sozdat-bezopasnoe-podklyuchenie-mezhdu-dvumya-organizaciyami/">vCloud Director: how to create a secure connection between two organizations</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/seti/raspredelennyj-brandmauer-v-vcloud-director-8-20-osobennosti-resheniya/">Distributed firewall in vCloud Director 8.20: solution features</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/chto_skryvaetsa_za_terminom_vcloud_director_vzglyad_isnutri/">What is behind the term vCloud Director - an inside view</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  <i>The main direction of our activity is the provision of cloud services:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/iaas-vmware-virtual-infrastructure/">Virtual Infrastructure (IaaS)</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/pci-dss/">PCI DSS Hosting</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/iaas/fz-152/">Cloud FZ-152</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://www.it-grad.ru/services/1c/">Rent 1C in the cloud</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417835/</a></p>
