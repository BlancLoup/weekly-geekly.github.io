These licenses are absolutely free for all users of the former free 3CX edition, which was called PBX Edition. <br><br>  New Standard free license offers unlimited SIP trunks (external lines) and extensions (users), 25 simultaneous web conferencing participants and free hosting on Google Cloud!  All current PBX Edition licenses (with an active subscription to updates, ie, not expired) will be automatically converted into annual licenses Standard, 16 simultaneous calls. <br><br>  The number of simultaneous participants of the built-in <a href="https://www.3cx.ru/web-conferencing/">web conferencing system 3CX WebMeeting has</a> also been increased: up to 25 participants in the Standard, up to 100 participants in the PRO, and up to 250 in the Enterprise.

At the moment, it is impossible to promise anything. <br><br>  <b>What does "out-of-box TLS support" mean?</b> <br><br>  This means that when using the FQDN from 3CX, a security certificate will already be installed on the system.  You just need to manually configure the phones for SIP communication over TLS.  However, if you are ready to wait for Update 4, the automatic work on TLS will already be implemented in the IP phone auto configuration templates (at the moment we expect the phone vendors to be ready for the firmware). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/2da/da9/7a02dada9a857058b18e8dde95eb4450.png"><br><br>  <b>What are the important limitations of the Standard version?</b> <br><br>  The FQDN of the 3CX server name in the Standard version is issued only by 3CX, i.e.  own domains are not allowed.  However, if at the time of updating to Update 3, the user has already used his own FQDN, he will continue to use it.  But as soon as the user unplugs this FQDN from his license key, in the future he will be able to use only the FQDN from 3CX. <br><br>  SMTP server for sending e-mail notifications only from 3CX.  However, if at the time of the update to Update 3, the user has already used his own SMTP, he will continue to use it.  But as soon as the user changes his SMTP to SMTP 3CX, he will receive a corresponding warning, and then he will not be able to go back. <br><br>  <b>Therefore, if you need maximum flexibility and independence, use the Pro edition.</b> <br><br>  <b>What do partners who earn from hosting 3CX instances do?</b> <br><br>  The main recommendation is for partners who want to sell their hosting for 3CX and their domain name, i.e.  offer a kind of ‚Äúbranding‚Äù - focus on offering Pro (or Enterprise), as the most flexible and functional edition.  And for future sales of the annual subscription to the Standard licenses ( <a href="https://www.3cx.com/2018-pricing/">versions for 8 and 16 calls are free only for the first year</a> ), offer a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/3cx/blog/339072/">special link to download 3CX</a> , indicating in it your partner ID.  At the same time, a free license is immediately assigned to a partner, and points are awarded to it! <br><br>  <b>What happens to my current commercial license Standard?</b> <br><br>  Absolutely nothing, all the conditions will remain the same.  In addition to the FQDN and SMTP server (and only if you decide to change these services to services from 3CX, as mentioned above). <br><br>  <b>What happens to unpaid annual licenses?</b> <br><br>  Annual licenses of any edition and capacity no longer ‚Äúrun out‚Äù.  In the first 30 days after the expiration of the license, the 3CX marketing department and (we hope so!) The 3CX partner will notify the user of the need for renewal.  If there is no extension, by 31 days any annual license automatically turns into a Standard Standard license for 4 simultaneous calls.  The ‚Äúend‚Äù date of the license is set on December 31, 2018. <br><br>  <b>How exactly are current free licenses replaced?</b> <br><br>  If your subscription to updates is still active (for free licenses it is active the first year after the key is activated), your PBX Edition license will ‚Äútransform‚Äù into an annual license of 16 Standard.  At the same time, the subscription expiration date will not change.  After the end of the subscription (and in the case of non-payment), the license ‚Äúwill turn‚Äù into an annual Standard 4 one.  call and continue to be free. <br><br>  If your subscription to updates has already ended, your PBX Edition license will ‚Äútransform‚Äù into an annual Standard 4 one.  call and continue to be free.  The end date of the subscription is set on 12/31/2018. <br><br>  <b>Example: comparison of the old free and new free edition of 3CX</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúOld‚Äù free license (8SC PBX Edition). <br>  After activating the license key, you received 8 simultaneous calls, 1 SIP trunk and a subscription to updates for 1 year.  If you did not renew your subscription after one year (95 euro), you still had the same 8 calls, but the FQDN, SMTP and WebMeeting from 3CX were disconnected. <br><br>  "New" free license (16SC Standard). <br>  After activating the license key, you receive 16 simultaneous calls with no restrictions on SIP trunks ( <a href="https://www.3cx.ru/ip-pbx/edition-comparison/">and other restrictions, except for the features of the Pro edition</a> ).  If you do not renew your subscription for updates, the system will ‚Äúdecrease‚Äù to 4 simultaneous calls, but it will remain free of charge, including FQDN, SMTP and WebMeeting for 25 participants from 3CX. <br><br>  <b>How can I find out more?</b> <br><br>  Just ‚Äúcome‚Äù to our <a href="https://www.3cx.com/blog/event-trainings/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C-%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-3%25D1%2581%25D1%2585-2018-02-14/">online presentation</a> dedicated to the release of 3CX v15.5 Update 3. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348844/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348844/</a></p>
