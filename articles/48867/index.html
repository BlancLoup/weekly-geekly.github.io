Now it has become a whole combine with its own email client, RSS reader, torrent rocking chair and a bunch of other functions.  It would seem that even for happiness is necessary, because everything is already there?  But I do not think so.  I will try to describe all the flaws of this, however, the wonderful browser that I lack in it and compare it with other browser options.  Of course, I do not want to impose my ideas on anyone, but I hope that they will seem interesting to someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  disadvantages </h3><br>  First I would like to point out a few common flaws, not comparing with any other browsers. <br><br>  <b>1. Functional overload</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

        </script>
      <br>
      In addition to the main function of the WEB page <b>viewer,</b> Opera <b>Browser is</b> equipped with the following functions: <br><ul><li>  Opera Mail Mail / News Client </li><li>  The address book </li><li>  BitTorrent Peering Client * </li><li>  RSS * aggregator </li><li>  IRC client </li><li>  Widgets are graphic modules based on HTML technology and working outside the browser window. </li></ul><br>  Features such as Opera Link, download manager, bookmarks make working with the primary responsibility of the browser more enjoyable and fast, so their presence, of course, cannot be challenged.  But the abolition of these 6 functions could reduce the launch speed of the Opera by several times, and the packet size would decrease by four to five megabytes.  Moreover, the open tab with the WEB mail interface may well replace the mail client.  The address book is in almost any OS in the standard set.  An IRC client is generally not clear what is doing here (to me personally).  Widgets in the form in which they are now generally not clear why they are needed. <br>  I have marked the BitTorrent client and the aggregator with an asterisk because I fully admit that 40-50 percent of Opera users use these features, unlike me, so their presence is probably correct. <br>  At best, it would be great if these 6 functions were installed with one touch of a button and removed in the same way as an extension, then everyone would be fine.  And most importantly, it would be logical, because the email client is an extension for the browser. <br><br>  Now compare with the <b>FireFox</b> browser: <br><br>  <b>2. It is difficult to contribute to the development of the browser</b> <br><br>  I am sure that if the ‚ÄúFire Fox‚Äù would not have the opportunity to expand due to user-created plugins ( <i>sorry for the tautology</i> ), it would not be so popular.  Opera understood this and created widgets, but they cannot be compared with the capabilities of the FireFox extensions.  That FireFox, that Opera are free products, so community support is very important, even if they earn quite a bit from advertising.  Anyone can enhance the Mozill browser by writing an extension, but what should be done to help Opera?  Only offer your ideas to real developers, and this makes them dependent on these developers, which is in itself bad. <br><br>  And if you look at <b>Google Chrome</b> : <br><br>  <b>3. Failure</b> <br><br>  Perhaps a children's item, but nonetheless important.  The concept of a good interface does not stand still, there is always someone who says: "But this would be more convenient than before."  But Opera is already 10 years old ( <i>not sure that 10, but still long</i> ) has the same interface with the menus at the top, the status bar at the bottom and the downloads as a separate tab.  For example, the interface of Chrome is much better than that of Opera in terms of use: everything is clear, there is nothing superfluous, a nice design - it's nice to even look. <br><br>  What about <b>Internet Expoler?</b>  : <br><br>  <b>4. Only 5 letters in the title</b> <br><br>  Internet Expoler - 15 letters, and in the Opera only 5. This is the only flaw in Opera compared to IE, which I discovered. <br><br><h3>  Benefits </h3><br>  Below, I described several functions of the Opera, which are the key arguments to the question: ‚ÄúWhy Opera?‚Äù.  I do not in any way claim that all these features are only in Opera, but it is in this browser that everything is available right away and it is easy and simple to use it. <br><br>  <b>1. Synchronization of bookmarks and not only</b> <br>  Perhaps this is the most important function in my choice of browser.  I have two computers and each has two operating systems, so this feature is very relevant for me.  It seems to me that only because of her one, you can already think about switching to Opera from other browsers.  And also, the fact that I can edit the browser bookmarks on my phone on my computer is very pleasant, that is, when I search for some interesting article, I can add this page to the phone‚Äôs bookmark and while I am traveling in a minibus or subway, read it.  Thanks to Opera for this feature! <br><br>  <b>2. High speed</b> <br>  Such small moments as quick transition between tabs, quick application of all settings, fast loading of pages, etc.  can not please the user.  Here, even without further ado, everything is clear. <br><br>  <b>3. Express panel (Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDial)</b> <br>  Opera is the first browser to add this beauty.  Unlike Firefox, where this feature is available as an extension, this panel is implemented very well.  Now almost all of the most popular browsers, with the exception of Safari, use this part of fast navigation between sites. <br><br>  <b>4. Working Ctrl + Z</b> <br>  Maybe a trifle, but I like it very much and I often use it and I can not understand why it does not work in other browsers. <br><br>  <b>5. Blocking site content</b> <br>  In the browser from Mozilla, this function is implemented using the AdBlock + extension like.  Here you do not need to install anything and everything works, as they say, out of the box.  But how easy it is to use!  I advise no one to ignore this feature. <br><br><h3>  If it were, I would be happy! </h3><br>  Well, now the main part of my little article, which is why I started this scribbling.  Maybe Opera Software employees will hear me, especially since there are several representatives on Habr√©. <br><br>  <b>1. ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù address entry line</b> <br>  By this phrase, I mean the following: if at the beginning of the text the user does not write http, ftp or the address is entered not in English, then try to search for this text in Google and if the required information matches the site issued by Google, then automatically go to this site.  This is implemented in FireFox and very well.  In the opera, it is necessary to write the letter ‚Äúg‚Äù before the text, but if I write the text in Russian, then I will have to switch the layout, add the letter g, and then switch the layout again and then only write. <br><br>  <b>2. Create a bookmark without any questions</b> <br>  A bit annoying is the dialog that appears after clicking on the action ‚ÄúCreate a bookmark‚Äù.  It distracts me from the content of the page, which I really liked.  And, because you can implement it as follows: if the user has created a tab for a page that already exists in the browser tabs, then simply move this tab to the very top.  Thus, the user will receive what he expects and there will be no unnecessary questions.  And if he needs to distribute the bookmarks, he will go into the manager and do everything at one time, because it is faster than doing each bookmark separately. <br><br>  <b>3. Built-in Twitter client</b> <br>  I really miss this, or rather not enough notifications that I would like to see every X minutes about new tweets.  Actually, there is nothing more to write here ... I don‚Äôt like to go to the tab with Twitter, when I‚Äôll remember about it and update the page. <br><br>  <b>4. Downloads separately from the browser</b> <br>  I would like to see this function like this: when the browser is launched, it is advisable to leave it as it is now, but if the download goes, and the user clicks ‚Äúexit‚Äù, then not to warn him about the download termination, but to make the download as a separate dialog, as is done in FireFox .  Especially when there is a built-in BitTorrent client, when large files can be downloaded. <br><br>  <b>5. Simplified interface</b> <br>  I never use the top panel with a lot of menus, except sometimes I have to choose an encoding or enter settings.  But she always distracts me from the names of the tabs on them.  A good example of a good interface: Google Chrome, as I wrote above.  I understand that such things as ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù or ‚Äúinterfering‚Äù are second-hand sensations and even hardly noticeable, but this is only because we have become accustomed to using a bad interface.  And the general impression from the use of the program is made up of small bricks, with which such things are. <br><br>  <b>6. The common for all OS file saving dialog</b> <br>  I noticed this feature: in Gnome, Opera uses the system dialog, in KDE3 / KDE4 its own, but very simple and inconvenient, and in Windows I honestly don‚Äôt remember, but it seems to be my own too.  I would like to see either the same for all systems, but with a very user-friendly interface (with bookmarks), or a system dialog, but not only in Gnome. <br><br>  For those who are interested in how my Opera looks now on a laptop (I tried to simplify as much as possible): <br> <a href="" title="Opera on Laptop"><img src="http://smages.com/t/bb/a1/bba19ec0e2cbebe7b4aeb83f79cf691f.jpg"></a> <br><br>  So far these are all the thoughts that came to my mind.  If you have any ideas and what you lack in the Opera - write in the comments, and I will add.  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <i>Used materials from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera">Wikipedia</a></i> <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48867/</a></p>
