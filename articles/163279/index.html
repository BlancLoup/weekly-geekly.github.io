  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication restoration after flood in Krymsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> We learned about the flood in the middle of the night from an engineer who monitors monitoring.  The base stations, one after another, showed at once a cascade of accidents (almost all sensors worked), and then completely left the network.  A little later, the technical service began to receive news about the flood itself, two engineers left Novorossiysk for the place, as they were the closest, and one of them had parents there. <br><br>  The city at that time was closed for entry: they promised to let in the evening.  One of our engineers made his way to the city for dinner (he hurried to his parents), and after he was convinced that everything was in order with his family - they actually flooded the apartment under the ceiling, but there were no casualties - he began to drive around the base stations and report what happened to them.  It was possible to approach only a few, there was still water around the others and it was only possible to understand that they were completely flooded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af8/1ea/57e/af81ea57edc06a6d600d257767afe9cd.jpg"><br>  <i>This is what the city looked like when we arrived - and the farther we went, the more destruction we saw.</i> <a name="habracut"></a>

      At different points in time, several base stations did not work at once: several sites simply flooded the roof, some of the power was cut off, and they switched to batteries, and then they switched off.  Three sites are completely out of order and, what is most unpleasant, two of them are transit sites, that is, those on which the work of other base stations depended.  The remaining part of the network was under a huge overload due to the exhaustion of the channel capacity - there was a huge peak of attempts to reach the city and from the city. <br><br>  By the time we were allowed into the city, the water had already gone.  Judging by the tracks on the buildings, it rose in places up to 3 meters.  Half of the city was flooded so that it was just impossible to drive.  Chaos as such was no longer there, many who were sitting at home, guarding them.  The bodies have already taken out.  There was no light in the city, because of the accidents at the stations, the power supply was cut off.  There were a lot of cars on the road. <br><br>  At the time we started work, we had 4 off-road vehicles, each with a ready-made and fully loaded generator, plus a 12-hour supply of fuel, tools and equipment for work.  In each car - two people.  The equipment was pre-packaged according to the information from the monitoring and the engineer on-site; complete assembly and loading took several hours. <br><br>  Our main task was to restore communication.  From evening to six in the morning we ‚Äúlifted‚Äù all the base stations except one into the network, it was restored for dinner.  When the water allowed us to approach the building with the equipment, we began the restoration.  Where the problem was only in the diet - they brought (or dragged on their hands) generators.  They worked for 4 hours, they cooled down for an hour, and the station at that time used batteries. <br><br>  The first was the transit BS that was brought back into the network by two more non-submerged stations to which the generators had already driven, then they took up the rest. <br><br>  At the three flooded stations it was necessary to fully deploy new equipment.  We disconnected the old blocks, put in advance the new ones brought in (they were unified for the entire network) and passed through the temporary wiring to the transmitting equipment (antennas).  All wiring and all flooded equipment immediately went on write-off.  Where the water only touched - later it was taken to the technical site.  It was possible to fix only a few units of iron. <br><br>  We worked in the dark with lanterns; there was a lot of dirt and silt in the rooms. <br><br>  Given that the base station premises were fully or partially damaged, it was necessary to protect the equipment (vandalism was noticed in the city).  At each station, at least one person was on duty (remember, the radiation from the equipment under the antenna itself and through the material allows you to be in the BS room for at least a year - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/132169/">here are the details</a> ). <br><br>  When it dawned, it was necessary to get to the second transit hub, but in the evening there was water along the headlights of the Ford Ranger (the tallest car of ours).  In the morning, the level was asleep, and in a roundabout way we managed to get to the BS container.  The water at the station itself was waist-high, I had to swim.  At the entrance, there was a blockage, raked it, entered, estimated the damage, dragged iron on hands (fortunately, the containers are mounted on a high foundation, so half of the equipment remained intact).  While throwing new wiring and winding up a generator, at the same time they threw up the mud and somehow washed the floors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28d/4a1/6f5/28d4a16f599670134a452dca6fd090e3.jpg"><br>  <i>We carry equipment in the morning.</i> <br><br>  All recoverable stations immediately expanded to the maximum configuration in order to allow communication to the maximum number of people.  For about a day, the channel capacity was clogged, after which the connection was restored in a relatively normal mode. <br><br>  Technical roaming operated on the territory of Kuban - our network picked up all the calls of those people who could not get access to the network of their operator (this scheme is used when calling an emergency service not on their network, for example).  Later, the other team helped raise 8 offices and recharge mobile phones of all those who came.  They distributed free account replenishment cards in the city (in our offices and in the offices of the Red Cross), and there were telephones in the offices where you could call to any place in Russia and the CIS for free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/508/983/38c/50898338c7e9c650c721f972eaee282b.jpg"><br>  <i>This is how time points looked for free calls - right on the street, they took the existing promotional stands instead of tables and threw the cable from the generator to charge the phones.</i> <br><br>  In normal mode, everything worked only after a week: the rooms were restored, new cooling systems were installed. <br><br>  In general, this is not the first accident we are leaving for.  We also had cases of base stations being flooded, and a lot more - the restoration work itself was done clearly and very professionally, despite the scale.  I can not fail to mention the people with whom we worked.  They are Yuri Plaksa, Alexander Kostin, Nikolai Krot, Vyacheslav Kuralesov, Sergey Smirnov, Alexander Bakholdin, Artem Blinnik, Yevgeny Vozhakov, Kirill Abyzov, Anton Chertogov, Yevgeny Yuryev, Andrei Nesterov, Igor Tucha, Dmitry Karpenko, Semyon Zuev, Gennady Chernykh, Vyacheslav Tikhonov, Igor Gorbenko, Alexey Borisov, Vladislav Kozhin, Vladimir Koltovskoy, Inessa Skobeleva, Natalia Stishenko, Dmitry Mikhalin, Sergey Suslov - our team, those who traveled to the city and those who worked on the restoration with us in the group remotely.  Another team involved in the campaigns in the city described above are Alexander Bugayevsky, Zori Vardanyan, Vera Vorotnikova, Victoria Egorova, Valery Zaytsev, Ivan Knyshev, Alexander Kryukov, Sergey Morozov, Dmitry Musayev, Alexander Ovchinnikov, Olga Polyakova, Dmitry Rudykh, Ismail Saduki, Andrei Talalay, Dmitry Chuprina and Oleg Khitrov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163279/</a></p>
