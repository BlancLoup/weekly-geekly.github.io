  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Survival Report (Episode II)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/survival/42382/">last episode</a> <i>(the link is available only to subscribers of the blog "Survival")</i> , an account was given of the first visit of people to nature without food and shelter.  The goal of the departure was to more accurately model and accumulate experience for the next survival.  Despite the extreme desire to participate in the second episode, circumstances did not allow very many to accomplish this.  Among those who participated in the first stage, only I went to the second.  Besides me there were two new people.  Total three. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The season is autumn.  Place - Tsimlyanskoe reservoir (north of the Rostov region).  This time there were no restrictions on equipment and clothing.  We wanted to test the usefulness of some items in the conditions of extreme minimalism.  We were dressed so as not to freeze in the afternoon.  In principle, we would have survived in pure summer clothes, but then we would spend more time on preserving heat and conducted fewer experiments.  And, by and large, a person who has fallen into the conditions of survival is likely to be dressed for the season.  The emphasis in this departure was aimed at creating a shelter / dwelling, and for this purpose we took a few pieces of polyethylene.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan overnight stay in a hammock was subject to verification.  I also wanted to check the possibility of creating dishes from clay.  Well, of course, it was necessary to make fire in different ways. <br><br>  Having reached the place, we began to think and build a house.  Chopped reeds for bedding.  Imposed ropes.  It turned out something like this: <br><img src="http://hotimg15.fotki.com/a/87_117/12_113/IMG_5681_600.jpg"><br>  In the fall, it is very cold at night in this area, and a damp, cold wind is blowing, so this made it possible to adequately assess the effectiveness of the shelter. <br><br>  Then we began to make a fire, it was sunny, and I took the lens.  I should note that, unlike summer, I did not manage to make a fire in the fall.  I tried everything that could be found dry, but high humidity did not allow inflating the resulting corruption before the formation of a flame.  I immediately refused to attempt to make a fire with thorns, for reasons known from the last article.  Next came our favorite flint.  With it, natural raw materials did not burn either: just the nascent light quickly extinguished, but I managed to set fire to the cigarette pack I found.  As I understood it later - cold tinder is as hard to ignite as it is raw.  If the tinder is cold, then all the energy of the nascent flame goes to heat and dissipates on it.  But the tinder can be dried and heated on itself, and best of all under the cap, for the head is the warmest place of a person and has the highest heat transfer.  It emits about <strong>40% of the</strong> total heat radiated by man.  So Suvorov was wrong, saying - "Keep your feet warm and your head cold."  Everything should be warm.

      We lit a bonfire right in front of the entrance to the ‚Äúdwelling‚Äù, because  He was supposed to heat us up at night.  Stored firewood and all went to bed together.  Woke up about an hour from the cold.  The dwelling turned out to be ineffective: the wind was blowing inwards, the fire outside did not warm us inside.  We divided the polyethylene equally and disassembled the litter of reeds into individual floor mats, sprawled around the fire, wrapped in polyethylene.  Woke up about an hour from the cold.  The fire went out.  They threw firewood into the fire and went to bed again.  Woke up about an hour from the cold.  The fire went out.  They threw firewood into the fire and went to bed again.  And so on until the morning.  In addition, at night the firewood ran out unexpectedly, and we, in the light of stars only, walked into a dark forest for firewood.  Unforgettable feeling. <br><br>  In the morning we approved the idea with individual wrapping in polyethylene.  It does not let out warm air, but allows heat of a fire to get inside.  In case of rain, it will also not let you get wet.  The only inconvenience is that from time to time it is necessary to change the side turned towards the fire, for the part where there is no fire freezes over time.  However, if you competently wrap up and leave enough space under the polyethylene in the opposite part of the fire, then convection will keep the heat longer.  We were a little exhausted by the constant awakenings to keep the fire going.  I proposed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãduty, when people take turns watching the fire, but I did not find support for this idea today. <br><br>  All day we idly wandered around and collected all that could be eaten.  The main of our dishes have become a huge mussel. <br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/87_117/12_113/IMG_5689_small.jpg"><br>  We caught them in Tsimlyansky vdkhr.  When accustomed to - they were prepared in the fastest and easiest way: they threw everything directly into the fire and controlled the roasting.  It is worth noting that in mussels, only the muscle that closes the sash is 100% edible.  The rest can also be eaten, but it is at your own peril and risk.  Do not forget also about snakes and frogs. <br><br>  About pottery.  I tried to make a clay mug.  The main difficulty here is not the modeling itself, but proper drying.  To dry the clay you need a little heat and for a long time.  I have eagerly burst dishes because of the intense heat.  Something sensible I did not work out. <br><br>  In the evening I hung a hammock near the fire, and we went to bed again.  Hammock well covered the bottom of the wind.  From above, I was covered with polyethylene.  The warmth of the fire passed through the hammock, and one of its sides was very warm and pleasant.  But the other was quite cold, so I had to spin.  Like last night, we occasionally woke up because of the extinct fire and kindled it anew. <br><br>  <strong>Findings:</strong> <br><br>  It was impossible to create a shelter out of polyethylene, so that it could be heated with a fire.  Instead, a good individual overnight stay was obtained in polyethylene by the fire. <br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ Polyethylene</strong> is an excellent item for survival.  Recommend. <br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ Several small bonfires are better than one big one.</strong>  Such assertions are often found in the literature on survival, but they are largely ignored.  I responsibly affirm that this is very useful advice.  If you are alone, make 2 fires.  If you are more, then you can make 3-4 fires. <br><br>  <strong>‚Ä¢ Hammock.</strong>  The hammock has several advantages: it can replace a karemat, and at the same time takes up much less space.  In a hammock, there is less chance of being caught by all sorts of crawling reptiles, such as snakes, spiders, rats, ants, skalpendra, langolera, etc.  Being suspended at a height of 3-4 meters, a hammock will save you already from many large predators.  Already on the last night I learned to heat a fire in a hammock like this: with the help of two small fires on the sides at a distance of about one and a half meters.  The firewood stacks right under the hammock, so that the maintenance of the fire does not force you to get out of it.  The entire lower surface of the hammock is warmed by the warmth of the fire, and it is very comfortable to sleep.  But you need to be sure that the firewood under you will not catch fire, otherwise you will not be up to the cold. <br><br>  <strong>Duty.</strong>  Without night duty, no one will be able to rest.  The fire will go out, and everyone will wake up from the cold.  We understood this too late.  The experience of night duty will be described in the following article. <br><br>  UPD: <br>  Thanks a lot.  Transferred to the blog "Survival". <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44080/</a></p>
