Not that not listening, and not as stupid as an unbeliever.  He does not believe that he can do something worthwhile with his own hands.  And since our specialty is ‚ÄúManagement of technical systems‚Äù and without ‚Äúdirect working pens‚Äù here in any way, I decided to help them.  Show that just everything that thumbs up can beat any journeyman.  It would be a log, but the tool is fine - a computer, I mean. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/00imageforinteress-vi.jpg" alt="The stand in the form in which the student sees it for the first time"><br><br>  We gathered with my graduate in the fall and began to think Dumka - what is the way of education and what kind of work can we cope with, so that first-graders students can use it, and the diploma project has ripened in spring to him.  They decided to assemble a laboratory bench in order to connect a computer with the Ileadna via a universal cable to a secret box, which would process our desire into electrical signals and transmit to the mechanism.  And this mechanism was also overseas ingenious - machine driven. <br>  And the main thing is that a small expense would come out, or we will break up, and the master will not give you money - no, he says, wait next year. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/00generalscheme-vi218.png" alt="Structural scheme of the stand (idea)"><br>  Fig.1 General scheme of the project <br><br>  First, we laid eyes on the Arduino - good devil.  All with her: and the connectors are fine, and examples - at least a dime a dozen.  But dear she, and no one will believe that my graduate student conducted my independent research, poured himself at night;  not only with his hands, but also with his head worked.  So, it is necessary to go in a different way - to beat microsin with a brow: ‚ÄúIt is useful for us to use the controller so that we can connect to the Mother and manage from the Accursed familiar with the language‚Äù. <br>  And ATMEGA16 appeared to us.  And she could take a USB command.  And on the orders of the electrical signals to the control circuit to submit. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/01montageplate-vi.jpg" alt="Photo of the circuit board before soldering optocouplers"><br>  Fig.2 Controller circuit board <br><br>  And we rejoiced, and congratulating each other thought up a management scheme.  They called it proudly an executive mechanism so that students would be aware of their importance and usefulness of their work.  They are already technologists, they can be planted on production as sprouted seedlings. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/02standscheme-vi.jpg" alt="Circuit diagram"><br>  Fig.3 Schematic diagram of connecting actuator control lines (layout board layout is taken from microsin.ru) <br><br>  And the scheme - it is simpler than the soared turnip.  The wiring from the circuit board directly to the keys of the console was soldered.  Well, by itself, the connectors along the way were inserted, and the optocouplers for galvanic isolation were not forgotten.  And then who knows them, these first-year students, that they will poke holes in their holes, this is not a tricky business. <br>  Breaking - not building, soldering - not writing songs.  But we got a decent work.  And it seems like not to say that handicraft is a prototype, an alpha version. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/03standinmetal-vi.jpg" alt="Layout after soldering"><br>  Fig.4. Development board with soldered optocouplers <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/04openedstand-vi.jpg" alt="Assembled stand (without computer and typewriter)"><br>  Fig.5 Module Assembly <br><br>  Well, then the most interesting thing began - the study of management.  How to make it so that the machine went, and the first-year green students later coped with this. <br>  And he helped us again microsin.  Rather, his site is unforgettable.  We found different descriptions on it and the library is interesting - LibUSB.  Well and the most important thing, in what our luck has developed - our C # students (‚ÄúC-Sharp‚Äù, I mean) studied.  Although some said "C-grille." <br>  And we got a miracle, wonderful, little-eyed problem: "As from a non-aggressive program, to rule the machine square."  And all you need to do is connect the third-party ATMega16.cs assembly and declare the object.  And then - write, read, do not shirk. <br>  And the methodical manual was prepared, and the workpiece was made - beat the student, yes, and spoon spoons!  You look and rushes the cart dashing, and you will receive a treasured estimate. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/05standwithapp-vi.jpg" alt="Type of stand prepared for protection"><br>  Fig.6 Stand assembly (application screenshot is pasted later - this is an illustration for a diploma) <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/06appscreen-vi.png" alt="image"><br>  Pic.7 Application screenshot <br><br>  But it turned out one ambush inconspicuous.  In the scheme of the controller that is called, the USB protocol is only emulated and the lines on the bus do it.  This means that not every bit or even a port can be used for control.  So, it is necessary to approach to the ration carefully and carefully choose the outputs.  And do not forget also to set the modes for ports, bitwise - to write it, or read. <br>  Then we had to add a template program, the ability to control ports independently.  If you want - check the boxes, if you want - write or read numbers. <br><br><img src="http://hotimg23.fotki.com/a/77_108/75_38/07fullapp-vi.png" alt="image"><br>  Fig.8 Screenshot of the full application <br><br>  And maybe it became the line to find working and safe.  And the hunt appeared to connect to them the executive mechanisms of many great.  That the student dashing taught our science, yes praised. <br>  And you, dear artisans, we ask you to give us a thought, an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat mechanism a young student might be interested in for automation - control. <br><br>  And if anyone has a desire to repeat our work, use it for health: <br>  - <a href="">source code of the control program (C #)</a> ; <br>  - <a href="http://microsin.ru/content/view/812/44/">recommendations on the connection and configuration of the controller, the library of LibUSB and the module-assembly ATMega16.cs</a> . <br><br>  Ps.  A radio-controlled helicopter should not be offered - already in operation ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127951/</a></p>
