I take a phrase (10-20 words) from 100% of the original article on my website.  For example, written and published in 1998-2000.  (Yandex allows you to use phrases up to 40 words).  I search and find that the page is not in the list. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am not an IT specialist.  I am only the author of the content.  I can be mistaken in something.  However, in 2011 my sites, my original content, created since 1998.  was in the issuance of Yandex in the first place. <br><br>  Pages with copies of articles were below.  There were a lot of copies, dozens.  I did not figure out the maximum number, but I found up to 70 sites for each article using the same Yandex.

      In 2012, site traffic began to decline.  He began to look for the cause and found that the articles simply dropped out of the issue.  There are 70 pages with copies, but no source site. <br><br>  Perhaps expert comments will help me find a solution to this problem. <br><br>  The rules of Yandex say that the source in the issue should be higher than the copies (Yandex rules: <a href="">help.yandex.ru/webmaster/yandex-indexing/webmaster-advice.xml</a> ).  Sanctions: "Exclusion from the search pages of the site, a decrease in the search results ..." if "Sites ... contain non-original, secondary, useless content, as well as sites created for selling links and earning on advertising." <br><br>  In order to determine ‚Äúnon-original, secondary‚Äù content, Yandex needs to find ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù, find the source.  And earlier, in 2010-2011, Yandex determined the source well.  However, in the issue from 2012 - copies, not originals. <br><br>  Started correspondence with Yandex. <br><br>  Sent to Yandex: <br>  1. Screenshot of issue <br>  2. Search phrase <br>  3. URL of the page on which there is a search phrase. <br>  4. A link to the Internet Archive, as proof of authorship, originality and primacy of content. <br><br>  I receive after rather long correspondence, the message: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúUnfortunately, there are errors on the part of the algorithms, due to which the pages of your site are partially missing in the search.</i>  <i>We already correct these errors, but since we do not rule the issue for specific requests or for specific sites, we change the algorithms as a whole so that such errors do not occur in the future, it takes a lot of time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On the other hand, there is no need to send us additional examples of requests for which your site is not in the search, as previously sent are sufficient to detect the errors of the algorithms.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please wait until the end of our adjustments. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  That was in December 2013. <br><br>  I am waiting.  2013, 2014, 2015 ... The number of my original pages in the issue is steadily decreasing.  First, 10 percent fell, today - more than 60%.  One could argue that no one is looking for large quotations, but this is not so.  Thus, people are looking for: quotes, aphorisms, poems, songs, movies.  In addition, the robot does not care what word set to look for (up to 40 pieces according to Yandex rules). <br><br>  It is important that there is no such error in Google. <br><br>  In addition to banal authorship, the definition of the source is important not only to Yandex, but also to users, for example, journalists.  Thus, the definition of the source is the quality of the search service for users.  This is much more important than my particular problem. <br><br>  Again I am writing to Yandex (in a couple of years) and I get in response: <br><br>  <i>"We really do not define the source."</i> <br><br>  But how then to determine the secondary, if not to determine the primacy?  Without defining the source, it is impossible to determine what is not original and secondary. <br><br>  I rechecked several other of my own or other sites (where I remembered the original publications before 2000) - the result is the same.  Somewhere 10% of the original content fell out of the issue, about half and more.  Those.  Something broke in the issuance algorithm is quite large. <br><br>  Recently wrote to Yandex again.  Got a response: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYes, we are aware of all this.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We are working with your examples, but we cannot promise that the situation will change dramatically in the near future. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And now what i can do? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293238/</a></p>
