Majestic, spiers of the mysterious creation of architecture, hundreds of floors, dozens of elevators ... <br><br>  How well to work in such a big company, Fox thought.  Stable salary, great career opportunities, social package - what else do you need from work?  Let what he was doing was not particularly interesting - what's the difference, the main thing, they pay impressively for it. <br><br>  - Hey, Fox, come here.  The boss is calling you.  - said John. <br>  - Yes, I'm coming. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fox was often called into the office of the department head.  More often, to praise, because people under Fox‚Äôs leadership worked with impressive enthusiasm. <br>  Therefore, without special doubt, he opened the door.

      - Hello my friend.  How are you, how is your family? <br>  - It's ok, chef.  What news? <br>  - Nothing special.  In your project, which you passed last week, crept a minor error. <br>  - Can not be!  We checked everything! <br>  - However.  Cory is waiting for you in the mistakes department.  Visit him after lunch.  Everything. <br>  And the chef went about his business.  Realizing that the conversation was over, Fox walked out. <br><br>  After lunch, he went to look for where the department of errors is located.  I went up to the 124th floor, went through the corridors A and F, reached the 57th floor of the special section elevator, descended the stairs to zone P and found myself in front of the inscription I was looking for. <br>  There were no people around, only occasionally, around the corner, voices were heard.  It's not often here, Fox thought.  Of course, because the company conducts its business so successfully that it almost makes no mistakes. <br><br>  So, and here is the door.  Hanging sign "Corey Naps", it seems, it is here. <br>  For the first time in many years, excitement swept Fox.  His cunning manipulations with the projects allowed him to shorten the time, and soon he headed the team of leading developers.  He always did everything so that no one noticed - and here, did he make a mistake somewhere? <br>  No, he could not.  He always knew his next step, always did everything right. <br><br>  He grinned, a mask of calm reappeared on his face.  He smiled radiantly, opened the door and stepped forward. <br><br>  And fell down from the 57th floor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22008/</a></p>
