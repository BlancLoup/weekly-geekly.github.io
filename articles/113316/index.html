  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Apple thursday</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Thursday, February 3, the regular monthly game development seminar for iOs was held in Moscow in the Hurry <s>Tower</s> on Pokrovsky Boulevard in Moscow.  Led the banquet <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexgoncharenko/" class="user_link">AlexGoncharenko</a> .  To his question - how did you hear about the event, 298 people out of 300 who came answered - From the announcement on Habrahabr. <br><br>  The audience was friendly, intelligent and educated, which surprised me and resurrected faith in the bright future of humanity.  Almost every listener had an iPad in his right hand, an iPhone in his left, and <s>a</s> macAir <s>girl</s> on his lap. <br><br>  A total of 4 reports were heard - 4 completely different approaches to developing applications for the iPhone and getting money from the appStore.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h6>  First report </h6><br>  At 18-45 the show began.  With delight, the audience met the first two speakers - the legendary Voynov brothers (Zeptolab), the creators of the hit 2010 - Cut the Rope.  Unlike the application, the report was not the most brilliant, although it is immediately obvious that people are correct, they smile well, in the 1st act they showed the public a trick with a rope. <br>  Cut the Rope is their second child, the first in the appStore was called PARASHYUTIK and brought the authors 300,000 paid downloads plus an understanding of the earning strategy.  They created Cut the Rope on the same principles that Disney created cartoons.  This is a great animation, professional sound engineer, heavy thread movement model algorithm (who has taken the most development time), a boring script, a team of testers friends and the choice of a correct and fat publisher (the target audience of the application and the publisher coincided). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abf/e49/a55/abfe49a55f7b4b23f68f1c26889c1c31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The guys called this publisher Publisher and, due to my stupidity, I decided that it was a last name, like Abramovich.  I was mistaken, nevertheless it was Publisher who did the main work of promoting the game.  The application has been sold 5 million times.  Brilliantly.  How much money did the publisher take?  It is not known, but the guys left immediately after the report to the railway station, and not to the airport, which is alarming and hints at a careful approach to choosing a publisher. <br>  The brothers answered questions from the audience in the case, they did not lift their nose, thanked fate and good luck.  As I understand it, now they want to cut down a little babosikov on the release of toys, T-shirts, etc., with the character of their game.  When asked whether they were participating with their toad in the Sochi 2014 emblem competition, the younger brother laughed and applauded, the older one became thoughtful. <br><br><h6>  Second report </h6><br>  The second report was voiced by two charming girls from Game Insight.  The company owns online games like Island and something else that millions of foreigners play.  These citizens buy all sorts of goodies for virtual fun for real money.  Game Insight ordered the iPhone version of the game to some programmers, put it into the store, received 600,000 downloads from the appStore from its users, and claims that it has profit from this event.  And it took only 2 months.  Normal result, yes? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79e/7b4/487/79e7b44879d0878140724aa15a18ac32.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The monthly income from the games they have more than 100 000 US dollars.  Russian citizens, according to the girls, do not play their games and do not pay money.  The quality of the report was breathtaking.  The slang of DOMA-2 heroes was greeted by the kindly neighing of three hundred <s>Spartans of</s> iPhone developers.  The girls were asked many questions, but the most important was not asked what they were doing tonight. <br><br><h6>  Third report </h6><br>  The third report was read by Ilya Kurylev, Flexis.  He clearly and sensibly told about the iPhone Game Center, about its advantages and numerous shortcomings and about the fact that they themselves have not created a single game application for the iPhone. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f70/33e/63b/f7033e63b2e8d40dfe29258f1dcb5e5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, the public did not ask the speaker a single question, thanking him only with applause.  And I would ask Illya where he got the numbers from, that 92% of iDos have 4.0 onboard iOs.  The data collected by my applications speak of less than 50%.  From this point of view, today there is little point in using Game Center for gaming applications.  There are a lot of holes on the server side and few Russian devices with the 4th generation of iOS. <br><br><h6>  Fourth report </h6><br>  The last speaker was, I quote - Vadim Bashurov, an independent developer of iPhone applications, the creator of the legendary "Field of Miracles."  It's not interesting to tell me about him, because that's what I am.  Moreover, my first game was not the ‚Äúfield of miracles‚Äù, but the ‚ÄúSea Battle‚Äù between Ukraine and Russia. <br>  The questions on the report were literate, and an unknown comrade of a solid type so simply opened my eyes to errors in adding iAd libraries to applications. <br>  Most objective-C code in the reports was not enough, probably the format of the meeting and the screen to this did not have. <br>  I want to add that in the process of the author's speech a monetary competition was played - what artist‚Äôs picture is used as the background of my presentation?  100 rubles was won by Alexey Goncharenko, who guessed the master after a small hint.  Do you know the answer? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/309/8aa/fa0/3098aafa0dea9ba3d165d2e487b57911.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the conference was extremely interesting for me and inspired ideas that I had already rushed to implement slowly. <br><br><h6>  About the competition </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41f/5f9/9a5/41f5f99a51cfa58287f212561d7f01e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During the seminar, participants filled out questionnaires, among which a prize was drawn - the book DEVELOPMENT for iPhone.  The book was won by a handsome unshaven guy with intelligent eyes.  Looking at him, I thought that he should not read, but to himself publish such books.  This is the fourth, the most correct approach to making money with the help of Apple and its magical devices. <br><br><h6>  AfterParty </h6><br>  I hope to learn from the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113316/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113316/</a></p>
