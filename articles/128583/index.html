      RURU relies on Beeline‚Äôs broad subscriber base and Alfa Bank‚Äôs expertise in retail payments.  These are very serious trumps.  They are also potential weaknesses: there will definitely be market participants who are not comfortable working with one of the leaders of cellular communication and with the largest private retail bank in the country.  Therefore, success will largely depend on the level of execution.  My experience of personal acquaintance with the project management says that there are all the prerequisites for this. <br><br>  <b>2. Why, according to Boris, Peypal performed a feint with his ears?</b>  <b>They asked (read - forced), he understood everything (aha, one more understood everything), he wants to come in some other way.</b> <br><br>  According to my information, PayPal plans to have a full-fledged presence in Russia, including merchant services and opening wallets for Russians.  Therefore, I am inclined to explain what happened with a technical error that is possible even in large companies. <br><br>  <b>3. Does Qiwi have plans to develop a network in Europe and North America (the United States, in the first place)?</b> <br><br>  We are already working in 18 countries and carefully approach their choice.  In particular, it is unlikely that we have serious drivers for growth in Western Europe, but with the US, niche projects in individual states are quite possible.  But this concerns the terminal segment.  QIWI Wallet was originally conceived by us as a product that exists outside of physical boundaries. <br>  QIWI terminals - a potential channel for replenishing the Wallet - are present in different countries of the world and their number is actively growing.  In addition, ways to replenish the Wallet are developing in other directions.  In particular, account replenishment is possible from cards of banks of all countries of the world, except the USA. <br>  The other day came across an interesting publication - the Western portal Practical E-Commerce published a review of the payment service, like Russian <a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/blogs/post/882-Selling-Online-in-Russia-A-Quick-Guide-for-Non-Russians">know-how</a> .  QIWI payment service is a must have for every advanced online store that is interested in Russian audience.  This is the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe article.  But we go further: who said that the QIWI payment service is relevant not only for the Russian audience, the number of countries of our presence is growing. <br><br>  <b>4. Will Qiwi have a contract with some sane bank (I don‚Äôt refer to TCS) for withdrawal without commission?</b> <br><br>  We very much value our partnership with TCS, but, of course, we are negotiating with other banks.  We subsidize the replenishment of the wallet to enable our users to do this without commission.  Therefore, the output should earn.  Not all banks are willing to pay us to replenish accounts or customer cards.  Therefore, we are constantly looking for a compromise, and this is an art.  For the development of the system it is necessary to maintain a balance of interests of users, partners and our interests.  Together, we gradually, step by step, create new conditions in the market of electronic payments. <br><br>  <b>5. Whom does Qiwi consider its main competitor?</b>  <b>and the second?</b> <br><br>  We have no competitors, other payment systems are our partners in market development.  In addition, we noticed that our colleagues learned how to reproduce quite quickly many of our new services.  The virtual map that appeared once was a trend on the market for a long time, now we are looking with interest at the fate of QIWI Eggs and the kill_cash project - we are waiting for remakes.  But why not, this situation also contributes to the overall progress.  Sometimes, for the sake of interest, one would even like to announce some kind of revolutionary, daring idea and wait: maybe someone does realize it?  For example, the withdrawal of money with a surcharge to the account in any bank in the world.  Who first implements? <br><br>  <b>6. In one of my comments I threw in the idea: does Qiwi have any plans (perhaps as a bank, yes, I repeat myself with my comments above) to start maintaining settlement legal accounts.</b>  <b>individuals.</b>  <b>After all, this is really cool.</b>  <b>Understandable and simple online banking.</b>  <b>Everything is clean and transparent (such as if the tax authorities want to check - you can give access to the accounts reports).</b>  <b>It‚Äôs a dream concept at all, if you want, I walked over to the Qiwi terminal, jabbed a few buttons, smiled at the prancing bird, and ... get a registered legal entity, with a current account, with all the notifications sent where necessary ...</b> <br><br>  As a first stage, we want to become the best online bank for individuals.  Then you can think about others.  In connection with the latest innovations, the topic of online banking is particularly relevant for us, so you‚Äôve got the point.  In fact, QIWI Wallet is an online bank: on the one hand, it is somewhat simplified, on the other - more functional than usual.  Still, not all online banks have access to more than 3,000 suppliers of a wide variety of goods and services. <br><br>  <b>7. Is Boris interested in what he is doing now?</b>  <b>And what plans to do in the future.</b>  <b>How to rest (skiing is a one-time photo or a constant hobby).</b>  <b>What services he uses, well, except for qiwi, of course.</b> <br><br>  I really like my work, because we are doing things that are new not only for Russia and the CIS, but also for the world.  This is a great luck.  I like to relax actively: bike, ski, mountaineering, diving.  As for services, judging by the frequency of use of applications in the iPhone - Twitter, Evernote for notes, Pressdisplay for reading newspapers, iBook for reading books, TripDeck for planning air travel - in general, everything is quite pragmatic. <br><br>  <b>8. Whether there will be any changes in connection with the plans of the state of the national.</b>  <b>boards</b>  <b>system?</b> <br><br>  Cardinal will not be, because the wallet and so lives largely according to the rules provided by the law on the NPS.  But the emergence of a new player in the market of payment systems is very interesting.  Moreover, such a specific player.  How exactly we will cooperate, in what tandem, we will see only with time.  But the overall situation in the market is such that together you can do much more than one by one. <br><br>  <b>9. What are your plans for the coming year?</b>  <b>I understand that all plans will not be announced anyway, but at least some hints.</b>  <b>Well, good luck with your work!</b>  <b>Thanks for the great service.</b> <br><br>  In our plans to make electronic payments as accessible and familiar to users as cash payments.  There is no need to go far for an example: more recently, QIWI Wallet was intended only for the Internet, but at the end of the summer we successfully went offline.  Paying a bill at a bar with QIWI Wallet has become even easier than paying in cash: you will not need to even decide on the issue with the change.  I can‚Äôt give you any specific information, but I think you will like our news :) Thank you so much. <br><br>  <b>10. Are you going to expand towards New Zealand?</b>  <b>How can I help you with this?</b>  <b>Sincerely, Kiwi resident of Auckland.</b> <br><br>  In general, we are going, although it is difficult to call more or less exact terms.  You are helping us by asking this question and having a need for our service.  And demand creates supply. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128583/</a></p>
