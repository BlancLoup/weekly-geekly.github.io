  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The revolution that flowed into evolution under the auspices of Apple</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just think, but this event happened more than 5 years ago!  And this event is the announcement of the first iPhone in 2007 at MacWorld.  And I want to tell you what happened due to the appearance of this device, which still stirs the minds of millions and causes a lot of controversy.  I'll try to look at it through the prism of years. <br><br>  At that time, various manufacturers produced "bearded" devices on windows mobile for geeks, Nokia produced smartphones on Symbian, and the rest only indulged in the release of rattles.  For ease of use, the complexity of the device to the WM is not inferior to the reference books of higher mathematics.  And Nokia, which at that time possessed the only human system for that time, was ‚Äúcutting down‚Äù with all its money.  Some idolized Nokia, others used it, and the rest had no choice, and therefore she released dozens of identical devices in different cases. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How was the announcement of the device from Apple perceived?  - cool.  People did not understand why he was, what to do with him, what he is better than others.  This, as the first person who realized that rolling friction is much less than sliding friction, but is not ready to argue, everyone immediately switched to the ‚Äúwheels‚Äù (I want to thank him for the development of technology).  So, I retreated from the topic, people did not notice that there was a revolution that changed the world of mobile devices. <br>  Technology companies on the announcement of the iPhone did not react at all.  It is enough to cite as an example the words of Steve Ballmer: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúIt is very expensive for such a device, given that no one is not a business phone.  Here we have Microsoft selling our Windows Mobile phones for 99 bucks (Motorola Q), where there is music, Internet, mail, instant messages.  We are not going to compete with Apple, why compete with them?  We sold millions, and Apple didn't sell any phones.  Well, yes, they will launch their expensive iPhone in half a year, no one knows what the market will turn out to be.  Of course, Apple took the lead in music sales, but we also have original designs based on wireless networks and social networks.  We are confident of change. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  Although no, they reacted, but even worse, the company did not put the iPhone in the ranks of competitors.  However, Ballmer was right, the changes have occurred, and even what, but this is not their merit. <br>  At the time of release, the first iPhone could not be called a smartphone, but it was a unique phone.  The quality of materials, the assembly, the speed of the interface, and the interface itself - in all it was better than its competitors.  And the very innovations that no one thinks about have entered our lives and a paradigm shift has occurred not noticeably for the majority.  A good example is the way children who grew up in the environment of apple technology try to ‚Äúzoom‚Äù in pictures in books.

      I believe that people get used extremely easily to good things, but they never represent the final object of their desires.  Everyone can talk endlessly about what is good and what is bad, or what is worth fixing.  But units can really create something that can sink into people's souls.  These units move the progress in various steps.  Sometimes it is an explosion, a revolution, and sometimes it is a gradual progress. <br><br>  As I already wrote, Nokia stamped dozens of identical devices and was the market leader.  The rest of the manufacturers tried to compete with her.  Then in the world of mobile devices there was a stagnation, nobody knew in which direction to move and what to change.  Everyone thought the devices existing at that time were perfect.  And then "some" Apple entered the market.  Underestimating it, Nokia lost the market over the following years, and Sony Ericsson lost some of its name.  Some survived, others appeared.  But since the apple company has set the vector, having revolutionized the development of the entire industry, it leads it into a <s>bright and magical</s> future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163673/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163673/</a></p>
