No, is it free? </h5><br>  Just yesterday, the first commercial tender, originally placed with us (at erumpo), was completed - this was custom software development.

      In the process of searching for a contractor for this tender, we were somewhat surprised that many employees of IT companies instinctively expect that they will be obliged to take money for providing final information about the tender.  Apparently, this is a prevailing stereotype, although we try to indicate everywhere that the service does not charge for information about tenders. <br><br><h5>  Open competition - the engine of a civilized market </h5><br>  We believe that information about ongoing tenders and procurement should be free and open.  This is the main engine towards the formation of real market competition between IT companies, which ultimately leads to higher levels of services and budget savings. <br><br><h5>  How can a customer save money? </h5><br>  On the example of the last completed <a href="http://www.erumpo.ru/">tender placed with us</a> : the customer managed to save more than a third of the project budget, in comparison with the proposal that the contractor independently found by the customer put to him.  Q.E.D. <br><br><h5>  How to save time for customers and suppliers? </h5><br>  In addition to creating a civilized market for tenders, we also aim to save time for both the customer and the performer. <br><br>  Usually the work being done to search for potential performers, even for a standard project, is to search the Internet, make calls to friends, look through the catalogs of IT companies and then call the secretaries.  This is complete nonsense, not to mention the effectiveness of these actions. <br><br>  This is doubly annoying, because every time you have to get answers from each representative again: <br><br>  - what have you done before? <br><br>  - how much are your employees? <br><br>  - for how long can you allocate them? <br><br>  - and why do you think you can handle this project? <br><br>  <b>You can compare how much time can be saved if you just hold a tender:</b> <br><br>  - 3 minutes to create a tender; <br><br>  - 15 minutes to search and select potential IT suppliers who can do the job; <br><br>  - 2 minutes to invite those suppliers who could potentially cope to participate in the tender (&gt; 10 companies); <br><br>  - 30 minutes for calls to IT suppliers who did not respond with a request for a published tender during the first day; <br><br>  - 10 minutes for the analysis of received commercial proposals and for feedback, if necessary; <br><br>  I tried to set out our vision of a civilized commercial market, as well as the main tips and reasons for the transition to the creation and participation in tenders. <br><br>  Also, recently we have prepared an <a href="http://www.erumpo.ru/about/tenders/review_of_market_equipment_and_supplies">overview of the market of equipment and consumables</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113858/</a></p>
