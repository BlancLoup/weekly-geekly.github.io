It is a very liberal country, truly green and clean.  The locals are very friendly and relaxed, yet it affects us that we are on a small island far from the rest of the world.  The population has recently exceeded 4 million people, of which 15% are foreigners.  In general, in Auckland (the largest city in the country with a population of 1.5 million) a very colorful mix of different nationalities has accumulated.  New Zealand is so quiet and peaceful country that, having become accustomed to such a slow pace of life, you come to a really big city, and some kind of phobia sets in, somehow you feel uncomfortable. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/984/0e8/5cd/9840e85cdece1ba457226e0c16ef76d6.jpg" width="400" height="370" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">

      <em>Do you miss your homeland?</em>  <em>Can you live in Russia again, and if not, why not?</em> <br><br>  You know, I did not particularly miss my homeland for a long time.  Just the head was busy with other things.  But the news and all the events around Russia, of course, were always closely watched.  But about a year ago, there was nostalgia, and again, after a ten-year break, I want to visit my native places.  Honestly, a little worried.  Russia is rapidly developing in all directions.  This is a completely different country compared to the one from which I left in 1995;  a completely different society - without the complexes of the 90s.  This can be seen in the Russian visitors, whom I meet.  But all this is not mine, the new Russia is a stranger to me, I don‚Äôt think I can get used to it again.  Still, Western thinking is having an effect, and life in Russia is still hard and, of course, a lot of stress.  I have already lost the habit of this - this page of my life is turned upside down. <br><br>  <em>Is the life of an average NZ resident different from the life of a Russian?</em> <br><br>  I would not say that radically, although of course there are differences.  In New Zealand, they plow the whole week, and they rest only for a weekend.  In Russia, it seems to me, people can walk all week.  New Zealanders (or simply Kiwi, as the rest of the world calls us) are a very sporting nation, so people of all ages devote much time to health.  It is as it is prescribed in the daily routine. <br><br>  <em>Is it easy for a Russian person to adapt to the NT?</em>  <em>Is it easy to find a job?</em> <br><br>  You see, we, the Russians, still have a slightly different mentality, and immigration is a very difficult fate at first.  This is separation from family and friends.  Immigration of many Russians here is simply suppressed.  People understand that everything has to be proved again, since nobody in the NZ is interested in who you were before.  Our Russian education is not taken into account, so many have to retrain and, of course, it is already difficult to make a career, and this is a big stress.  It is much easier for the representatives of my generation, who received local education.  The job, however, is not so difficult to find.  Everything is done via the Internet, there are lots of ads. <br><br>  <em>What do you do?</em>  <em>Where do you work?</em>  <em>How do you spend your leisure time?</em> <br><br>  I work in the IT field - a network technology specialist (network engineer), also testing software for accountants.  In this, perhaps, my interest.  I spend my leisure time with friends, both with the natives and with the Russians.  And I have very close friends here from Nakhodka.  So there is enough entertainment, and I love to ‚Äúbully‚Äù through the clubs.  Many people know me at local get-togethers.  I spend a lot of time on sport.  I run every day for medium and long distances. <br><br>  <em>Do you know at least one person who lives off money on the Internet?</em> <br><br>  I know one, but he moved to Phuket (Thailand).  Now "loot hacks" there, although in this business it does not matter where you are. <br><br>  <em>Are there many Russians in the NT?</em>  <em>Do they keep in touch with each other?</em> <br><br>  Russian only in Auckland over 10,000 people.  We, of course, keep in touch with each other.  There are Russian shops, a Russian club, a Russian video rental service, even a Russian disco, where people are always fit.  Russian parties (parties) in a nightclub are also organized, so they communicate to the detriment of their English.  You will be surprised, but I meet many who have lived here for ten years, but in English they speak little because of the fact that their compatriots are exclusively in their circle of contacts. <br><br>  <em>NZ is located on the edge of the world, are local people following news from Russia, Europe, the USA?</em> <br><br>  The main news is, of course, followed.  Just recently, the news was about an expedition to the North Pole.  Many people asked me about it.  A lot of news related to terrorism shows, as always.  At the same time, we all understand how lucky we are that we live far from all this disease. <br><br>  <em>The climate in NZ is very different from the seaside?</em>  <em>Do you swim in the sea?</em>  <em>Do natural disasters happen?</em> <br><br>  The climate, of course, is different, although in summer it is not as warm as in Nakhodka, but still +25, +30 it happens.  But the rainy winter.  In Auckland, in winter, all the time is +9, +15, and we have winter from June to August, that is, vice versa compared to the northern hemisphere.  But on the South Island snow falls.  In the sea in the summer often swim.  From the east, Auckland rests on the Pacific Ocean, and from the west to the Tasman Sea, where there are big waves, so western beaches are popular among surfers.  Natural disasters are rare.  These are mostly floods due to heavy rainfall, but not in Auckland.  There are also strong storms with hurricane winds from the Antarctic. <br><br>  <em>What is the average salary in NZ?</em>  <em>Is life expensive, food, utilities, clothing, appliances, the Internet?</em> <br><br>  The average salary at the level of Australia, Canada and most European countries, but slightly lower than in the United States, as a result, the prices of utility bills, equipment, television and the Internet are much higher than Russian, but Russia will come to this.  Internet costs from $ 18 to $ 50 per month, ADSL, by itself.  The average annual income is about $ 20,000.  Although I do not know anyone with such a ridiculous salary.  Mostly people get more.  Those who have an education, receive from $ 35,000 per year.  As for the rent, in normal areas the price starts from $ 210 a week for both houses and apartments with two rooms (2 bedrooms, not including the hall).  There are houses and $ 1500 a week.  Many young people (students) in order to save rent housing together or three. <br>  (All prices are shown for convenience in US dollars, approx. Kopernik). <br><br>  <em>Are there many poor people (beggars), is the crime rate high?</em> <br><br>  The poor have become more, but it is their own choice.  Here everyone has the right to choose, even the last homeless.  Crime has also become much more in the last 10 years, but still very safe.  In Auckland, there are about 300,000 people from Pacific islands, over whom the NZ holds a protectorate - Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Islands, Cook Islands and others, many people from Fiji.  12% of the population - aborigines (Maori).  It is from them that all crime occurs.  The islanders are very large people, all men for 100 kg.  Yes, they have the largest ethnic group. <br><br>  <em>Did you quickly learn English?</em>  <em>Do you know him as your own?</em> <br><br>  Learn English completely takes not a year or even two.  You can only say that you know the language perfectly when you start to think on it.  He taught not for very long, but he improved much longer.  I already think in English, so I know how my own.  All the time we have to translate into Russian, so we even speak some English in Russian, because it is easier to explain this way. <br><br>  <em>NZ is an international state, because there are many visitors from all over the world.</em>  <em>Do all people live in the world?</em>  <em>Is there interracial conflict?</em> <br><br>  You know, we are lucky in this regard.  Every time, seeing news about conflicts on interracial grounds in different countries, even in neighboring Australia, you realize that you made the right choice in favor of the NT. <br><br>  <em>Could you open your own business in NZ?</em>  <em>What directions do you think are promising there?</em> <br><br>  Hard to say, maybe could.  Moreover, in the field of IT there are always prospects. <br><br>  <em>What do you dream about?</em>  <em>What are your plans for the next 10 years?</em> <br><br>  I dream to visit Russia again, and at the expense of plans - I want to go around the whole world and try myself in a new place. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.kopernik.name/2007/08/blog-post_24.html">A source</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13492/</a></p>
