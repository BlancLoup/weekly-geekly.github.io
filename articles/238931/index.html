      <b>Basis peak</b> <br>  Remember the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/218375/">Basis B1</a> watch?  They were able to track the pulse, skin temperature, sleep quality, monitored your activity.  True, they differed weak design and the inability to measure the pulse during exercise, as does, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/206884/">Mio Alpha</a> .  The company Basis Science, which is engaged in the development of wearable electronics, this year <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/214863/">bought Intel</a> .  And one would think that now all the development will be aimed at improving the technology of Intel, but no.  Recently, Basis has introduced a new gadget called Peak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/26d/843/29926d8430514ea5b3aab408460dc650.png"><br><br>  Peak is more of a clock, and to be more precise, it‚Äôs still a monitor of a person‚Äôs physical activity, but in the form of a wristwatch and with the functionality of a smartwatch.  The screen of the gadget is monochrome, very contrasting, but, most importantly, has low power consumption.  In general, thanks to this screen, Peak watches are similar to the famous Pebble, but rotated 90 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bf/755/845/4bf75584595047afab1f03dfe0cff797.png"><br><br>  Undoubtedly, Peak is equipped with sensors and sensors of the latest technology.  There is an optical heart rate sensor, and a galvanic skin response sensor, which allows analyzing the psycho-emotional state of a person, there is even a temperature sensor.  Thanks to this set, the new Basis Peak can do everything that modern fitness trackers do.  This is a calculation of the number of steps taken, the distance, the number of calories burned, the preservation of data on heartbeat, sweating, temperature, workout dynamics and, of course, sleep analysis. <br><br>  New watches from Basis Science can work with devices on iOS or Android using a proprietary application that connects to the gadget using Bluetooth LE.  In addition, in conjunction with a smartphone Peak can show notifications about calls, events, messages and even e-mail.  This functionality will not be available from the first firmware version, but is referred to as planned. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/f45/bd3/2faf45bd3cf2474b84fbc450220f50c1.png"><br><br>  As for its moisture-proof features, the watch can be immersed in water to a depth of 50 meters.  Peak work time is up to 4 days, however, it is not yet clear in what mode. <br><br>  List of declared functions and characteristics of Basis Peak: <br>  - 5 sensors for measuring heart rate, movement, sweating and body temperature; <br>  - automatic recognition of the type of activity (walk, jogging, bike, sleep and its phases) using BodyIQ technology <br>  - Advanced sleep analysis technology for determining phases (fast REM sleep, deep, movement, etc.) and sleep quality <br>  - the system of formation of healthy habits through the implementation of tasks and insights about your health. <br>  - support for notifications from a smartphone (iOS and Android) <br>  - pulse measurement during workouts (as in Mio Alpha) <br>  - mobile application with detailed statistics <br>  - heavy-duty glass Gorilla Glass 3 <br>  - water resistant to 5 ATM <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sSjDcSzbk5A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhia_9SYkuY8alqw4c0dwESJ5H4dew" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Where to buy, price, date of start of sales:</b> <br>  The cost of the device in the US is $ 200, and sales begin in November 2014. <br>  For now, you can leave a pre-order <a href="http://www.mybasis.com/">on the official website</a> or <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/umnye-chasy-basis-peak/">on Madrobots.ru</a> . <br>  Previous models Basis B1 and Basis B1 Carbon <a href="http://madrobots.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dbasis">are available on Madrobots.ru</a> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/intellektualnye-chasy-my-basis/">for 7990 rubles</a> and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/basis-carbon-steel-edition/">8990 rubles</a> . <br><br>  <b>Misfit flash</b> <br><br>  The company Misfit introduced a <a href="http://www.misfitwearables.com/products/flash">new fitness tracker</a> called Misfit Flash.  The price for the tracker was declared murderous - only $ 49. <br>  From the first Shine fitness tracker, the new model is different in body material. <br>  Shine is made of anodized aluminum, and Flash is made of plastic.  7 Misfit Flash color solutions are available (although 3 of them will be exclusively available at Best Buy). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6aa/8da/ab5/6aa8daab571f40828e8863504a1782cd.jpg"><br><br>  Fitness tracker Misfit Flash can count the steps, the distance covered, determine the quality of sleep, as well as the number of calories burned.  The device itself is able to recognize running, cycling and swimming. <br>  The battery life of the new tracker will be approximately 6 months.  After discharging you just need to replace the CR2032 standard battery. <br>  With Flash, you can swim and even dive to a depth of 30 meters. <br>  Misfit Flash uses indicators located on the edge of the tracker to indicate the level of physical activity.  These lights show how close or far away the user is from the target. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d42/71f/af5/d4271faf548741d8961afc5dfc975799.jpg"><br><br>  The goals of physical activity can be set in the app.  Statistics and dynamics of your classes are also displayed there. <br>  Misfit Flash supports smartphones on iOS and Android since version 4.3. <br><br>  <b>Where to buy, price, date of start of sales:</b> <br>  The cost of the device in the US will be $ 49, and sales begin in mid-October 2014. <br>  You can leave a pre-order <a href="http://store.misfit.com/products/flash%3F__hstc%3D177047034.6ad668f5ea7fbb3c88ba33e94f66caf0.1412231538328.1412231538328.1412231538328.1%26__hssc%3D177047034.4.1412231538329%26__hsfp%3D2521489323">on the official website</a> or <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/misfit-flash/">on Madrobots.ru</a> . <br>  Let me remind you that Misfit Shine can be <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/misfit-shine/">bought now at Madrobots.ru for 4490 rubles</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pebble</b> <br>  Startup Pebble is well aware that he will have to fight with giants like Apple, Sony, Samsung and LG. <br>  Pebble managed to beat Koreans and Japanese quite easily: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edc/e2c/024/edce2c024d7c4081873dad97e104072d.jpg"><br>  <i>According to the Catalys analytical service, Pebble has become the leader of the smart watch market, and sales of Pebble and Pebble Steel accounted for 35% of the total smart watch market in the world in the first quarter of 2014.</i> <br><br>  But <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vcstart/blog/236277/">Apple Watch</a> despite the mediocre characteristics <s>so far</s> , everyone is afraid. <br>  So, on October 1, Pebble released a very important update for Pebble and Pebble Steel watches.  Pebble expands the ecosystem of their gadgets and now they support applications that track physical activity in the background, that is, Pebble is now not a new-fangled gadget for displaying notifications, but a full-fledged fitness tracker. <br><br>  Erik Mikigovski (CEO Pebble) said they had long wanted to expand the functionality, but for about half a year they were testing whether the battery life of the clock would not decrease significantly.  And the results obtained satisfied them.  Calorie accounting and sleep monitoring does not affect the speed of drawing the interface, and battery life is reduced by a maximum of half a day, this is a reasonable fee for the functions of a fitness tracker. <br>  The first who developed a special application with the functions of a fitness tracker for Pebble were the guys from the startup Misfit. <br>  The news of this <a href="https://blog.getpebble.com/2014/06/24/pebble-makes-fitness-shine-partners-with-misfit/">came out on June 24th</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/7af/5b7/26f7af5b7e3c431383f81e1c9ab650e2.jpg"><br>  The first version of the application did not allow tracking the number of steps taken in the background, which rather limited the use of the new functionality. <br><br>  On September 30, Jawbone, Swim.com and Misfit announced their collaboration with Pebble.  For these companies, integration with Pebble makes it possible to multiply the base of its users, and also to tell about themselves to those who did not know about the world of fitness trackers. <br>  Pebble singled out Swim.com among partners, since the function of calculating the distance when swimming is present on the market only in models like Garmin Swim and more expensive sports watches, which can not be called clever.  For swimmers (if the functionality fails), Swim.com integration is just a holiday. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/589/07c/a8e/58907ca8e7ec470dbd3dc58c55f4a49d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d1/cd9/d36/0d1cd9d36bbb4e49b628180ad4975a41.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0e/d44/b26/b0ed44b264fb4c9e877ab53316d33472.png"><br><br>  <b>Pebble firmware 2.6 detailed description:</b> <br><br>  <b>NEW</b> : Activity.  Activity tracking applications (like Jawbone, Misfit, Swim.com) for Pebble are now running in the background.  Installing fitness applications and setting them up is done through the Pebble Settings menu.  The Activity icon is displayed in the Pebble menu when the fitness app is installed and running. <br>  <b>NEW</b> : Quick Start.  Set the shortcut for your favorite application by long pressing the Up or Down button (buttons on the right side of the watch).  The Quick Launch feature can be enabled via the Pebble Settings menu. <br>  The battery icon is now displayed on all screens of the clock settings menu. <br>  Corrected errors and improved functionality. <br><br>  <b>To upgrade to the latest firmware version:</b> <br>  Open the Pebble app on your iOS or Android smartphone. <br>  Choose Support ¬ªUpdate Your Pebble in the menu if the update is not offered automatically. <br>  <b>IMPORTANT: The</b> new firmware version by default does not support Cyrillic. <br>  You can download custom firmware with Cyrillic support (as before) at <a href="http://pebblebits.com/firmware/">http://pebblebits.com/</a> . <br><br>  An unexpected step from Pebble was the reduction in the price of watches by $ 50. <br>  Now Pebble watches cost $ 99, and Pebble Steel is only $ 200. You can now buy them in dozens of stores around the world, including on Amazon.com. <br>  With delivery to Russia, the watch will cost you about ~ 5500 rubles Pebble and ~ 10 000 rubles Pebble Steel. <br>  I‚Äôll add that Pebble retail prices are now lower than wholesale prices at which Pebble has shipped watches earlier (including Madrobots). <br>  For us, the decline in prices was a complete surprise. <br><br>  In Madrobots <a href="http://madrobots.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dpebble">Pebble are available</a> at a price of 6990 rubles, and Pebble Steel 10 990 rubles. <br>  Madrobots is the official distributor of Pebble and provides warranty support for Pebble in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/intellektualnye-chasy-pebble/">Buy Pebble watches for 6990 rubles.</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/pebble-steel-smartwatch/">Buy Pebble steel watches for 10990 rubles.</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/umnye-chasy-pebble-time/">Buy Pebble Time watches for 18,990 rubles.</a> <br><br>  Let me remind you that we always have a 5% discount for users of Habr using the HABR code, and below you will find stunning news that will make our offer comparable to a Pebble price reduction. <br><br><a name="mrpp"></a><br>  <b>MadRobots and PayPal</b> <br>  We began to cooperate with the payment system PayPal.

Now you can pay for your purchases of interesting gadgets using PayPal. <br>  In fact, this is all the same payment by credit card, but in connection with the PayPal account with all the ensuing consequences (protection of the buyer, the possibility of a refund). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/868/f08/f65/868f08f652b24603bd3f6191cf40d283.jpg"><br><br>  In honor of the start of cooperation, we launched a <a href="http://madrobots.ru/paypal/">special page</a> where users can get a discount of up to 20% on any gadget from the Madrobots range.
