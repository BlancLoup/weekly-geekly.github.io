Edition Sostav analyzed all the data and highlighted the numbers relating to the domestic segment of the Internet. <br><br>  The main facts are as follows: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Russian users are not abandoning stationary PCs and laptops despite the ongoing ‚Äúmobile revolution‚Äù; </li><li>  The desktop audience in Russia is more than 68 million unique users every month - this brings the country into the leaders among the countries of Europe, Africa and the Middle East; </li><li>  The share of Russian users among the audience of the ‚Äúbig diagonal‚Äù in the EMEA region (Eastern and Central Europe / Asia) is 19%, in second place is Germany (14%), in the third place is the United Kingdom with 11%; </li><li>  Most of all, the ‚Äúbig screen‚Äù is used by middle-aged Russians: 27% for men and 25% for women aged 25-34 and 21% for both sexes aged 35-44 each.  Their share of time spent on the network: 29% (men 25-34), 25% (women 25-34) and 23% among both sexes aged 35-44 years; </li><li>  It is predicted that the greatest coverage and involvement stimulate such categories of services and products as ‚Äúsocial‚Äù (leader with a strong margin), ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù and ‚Äúportals‚Äù; </li><li>  The structure of the general Russian Internet audience: only a desktop over the age of 6 years old - 67% of users, only mobile devices - 4%, and both of them - 29%.  The younger the audience segment, the higher the share of the cross-platform segment, the generation 15-34 is 53% of the total audience; </li><li>  The larger the screen, the longer the user lingers in categories of browsing-oriented multiple pages: in retail 70% of the audience, among news resources - 37%; </li><li>  Smartphone users dominate as consumers of weather services information (90%) and navigation and search by locations (83%) </li><li>  Smartphone users spend 70% of their time online, 30% of tablets; </li><li>  comScore added the analysis of the most popular video content, there is also something to see here: the ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù category leads in average users per month, followed by ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù (Russia differs from other countries with the longest videos), the maximum time occupy videos from the "educational" category; </li><li>  According to comScore estimates, the average brand has between 20 and 34 seconds to try to effect the user / viewer; </li><li>  The largest amount of video content (counted along with advertising) is Google, the largest share of video advertising (53.8%) is at ivi.ru, the smallest is by competitor megogo.net, the most saturated by advertising video is from the ‚Äúgame‚Äù category. </li></ul><br>  The second study from AAI (Agency Assessments International) concerns the dynamics of ‚Äúsentiment‚Äù in the marketing environment in 2015-2016.  The consultants surveyed 664 marketers working in 512 companies in 44 market segments - the industry publication AdIndex translated the study into Russian and summed up the numbers.

      The most interesting thesis of the AAI study is that, according to the results of the survey, the economy mode, which the companies took to the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, will not be respected by everyone in the next calendar year. <br><br>  According to the survey, in 2016 budgets for advertising and promotion will begin to slowly ‚Äúunfreeze‚Äù, a minority of respondents plan to reduce the budget - 22%, for the current year this figure is 33%.  Leave the budget unchanged plans for half of the companies. <br><br>  But 30% of companies are planning to increase marketing and other advertising expenses, against 38% this year.  This leads to the conclusion that the market is starting a slow recovery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b15/313/71c/b1531371c000eca73b10b993032670c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Pharmacology stands apart from all industries - the dynamics of marketing expenditures in which differs significantly from the average for the market and has grown significantly in 2015 as well as is expected to grow in the next 2016 as well.  But here, too, the growth rate does not exceed 20% from year to year.  Additional interest is the distribution of preferences in various advertising tools from the industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/df9/aed/5b1/df9aed5b1c8097501100e62014967f45.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The editors of "Megamind" requested expert comments and their forecast regarding both poles of the media market. <br><ol><li>  Do you think the Russian share of global network users will grow? </li><li>  Will your share increase only mobile users in runet (now 4%)? </li><li>  Will online advertising be on the growth trajectory in 2016? </li></ol><br>  <b>German Klimenko</b> (Institute for Internet Development): <br><blockquote>  Grow certainly will.  We have extremely poorly mastered Internet retirees and the potential for Internet growth is now in the ‚Äúnew retirees‚Äù. <br><br>  If by mobile users we mean strictly smartphones, then I think that this share will not grow.  The explanation is extremely simple - see paragraph 1. With age, vision does not improve and requires a polite attitude.  The older, the more stationary computers. <br><br>  In relative numbers in comparison with other types of advertising, of course, yes.  In absolute terms, it is unlikely.  Too strong internal processes of economic restructuring. </blockquote><br>  <b>Asya Melkumova</b> , spokesperson for Yandex: <br><blockquote>  Internet advertising is the only segment that shows growth.  View the latest ACAR report - <a href="http://www.akarussia.ru/knowledge/market_size/id6210">www.akarussia.ru/knowledge/market_size/id6210</a> <br><br>  Internet advertising is growing at the expense of constant technology development.  For example, we always offer our clients new tools for working with the audience.  Here are the latest examples - <a href="">advertising.yandex.ru/news/news2015.xml</a> <br><br>  As for mobile devices and desktop, look at this research - <a href="https://yandex.ru/company/researches/2015/ya_internet_regions_2015">yandex.ru/company/researches/2015/ya_internet_regions_2015#ispolzovanieinternetasmobilnyxustrojjstvsmartfonoviplanshetov</a> It is April, but it can be useful. </blockquote><br>  <b>Igor Gladkoborodov</b> , <b>Cob</b> co-founder: <br><blockquote>  All three - yes.  Only a matter of time. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296514/</a></p>
