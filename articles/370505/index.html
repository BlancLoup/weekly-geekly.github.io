  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coal of the second freshness: a new approach to assessing the quality of coal fuel has been developed at NUST ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The properties of coal mined change over time, which greatly affects the quality of coal fuel, increases the cost of electricity, leads to additional environmental damage.  In addition, coal sometimes ignites spontaneously.  Proper assessment of the properties of coal fuel, as well as the risk of spontaneous combustion, are just a few applied aspects of the work performed by a team of scientists from the National Research Technological University "MISiS" under the supervision of Professor Svetlana Epstein. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ffa/ce8/7c1/fface87c1417cfb25fa162a413ec9162.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Scientists of NITU "MISiS" have developed new approaches to the study of the mechanism of oxidation of coal, which can significantly affect the coal industry in Russia, the pricing of the coal market, as well as the ecology of coal regions.  One of the approaches is based on the use of a modified thermogravimetry method (thermal analysis) in the analysis of samples in air and in an inert atmosphere.  The obtained data will help to correctly determine the state of coal during its mining, storage and use, which will increase the efficiency of coal fuel use and thereby reduce the damage from its use.  The fact is that, depending on the terms and conditions of storage, the amount of heat produced per ton of fuel can decrease on average by 20% (for brown coal), which seriously increases the costs of power engineers and the ecology of the regions. <br><br>  A scientific article with research results was published in the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016236117302363"><b>authoritative journal Fuel</b></a> , leading to the publishing group Elsevier.

In addition, as the study showed, for weeks and months (sometimes up to six months), which the extracted fuel spends in the warehouses of the CHP plant between production and use, its characteristics change.  Therefore, for companies purchasing coal on the market, the correct assessment of the product from the point of view of its safety by the tendency to oxidation is very important.  New methods will help develop a classification of coal products, which will make the coal market more civilized and transparent. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>The research of the Physics and Chemistry of Coals research and educational testing laboratory is of great importance for the Russian coal industry</i> ,‚Äù commented <b>Alevtina Chernikova, rector of NITU ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù</b> .  ‚Äú <i>On the basis of the research conducted in the laboratory, more than 25 national and interstate standards in the field of solid mineral fuel and activated carbon have already been developed.</i>  <i>The Physics and Chemistry of Coals Laboratory under the direction of Professor Svetlana Epstein, Doctor of Technical Sciences, is one of the university‚Äôs leading laboratories dealing with waste management and mineral processing, including commissioned by leading coal corporations in Russia</i> . ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/167/5c3/41b/1675c341b72f9cf5a7a24f9f26f6b4d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Svetlana Abramovna Epstein</i> <br><br>  <b>Reference: Epstein Svetlana Abramovna</b> .
