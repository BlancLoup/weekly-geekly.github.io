Slightly apart from the usual cryptocurrency, there are tokens - cryptocurrency, produced by specific projects for specific goals to attract primary funding.  This tool, despite the large number of different crowdsales, is <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hamstermarketplace/blog/344584/">more attractive for long investments</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kq/zg/4i/kqzg4iar6kylchah-j15vrnmxoo.jpeg"><br><br>  HMT Token is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, developed for the trading platform of unique gadgets and electronics Hamster Marketplace.  Tokenization of the Hamster Marketplace, along with the use of the blockchain and AI elements, is one of the first and key elements of the future infrastructure of a self-managed decentralized marketplace.  From the very beginning of the site, HMT tokens will be applied: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  to pay for the service fee of the Hamster Marketplace platform; </li><li>  for sales without commission platform; </li><li>  to pay for internal promo on the Hamster Marketplace; </li><li>  as a pledge to ensure compliance with all requirements for a verified vendor; </li><li>  for discounts on purchases on the Hamster Marketplace platform when paying with tokens; </li><li>  to access additional features of the Hamster Marketplace. </li></ul><br>  The total number of HMT tokens produced will be 20 million, of which 14 million will be released in January 2018 for open sale at $ 2 per coin, at the end of which the unsold and undistributed surplus tokens will be destroyed.

      Users who have passed the personal identification procedure (KYC) will automatically be able to not only store, but also send and receive HMT tokens both on the hmstr.io web wallet and on their essential wallets.  The HMT token will be added to the cryptobirth listings. <br><br>  After launching the beta of the Hamster Marketplace trading platform, the manufacturers represented there will be able to pay for platform services with tokens along with other types of cryptocurrencies and Fiat, as well as receive discounts.  The internal rate of the HMT token used in calculating the number of tokens for paying commissions, internal promo and accessing additional functions of the platform at the time of launching the public beta will be set at $ 10. <br><br>  The market price of the HMT token at the time of the operation will be used to pay for the goods, receive discounts and as collateral.  If the value of the token in the free market rises to 80% of the nominal value, the internal rate of the token on the Hamster Marketplace will be adjusted upwards.  Thus, the owners of HMT tokens will be able to count on a discount on the services of the site at least 20% in comparison with any other payment methods. <br><br><h2>  HMT token owner privileges </h2><br><h3>  1. Ability to pay Hamster Marketplace HMT tokens </h3><br>  Service fee Hamster Marketplace provides the content and development of the platform.  The fee is held by the platform in the form of the minimum possible to ensure the self-sufficiency of the marketplace commission from sales in the currency of purchase - whether it is Fiat or a cryptomonet.  To save on this fee, manufacturers can pay a fee in HMT tokens. <br><br>  The amount of commission in tokens will be calculated at the internal rate (HMT ‚â• $ 10, but not less than 125% of the market price).  A manufacturer who bought HMT in advance at the price of a tokensale, with a discount on a pre-sale or on a crypto-exchange, will be able to save significantly due to the difference between the nominal and real exchange rates of the coin - by increasing the demand for them through their actions. <br><br><h3>  2. Ability to organize without commission </h3><br>  Products purchased on the Hamster Marketplace for HMT tokens are not charged for sales.  Due to this, the seller can provide buyers when paying with HMT tokens a discount from the price in other currencies on the commission size or slightly less to increase their margin. <br><br>  The seller will be able to spend the tokens obtained in this way to pay for promo, commissions for sales in other currencies and other services. <br><br><h3>  3. Means of payment for internal promo on the Hamster Marketplace </h3><br>  Platform specialization in niche manufacturers allows you to avoid direct competition with major or consumer goods.  But the growth of internal competition with the increase in the number of vendors on the marketplace (at least 1000 in 2018, 2000 in 2019) will create a need for tools of internal promo.  On the marketplace sellers will be available: <br><br><ul><li>  priority display in search and promo blocks; </li><li>  banner advertising; </li><li>  the ability to conduct surveys among users; </li><li>  priority hit in the block "Recommended"; </li><li>  email newsletters (for example, ad units in service messages); </li><li>  and other options under development. </li></ul><br>  Payment is possible by both fiat and cryptocurrency, including HMT tokens.  The cost of advertising options in the HMT will be calculated at the domestic rate (HMT ‚â• $ 10), allowing you to save a lot when buying tokens on the open market. <br><br><h3>  4. A pledge to ensure that vendors meet the requirements of the Hamster Marketplace when they are verified. </h3><br>  A vendor that does not score enough points to pass verification on indicators that are not related to product quality or key business processes, and on related parameters (for example, in matters of documentation, licensing, copyright), but guaranteeing the time to correct defects, can begin sales on Hamster Marketplace, leaving a deposit in the HMT tokens. <br><br>  In case of violation of the conditions of the pledge, sales of the vendor on the marketplace are frozen until the complete removal from the site.  After all the conditions are met, the tokens are credited to the vendor‚Äôs account on the marketplace, which he can later use to pay for the site‚Äôs services. <br><br><h3>  5. Zero commission on purchases on the Hamster Marketplace when paying with tokens </h3><br>  HMT tokens provide privileged conditions not only for manufacturers, but also buyers on the site.  Tokens can pay for any purchases on the Hamster Marketplace, even if the HMT is not listed by the seller among the accepted payment instruments.  When paying, HMT is automatically converted by the marketplace into one of the currencies accepted by the seller at the exchange rate. <br><br>  The buyer‚Äôs savings consist in reducing the price of the product by the size of the marketplace commission that is missing when purchasing for HMT within the platform.  The buyer's winnings in money will be the greater, the earlier he acquired HMT tokens - for example, as part of the presale in December 2017 with discounts of up to 40%. <br><br><h3>  6. Access additional features on the Hamster Marketplace. </h3><br>  The owners of HMT tokens will have access to information not only about the products and manufacturers that are represented on the site, but also about the list of projects that are in the process of verification and even about vendors that fell into the ‚Äúbasket‚Äù (about those who were denied access to Hamster Marketplace ).  Also, holders of HMT tokens will have access to sales statistics by product category, including the average check, the total number of purchases and the socio-demographic portrait of Hamster Marketplace buyers, both by product category and entirely by the platform.  This will be unique information for both producers and IT journalists or just fans of new technologies. <br><br><h2>  Pre-sales Hamster Marketplace - the best opportunity to buy HMT for the future </h2><br>  <b>Pre-sales:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  In December 2017, preliminary sales of the Hamster Marketplace are being completed, in which a limited number of HMT tokens can still be purchased for $ 1.8 to December 26 and for $ 1.9 from December 26 to 31. </li><li>  When shopping in the amount from $ 2000 to December 26, a 15% discount is valid, from December 26 to 31 - 7.5%. </li><li>  When shopping for an amount from $ 5000 to December 26, a 20% discount is available, from December 26 to 31 - 10%. </li></ul><br>  The possibility of receiving bonuses for purchases from $ 25,000 and $ 100,000 can be requested by mail info@hmstr.io.  And the participants of the December presale will also receive special conditions that are not available to users who register or make their first purchases only after 2018. <br><br>  <b>Tokensale.</b> <br><br>  In January 2018, Hamster Marketplace tokens will be released for $ 2.  You can book tokens in bulk at a special price by mail to info@hmstr.io. <br><br><hr><br>  <i><b>If you want to get more information about Hamster Marketplace first hand, welcome to our <a href="https://t.me/hmstrRU">Russian-language channel in Telegram</a> .</b></i>  <i><b>You can get acquainted with the project, read White paper and take part in the pre-sale of HMT tokens on our <a href="https://hmstr.io/">official website</a> .</b></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345428/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345428/</a></p>
