  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Ears" for every taste</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year, <s>December 31,</s> a couple of weeks before the New Year, I wonder about what kind of gifts to give to my friends.  Everyone wants to pay the maximum attention, but not much money to spend.  In general, after thinking, I came to the idea that you can give everyone headphones.  In general, I present to you their mini-review. <br>  Maybe some of you use my idea too.  After all, it is cheap, practical, and in fact - unique. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5f4a326c/f21718c5/904f3524/ce8bb242.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For a long time I have not pleased you with Fischer Audio headphones, so why not do it before the New Year.

    <h4>  HS-0003 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/61b05a4d/b7458b54/dd6bb450/6e25bb50.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Technical information:</b> <br>  Frequency range: 20-20000 Hz. <br>  Sensitivity: 106 dB. <br>  Resistance: 32 Ohms. <br>  Input power: 30 mW. <br>  Cable length: 1.25 m. <br>  Color: black / red. <br><br>  Very nice looking headphones.  The combination of red and black looks interesting.  Headphones are completely made of plastic (except for speakers and wires, of course). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0134e1ee/78fbcf5c/e8d28721/7710aaf2.jpg"><br><br>  On the left earpiece is a microphone, which is located directly in front of the mouth.  Unfortunately, it does not bend, but only rotates around the axis of the earpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7a44bd20/e7747f57/f19dfe70/c8c124b8.jpg"><br><br>  The speakers themselves are made quite original: and not round, and not square.  I will not even bother to call this form, because  There is no next textbook on geometry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b41339f2/d11e7948/daae75b6/aa05ec30.jpg"><br><br>  Naturally, you can fit them to your head. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/23ad35d3/694847ad/56a9995b/e53d064e.jpg"><br><br>  Lightweight body provides convenience for long-term use, because  Headphones do not press on the head, but nevertheless, keep well.  High-strength wires with elastic silicone insulation is unlikely to fray soon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/22833360/a623ebdc/44140a6e/24b11f5f.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, I was very pleased that there are replaceable ambushures.  If you look closely at the first picture, you will see that I have ambushures from different sets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d9c76592/9cbc3519/6a2d249f/a6219197.jpg"><br><br>  Well, now, when you scroll to the beginning and come back, stretching your finger a little, we continue. <br><br>  The HS-0003 has a volume control.  True, as for me, it is a bit too big, although, I don‚Äôt argue, it doesn‚Äôt become less convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0b48c4aa/edd817ff/6806513e/b81048cd.jpg"><br><br>  And at the end here is such a two-headed "serpent". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18767296/8e67139e/8816c08e/286a8fff.jpg"><br><br>  As for the sound, then I can call these headphones quite high-end.  Very clear sound and powerful bass, also, the voice is well reproduced.  In these "ears" you can not only chat with friends on Skype, but also quietly listen to music or sounds in games.  The microphone also copes with its task, the sound is transmitted without any special noise and distortion.  In general, I like them as a user.  And comfortable, and beautiful, and not very expensive. <br>  By the way, about the price: they cost 690 p. <br><br>  Comfortable headset, suitable for both boys and girls. <br><br><h4>  Una </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fcec7e12/4695c786/004e2eca/4ada8ba5.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Technical information:</b> <br>  Frequency range: 20-20000 Hz. <br>  Sensitivity: 101 dB. <br>  Resistance: 16 Ohms. <br>  Input power: 50 mW. <br>  Cable length: 1.25 m. <br>  Color: Silver. <br><br>  Unlike previous earpieces, these are absolutely for girls.  No, of course, guys can wear them too, but side glances will be provided. <br><br>  In Una made very beautiful and glamorous clothespin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aebb6ed8/5cca3733/aea5f4d8/0d0ca0f3.jpg"><br><br>  Rhinestones are stuck on the earpiece  They say girls like it when everything is shiny.  Oh, I do not know.  But my eyes hurt from looking at this brilliance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7a846319/1956602f/fb88aaf9/cf6b7689.jpg"><br><br>  The kit also has a carrying case and removable ambushures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2c253500/5f2ecbce/247669ad/e692eb2d.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to a good entourage, Una is quite a good sound.  Yes, I had to overcome myself and listen to them.  No, listen with RHChP bass so that it is clean, it is unlikely to work.  But listening to the player on the road at medium volume is quite.  High frequencies are sometimes swallowed, but in general, the sound quality.  Tested on iPod and Transcend.  In both cases, there were no problems.  The shape is chosen usual, when combined with the correct ambyushuru headphones fit well and fit snugly. <br><br>  Price: from 730 p.  Oddly enough, they are more expensive than the previous headset.  Although, if we take into account the fact that there are rhinestones and different sparkles - then everything is clear. <br><br>  These headphones are more than fully female.  By the way, all the familiar girls who saw them from me squealed with joy and asked to be presented.  Guys, take note. <br><br><h4>  Genesis </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a883c5ab/4ee2d968/c02f2ec5/57ea4ff6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Technical information:</b> <br>  Frequency range: 5-20000 Hz. <br>  Sensitivity: 104 dB. <br>  Resistance: 18 ohms. <br>  Input power: 65 mW. <br>  Cable length: 1.25 m. <br>  Color: Silver. <br><br>  This is how they look upon closer examination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8fbfcf20/44a1c4f0/1bb8cf13/37f5e764.jpg"><br><br>  At first glance it seems, how can they even be stuck in the ears, they are huge and uncomfortable.  However, after I inserted them correctly in my ears, I realized that these are the most comfortable ‚Äúears‚Äù lately.  They sit very tight, do not fall out, and are almost not felt in the ear.  It feels like the sound goes straight to the brain.  This is unreal cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/43517b8f/4734db1b/259d157e/01604737.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the shape of the headphones, there is nothing unusual.  The most trivial 3.5mm plug.  But happy wire.  It is for notorious extremes: made of fabric braid, so that it will be almost impossible to grind it <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b5b84be8/79d38400/cb8d6f06/76234980.jpg"><br><br>  Unless, such storage box and additional ambushures became a good addition. <br>  It is convenient to carry it in the bag, the headphones are not tangled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/35f45d7e/86f17679/e1c22df7/d3ce14dc.jpg"><br><br>  This is how the whole set looks closed.  By the way, there are 5 more pairs of ambyushur included.  For different tastes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d74c8bf5/12e984ab/e2a269df/f58fd257.jpg"><br><br>  The sound of this model is better than the previous ones.  First, the bass is played very clearly and succinctly.  It's great because  when the headphones fit snugly and play well, it creates a feeling of complete immersion.  Secondly, the sound itself is very clear, without any cracks or hiss.  The design of the headphones allows you to insert them into your ears so that you practically do not feel this sound even better. <br><br>  Price: 1790r.  Taking into account all the advantages, I think that this is quite an adequate price.  Although, in my opinion, still headphones-plugs should not cost more than a thousand rubles.  But this is my subjective opinion. <br><br>  These are the interesting models here.  I think everyone here liked something different. <br><br>  <b>Good luck!</b>  <b>And with the coming!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110374/</a></p>
