It is a large flightless bird of the celesch family.  Faded extinct in the middle of the 19th century.  As <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Wikipedia tells us</a> , this bird was the only modern representative of the genus Pinguinus. <br><br>  She died not because of natural disasters, but because of the fact that she hunted people.  Meat, fluff - everything went in turn.  Already by the middle of the 16th century, the populations of the eiderdown in various regions began to decline sharply.  And in 1852, a single individual was seen on the Grand Newfoundland Bank.  Looks like she was the last, or one of the last in the world.  This is one of the first types of living organisms that have been completely destroyed by man.  Now scientists want to fix everything and return the archery with the help of the latest achievements of science.  Namely - with the help of genetic engineering. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  American experts of the research organization Revive &amp; Restore presented their plan for the revival of the bird species destroyed many years ago.

      The plan is simple - extract DNA samples from fossil remains or samples of bird tissue that are stored in the vaults of some museums, and use DNA to revive the entire species.  Specific regions of the wingless arachnid genome will be introduced into the genome of the close relative of the species, the eider (Alca torda).  After that, the fertilized embryo will be implanted in another bird, which will be able to carry an egg of the required size.  Most likely, it will be a goose.  Yes, the usual goose, which clearly does not belong to endangered species.  The fact is that the now living auk is too small to carry an egg, from which a young wingless auk can hatch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be0/ccb/32b/be0ccb32b93054fc739ab67db7e9bed5.jpg"><br><br>  According to Matt Ridley, wingless auk is one of the few species of flightless birds in the northern hemisphere that have played an important role in the ecosystem of a number of regions.  "It would be great to return this view," - says the scientist.  It was decided to conduct the experiment on the Farn archipelago.  Here wingless auk once existed beautifully.  And the local ecosystem is unlikely to be greatly affected if the bird population of this species is restored on the archipelago. <br><br>  Biologists argue that the restoration of the species may be important for the ecosystem of the archipelago.  In addition, it may be important for humans, since the restoration of a bird once destroyed can serve as an example of the possibility of the revival of animals of other species destroyed by man.  Once representatives of the species of wingless auk (Pinguinus impennis) inhabited the coastal zones of a number of islands in the North Atlantic.  These birds looked like penguins, whose relatives are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41e/657/7de/41e6577dedac50a974f28ab1aa6a1c10.jpg"><br><br>  In previous centuries, man became the cause of the extinction of not only this species, but also the birds of a dodo or a number of other species.  According to some scientists, these animals can come back to life, if you use a number of genetic engineering techniques.  Other experts have raised concerns about whether it is possible to return the extinct species to their former habitats.  Perhaps, skeptics say, this will lead to the degradation of modern ecosystems that exist in these regions.  It is quite difficult to answer the question whether this is so, but many scientists say that there is no danger. <br><br>  As a matter of fact, nobody knows yet.  But, perhaps, soon there will be a chance to get an answer to this question. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396971/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396971/</a></p>
