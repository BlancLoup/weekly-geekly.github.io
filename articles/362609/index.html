Fantasy, adventure - favorite genres.  Until now, there is a large science fiction library at home.  Due to financial difficulties, it now has to be sold off, but nonetheless.  By the way, these people are pleased, who come to the ad somewhere on the other end of Moscow for the right book, which cannot be found in stores.  Neither comics, nor films with TV shows or computer games do not develop their imagination in this way, they do not contribute to the assimilation of language and literacy, like books.  ‚ÄúThe book is a source of knowledge, the book is the best gift‚Äù - for me these sayings are not ironic cliches. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Learning without books is also unthinkable - school textbooks, an institute, then professional literature.  With the advent of the Internet, many resources, blogs, interactive textbooks have appeared.  But they have not yet come up with a replacement for a good, well-written and well-structured book.

      I saw the first advertising of the e-ink technology back in the 90s, and was terribly pleased with such progress.  With impatience, like many, I was waiting for the opportunity to have on hand a huge library that fits in a small device, with a screen that would not hurt my eyes. <br><br>  The path of e-ink was long and difficult, the first book appeared only in 2004, then there was the heyday of electronic readers - there were many different ones.  But now for some reason they are getting smaller.  There were books with a touch screen, players, devices with two screens - LCD and e-ink ... But the popularity of electronic books is falling. <br><br>  Whether people are disappointed in technology.  Yes, e-ink has its drawbacks.  Big update time, a small amount of colors (color displays exist, but they are exotic).  But there are advantages.  With daily dense reading of the book you need to charge it a maximum of once a week.  As for the flowers - why are there so many of them?  After all, for reading the text, two colors are enough, this is not comics. <br><br>  Whether people began to read less.  Now everyone carries the Internet with them, and the flow of information from social networks and news feeds - although it is low-grade, it satisfies the brain's need for novelty, and leaves no room for the other.  Unfortunately.  People read what others write the same, and average their level - instead of reading good works and pulling the level up. <br><br>  I have a great Amazon Kindle DX reader with a large screen.  But I still miss her.  I would like a screen the size of a real book of a large format - one in which voluminous textbooks on computer topics are usually published, for example.  If proportionally reduce the page of such a book, the text becomes too small.  If you expand the book and read half a page, it is inconvenient - especially when the text is formatted with columns, several columns per page. <br><br>  My ideal e-book is with a large screen that accommodates a full-sized A4 page that reads any known text format, with open source software, and without any gadgets that shorten battery life and are not inherent in the book initially. <br><br>  In any topic dedicated to e-book, I found support from people who would ‚Äúalso buy‚Äù a similar device if it were on the market.  But, obviously, marketers of large companies do not recommend them to sell such a product - either they do not see the point in it, or, in their opinion, it will not be in demand.  Contradiction? <br><br>  If it turns out that there is still demand, I would gladly have organized a crowdfunding of such a project on one of the suitable services.  I ask you to share your thoughts on the need for such a device. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362609/</a></p>
