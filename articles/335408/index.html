Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The trial version of this article has previously been published by me. <br><br><h2>  I Introduction </h2><br><blockquote>  I want to share a theory that I just created. <br>  Agent Smith (The Matrix Film) <br></blockquote>  A little bit about yourself.  At the dawn of my career, I worked as a programmer for a long time.  Later, when it became boring for me to simply encode, I retrained as a systems analyst, simultaneously performing the functions of a project manager.  Recently, the circumstances were such that, together with our partners, we created a small IT company. <br><br>  I had to pick up personnel in my team before, but it‚Äôs one thing to hire people in a company where you are an employee, and it‚Äôs quite another when you let strangers, people you don‚Äôt know in your brainchild.  Willy-nilly, you wonder how to make employees not only formally pay for their work, for the money they pay, but try to bring something personal into the common cause: important for them and at the same time useful for everyone?

      Obviously, here you need some special tool that will allow you to gather a group of singles and turn them into a team of supporters.  Moreover, this tool should be not just a club where like-minded people hang out, but a way of qualitatively and effectively solving production problems. <br><br>  Since, by the nature of my activity, I have become accustomed to approaching problem solving in a systematic way, then in this situation, I made an excursion into the foundations of sociology and conducted a blitz analysis of the subject area.  Information turned out to be very much, and she shed light on some of the points that were previously not obvious to me.  But still, I could not find ready-made integrated solutions that would allow me to build my own ‚ÄúOz country‚Äù.  So, I decided to systematize the information I extracted, dilute it a little with my personal experience and design this ‚Äúmagic‚Äù tool myself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In implementing my ideas, I used all the same tricks and skills that I usually practice in my professional activities for analyzing and designing automated systems.  And that's what I did. <br><br><h4>  For whom and for what this article is intended: </h4><br>  In the books on management [1], [2], the sections on efficiency, most often, are devoted to the glorification of the role of the individual in achieving the goals of the organization.  In this context, perhaps the most important characteristic of a manager‚Äôs success is the presence of charisma (special talent, personal exclusivity in intellectual, spiritual, or some other respect), which pushes others to follow him, and more often just to obey.  From a pragmatic point of view, charisma helps its owner to realize his ideas, plans, ideas, using the potential of the people around him.  Consequently, the main leitmotif of books dedicated to leadership: if you want to succeed, finally engage your charisma. <br><br>  Is it possible to even develop this very personal charisma in a person?  In essence, among the distinctive features of charismatic people are: <br><br><ol><li>  Self-confidence; </li><li>  The ability to infect people with your ideas; </li><li>  Sensitivity to the emotional state of other people; </li><li>  Manage your emotions; </li><li>  The ability to vividly express their thoughts; </li></ol><br>  Of course, if desired, a person is able to cultivate these qualities in himself.  Although, if up to a mature age they did not fully manifest themselves, then most likely, by nature or by virtue of a certain upbringing, they come into conflict with his inner ‚ÄúI‚Äù.  In such situations, attempts to imitate charisma will be accompanied by constant internal encounter with oneself, or, at best, an attempt to challenge oneself.  But one way or another, the result will be the same ‚Äî an obsessive sense of unfulfilled debt: - ‚Äú <b>It</b> ‚Äù is unpleasant for me, I want to engage in others, but I MUST get ready and go to perform ‚Äú <b>It</b> ‚Äù. <br><br>  It is not always so easy to admit to yourself that you are in a similar situation.  Fairy tales with deep meaning help sometimes to understand their feelings and not to lie, even to themselves.  Plunging into them, often you catch analogies with reality.  Remember, like E. Schwartz in ‚ÄúThe Ordinary Miracle‚Äù, when the king was afraid that he would be bothered with the truth about the state of affairs in the kingdom, about the princess's illness, and he tries to escape from all this: <br><br>  <b><i>First Minister</i></b> Your Majesty ... <br>  Goodbye <b><i>King</i></b> , goodbye! <br>  <b><i>First Minister</i></b> Your Majesty, listen to me. <br>  <b><i>King</i></b> I want to sleep. <br>  ... <br>  Because I'm degenerating, you are a fool!  Books should be read and not require the king of what he can not do.  Will the princess die?  Well, let‚Ä¶ <br>  Water! <br>  <b><i>Emilia</i></b> Do not give him water, let him listen to the truth! <br><br>  Under the yoke of such discomfort, sooner or later, the sufferer asks the question: is it worth it? <br><br>  In this article I want to propose a different approach for solving such problems.  Let's get to this topic from the other side.  We will not focus on the leader and his qualities leading the team forward, but the atmosphere, the aura that a person (or a group of people) emit around themselves, drawing along like-minded people.  And what do we see from this angle?  From this point of view, it is the attractiveness of some artificially created social education (of the World) that attracts the inhabitants you need.  As a result, you can rally people to achieve your goals not with your eccentricity, but with your own interests, which can be satisfied in the World created by you.  An example of this is the social networks that allowed individuals who do not have leadership qualities to draw people's attention to their virtual world and solve some of their tasks.  The similarity of such a virtual world can be created not only in computer networks or in fairy tales, but also in real society.  In the future, at the mention of this phenomenon, I will use the term - Social Organism. <br><br>  To summarize the above: to solve your goals and tasks that require organizing people into a team of associates, you need to learn how to create a suitable Social Organism that is as attractive as possible for each member of the team.  In this difficult matter, as well as possible, the ability to simulate reality, which allows reality itself to give a ‚Äúmodel appearance‚Äù, can be useful.  Further more, reciprocity can arise in these relations: if a participant finds a Social Organism attractive, then he himself most often becomes attractive to the Social Organism. <br><br>  The simplest example: the creation and operation of a small organization that has recently been formed, which still does not have a recognizable name, ambitions and competitive fees.  What can attract employees to it?  From my experience I will call: comfort, serenity, some kind of seclusion, but growth prospects, and a desire for development, but then, not today, a little later, when we get stronger, we will grow up ... In fact, the founder of this organization creates a kind of Social Organism in which they live everyone who takes it - in this case, employees.  Of course, over time, it should change, because employees, coming to the organization, ultimately want to satisfy their personal needs.  In addition to improving material well-being, it can be: learning new things, improving professional skills and security, a way of communication or recognition, a hobby, etc.  Therefore, their gratitude expressed in the form of: timely and high-quality completed tasks, non-indifference to the problems of organization, mutual help from associates, etc., depends directly on how comfortable it is constantly living in this community. <br><br>  If you are interested, raised in the introduction of issues, let's understand further ... <br><br><h2>  II Definition of the Concept of Social Organism </h2><br><blockquote>  - What is reality?  And how to define it? <br>  ‚ÄîThe whole set of sensations: visual, tactile, olfactory - these are receptor signals, electrical impulses perceived by the brain. <br>  Morphius (Film "The Matrix") </blockquote><br>  As mentioned above, this article addresses the issues of building social education (a Social Organism) as a way to effectively organize people to achieve certain personal or collective goals that are different from the business goals of an enterprise.  And the fact that such communities, most often, improve the climate in the enterprise and improve the quality of the organization‚Äôs business processes is most likely a bonus that can be set off as an asset. <br><br>  So, we will consider the phenomenon of the <b>Social Organism</b> from different angles. <br><br><h3>  1. General characteristics of the Social Organism </h3><br>  In order to meet the term Social Organism in the text, in the imagination everyone would have about the same picture, let's give it a definition: <br><br>  A social organism is a combination of various aspects of the life activity of a certain community, the interaction of which gives it a holistic character and is determined by the goals of its formation.  It is characterized by trends socially accepted in this society and focused on changing social reality. <br><br>  According to G. Spencer [3], like biological organisms, social can also: <br><br><ul><li>  Grow and grow in size, while complicating its internal structure; </li><li>  As a result of evolution, some social organisms may develop, while others may die or be absorbed by stronger ones; </li><li>  During their existence, social organisms can pass from birth to becoming, aging and death.  This theory is well disclosed by I. Adizes [4]; </li><li>  After the death of the social organism as a whole, its individual parts can continue functioning as independent organisms; </li></ul><br>  Notice, in the modern world, the characteristic ‚ÄúLiving‚Äù is more common next to the word Beer.  Although the social community, in my opinion, deserves much more of this epithet to itself. <br><br>  It turned out to be even more interesting to consider the concept of Social Organism through the prism of the theory of projection perception.  No wonder that in his definition we used the phrase: ‚Äúa change in social reality‚Äù.  From this point of view, the Social Organism acts as a psychological tool that makes its participants perceive incentives and events occurring in the community - as their own expectations, needs, desires, etc.  It also contributes to involuntarily attributing to oneself beliefs, values, or other subjective processes promoted in the Social Organization.  From this point of view, the community in general looks like a tool for manipulating people.  Nietzsche wrote: ‚ÄúOnly his thoughts, not external circumstances, make a person unhappy or happy.  By controlling his thoughts, he controls his happiness. ‚Äù  In this context, thoughts for the sensation of human happiness help to manage the Social Organism and it is important that this tool is used for the benefit of the participants themselves, and not for the benefit of the manipulator.  Otherwise, the lives of people trapped in such a trap are replaced only by imagination, immersed in the speculation of a swindler. <br><br><h3>  2. External environment of the Social Organism </h3><br>  In order to proceed to the analysis of the vital activity of a Social Organism, let us first define all those with whom it interacts and everything that affects it in one way or another.  Since we have embarked on the firm position of considering the community as a living organism, its environment can be considered Ecology, and the main object of influence is the organization within which a Social Organism exists. <br><br>  So, how does the organization and the social organism relate?  Considering an organization as a system, it can be represented as a set of three significant subsystems: material (buildings, equipment, resources, documentation, etc.), biological (people) and social (rules of conduct, traditions, corporate ethics, etc.) ) see figure 1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/423/6f9/089/4236f90895ec4051a3a6eb622abe9802.jpg"><br>  Figure 1 - Organization Subsystems <br><br>  Therefore, in this article, speaking about the Social Organism, we will nevertheless realize that it is an integral part of something larger (the Organization).  And changes in it will greatly affect the entire organization.  Therefore, by developing a Social Organism, we can influence the development of an organization <br><br>  It should also be borne in mind that the Social Organism does not exist in an organizational vacuum.  He is surrounded by other Social Organisms, both inside and outside the organization, exerting this or that influence. <br><br><h3>  3. The structure of the presentation of the social organism </h3><br>  The very same social organism in its essence can also be decomposed (divided into its component parts).  We use the model of Joe Owen division into components of management [5]. <br><br>  In my opinion, this three-dimensional model is equally well suited for identifying segments of impact in a community: 1) The rational world, 2) The emotional world, 3) The political world, see fig.2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/470/c72/5f7/470c725f78324cf884e50eb0b520030f.jpg"><br>  Figure 2 - Social Body Subsystems <br><br>  The first two segments are discussed in the literature quite often, but the role of the political world in the life of the community, related to aspects: morality, the struggle for survival, the use of levers of power, etc.  due attention is rarely given. <br><br>  In the future, when designing a social organism, we will determine the functions that it should perform.  Each function will be attributed to one or another segment of the impact.  Thus, on the one hand, we will be able to make sure that we have covered all aspects of community activity, and on the other hand, we will understand which function and which segment has the greatest impact. <br><br><h3>  4. Purpose and Limits of the Social Organism </h3><br>  The main distinctive feature of each such social education, affecting its life cycle, are the goals of its creation. <br><br>  Therefore, before starting to create a new Social Organism, in which there is a need, first we will answer the questions: what do we want to achieve as a result and what benefits do we want from this?  It is also important to immediately determine by what criteria we will be able to evaluate the success of this ‚Äúcreation‚Äù. <br><br>  For example, I woke up in the morning in a good mood and decided to create a company that produces a certain product or service.  A good start ... And why do I need all this: <br><br><ol><li>  Satisfy your ambitions as a businessman by building a successful venture; </li><li>  Satisfy your ambitions as a specialist in the field related to the production of a selected product or service by creating a competitive product; </li><li>  Earn money for a decent, comfortable existence; </li><li>  Satisfy a market that is in need of a product or service manufactured by an enterprise, bringing it to the consumer; </li></ol><br>  We will be realistic, in order to implement this project I need to attract people.  And in order to implement the project effectively, as we assumed earlier, it is necessary to immerse these people in a Social Organism - a certain environment for their comfortable living.  And not only employees, but also all interested parties (contact persons of suppliers, checking from tax, etc.) can enter the number of inhabitants. <br><br>  So after all, why exactly does our project need this environment?  Define the purpose of its creation: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/86b/c42/f6f/86bc42f6f73746e9b1b6e9a02f5a8fd4.jpg"><br><br>  This approximate set of goals can be replenished and adjusted in the process of formation of a social organism. <br><br><h3>  5. Borders of the Social Organism </h3><br>  By building such a community, we cannot cover the whole world.  No, we certainly could, but: firstly, it is very expensive, and secondly, probably, it does not make sense.  And the world itself, after all, can be against it.  Obviously you need to outline for yourself some kind of framework, for which you should not go. <br><br>  Determining the boundaries in which the Social Organism will function, it is necessary to make a start from own needs and opportunities.  It is necessary to take into account that, pushing the boundaries of the community‚Äôs influence, we not only increase its appetites in resources, but also complicate the relationship and interrelationships in it.  And this, in turn, may entail a loss of a common understanding of the very principles of the vital activity of a social organism. <br><br>  The lack of understanding by the community of all processes and events occurring in it leads to its unpredictability and loss of harmony.  In my opinion, with collective interaction it is always better to feel a certain inevitability than to wait for inevitable surprises. <br><br>  In the example we are considering, the created environment should not extend its influence beyond the organization in which it operates.  Although there are options when the company, for example, helps the family of its employee, receiving in return the loyalty of its members.  But we have not set such a goal before ourselves, so we will leave it beyond the borders of the Social Organism in question. <br><br><h3>  6. Functions of a Social Organism </h3><br>  Having defined our goals and delineated the boundaries of a formed community, it is possible to predetermine the functions with which we should endow it.  Once again I want to emphasize that the functions of the Social Organism will differ from the overall business processes of the Organization (Enterprise), since they have radically different goals.  Therefore, in further reasoning, we will reject all the mechanistic and structural aspects and focus only on the social and ethical ones. <br><br>  According to G. Spencer [3] ‚ÄúThe social organism‚Äù can be represented as three main organ systems (another three-dimensional dimension): Management (Regulation), Production (Maintenance) and Distribution (Stimulation).  Let's take this classification as a basis and group the functions that the Social Organism we are considering should perform: <br><br>  1. Management and Regulation <br>  1.1.  To accept and exclude participants of the Social Organism; <br>  1.1.1.  Adapt new members to the habitat; <br>  1.1.2.  Reduce the stresses of a social organism when a participant leaves; <br>  1.2.  Communicate to each participant of the Social Organism - the actual rules, standards and conditions for its functioning and motivate the participants to share them sincerely; <br>  1.3.  Respond to environmental changes; <br>  1.3.1.  Regulate the functioning of the social organism in its qualitative and quantitative change; <br>  1.3.2.  To motivate participants to discuss changes in the rules for the functioning of a social organism that help it develop; <br>  1.4.  To redistribute areas of responsibility between the participants in order to achieve the maximum result of joint activities, taking into account the basic rules and limitations of the life of the Social Organization; <br>  1.5.  Cultural and Ethical Coordination <br>  1.5.1.  To determine value reference points for participants; <br>  1.5.2.  Identify cultural norms in the environment; <br>  2. Production and Maintenance <br>  2.1.  To interest all participants of the Social Organism in obtaining the best result from joint activities.  Including to interest everyone in achieving the best result by the other participants in their areas of responsibility; <br>  2.2.  Suppress conflicts in the environment, supporting only healthy competition; <br>  3. Distribution and Stimulation <br>  3.1.  To increase the attractiveness of the participants' stay in the Social Organization; <br>  3.1.1.  Provide a comfortable environment in the middle; <br>  3.1.2.  Provide social protection against external threats to participants; <br>  3.1.3.  Protect participants from the part of everyday, everyday concerns. <br><br><h3>  7. Results </h3><br>  So let's summarize the work done.  In this chapter, we looked at the multifaceted phenomenon of the Social Organism on all sides: <br><br><ul><li>  Revealed his purpose </li><li>  Revealed its basic properties and characteristics </li><li>  Defined the environment in which it should function </li><li>  Spread it out into its component parts, defining the structure </li><li>  Outlined and fixed the boundaries of its impact </li><li>  Determined the functions that it should have </li></ul><br>  But simply knowing about a problem or even an opportunity does not solve the problem itself and does not bring opportunity to life. <br><br>  It would seem that here we already understand the essence of the Social Organism and most of its aspects, but how now to take advantage of all its advantages.  After all, it is still necessary to somehow create.  And for this, it is necessary to determine concrete methods and measures that will allow us to put the Social Organism into practice.
