  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Communications will create a fund to finance projects in IT at 5%</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To support domestic Internet companies and startups on the foreign market, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media plans to create an information technology development fund with a capital of 5 billion rubles.  Within this fund, there are 4-6 companies with an annual budget for a specific project of more than 100 million rubles.  will receive loans in the amount of 70 million rubles.  up to 500 million rubles.  Additional 16-24 projects with a budget of more than 60 million rubles.  will be able to apply for loans on concessional terms in the amount of 30 million rubles.  up to 300 million rubles.  at 5% per annum.  Along with obtaining preferential credit conditions, such companies can be exempted from paying taxes. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  All these bonuses will cost the IT business dearly - in exchange for benefits, the Ministry of Communications wants to get exclusive rights to IT-development.  For comparison, at a similar rate, entrepreneurs can get loans from the Industry Development Fund.  In 2015, among such projects was the domestic processor "Baikal", which received 500 million rubles.  and a loan for the production of computers and processors Kraftway for 300 million rubles. <br><br>  The main areas of the fund to finance will be companies in the segment of mobile operating systems, database management systems, corporate operating systems and systems for managing cloud infrastructure.  It also indicates the possibility of financing virtualization projects based on Russian processors - but so far their competitiveness on the world market remains in question.

      At the same time, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media already has a Rosinfokominvest background, attracting 1.45 billion rubles.  budget funds in 2006.  This fund was created at the Ministry of Communications and Communications under the leadership of Leonid Reiman, only to this day it has not made any major investments.  As part of the import substitution program, the fund intends to invest in software for the corporate and government sector. <br><br>  In the past few years, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media tried to actively modify the financing of Russian programmers - from 10% of the software sales collection, and subsequently to the abolition of VAT benefits for IT companies.  The Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance have become active opponents of these bills - calling the collection and control of incoming funds the main problem. <br><br>  One of the adopted innovations was the creation of a registry of domestic software.  As part of this, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media provided documents of regulatory acts in February 2015, and the relevant law on this term was considered in the State Duma.  This registry contains 86 domestic applications and other products, and the Ministry of Communications is going to add 155 new solutions to it. <br><br>  So far, the benefits of such innovations are questionable, and the majority of IT companies oppose the introduction of additional taxes on income and the abolition of tax incentives.  The main income now such companies still get when selling their own goods abroad, which will make for them the domestic market even less attractive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299510/</a></p>
