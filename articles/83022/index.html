  <section class="page js-page"><h1>rave</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 1984, about 1,000 devices were connected to the networks.  In 1992, 1,000,000.  In 2008 there are 1,000,000,000. <br>  The speed of connecting devices to a single network is growing exponentially. <br>  A selection of newspapers The Washington Post for one week contains more information than an 18th century reader has received in a lifetime. <br>  I myself look at an average of 100 to 400 pages of information per day, of which I read 50-70 percent. <br>  In any educational institutions all the knowledge that we give is already outdated.  And all innovations in the first year of study, by the end of training, become obsolete and are replaced by new ones. <br>  Life began to resemble a whirlpool of events.  We are literally flooded by the flow of information. <br><br>  This is the second worldwide flood. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is impossible to isolate oneself from this - it will be tantamount to a solitary cell, in which water erodes walls.  You hear that something is happening outside, you are bored and curious.  And as soon as one small stream flows through, the walls break, and we are carried away by this stream. <br>  And it turns out that the most important thing in the modern world is to join the stream that carries the foundation of our life and form around the streams of our interests. <br>  And do not choke. <br>  But, unfortunately, not everyone finds their threads.  Such units.  The rest float in other streams and choke on them. <br>  So it turns out that it is not they who choose the streams, but the streams choose them.  They give them food and get nothing in return. <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  How do you know the weather outside? <br>  Look out the window?  See the weather forecast on TV?  Check on the Internet? <br>  Hardly the first!

      How do you communicate with other people?  Personally over a cup of tea?  Most likely, virtually via skype or twitter or blog. <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  You do not start your day with breakfast with your family, but by reading an email.  You are reading your plan for the day you have been caring for. <br>  And finish it the same way. <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  Previously, in order to feed the family, a man hunted mammoths and eventually destroyed them.  But he was happy! <br>  Now he presses the buttons in some program whose purpose he knows (which is good) or understands (which is rare), but he usually does not know how to do it. <br>  Do you think he is happy? <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  You send a message to a work colleague via ICQ, although he is sitting at the next table. <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  This modern world is a matrix! <br><br>  You are reading this document on a computer or phone screen while sitting in an office, not in a cheap newspaper for 10 cents and sitting in a cafe. <br>  Because I myself connected to it! <br><br>  Curiosity gnaws at you - ‚ÄúWhat else is she hiding?‚Äù And you spend all your time on finding yourself in a fictional world - invented things. <br>  For you, the virtual thing is more tangible than the real thing.  You voluntarily give up your freedom, in exchange for being in a world invented by you. <br>  And do not say that it is not so! <br><br>  You are all connected to the matrix, the matrix that you create and without which you can no longer live.  And you do not know how. <br>  You cannot disconnect from it because you depend on it.  And hate her! <br>  And do not say that it is not so! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83022/</a></p>
