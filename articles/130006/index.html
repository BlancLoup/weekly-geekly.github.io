  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to avoid problems with firmware LG P500 Optimus One</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr.  I'm not in the best of spirits right now, and for hell of good reason - my LG P500 Optimus One has turned into a brick (does not turn on).  The funny thing is that this is happening the second time, I <i>just yesterday</i> took the phone from the warranty repair, where it was sent after the previous unsuccessful firmware.  In general, I can officially be considered a <s>Krivoruk idiot,</s> an experienced killer of Optimus, and I would like to share this experience (in the context of ‚Äúhow not to do it‚Äù).  So that from my double attack on the rake there was at least some benefit. <br><br>  Most of the theses cited under the cut are fairly commonplace, but if you are going to flash the P500 through KDZ (unofficial flasher) in the future, I advise you to go there anyway. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Story </h2><br>  LG Optimus One I have since February this year.  For the first time it was stitched (with an official updater) immediately after purchase, about a week later Root and Custom Recovery were received, in six months I looked at several custom firmware, there were no serious problems.  The problems started when Android 2.3.3 was released.  It is not installed via Custom Recovery, it seemed to me a bad idea to try to work through the official updater because the custom firmware was installed, and I decided to flash the phone using KDZ. <br><br>  The first ‚Äúbrick‚Äù was completely on my conscience - it was late at night, I was full of confidence (before everything was perfectly sewed) and after the first unsuccessful firmware I thought that I should pull the SIM card out of the phone.  Which is under the battery.  Epic Fail.  :) Naturally, the phone did not turn on anymore - when it‚Äôs lost bootloader, it shows no signs of life at all.

      I'm not proud of this act, but I took the phone to the seller (a large retail network store) and they accepted it for warranty repairs, which took six weeks.  The phone came back from repair with another serial (which suggests that the entire system board was being replaced), but unfortunately, it is still on the old Android 2.2.1.  It categorically did not suit me, and I decided (in vain, in vain!) To complete the work begun before the repair. <br><br>  I think my main mistake is that the firmware was installed from the same laptop on which the first brick was obtained.  She failed again.  After a certain number of attempts, I decided to continue working on another computer.  And there, after installing the phone drivers and rebooting the computer (the phone remained connected via USB), it was <i>no longer detected</i> .  All subsequent attempts to launch the update ended with a message that the phone was not detected, that is, despite the fact that it was in Emergency Mode, it was impossible to reach it.  After removing the battery, of course, the phone is no longer included at all.  Game over. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br><h3>  1. Do not be optimistic </h3><br>  Many are accustomed not to delve particularly into the instructions, press all the buttons in a row and hope for the best.  Do not.  The programs for installing the firmware (which is the official flasher, which is unofficial) are very crooked and buggy, so do not hope that they will forgive your mistakes. <br><br><h3>  2. Do not hurry </h3><br>  Download in advance all the necessary software.  Install everything you need on the computer - drivers, additional libraries, etc.  Charge the phone battery completely.  Carefully (and not diagonally), read the instructions for installing the update, look at the comments of users who have used it, pay special attention to reports of problems (the most popular, by the way - forgot to disable LG modems in devices).  Choose a convenient time so that you do not have to be distracted by other matters during the firmware process. <br><br><h3>  3. Try to use the official update. </h3><br>  Yes, KDZ provides a bit more options - for example, rolling back to the old version of the firmware, installing the firmware intended for another region.  But with the official updater there is less chance of killing the phone "to death", without the possibility of loading even in Emergency Mode. <br><br><h3>  4. Emergency Mode - this is serious.  Very, b # $% s seriously, really. </h3><br>  This is in the instructions, do not repeat my mistake and remember - if something went wrong when installing the firmware in Emergency Mode, turning off the phone (by pulling out the battery, otherwise it does not come out of this mode), you will receive a completely faulty and unrepairable device . <br>  The exception is cases when the firmware process <i>did not start</i> (for example, the phone was not detected normally in KDZ, which happens if you do not disable LG modems in the device list). <br><br>  If the memory overwriting started and ended unsuccessfully - understand what the problem is, eliminate its causes and re-do the firmware.  To succumb to the temptation to see "and maybe a ride," as you already understood, is not worth it.  :) <br><br>  Personal advice from me - if the firmware failed, and you cannot determine why - try to repeat the procedure <i>from another computer</i> , carefully and carefully, following each step of the instructions.  It is better to prepare a spare computer in advance. <br><br><h2>  What to do if all the same "brick" </h2><br>  Until recently, there was only one way out - the official service center and the replacement of the motherboard.  If you managed to convince the seller that you didn‚Äôt do anything and the guarantee case - your karma (real) suffered, if you didn‚Äôt succeed - the wallet, and quite seriously, by 4-5 thousand rubles.  Today, you can try to contact the experts using the RIFF Box - a gizmo that allows you to fill the firmware by connecting directly to the terminals of the elements on the motherboard.  By the way, if someone from habrauzerov with such a thing is familiar, I will be very grateful for the help (including financially). <br><br>  Be careful and cautious.  All successful firmware. <br><br>  <b>Upd.:</b> Useful comments: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/130006/">1.</a> A person who has a RIFF Box <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/130006/">2.</a> Link to the manual for solving the problem with a phone that is not defined in Emergency Mode. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130006/</a></p>
