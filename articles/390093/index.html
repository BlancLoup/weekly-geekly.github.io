A month ago, they just wanted to buy tickets for a battle of robots, but suddenly they remembered that they themselves had studied at Baumanka and could easily get to the show for free, as participants, they only need to make their own robot.

Dmitry failed to complete such a complex university, but succeeded in opening several of his own businesses, one of which is the sale and installation of solar power plants.  Boris successfully graduated from Baumanka and the department ‚ÄúDynamics and Strength of Machines‚Äù and most of the time he works as a calculation engineer.  Well, in his free time he helps Dmitry. <br><br>  But at the time of our battles, they decided to take up a more serious matter and assemble their first combat robot.  It is important to note that they are new but they are not a stranger to the topic - both grew up on <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B_%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">Robot Wars</a> on TV and it seems only because of him they went to study at Baumanka, how else can you choose the chair of the dynamics and durability of the machines?  Now the circle is closed and the Solarbotans finally realize their childhood dream and will themselves be in the arena of the battle of robots. <br><br>  Now the description of the robot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/60a/19b/6f660a19b673485d9564dc9aba5d6412.jpg"><br><br>  We are new to the Bronebot competition.  Therefore, after analyzing tons of videos, photos, articles and reviewing all the ‚ÄúBattle of the Robots‚Äù, both our and foreign, it was decided to create the simplest and most effective design.  And yes, the time factor was of course decisive!  At that time, on the website on the back of the report, we observed a figure of 36 days. <br><br>  And so the main thing - the concept.  Main ideas: Since the most effective weapon in the arena is a simple turn-over, our robot must be able to move both in the normal position and after the coup;  minimum clearance;  all basic elements of the robot must be reliably protected;  weapons - peaks on pneumatics. <br><br>  Next - the way to travel.  Everything is simple - 4 wheels, 4 electric motors.  The required engine power has not yet been determined.  It all comes down to finance - I‚Äôm going to optimize and install smaller engines (about 1.2‚Äì1.4 kW total power).  And Dmitry wants to charge in full - 4 electric motors of 700 watts each.  Wheels independent and not rotary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2a/991/43c/f2a99143cdf146a6a9a443c0cd25f9bf.jpeg"><br><br>  The case - a welded frame from a different thin-walled profile.  Light and durable.  For the frame, preliminary sketches were made and a strength calculation was performed.  In general, I think there was no mistake, and she will withstand all imaginable and inconceivable (although this is unlikely) load.  The most important thing is to raise your skill from a welder of 2 digits to a welder of 3 discharges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/130/bcc/51f/130bcc51fb1441d691a2c9583b364f76.jpg"><br><br>  Weapon  The main weapon - two peaks on pneumatic cylinders.  Here we are still in development.  Prior to that, with pneumatic systems did not have.  The idea is that peaks should quickly be ‚Äúthrown out‚Äù by 150‚Äì200 mm in order to penetrate or damage the enemy‚Äôs armor.  The peak ejection velocity is up to 0.2 m / s.  The pressure in the pneumatic system to 10 atmosphere.  The secondary weapon is the tail with three clubs.  Why not bring a touch of medieval in this world of technology!  In the best traditions of knightly battles!  It should turn out well. <br><br>  Armor.  Armor will be composite.  Thickness is from 1.5 to 3 millimeters.  Ordinary steel sheets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/014/884/dc40148844c94d59aec817c7520e7717.JPG"><br><br>  The total weight of the composition is from 85 to 95 kg.  Planned speed - up to 5 km / h.  These are not all parameters, of course, but we would like to save some secrets for the arena. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/478/522/184/47852218401e42b9b3837e3b84960b05.jpg"><br><br>  And now on the reverse report we see the figure of 18 days.  There is a lot of work, but we still want to come up with a name for your robot and make a promo video about him next weekend so that at least something remains of the robot as a keepsake <a href="http://www.bronebot.ru/">after the fights</a> .  Wish us good luck;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390093/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390093/</a></p>
