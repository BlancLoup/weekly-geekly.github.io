  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UPS for banking and financial institutions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Uninterrupted power supply is important for any consumer of electricity.  However, in some cases it is just a temporary inconvenience (for example, in the absence of power supply for a personal PC), and in others - the possibility of major accidents and man-made disasters (for example, if production processes at refineries or chemical plants are suddenly stopped).  For banking and financial institutions, the constant availability of electricity is one of the most important issues of their normal functioning. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Why do banking and financial institutions have a UPS </h2><br><p>  Here you can draw an analogy with industrial enterprises.  In their conditions, even a short-term shutdown of the production process can lead to a serious accident and loss of life.  It is unthinkable even to leave without control for an instant, for example, the complex process of separating oil into light fractions in distillation columns at refineries. </p><br><p>  Shutting down power supply to banking and financial institutions is unlikely to result in casualties and man-made accidents.  There is another danger here: the financial loss of thousands of companies and millions of people. </p><br><p>  Now the financial sector is obliged to work at high speed in order to satisfy the demands of its customers.  The range of banking services, in addition to traditional operations provided by ATMs and bank branches, was supplemented by mobile and online banking.  As a result, the volume of non-cash transactions has increased significantly. </p><br><p>  Banking and financial institutions have to store, transfer and process huge amounts of data.  Power outages mean the loss of some information and the interruption of a large number of operations.  The result of this is the financial loss of both the institution and its clients.  In order to prevent this option, uninterruptible power supplies are used. </p><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/li/lt/6a/lilt6auiioietiuxbkt2v0l0rvw.jpeg" alt="   " title="Banking and financial institutions need UPS no less than large industrial enterprises"></div><br><br><h2>  UPS requirements for banking and financial institutions </h2><br><p>  When choosing an uninterruptible power supply for banking and financial institutions, customers pay particular attention to three points: </p><br><ol><li>  Reliability.  The performance of any UPS can be improved by changing the redundancy scheme.  In this case, we are talking about the stability of individual sources.  Their reliability can reasonably be put in the first place in the list of requirements for UPS from banking and financial institutions. </li><li>  High quality products and reasonable price for them.  These two parameters should be harmoniously combined. </li><li>  Cost of operation.  It depends on the efficiency, battery life, the ability to quickly diagnose and replace the failed components, ease of scaling and the possibility of a smooth increase in power. </li></ol><br><h2>  Types of UPS for banking and financial institutions </h2><br><p>  UPS, intended for use in the banking and financial sector, can be divided into three groups: </p><br><ol><li>  To ensure uninterrupted power supply of ATMs.  From the point of view of energy supply, it would, of course, be much more convenient and simpler if all the ATMs were located in the banking institutions themselves.  But this approach does not correspond to the requests of customers.  Therefore, ATMs are installed in shopping centers, gas stations, hotels and residential buildings.  Such a variety of installation locations complicates not only their connection, but also a stable power supply.  UPSs are used to ensure reliable operation of the devices.  For this purpose, suitable, for example, <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/1kva-and-higher-ups-amplon-family.php">single-phase sources Delta Amplon</a> .  They protect ATMs from voltage fluctuations in the network. </li><li>  To ensure uninterrupted power supply of bank branches.  There is another difficulty: lack of free space.  Not every branch of the bank is able to allocate a separate room with good air conditioning to accommodate power equipment.  The successful solution for these purposes - single- and three-phase <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/15kva-and-higher-ups-ultron-family.php">uninterruptible power supplies of the Ultron family</a> .  Their distinctive features are high efficiency, compactness and stability of parameters. </li><li>  To ensure uninterrupted power supply to data centers of banking and financial institutions.  It is the data center used to store information and perform financial transactions.  The operation of ATMs and bank branches depends on them.  Considering the huge volumes of operations performed and the large number of specialized equipment (servers, storage devices, switches and routers), data processing centers belong to large electricity consumers.  Uninterruptible power supplies for them should differ in availability and high efficiency.  A good choice is a <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/20kva-and-higher-modular-ups-modulon-family.php">Modulon UPS</a> .  They are optimal for data centers of small and medium size and have a low cost of ownership. </li></ol>

One example is a project at the Sberbank of Russia branch in Anapa.  A new equipment for managing ATMs was installed here, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomer service halls was increased, and an electronic queue system was introduced.  Accordingly, a reliable uninterruptible power supply was required to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the bank branch.  We solved this problem by installing a <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/20kva-120kva-three-phase-ups-nh-plus-series.php">Delta NH Plus modular UPS with a capacity of 120 kVA</a> .  Read more about this <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/success-story-delta-electronics-implements-solution-for-sberbank-in-russia.php">here</a> . </p><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  Selecting uninterruptible power supplies for banking or financial institutions is a complex and important task because it affects the interests of thousands of customers.  To solve it, you need to find the optimal ratio of price, quality, reliability and cost of operation of the UPS. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449106/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449106/</a></p>
