Choosing work and space for it, we choose a way of life.  It is no secret that we spend most of our life in the office.  Therefore, it is very important for us to create comfortable <a href="http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/interior/137211-ofis-nedeli">working spaces</a> in the company where an employee can not only work, but also relax.  And sometimes in our office there is even a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mailru/blog/268190/">skating rink</a> . </p><br><p>  Inconvenient offices have a very bad effect on employee motivation.  Therefore, the office should become a space for creativity, communication, recreation and productivity.  But this is possible only with its detailed forethought.  From design to functionality.  You probably read about our Moscow office many times, so now we will look at some of the most unusual offices of companies around the world.  It is not only convenient to work in them, but sometimes you even want to live.  Office can be home.  And we will prove it to you. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="multyashnyy-ofis-pixar-ssha-kaliforniya">  Cartoon Office Pixar (USA, California) </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d1f/29c/dc1/d1f29cdc149b40728d275a8658fe914e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://www.insidethemagic.net/2017/05/photos-visit-pixars-headquarters-emeryville-california/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The most commercially successful animation studio in the world is located in the town of Emeryville, California.  It has been owned by Walt Disney for more than 10 years, but has not lost its originality.  And it affected the appearance of the main office.  The concept of the office was openness, spontaneity and interpersonal skills.  Its formation was influenced by Steve Jobs, who was convinced that all the best ideas came spontaneously and in a random conversation or meeting.  Therefore, the atrium became the central place in the office.  It is big, there are a lot of employees constantly running there, they exchange ideas, organize organized meetings or sudden brainstorming sessions.  Due to the ‚Äúimmensity‚Äù of the atrium, not every employee will risk walking through it, so most ride scooters. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/759/579/d95/759579d95e0743ba808d192f57a23f77.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://d-kb.ru/post-544-nestandartnye-ofisy-standartnyh-kompanii">A source</a></em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/90a/620/121/90a6201217fe47b895165d35430eb07b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://www.bu.edu/bostonia/summer14/pixar/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The characters of the most famous animations produced by Pixar will meet you everywhere.  At the entrance to the building is the world-famous Luxo Jr light bulb (yes, it has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxo_Jr.">name</a> ).  Atrium is no exception.  His design is constantly changing depending on what kind of cartoon is now in work.  On any floor you can see a lot of wall posters with the most famous characters of the studio.  And a huge warehouse of toys keeps a whole story about how a prototype was developed for each character. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/03c/884/98c/03c88498c08740ada7274e877da7eabd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://ru.pinterest.com/pin/384424518162357273/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  But the workspace is located not only inside but also outside - in the green area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe office.  Conferences, presentations and speeches are regularly held in a special amphitheater.  During breaks, the staff rest.  Their services - sports and a large selection of video games.  Well, a huge cinema for free use, of course. </p><br><h2 id="napechatannyy-ofis-dubai-future-foundation-oae-dubay">  Printed office Dubai Future Foundation (UAE, Dubai) </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/beb/d4d/a87/bebd4da871ef43839cfacacf4c220f3c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://smartcitiesworld.net/special-reports/special-reports/your-city-is-printing-now">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  To date, there are many ways to build.  But the most fashionable of them is 3D printing.  And the UAE government decided to succeed here, having implemented the first-ever project of an office building printed on a 3D printer.  It is located on the territory of the Emirates Towers complex. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b92/643/296/b92643296dd04d20a032c8c69fdb784b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://officeofthefuture.ae/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The office was created using a huge 3D printer measuring 6 √ó 36 √ó 12 meters.  The building was printed by extruding the cement mixture layer by layer.  For smaller parts, small 3D printers were used.  The semi-circular shapes of the building were chosen for safety and sustainability. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d85/ac5/e07/d85ac5e07cf5475c8387a6ecbeb872c2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://officeofthefuture.ae/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The total area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe office is 250 square meters.  It was planned that the building would be erected in two weeks, but it took 17 days to build it.  3D printing reduced costs by half by traditional construction methods.  The UAE‚Äôs ambitions are very high; the country plans to become a world leader in 3D printing. </p><br><h2 id="kancelyarskaya-fabrika-ofis-kickstarter-ssha-nyu-york">  Stationery: Kickstarter office (USA, New York) </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/514/327/5aa/5143275aa6654625b435ecb6c16bb163.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://www.uniqueworkspaces.com/kickstarter-office-space-in-brooklyn/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  At one time, the most famous crowdfunding company was located in an apartment building on the Lower East Side.  Now she has found a home in the Greenpoint area at the site of the pencil factory.  For a creative startup to survive in such a huge metropolis as New York, an ecosystem has been created, including natural wood furniture and a roof garden, which is supported by a rainwater collection and spraying system. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a3e/abb/187/a3eabb1873dd41908dde59b5a798e19c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://www.uniqueworkspaces.com/kickstarter-office-space-in-brooklyn/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  This garden is not just a decoration.  There you can find a lot of vegetables and edible herbs.  Or even listen to the ficus monologues.  Sounds pretty weird?  But should we know that Kickstarter lets you breathe life into the most unusual projects from around the world.  And MIDI Sprout is one such project.  Its equipment allows to measure the electric current in plants and convert it into sound waves. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/83b/559/bb6/83b559bb697c47f7b2f8d88a2db00c71.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://vc.ru/p/kickstarter-office">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The garden is inhabited not only by "talking" plants, but also by dinosaurs of 32 Square, which collected about 9 thousand dollars on the platform. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f25/08c/ca8/f2508cca8f5144d99b330a0f93ce9507.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Let's go back inside the office.  The most symbolic area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe building is the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kickstarter-office-tour-2014-5">dining area</a> , which is modeled on the diner in which the co-founders of the company met for the first time.  And for leisure, employees can use the rest rooms, slot machines or walk through their own gallery.  It exhibits many different pieces of art that have gained fame thanks to Kickstarter. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2c8/4c9/768/2c84c976861f4dfebf47f24af9cda66d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/kickstarter-office-tour-2014-5">A source</a></em> </p><br><h2 id="sliyanie-s-prirodoy-v-ofise-selgas-cano-architecture-ispaniya-madrid">  Merging with nature in the office of Selgas Cano Architecture (Spain, Madrid) </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1f7/d9b/da6/1f7d9bda68fe4238a98ec7dd9879db49.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://hqroom.ru/ofis-kompanii-selgascano-arquitectos-v-madride.html">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The best motivation for creativity is freedom in all its manifestations.  And even if the office is very cool, then most often it is limited by the height and density of the urban jungle.  Therefore, the concept of office in nature comes to the rescue. </p><br><p>  The office of the architectural bureau is located in a forest near Madrid.  From the side, the building resembles a large glass pipe.  The creators wanted a lot of sunshine to enter the office, but that the workplaces were not under direct rays.  Therefore, we decided to make the building half glass. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ab7/786/253/ab7786253122455f82f00ccea789e280.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://hqroom.ru/ofis-kompanii-selgascano-arquitectos-v-madride.html">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Part of the building is buried in the ground, which creates the effect of complete immersion in the forest environment.  Due to this, desktops are located almost on the same level with grass.  Thanks to the windows, employees can enjoy beautiful views and fresh forest air. </p><br><h2 id="krugosvetnoe-puteshestvie-za-chas-ofis-airbnb-ssha-san-francisko">  Round trip per hour: Airbnb office (USA, San Francisco) </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/50d/323/a55/50d323a55d4d42acbb6b5b2965a43b65.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://dailygazette.com/galleries/2017/03/25/orbit-airbnb">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  The corporate identity of the Airbnb office is heterogeneous, and the reason is simple: a huge base of rental houses and apartments.  Each room is decorated in the style of the most inspiring interiors of real houses and apartments around the world.  Therefore, the usual moving around the office turns into a real world tour. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f10/3b2/5cb/f103b25cb7db4b55913f4a2ed88f6ee2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://www.snapsuites.com/unique-offices-from-around-the-world/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Cabinets acquire the shape of a real apartment only if it has a high rating and is in high demand on the site.  Then all the magic is transferred into the hands of designers - and voila: a simple conversation turns into a room from Johannesburg.  But the design of rooms is not always engaged only designers.  The third floor spaces can be decorated by the employees themselves in order to create a ‚Äúpiece of house‚Äù at work. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7b8/ed9/801/7b8ed98018334231bc1804e1d8952a10.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2015/07/31/a-tour-of-airbnbs-gorgeous-new-san-francisco-headquarters/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  One of the main attributes of travel: what is it?  Letters and postcards from abroad!  Therefore, the office has a mailbox in which you can drop a letter of any content.  The feeling of travel is created and reaches the recipient much faster. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c7/a44/754/9c7a44754ed3406dade09bc03f0fcd15.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://www.snapsuites.com/unique-offices-from-around-the-world/">A source</a></em> </p><br><p> Huge open spaces, filled with light - not the only place of work of employees.  Having entered the office, each of them leaves his belongings at the landing station (landing place), and then selects a suitable place.  A large variety of rooms allows you to find a place with any level of light, comfort, noise and suitable interior.  Only the demand for these rooms is quite large, so you should book them in advance. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/542/763/8ab/5427638abdf6465abb4700d9ba7799ca.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://www.officelovin.com/2015/07/31/a-tour-of-airbnbs-gorgeous-new-san-francisco-headquarters/">A source</a></em> </p><br><h2 id="i-vse-taki-a-nuzhen-li-ofis-wordpress-obhoditsya-i-bez-nego">  And yet, do we need an office?  WordPress costs without it </h2><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/140/022/c99/140022c99a4c44d7bebff48056137e85.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <em><a href="https://charge-up.ru/archives/186717">A source</a></em> </p><br><p>  Automattic management has decided to close its office.  Nobody just came to it.  And so it was decided to no longer spend money on renting an office and invest it in something more worthwhile.  And to transfer all employees to remote work. </p><br><p>  Most often, colleagues gathered to discuss joint projects and organize events, the rest of the time they worked at home.  The formation of such a habit was influenced by the policy of the company, encouraging work in other places.  If an employee likes to spend time in coworking, then he is paid a stipend to cover expenses.  If he decided to arrange his office at home, then he also receives payments.  If he ran to work at Starbucks, the company will pay for coffee. </p><br><p>  Company events are held in different parts of America, so all flights are also paid by the company, and all working meetings are held online.  Many employees are remotely hired, without a personal conversation, after an online interview. </p><br><p>  In the office or without it, the working atmosphere of the company and good specialists still create the working atmosphere.  A properly built workflow can go beyond the usual office, regular schedule and formal relationships.  This allows such companies to create a unique and useful product, which is used not only by ordinary consumers, but also by the employees themselves outside the office. </p></div>
