  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first experience of using the method of memory cards (mind map)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I heard about this method for a long time and many times, first of all from an analyst of our office, who told about a large amount of specialized literature, worked out in this way.  I, frankly, suffer from the fact that I read technical literature as fiction, that is, after the first reading, very little is left in my memory, and unfolding on the shelves does not always go as it should.  The same problem arose when trying to listen to <a href="http://coursera.org/">coursera.org</a> lectures - I can‚Äôt write by hand quickly, and typing formatted text on the fly, IMHO, is difficult. <br><br>  The moment of reading one article turned out to be a turning point: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155891/">http://habrahabr.ru/post/155891/</a> - it was too painful for the author to get what I was so eager for.  Well, I thought - with his head, but into the pool, and how else? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Preamble </h4><br>  To begin with, I will give a bit of a formal text, for those who are too lazy to climb on the wiki (actually, I bring copy-paste from there): <br><blockquote>  A memory map (mind map) is a way of depicting the process of general systems thinking with the help of diagrams.  It can also be considered as a convenient alternative recording technique. </blockquote><br>  XMind ( <a href="http://www.xmind.net/">http://www.xmind.net/</a> ) was chosen as the program for creating these cards, due to its free and most positive feedback from all programs in this sector. <br><br><h4>  Plot </h4><br>  Actually, a logical question immediately arose - what to disassemble and take notes?  Search material artificially - did not want.  And, like the first time - unexpectedly, a lucky chance number two happened - I, reading Habr, came across an article "Educational program on typing in programming languages" ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/">http://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/</a> ).

      The topic, to me, as a programmer, is interesting and extensive, which means with a swoop and incomprehensible.  An attempt to read an article in a row led only to the fact that within two minutes there was porridge in my head and I had to overcome the desire to send a printout to the nearest wastebasket.  There was only one option - to try to formalize the article through the method of memory cards. <br><br>  And, it started ... It turned out that the devil is not so scary as it is drawn - the article is, in fact, a list of different types of typification, each of which is branched into subspecies, which are combined into groups, and also have connections and relationships with each other. a friend. <br><br>  That is, reading the article consistently - the graph of the memory card was built in the same way - let's say, the advantages of static typing over dynamic are described - we get the ‚ÄúBenefits‚Äù branch in the ‚ÄúProgramming Languages‚Äù - ‚ÄúTyped‚Äù - ‚ÄúTyping‚Äù - ‚ÄúStatic‚Äù sections and specify the link to the ‚ÄúDynamic‚Äù section so that it is clear - but before what, in fact, are the advantages? .. <br><br>  The time spent on such reading and note-taking of the article was, undoubtedly, much longer than if it were read in the usual way.  But, I repeat, in the usual way I, most likely, would not have finished reading it at all, and there would have been much less confusion - I would hardly have been able to recall at least something from the article just read.  Now, when all the information is laid out ‚Äúin branches‚Äù not only on the cards, but also in the head, and not only informationally recorded in the memory, but also visually - I think that at night if I wake up - I will definitely tell you the main points without hesitation. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  You can make two conclusions - firstly, everything is much simpler than it seems (do not be afraid - just try and everything will become clear) and, secondly, I strongly advise everyone-everything-IMHO, the speed of writing an abstract will increase over time, and so the pleasure of the fact that information is digested, assimilated and remembered - and I can not convey. <br><br>  Also, once again I provide a link to the article with which I worked ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/">http://habrahabr.ru/post/161205/</a> ) and post, as an example, my memory card for this article - <a href="http://www.xmind.net/embed/Lgg8/">http://www.xmind.net / embed / Lgg8 /</a> . <br><br>  Upd.
