  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Create a preset manager in PureData</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yes, <em>Max is</em> more perfect than <em>Pd</em> .  Yes, a lot has been done in it for productive work.  Finally, its interface does not slow down with a large number of objects in the patch.  However, there is something magical in <em>Pd</em> that forces you to open this simple interface written in <em>tcl / tk</em> again and again, with its simple boxes and colors that please the night.  Maybe this is the very open source magic that makes people use gentoo on the desktop? <br><br>  In this article we will try to solve one sore subject of all users of this wonderful program, namely, the preservation of the parameters of numeric boxes, sliders, knobs, etc.  It would seem a very important function. Why is there still no special object similar to the <strong>preset</strong> in <em>Max</em> ?  The thing is that using the <em>PureData API</em> you can not access data from other objects, so you have to get out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, there were attempts to implement presets.  I looked at some of them, but their implementation seemed to me difficult (yes, I didn‚Äôt understand them completely) - I wanted something light and flexible.  As a result, after a day of thought and evening of patching, such a system was born. <br><br><h4>  Formulation of the problem </h4><br>  To save the presets, we need: <br><ol><li>  constantly monitor the saved parameters; </li><li>  be able to extract and save them at any time; </li><li>  be able to restore the state of objects from stored data. </li></ol><br>  I immediately remembered the <strong>pattr</strong> and <strong>pattrstorage objects</strong> from max.  The first connects with a gui object, the value of which needs to be stored, and the second is the data store.  It was decided to do something similar. <br><h4>  We represent how everything will be </h4><br>  So, our ‚Äúanalogue‚Äù of the <strong>pattr</strong> object will monitor the parameter, and the analogue of <strong>pattrstorage</strong> 'will, if necessary, poll it and save the values.  We call these objects <strong>store</strong> and <strong>storage,</strong> respectively.  All this should look something like this: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/1.png" alt="Presets PureData. We represent how everything will be"><br><br>  The <strong>store</strong> object will store the current one, as well as assign a new value to the numeric box.  That is why these objects are interconnected in such a way.  Using the message <em>‚Äúsave‚Äù</em> <strong>storage</strong> will send a command to the <strong>store</strong> so that it sends the current value of the numeric box to it.  <em>‚ÄúRecall‚Äù</em> will do the opposite - to ask boxing a new value. <br><br>  So, the general view is clear, moving on. <br><br><h4>  Making the base </h4><br>  Max presets information is stored in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">json</a> format.  Theoretically, <em>Pd</em> can work with it through the <a href="http://puredata.info/community/projects/software/purest-json">PuREST</a> library, but it is sharpened for online services, and why complicate things?  The easiest way to write data to a .txt file is by using a <strong>textfile</strong> object.  It can save any number of messages and display them in sequence.  More information about how it works, you can read in the help, and now proceed to create objects. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/2.png" alt="Presets PureData. First sketches."><br><br>  The picture above shows a screen with comments of three open patches.  <strong>root</strong> is a test patch in which we will check the operation of the <strong>store</strong> and <strong>storage</strong> .  In the script, at this stage it is already possible to save and restore the value of one numeric box.  The procedure is as follows: <br><ol><li>  change the value of the numeric box; </li><li>  press <em>‚Äúget‚Äù</em> - this will clear the <strong>textfile</strong> , after which <em>bang</em> will be sent to <strong>[s presetTrigger]</strong> .  The recipient of this <em>bang</em> will be a <strong>float</strong> object located in the <strong>store</strong> , which will output the stored number through its outlet and send it back to the <strong>store</strong> , where it will be output through [r presetGetAll]], will turn into a message like <em>‚Äúadd% number_from_box%‚Äù</em> and go to the <strong>textfile</strong> ; </li><li>  press <em>‚Äústore‚Äù</em> - this will send a <em>‚Äúwrite‚Äù</em> message to <em>the textfile</em> and create a text file in the folder with the <strong>root</strong> patch, which will contain all the parameters of the preset; </li><li>  change the value of the numeric box, then press ‚Äúrecall‚Äù - the previously saved value should be restored. </li></ol><br><h4>  We increase the functionality </h4><br>  So, we did the main part and successfully tested performance.  However, at the moment you can save only one parameter, which is not good.  As we remember, the <strong>pattr</strong> object in the argument must specify the name of the parameter, the value of which will be remembered.  Thus, max indexes the parameters in the json file so that you can later restore the data to the necessary gui objects.  We will do something similar and do it slyly.  Take a look at the screenshot: <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/3.png" alt="Presets PureData. We work with several numeric boxes."><br><br>  As you can see, in the <em>root.pd</em> patch <em>,</em> now three numeric boxes are connected to three objects <strong>[store one]</strong> , <strong>[store two]</strong> and <strong>[store three]</strong> .  Each saved parameter is given a name.  Now, if you twist the parameters of the boxes and open the preset.txt, you can see something like this: <br><br> <code>three 67; <br> two 43; <br> one 165;</code> <br> <br>  That is, each parameter in the file was added an index corresponding to the argument entered in the <strong>store</strong> object.  This is done thanks to the so-called <em>abstraction creation arguments</em> .  If you look closely at the <strong>store.pd</strong> patch, you will notice that the <strong>route</strong> and <strong>prepend</strong> objects have the argument <em>"$ 1" -</em> these are the arguments.  The bottom line is that when using a patch as an abstraction, inside is not $ 1, $ 2, $ 3, etc.  are replaced by the first, second, and third arguments, respectively.  That is, the <strong>[route one]</strong> and <strong>[prepend one]</strong> objects are actually in the <strong>[store</strong> <strong>one]</strong> . <br><br>  Now about that, for which, in fact, <strong>prepend</strong> and <strong>route</strong> were added.  The first of them before sending the parameter in the <strong>textfile</strong> creates the same index that we saw in the text file, and <strong>route</strong> c filters out parameters with non-foreign indexes, when the entire contents of the text file are translated via <strong>[p presetSetParam]</strong> . <br><br>  As mentioned earlier, with <em>bang</em> you can display one message from the <strong>textfile</strong> .  When the last message is reached, the object displays <em>bang</em> through the right outlet. <br><br>  In order to extract all messages, you need to go through the entire file, which makes the <strong>until</strong> object.  This is a very interesting object. If you submit any number, say, <em>ten</em> , to the inlet, it will output 10 <em>bang messages one by one</em> .  If the input is simply <em>bang</em> , then <strong>until</strong> will generate <em>bangs</em> until <em>bang</em> enters its right inlet. <br><br>  Now you can figure out what happens when you click on the message <em>"recall"</em> .  First, <em>bang</em> enters the <em>‚Äúread preset.txt, rewind‚Äù message</em> , which loads the <em>preset.txt</em> file <em>into the textfile</em> , and then sends the <em>‚Äúrewind‚Äù</em> message, which makes the next <em>bang</em> received by the object output the first parameter from the file.  Then <em>bang</em> goes to the <strong>until</strong> object, which generates <em>bangs</em> one by one and sends them to the <strong>textfile</strong> until the latter takes <em>bang</em> out of its right outlet and stops <strong>until</strong> . <br><br>  At this point in the preset, you can only save numbers, but in order to be able to be used in real patches, you must add at least the preservation of lists.  We do this by creating analogs of the <strong>store store</strong> for other data types.  Rename our <strong>store</strong> to <strong>sfloat</strong> and create a <strong>slist</strong> object. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/4.png" alt="Presets PureData. Save the lists (lists)"><br><br>  This is a slightly modified patch <strong>sfloat.pd</strong> , adapted for lists. <br><br>  The next step is to add the ability to save different presets.  Considering how to implement this, I came to the conclusion that it is best to save each preset to a separate file.  In this case, there is no need to construct additional logic that separates lines for different presets in a text file, and the smaller the patch's complexity, the more stable its work will be (after all, it‚Äôs one thing to save two or three parameters, and another when there will be a hundred). <br><br>  So, in order to be able to manage multiple presets, we need to change the contents of the message boxes ‚Äúread preset.txt‚Äù and ‚Äúwrite preset.txt‚Äù, namely change the file names for the corresponding presets.  <strong>Take a</strong> look at the modified <strong>storage.pd</strong> : <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/5.png" alt="Presets PureData. We work with several presets."><br><br>  A new object appeared here: <strong>makefilename</strong> .  It is designed to generate file names and is perfect for us.  When a number enters the inlet, the object displays a message like <em>‚Äúpreset-% i.txt‚Äù</em> , replacing <em>% i with a</em> number.  I also had to display ‚Äúrewind‚Äù in a separate message box, since I did not find an easy way to generate a complex message with a comma. <br><br>  Everything, now the system works.  Now add convenience by making a small gui.  Open storage.pd, right-click on an empty place and select Properties.  In the window that appears, check the <em>‚ÄúGraph on parent‚Äù</em> box, after which a red rectangle appears in the patch.  All interface objects, like buttons, numeric boxes and comments inside this rectangle will be displayed in the patch a la maxio <strong>bpatcher</strong> .  The size and position of the rectangle are set in the <em>canvas</em> window using the <em>size</em> and <em>margin</em> parameters. <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/6.png" alt="Presets PureData. Making a GUI."><br><br>  This is how the <strong>storage</strong> object in the patch now looks like: <br><br><img src="http://pattr.ru/img/pd-preset/7.png" alt="Presets PureData. The final version of the object [storage]."><br><br>  Now <em>Pd</em> has become a little more comfortable :) <br><br><h4>  At last </h4><br>  This system of presets is not enough to save the tables, but I will postpone it for the future, as it is likely that some tricky witch would be necessary for us to be comfortable.  Also, it would be nice to add an inlet to the storage for external control of the presets, so that you can pull up some MIDI controller. <br><br>  You can download files from the site <a href="http://pattr.ru/">pattr.ru</a> from the section <a href="http://pattr.ru/patches/pd-preset">"Patches"</a> , enjoy! <br><br>  <a href="">direct link</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137019/</a></p>
