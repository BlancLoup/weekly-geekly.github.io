  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HP ProLiant DL360: Gen5 or Gen6? Server for 1C for 10-15 people</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In recent decades, microenterprises have firmly occupied their niche in the vast Russian business, which is not at all surprising - everything starts off small.  Someone in this field achieves success and begins to grow, someone is comfortable to remain at the same level, and someone, unfortunately, having burned out, gives way to others.  One way or another, in all cases at this stage everything depends on money, or rather, in precise planning of expenses.  In the era of total computerization, the allocation of funds for the technical equipment of enterprises is vital.  And funds for these purposes are sometimes required not small.  Therefore, a competent economy mode is the very lifeline that can keep a small business afloat.  It is only natural that such firms of up to 10-15 people are the main customers of the used computer equipment market and WestComp in particular. <br>  A very frequently asked question: which server will suit a small company (10-15 people in permanent connection) to provide an office with 1C package and internal mail, and how much will it cost?  A person not involved in this particular organization is not so easy to answer the question unequivocally.  Why?  It all depends on what short-term development prospects are prepared for a particular enterprise. <br>  Based on the analysis of user requests in our company, server configurations were selected for various purposes that have worked well over the past years.  In the question of selecting the optimal server option, you can consider two ways of development of events: the growth of the organization is planned or not planned. <br>  Suppose an organization or a specific office is not planned for expansion, and the tasks for providing such a working space are set to be narrow and straightforward: 1C and / or internal mail.  For such purposes, <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl360_1u/hp_proliant_dl360g5_2x2_83ggts_quad_core_xeon_5440_8x2048mb_ddr2_pc2_5300f_sa_p400i_no_hdd_sas_2_pws/">HP DL360 Gen5 is</a> perfect, as an opportunity to purchase an excellent server with a guaranteed budget of about $ 500.  5th generation DL360 servers belong to the middle class of servers - ‚Äúworkgroup level‚Äù. <br>  With 4-core Xeon processors, DDR2 memory with full buffering DIMM, and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and PCI Express technologies, these servers provide high performance and are ideal for all scalable applications, including popular virtualization programs.  In addition, the HP DL360 Gen5 server ensures increased fault tolerance on a platform with ultra-high density thanks to a redundant power supply (hot swap), redundant fans, mirrored memory or redundant memory bank, built-in RAID technology (you can install 6 2.5 "drives), an integrated system of remote Lights-Out. (iLO) control. When all the requirements are met, the server has a relatively low price and will be the best solution for a specific task. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a40/bbd/86a/a40bbd86a2844fcfb1784bcf0ca15275.jpg"><br><br>  In the case of the planned expansion of both the tasks and the composition of the organization (more than 15-20 people), the acquisition of the 5th generation DL360 becomes ineffective.  With such an increase in the number of employees, an elementary shortage of RAM will have an effect, because the provision of more than 20 employees requires more than 16 GB.  If there is a question of increasing the number of tasks, then the power of two 4-core DL360 G5 processors will not be enough.  At this stage, there is a need to acquire <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_proliant_dl360_1u/hp_proliant_dl360g6_2x2_93_ggts_xeon_six_core_kh5670_8gb_2x4_ddr3_pc3_10600_no_hdd_sas_sa_p410_1_pws/">the 6th generation of the HP DL360 server</a> . <cut>

Accordingly, for 15-20 people, you need about 10 GB of memory, plus, SQL - 10 GB, which, if possible, should be placed on a separate server.  In a good way: the OS uses 2 GB, caching - 2 GB, 1C itself - 4 GB, and in addition MS Office requires about 500 MB.  In the end, it turns out about 32 GB for a good flight.  You should also not forget that when RAM becomes low, the OS can unload 1C in Swap File, which is why the application may be unavailable for a while.  Accordingly, only one conclusion can be made: there is not a lot of RAM and, in a good way, there should be 30% more than you expect. <br>  Speaking of processors, ideally, the number of cores should coincide with the number of running processes.  The following question arises: which processors are supported by the motherboard, when calculated on the growth in the number of users and add.  processes?  In this case, it is advisable to select a server whose motherboard supports SixCore (six-core processor).  The DL360 G6 supports such processors and 144 GB of RAM, and in addition, it can also contain 8 hot-swappable disks (a second backplane is installed, by default they come with one).  Initially, you can put, for example, Quad-Core Intel Xeon x5550 (2.67 GHz, 8MB cache) and this will be more than enough at first.  Subsequently, based on the need, you can put the Intel Xeon x5650 Six-Core (2667MHz, Socket LGA1366, cache 12288Kb).  The main thing to remember is that the main parameters of the processor when choosing is its frequency and cache size. <br>  Now there are different disk formats on the market with different connection interfaces: SAS, SATA, SCSI, Fiber Channel, SSD, etc.  (earlier there were also DE disks).  I would like to clarify that SSD (solid-state) drives have an SATA connection interface.  But, since we are considering an example of a DL360 G6 server, we take only the format disks: SAS, SATA and SSD.  Let us proceed from the fact that, first of all, high speed and reliability of the disks are necessary, therefore SATA is excluded, and SAS and SSD remain (here who has what the soul is about).  Probably in terms of reliability, SAS drives are higher than the SSD, but they are much inferior in speed.  As a result, SAS drives are a kind of golden mean, as they provide for repeated and reliable data rewriting, unlike SSDs.  Another important factor is hot-swappable disks.  You also need to take care of the integrity of the data on these disks.  Of course, it is not bad to use 10 raid, which consists of raid0 + raid1, which gives high fault tolerance, performance and, of course, high cost, since for a raid 10 you need at least 4 disks (more is possible, the main thing is to have an even number).  You can also consider 7.30, 50 raids, but it is optimal for 10 raid for the above tasks.  There is no point in writing about the volume of disks, since this already depends on the size of your database, etc. <br>  Another important tip: buy a second server, the level of "working group" and use it under backups.  It is possible for this to find the used DL360G5 or, of course, take the storage system, but the storage costs a lot of money.  The cost of such a server with a guarantee in our company is about $ 1,400.  Although, compared to its predecessor, the difference in price is almost threefold, for such purposes such an acquisition is necessary. <br>  Depending on your goals, <a href="http://westcomp.ru/">WestComp</a> will always help you purchase reliable equipment with a guarantee and at an adequate price. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264679/</a></p>
