  <section class="page js-page"><h1>School portal and Web3.0.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The theme of the school portal has already been imposed on the teeth, however, it is worth making some rational grain into this series of five minutes of hate. <br><br>  To begin with, such a phenomenon as a school portal is not necessary in principle. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that the portals themselves are a relic of the past and an occupation unpromising.  What constitutes a portal is a collection of a bit of everything, designed to disperse the user's attention as long as possible, thereby keeping it within one site, which will allow you to sell advertising centrally. <br><br>  The ability to concentrate on the average child and, as a rule, tend to zero, and the sale of advertising, with the right approach to the goals of the "school portal" is not included. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      And it is in the goals of the school portal, as well as school education in general, to crystallize the addictions and abilities of an individual person to any area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity.  Well, to give some intellectual background, which, as the biographies of many prominent personalities show, is the tenth case. <br><br>  Thus, the presence of one tremendous portal, covering the entire difficult path of the modern schoolchild from the timetable to the disco, is not only unnecessary, but also harmful. <br>  We can see this by the example of the recently announced Planet of Schools, which has the same attitude to the learning process as the Yeralash newsreel. <br><br>  So the essays, the pearls of teachers, gadgets and other pleasures of life leave aside, in full accordance with the law of non-decreasing entropy, the tasks of personal dullness are easily solved by man and without help. <br><br>  Here the question arises whether the schoolchildren need the Internet at all, the answer is not surprising: yes, we need it.  The network (along with the toilet) is one of the few places where a person is left alone.  Even intelligent adult people gathered in a group of more than three, are a deplorable sight, what can we say about children: everyone who is not lucky enough to meet on a school excursion on the street, imagines what a nightmare it is.  In this case, a single individual is usually imputed regardless of age. <br><br>  If we visit a school portal that is not mentioned at night, there we will notice quite distinct problems with the content.  The main page contains articles with headlines written in such an official language that it is difficult to imagine a brave man willing to risk mental health and follow the link. <br><br>  In fact, the content is not such a big problem, because, firstly, there are a lot of teachers who are passionate about their subject, and, secondly, a great number of heterogeneous museums are left as a legacy from the Soviet empire, where people who know and extremely enthusiastic people (there is simply no other reason to work in a museum with the current level of wages).  This is despite the fact that in museums there are mountains and the collapse of a perfectly systematized ‚Äúcontent‚Äù, which are just waiting to be digitized. <br><br>  If you think that museums are a surprisingly boring place, covered with dust, where harsh aunts-keepers hide behind the folds of curtains, then you are deeply mistaken.  Most likely, you either, within the framework of cultural service, just glumly slandered from exhibit to exhibit at a conscious age, or went to the last one with your favorite classmates ¬©, which, as has been said above, is hell of a pity. <br><br>  It is known that any school trip is quickly organized into a mobile social network, the intellectual level of which is slightly lower than that of the dumbest participant. <br><br>  A small lyrical digression: what did inspire me to write this text.  The fact is that this Sunday, jumping back near the metro station "Teply Stan", I came across a museum of paleontology.  The fate of the "Warm Camp", brought me the first time in 25 years, having decided that, most likely, another 25 will pass until I get here again, I was more than worthy to go and see the dinosaur skeletons.  Having passed two halls, I came across a tour passing by and, drawn by an inescapable freebie, pretended that I was also here for a reason.  The most remarkable thing is that it turned out to be wildly interesting, for which a special thank you to the guide.  And this is not the first time when, in the presence of a good story-teller, it would seem, a boring event would become very interesting. <br><br>  Well, let us return to our sheep, the problem is that all these wonderful people are completely unaware of website building, and most of the existing websites are worthy examples of ‚Äúpopular‚Äù design and, it is terrible to say, they are invalidated.  All this orgy is accompanied by complicated texts, and not very rich illustrations. <br><br>  Thus, most sites need professional caring hands, and since we are counting on the younger generation, whose representatives cannot sit for a long time, not like reading, in this case (unlike one ‚Äúintellectual site‚Äù) flash will more than appropriate. <br><br>  Now about where to get these professionals, thank the global financial crisis, the flow of very necessary sites about mutual funds, mortgages and promotions will obviously decline in the near future, so the government order will be very much in the lives of many web studios.  It should be borne in mind that intensifying competition, in terms of logic (keeping silent hussars), leads to an increase in quality, and many will be interested in having a good, complex project in the portfolio that can be used to explain to the customer that if the studio was able to light and colorfully questions of molecular chemistry, the site for "Super dumplings" will undoubtedly resonate in the hearts of potential eaters. <br><br>  The state, by the way, will finally be able to report how it has remarkably supported small and medium-sized businesses. <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs a little about what web3.0 is about.  In addition to the usual zamanuhi designed to cause an increased salivation of readers, this is quite a complete concept.  Recall that web3.0.- is a social network of robots, and robots, as you know, are much kinder smarter and more humane than humans. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãweb3.0.  is the automation of interaction and transfer of information between sites, this idea can not be well applied in the framework of our ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù portal: every fourth-grader knows that science is interconnected.  Biology is connected with chemistry, chemistry with physics, physics with mathematics, and mathematics with everything. <br><br>  Thus, in order to clarify at some point related to related science, our small site can refer to another small site, and pull out a hint on this topic from there.  That is, the site dedicated to the work of Pushkin may ask the site of the historical circle a brief reference on the Decembrists.  To steer these requests will be just the notorious "school portal", which, thank God, no one will see. <br><br>  Thus, by the method of successive iterations, our weighted average idiot can reach the area in which he can fully realize himself, which, as I wrote at the very beginning, is the goal of all our secondary education. <br><br>  By the way, at the same time we kill the third hare, namely, we are finally creating a semantic network, which dramatically moves us forward, and we will have a googol on the premises. <br><br>  Now about the sad, firstly, the developers are also rare unbelievers, which can be seen on the example of 99% of domestic sites, and the task requires not only professionalism, but also great involvement.  The only way out that I see is to call a hypnotist and identify which items interested our developer in childhood, well, or if he was not interested in anything other than girls and inserts, give him an installation on organic chemistry. <br><br>  On a studio scale, the principle is the following, since we have small projects to give them to each studio, and then, within the framework of the ‚ÄúScholl site web award,‚Äù separate the sheep from the goats with the help of expert advice (since we have an expert on habrahabr, every first) .  According to the results, the winners are given to do the next project, and the losers are sent to the felling of the forest. <br><br>  And the saddest thing is the mind is the honor and conscience of the nation, our invaluable officials, who unfortunately think in two categories: cutting the ribbons and cutting the budget.  Since each project is rather small, you don‚Äôt cut the ribbon very much and don‚Äôt cut the money, so I'm afraid this idea will not cause much enthusiasm for them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42229/</a></p>
