  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet Marketing Workshop: Google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, I accidentally saw on Twitter a message about the <a href="http://www.onlinesem.ru/viiseminar.php">VII free internet marketing seminar</a> .  Free participation and a speaker from Google-Russia was instantly seduced.  I registered and waited with a little excitement on the cherished Friday of the 20th: I hadn‚Äôt participated in webinars before, I didn‚Äôt communicate with the Gugloids, had to wait for something curious, some kind of ‚Äústrawberries‚Äù.  In a good sense - in the current that is exclusive and insight.  Although the reason, such a pessimism, vaguely nodded at the ‚Äúfreebie‚Äù, hinting at the futility of these expectations.  And it turned out to be right. <br><br>  It's Friday.  The time has come.  I came to the head of the IT department and said: time, friend, to test the channel and microphone. <a name="habracut"></a>  The kind soul of the boss let me go at her computer - she, like my soul, did not suspect that the seminar lasted 3 hours.  A registration link from the letter was opened, Gotowebinar software was downloaded to connect to the seminar, a microphone was checked, and speakers were connected.  Chomped on tea before the hour "C".  Went ore, crawled traffic.  Traffic chief IT.  God bless him.  About him (about traffic), he thought only after 40 minutes. <br><br>  Now, finally, about the case.  I am glad that, in full accordance with the program of the seminar, the first to launch just the ‚Äúlocomotive‚Äù - Stanislav Vidyaev with a report on the new features of Google Analytics.  Stanislav's report was undoubtedly useful and interesting, our office clerk (the third participant in our small company) just turned into a statue while listening and watching.  And I still suffered the question - how do I know this?  I remembered - and found in my bookmarks a <a href="http://analytics.blogspot.com/2008/10/more-enterprise-class-features-added-to.html">presentation from the Google Analytics blog</a> , which I had already dug out from someone in a very long time on Twitter.  Stanislav's report did not lose its value, nevertheless, in Russian anyway, more understandable, and even live.

      The main impression - GA has become a powerful tool for analyzing traffic on your site.  If he used to allow a lot, now, with the transition from Urchin to his own script ga.js, GA turned into just a combine, Gromozek and Briarei.  Two weeks ago, the head of the IT department only frowned at my requests for an analysis of the transitions from our external advertisements;  Everything that I (and the office) require is now realizable and ready for delivery in a visual form.  I simply thanked fate and Twitter for not having missed the announcement of this seminar (to my shame, I was not signed to <a href="http://googlerussiablog.blogspot.com/">Goggle Russia blog</a> then).  With your character, I can restore the general meaning of the story told by Stanislav, but not now, because it takes a lot of places, and the content is copyright. <br><br>  After the report there were questions - written (in the Q / A-block of the webinar client) and oral.  Written questions were voiced by the presenters.  And the questions were burning.  I will list what I remember.  How to solve the problem of accounting for users with disabled Java scripts?  No, Vidyaev answers, and he will not decide in any way, most likely he commented out my nachaytiot aloud.  Such users are too few, I read the research, we are talking about some percent, continued Vidyaev.  The problem of users is more important, he added, who at least once a month clean the cache and cookies - after all, they cannot be taken into account as ‚Äúreturning‚Äù, and there are a lot of such people.  Is that Google will put additional servers and will store the logs / cookies right at his place, again he intervened IT-commander of my office.  Then they asked whether it is possible to follow the movement of the user through several sites.  Very hard to implement, answered Vidyaev.  According to him, he saw only one such implementation (I glanced at my colleagues, but they worked, they seemed to know the word): the proprietary system of one airline, which guides the user through several websites from ordering a ticket to paying for it.  Billing is generally a very difficult topic, said Stanislav.  Then asked if you can monitor the desired IP.  Yes, Stanislav replied, by analogy with banned IPs (which you ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù), you can, on the contrary, ‚Äúenable‚Äù a selected address range.  Are preparing an upgrade system, asked from the audience.  The answer was no, in any case he does not know about it.  He knows only that beta testing passes a number of interesting functions, for example, moving points on GA graphs.  ‚ÄúOnce it will reach us,‚Äù Stanislav said melancholically.  Not surprisingly, I grinned, looking at the date of the original GA presentation - last October;  her Russian translation "reached us" in 4 months.  The last question was about the possibility of at least partial opening of GA statistics for external users.  There is no such possibility, Vidyaev answered, and it is not provided for. <br><br>  Little fun: Stanislav showed examples of how Google Analytics works in Firefox browser, in the status bar of which I saw the familiar SEOQuake badge.  And in place of the account name flaunted Yandex-mail dear Stanislav Vidyaeva.  I have already read on Habr√© that the gugloids do not try to use Yandex, and do not burn, but then I saw it myself. <br><br>  But the second report, from the representative of the organizer of the seminar project SEO-study.ru, under the promising for me title ‚ÄúOptimization of the media plan in Internet marketing‚Äù, for which I stayed for another hour, greatly disappointed with my impracticality.  Stretching the banal idea of ‚Äã‚Äãproper planning for 40 minutes and saying nothing is unpleasant.  Sorry for your time.  For some reason, the illustrative material did not appear on the screen for a long time, and the speaker Alexey Yakovlev explains on the fingers.  I simply did not listen to the third report, my colleague, a social assistant, listened to it, then said that it was even worse than the second. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know what the gentlemen of the organizers wanted to achieve, but it looked like this, to the useful report, the locomotive Vidyayev was given a load of 2 more hours of nonsense.  Do not do so again, good gentlemen.  And thanks to Vidyaev for the report. <br><br>  Sincere thanks to the organizers, I won‚Äôt be such a reptile, the connection was excellent, the implementation of the seminar was besyakyachny (and this was with four hundred participants), the headliner of the seminar was lit, the hosts were polite and professional.  Definitely a must-reg for anyone involved in web development and web promotion.  I hope the organizers will take into account my wishes and will more carefully prepare the "load" reports. <br><br>  So in brief about the new interesting experience that I gained through the efforts of SEO-study.ru and Google.  Maybe habratovarischi, which I managed to notice in the list of participants, add something. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52492/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52492/</a></p>
