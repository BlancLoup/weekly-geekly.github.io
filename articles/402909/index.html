      In this post we want to recommend lenses that are best suited for a particular genre and are in a reasonable price range. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Remark one: in the statement that the shots taken on the camera, surpass similar pictures on the smartphone, there is a little slyness.</i>  <i>In terms of a high-quality camera in a smartphone, a sunny day, and viewing photos on a smartphone screen, the difference in any general picture may be minimal.</i>  <i>But once we dive into the genres (for example, portrait) or try shooting at dusk, and then display the photo on a laptop screen, the laws of physics will heartlessly remind of themselves.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The second remark: why we limit ourselves to reviewing only Canon, Nikon and Sony.</i>  <i>The first two companies need no introduction, and the lion's part of the DSLRs is produced under these labels.</i>  <i>Well, Sony makes just amazing mirrorless cameras, for example, the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-sistemnyi-sony-alpha-a5100-kit-16-50-white-10006969%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Sony Alpha A5100</a> is considered one of the best entry-level mirrorless cameras.</i>  <i>Well, the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/fotoapparat-sistemnyi-sony-alpha-a6000-kit-16-50-silver-10006255%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Sony Alpha A6000</a> has long been firmly established in all sales charts.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Initial lenses</font> </h2><br>  As a rule, the first lenses that are worth trying out in business are the so-called fixes, i.e.  lenses with fixed focal length.  The absence of moving parts (and, as a result, the need to solve a bunch of engineering problems) reduces the price of the lens and allows you to achieve the highest quality images at a single focal length. <br><br>  In fact, thanks to the fix, you can see how your camera can shoot.  Well, the first fix is ‚Äã‚Äãto take the so-called 35s, i.e.  lenses that closely mimic human vision.  As a result, objects appear in the photograph just as your eyes perceive them.  Neither closer nor further. <br><br>  <i>Third remarks: here and below, when selecting the lens, we will focus on the so-called ‚Äúcrooks‚Äù, i.e.</i>  <i>cut matrices.</i>  <i>Because as if the beginning photographer is unlikely to have a full-frame camera.</i>  <i>However, in order not to be confused with the purchase, we will write the focal length as it is indicated on the lens, i.e.</i>  <i>without recalculation.</i> <br><br>  Well proven fixes: <br><br><ul><li>  For Canon: it‚Äôs worthwhile to retreat from the recommendation about the 35 mm and look at the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-canon-ef-50mm-f-1-8-stm-10008381%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Canon EF50mm F / 1.8</a> ( <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-canon-ef-50mm-f-1-8-stm-10008381%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">8,990</a> rubles) as the most budget option; <br></li><li>  For Nikon: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-nikon-af-s-dx-nikkor-35mm-f-1-8g-11032053%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Nikon AF-S DX Nikkor 35mm f / 1.8G</a> (14,990 rubles); <br></li><li>  For Sony: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sony-35mm-f-1-8-sel35f18-10007743%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Sony E 35mm f / 1.8 OSS</a> (32,990 rubles). <br></li></ul><br>  It may seem that the lens for Sony is somehow prohibitively expensive (for its price you can buy a more high-aperture Canon EF50mm F1 / 4), but it also has an image stabilizer, which allows you to take pictures at longer exposures.  In other words, in low light conditions you are more likely to get an ungreased frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03b/f36/689/03bf36689a0a42969bb55d3101c52737.jpg"><br>  <i>Sample photo on Sony E 35mm f / 1.8 OSS (Takuritsu Kou <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/flickr/" class="user_link">Flickr</a> )</i> <br><br>  If you still think that the price for Sony is somewhat too high, you can search for <a href="https://wclink.co/link/222/0/1/22568/">Sigma 30mm F / 2.8 DN</a> .  It is not always on sale, but it is a worthy alternative to the brand fix.  Yes, he is not so bright, and his blur is not so ‚Äúcreamy‚Äù, but it costs significantly less. <br><br>  <i>Remark four.</i>  <i>In order to understand exactly how these lenses are taken in combination with your camera, we suggest using the well-known <a href="https://pixelpeeper.com/">Pixel Peeper</a> website, which allows you to find photos taken with the bundle you need.</i>  <i>All images in the article, illustrating the capabilities of the camera, obtained by such an algorithm.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Zoom lenses</font> </h2><br>  All novice photographers love zooms very much.  If you are going to shoot wildlife, a sports match or your child at a matinee, we advise you to look at the following models: <br><br><ul><li>  For Canon: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-canon-ef70-200mm-f-4-l-usm-383416%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Canon EF70-200mm f / 4 L USM</a> (47 990 rubles).  He looks and shoots very well.  At the same time, despite the white color characteristic of professional lenses, it is not prohibitively expensive.  There is a modification of this lens with an integrated stabilizer, but it is exactly twice as expensive; <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/872/28a/7c587228a27d4d6b9a780b9b90c930c6.jpg"><br>  <i>(M. Kafka <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/flickr/" class="user_link">Flickr</a> )</i> <br><br><ul><li>  For Nikon: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-nikon-af-s-zoom-nikkor-70-300mm-f-4-5-5-6g-ed-vr-11031981%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Nikon 70-300mm f / 4.5-5.6G ED IF AF-S</a> (39,990 rubles).  The luminosity is no longer as remarkable as that of Canon, but it has a stabilizer; <br></li><li>  For Sony: Sony E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS.  Good lens with image stabilizer. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Wide angle lenses</font> </h2><br>  As a rule, right after the zoom, photographers start to get involved in wide-angle lenses.  Because it becomes much more interesting not to remove a distant object, but to convey the panorama opened to the eye as widely as possible.  Especially such a lens is in demand during city shooting - dense building does not allow for a sufficient distance to move away, allowing to fit all the most necessary things in the frame.  Or while photographing parties. <br><br>  <i>Remark five: wide-angle lenses are very much loved by realtors and hotel owners.</i>  <i>Thanks to this lens, the rooms look bigger than they are.</i> <br><br>  The most interesting lenses in this category: <br><br><ul><li>  For Canon: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-canon-ef-s-10-18mm-f-4-5-5-6-is-stm-10007402/reviews%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Canon EF-S 10-18mm f / 4.5-5.6 IS STM</a> (17 990 rubles).  A great option in its price range.  Most reviewers of this lens say that for such money this is a very, very good offer. <br><br></li><li>  For Nikon: A bit unexpected, but the <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sigma-10-20mm-f-3-5-ex-dc-hsm-nikon-10005973%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Sigma 10-20mm f / 3.5 EX DC HSM</a> (31 990) has the best price / quality combination.  Why precisely he?  The fact is that most wide-angle lenses have a standard problem caused by the design itself - frame distortion.  This is quite easily corrected by software when processing photos.  But in the case of Sigma, these distortions are minimal.  It means that it is easier to process photos and better result.  Experts from the reputable project DXOmark.com have tested the lens and agree that it is not inferior to the brand Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 10-24mm F / 3.5-4.5G ED. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e3/ad3/4e7/7e3ad34e7ad643e88bb31a90c82eba47.png"><br><br><ul><li>  For Sony: very good Sony 10-18mm f / 4 (62 990 rubles).  We pay a lot - but we also get high luminosity, optical stabilizer and automatic autofocus.  In principle, in the case of a wide-angle lens, autofocus is just not so important.  If you remove it, the stabilizer and the label of Sony itself, you get a good Samyang 12mm F2.0 NCS CS.  But it can be very difficult to find on sale. <br></li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Portrait lens</font> </h2><br>  Here again it is necessary to return to the fixes, because it is just hard to think of something better for portraits.  Relatively low price with consistently high quality rarely allows you to consider something else. <br><br>  The most interesting models: <br><br><ul><li>  For Canon: here you can try to work with the same <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-canon-ef50mm-f-1-4-usm-11023809%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Canon EF50mm F / 1.8</a> from the beginning of the article; <br></li><li>  For Nikon: Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 85mm f / 1.8G; <br></li><li>  For Sony: <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sigma-60mm-f-2-8-dn-sony-e-black-10004989%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dcpm%26utm_campaign%3Dgtblog%26reff%3Dgeektimes_cpm_gtblog">Sigma 60mm f / 2.8 DN</a> (for some incredible price for such glass 7990 rubles).  Below is an example of shooting with him with a Sony ILCE-3000 camera. <br></li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d1/622/640/4d1622640c934eeba4c198f70f5e9ad0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Casual lens</font> </h2><br>  Despite the fact that above we scolded the so-called whale lenses, their very idea is quite robust - the buyer is given a lens with universal focal lengths covering most of his needs.  But often the quality of ‚Äúmodels included‚Äù leaves much to be desired.  Therefore, a universal whale lens is proposed to be <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sigma-af-18-35mm-f1-8-dc-hsm-canon-10005092">replaced</a> with a no less universal <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sigma-af-18-35mm-f1-8-dc-hsm-canon-10005092">Sigma AF 18-35mm F1.8</a> ( <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/obektiv-sigma-af-18-35mm-f1-8-dc-hsm-canon-10005092">47,990</a> rubles).  And we recommend it for both Nikon and Canon.  Only the bayonet is different;  lens mount format. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2da/f5b/ebf/2daf5bebf88b402f92fd8d141e9acbdd.jpg"><br>  The important point is that this model has problems with autofocus in low light conditions.  Therefore, together with the lens is strongly recommended to take the so-called USB dock.  It allows you to update the firmware and correct the focus.  More on the forums are very advised to come to the store and try several copies, because the behavior of the lenses can vary.  It gives a little ‚Äúto modify the file‚Äù, but this is the case when you forgive everything for this price. <br><br>  Here is one of the reviews for this lens: <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is the best zoom lens for crop at the moment.  It replaces 3 fixes: 18, 24 and 35 mms with a diaphragm 1.8.  Consider that you have several lenses on the camera at the same time and you do not need to waste time on changing them. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a40/755/d74/a40755d748084f8aa117c81636a279e9.jpg"><br>  <i>(Coxy from Aus <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/flickr/" class="user_link">Flickr</a> )</i> <br><br>  Alas, it is quite difficult to call a universal lens for Sony at any reasonable price.  But we would appreciate if you share your thoughts in the comments. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402909/</a></p>
