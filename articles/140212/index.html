  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Search Quality in Runet - 2011</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company "Ashmanov and Partners" published a final report "The quality of search in RuNet" ( <a href="http://www.ashmanov.com/misc/file/arc/pir/ashmanov-search-analytics-2011.pdf">PDF, 62 pages</a> ), compiled from the results of the analytical service <a href="http://analyzethis.ru/">AnalyzeThis.ru</a> .  According to the developers, AnalyzeThis is currently the only independent test of search quality on the Runet. <br><br>  Probably the most interesting part of this report is to compare the quality of Yandex search and Google.  Many users are subjectively trying to decide for themselves which of these two search engines is looking for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.  The AnalyzeThis website employs 23 search quality analyzers and an integrated analyzer for the overall search quality, so this service allows you to answer this question as objectively as possible. <br><br>  A detailed description of the work of the analyzers can be found in the report itself, as well as on <a href="http://www.ashmanov.com/">the Ashmanov website</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the past year, several important developments have taken place in the search market.  First of all, the independent Rambler and Aport search engines ceased to exist, these sites switched to Yandex, so that in many graphs the Rambler and Aport indicators in the second half of the year coincide with the Yandex indicators .  In turn, Google is increasing its position due to the growing popularity of the Google Chrome browser, the only browser on the global Internet that increased its market share in 2011.  Some experts believe that it was thanks to Chrome from January to October 2011 that Google acquired, and Yandex lost about 3.5% of Runet's search traffic.

      Google and Yandex show approximately the same quality in terms of navigation queries and information queries, in the quality of hints, resistance to typos, in the level of SEO-pressing, in the amount of spam and the level of advertising load, as well as in the level of updates. <br><br>  Google is ahead in the quality of quote search, the quality of search for homonyms, the search for popular words, the relevance of information in search results and the speed of indexing new pages in Runet, the level of similarity of issue for queries synonyms and the number of porn sites in search results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e90/ea6/776/e90ea6776dacf31f78fb7bc39c4d922e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d7d/920/47b/d7d92047bd9e32b23bda37911df34872.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5a/2b8/092/f5a2b8092878b671e9d88b13f9311c80.png"><br><br>  In turn, ‚ÄúYandex wins from Google in terms of index completeness, search by thematic queries and - very strongly - in terms of the quality of regional search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fe/fd5/843/7fefd584305407f9b5ff19ef18bdaf28.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/265/9de/4e7/2659de4e705c44f886758651d54fa558.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9a/9d4/75b/d9a9d475baa83286df9211cd8a308425.png"><br><br>  An interesting situation has developed with a marker of the availability of original sources of information in search results.  According to this indicator, Google has made significant progress and at the end of the year came very close to Yandex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e08/ff7/b1b/e08ff7b1b3703f18905d3f4111fcf424.png"><br><br><blockquote>  On the corresponding chart, the highest positions are occupied by those search engines that more correctly track the originals. <br><br>  We have to admit that the quality of processing of this extremely important parameter is unsatisfactory for all search engines.  Search engines are still poorly ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù where the original text is, and where is the reprint, which often leads to the fact that the site with the copied articles is in the issue much higher than the site with the original. <br><br>  In Runet, the relative leadership by definition of the originals was occupied by Yandex until the end of the year, but even his share of ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù does not exceed 50 percent.  Almost all other search engines for this indicator, unfortunately, demonstrate a negative trend.  Note that Yandex also lost ground in November and December - perhaps this is due to the fact that the set of markers in this analyzer remained almost unchanged during the year, and the originals sought became increasingly ‚Äúold‚Äù. <br><br>  The exception is Google, which since October has consistently improved the quality of search for this parameter.  (Already in early 2012, Google overtook Yandex, bringing the quality of the search for originals to 60%). </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140212/</a></p>
