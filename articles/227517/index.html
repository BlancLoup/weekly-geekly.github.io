Today we received a dispatch from Shipito, in which it is reported that there are about 40 days to purchase and deliver goods at the old rates (1000 Euros per month per person). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/197/8e0/885/1978e0885298f1b0b400269b95c65e9b.jpg"><br><blockquote>  Russian Customs News <br>  New custom limit is 150 Euro and 10kg for one parcel. <br>  There is about 30-40 days to take effect. </blockquote><br>  Voting on the Internet did not help. <br>  Sad story.  Now you can‚Äôt buy products that are so rare in Russia (for example, I ordered it right after the announcement of the Nexus 5 32Gb white and Nexus 7 32Gb white). <br>  It is also unknown at what price for us will be available so expected by many Moto360. <br>  And although there was no official announcement, and the project has not yet been signed, sending out from one of the largest intermediaries speaks volumes. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The initiative against imposing additional taxes on purchases in foreign online stores, as well as against reducing the customs limit of 1,000 euros for purchases of goods for personal use is still open <a href="http://www.roi.ru/6536/">www.roi.ru/6536</a> <br>  <b>UPD 1</b> : <br>  For convenience, I will describe how things are at the moment.  If only the cost limit and weight are changed, it will be similar. <br><br>  Customs duties are not subject to MPO with the following mandatory characteristics: <br><ul><li>  Products must be for personal use. </li><li>  The total amount of goods per month should not exceed 1000 euros per recipient - an individual. </li><li>  The total weight of goods per month should not exceed 31 kg per recipient - an individual. </li><li>  In the case of receiving within one month of goods whose value exceeds 1000 euros and their total weight exceeds 31 kg, customs duties are applied to this excess. </li></ul><br><br>  Customs duties have cost and weight norms. <br><ul><li>  If the goods are worth more than the specified norms, then a duty in the amount of 30% of the excess of the standard cost is charged.  Shipping costs are not counted. </li><li>  If the imported goods weigh more than the specified norms, then a customs duty in the amount of 4 euros per 1 kg of excess weight is charged. </li></ul><br>  For example: <br>  The total cost of goods per month is 1,200 euros.  Total weight - 20 kg. <br>  <b>At the moment</b> : The duty (1200-1000) * 30% = 200 * 0.3 = 60 euros. <br>  <b>If they accept the project</b> : The duty (1200-150) * 30% = 1050 * 0.3 = 315 euros (by weight the tax is obtained: (20-10) * 4 = 40 euros, but the larger of the two is taken).  Of course, you must take into account each individual package, and not the total cost.  The norms do not cancel the total monthly limit, but add a restriction on one parcel. <br>  The cost of the package is 130 euros.  Package weight - 40 kg. <br>  <b>Currently</b> : Fee (40-31) * 4 = 9 * 4 = 36 euros. <br>  <b>If they accept the project</b> : The duty (40-10) * 4 = 30 * 4 = 120 euros <br>  If both weight and cost are exceeded, the excess is calculated for both indicators and the maximum amount is taken. <br>  Read more <a href="http://goo.gl/z24IA0">HERE</a>

      <b>UPD 2</b> : An example from life.  Buying a Nexus 5 32Gb.  For the calculation, the euro exchange rate is 46 rubles, the dollar exchange rate is 34 rubles (all figures are rounded for convenience). <br>  The cost on Google Play is $ 399 + $ 10 delivery to the intermediary's warehouse + $ 3-5 $ parcel processing + ~ $ 40 shipping = about $ 455 or RUB 15,500. <br>  When / if they accept the project: <br>  The cost is approximately 295 euros.  The tax will be (295-150) * 0.3 = 43.5 euros or 2000 rubles. <br>  At the cost of the Apparatus in the coherent current 16990, the purchase does not make sense, because  overpayment will be 500r.  Actually will be at the start of sales (8 months ago, the cost was about 21-22 thousand rubles) <br><br>  <b>UPD 3:</b> <br>  Today's letter from Shopfans-Express: <br><blockquote>  <i>How To Live After Limit Reductions?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It would seem that the news is twofold for shopaholics, but is it all so bad ?!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Firstly, OUR MAIN SURPRISE - today we announce a new type of Altyn Express delivery through the Republic of Kazakhstan!</i>  <i>This will give customers from Russia and the Republic of Belarus the opportunity to continue to use the limit of ‚Ç¨ 1000 per month, as if the limits in Russia have not changed.</i>  <i>Previously, the cost of delivery through Altyn Express will be 10% -15% higher than directly via Shopfans-Express, and delivery times will increase by 1-2 business days.</i>  <i>We will report the final information on the launch of Altyn Express 30 days before the limits are reduced in Russia.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Secondly, from June 2014 through Shopfans-Express, you can send parcels on the principle of ‚Äúone Package - several Recipients‚Äù, using the maximum duty-free limit of each Recipient.</i>  <i>Thus, you can receive parcels with an estimated value above the established limit, without paying customs duties.</i>  <i>Unite, and the best shipping rates guaranteed!</i>  <i>Already, we are sending more than ‚Ç¨ 1,000 worth of parcels to multiple recipients.</i>  <i>Read more in our Shopfans-Express manual.</i> </blockquote><br>  Details about the delivery Shopfans <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/227737/">here</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD 4:</b> <br>  An article in the Izvestia newspaper appeared with the deputy head of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, Mikhail Evraev (the Russian Post office falls under the authority of the ministry and participates in the development of new mechanisms for regulating e-commerce). <br><br>  <i>Now we have two parallel processes: the first is a public discussion on a draft government decree, which intends to change the rules for importing goods for personal use from foreign online stores, setting the cost of duty-free importation of one parcel at ‚Ç¨ 150 and weight 10 kg without limitations on the number of parcels received per month per person, the second is the process of interdepartmental coordination of the international protocol for all countries ‚Äî participants of the Customs Union, ‚Äùexplains Heraev.</i>  <i>- We expect that the changes to the Russian legislation will come into force within 1.5‚Äì2 months, and at the same time the legislation will be harmonized for all countries of the Customs Union.</i>  <i>At the same time, the governments of the countries participating in the Customs Union will still have the opportunity to further regulate the duty-free importation of goods for personal use from foreign online stores, taking into account the maximum levels for the cost and weight of packages that will be established by the protocol of the Customs Union.</i> <br><br>  <i>Banks and payment systems are planning to provide the ability to connect to the customs payment service and receive payment for the specified public services through their online services.</i>  <i>We hope that these initiatives will be implemented before the end of this year, ‚ÄùNatalia Karachevtseva, deputy chairman of the board of the non-profit partnership National Payment Council, told Izvestia.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://goo.gl/dB8RUV">Full article.</a> <br><br>  <b>UPD 5</b> : <br>  Last night a letter came from a parcel post. <br><br>  <i>How to live at the new customs limits?</i>  <i>The answer is!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Friends!</i>  <i>Many of you are worried about new customs limits that have not yet been adopted, but, as many believe, are about to be introduced.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In order to mitigate for you the consequences of this event, Banderolk is developing a number of solutions, the first of which we are launching on July 4 in test mode.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The solution is called ‚ÄúJoint shipments‚Äù and it is intended both for those who organize joint purchases and for those who simply love to buy many things, not only for themselves, but also for their friends, relatives and loved ones.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The new method of shipping will allow you to avoid the need to overpay for customs duties where it can be avoided quite legally and honestly.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><a href="http://goo.gl/Qpjwpy">You will see the details on the Banderaka</a> website on the launch day of the ‚ÄúJoint shipments‚Äù.</i>  <i>Follow our news!</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD6</b> <a href="http://goo.gl/rDzRjm">Possible good news</a> about the suspension of work on the project and its cancellation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227517/</a></p>
