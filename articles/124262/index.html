  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to get capital to budding entrepreneurs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many IT specialists sooner or later come to the conclusion that it is more efficient and more profitable to work for yourself than to be an employee.  Having gained experience in some area, I would like to apply my knowledge to improve well-being, but the question arises: ‚Äúwhere to start?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhere to get money for a start?‚Äù As practice shows, few people turn to the state for help, but first Of course, all means are good and you need to use every opportunity! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Good day, dear IT specialists who want to start a business or accidentally read this post!  I will try to briefly highlight the topic of the possibility of obtaining various kinds of support from the state. <br><br>  To start our own business, we need at least some savings; the center of employment will help us in this.  We find the appropriate institution in our city and district, and as soon as we get registered (for a job search), for this we need the following documents: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ a passport (or a document replacing it); <br>  ‚Ä¢ certificate of education (if you have never worked before); <br>  ‚Ä¢ a document certifying professional qualifications (having work experience); <br>  ‚Ä¢ employment record or a document replacing it (having work experience); <br>  ‚Ä¢ certificate of average earnings (having work experience).

      For 10 days, the employment center is looking for a job that suits you, which corresponds to your education, work experience and your requirements.  If after this time you do not find a job, and the probability of this is extremely small, then you will be recognized as unemployed. <br><br>  Lyrical digression: I am an economist who received a diploma 2 weeks ago, of course there is no professional experience, I specified salary requirements for 20 tr, I think that for the city of Novosibirsk where I live, these are average requests, but taking into account the lack of seniority to find such a job is not easy, especially as practice has shown in the employment center there are not too many vacancies. <br><br>  After registration, you will have to come to the purchasing center at least 2 more times, for the next job search (in a week) and for recognition as unemployed (in 3 more days).  You will be asked to open an account in the savings bank to receive unemployment benefits, but our goal is to get start-up capital, so we will not go into details on benefits. <br><br>  As an additional measure of employment, the CH offers a program to ‚Äúpromote self-employment of unemployed citizens‚Äù, which we need!  In Novosibirsk, the subsidy is 73500 rubles, perhaps in different cities this figure may differ.  To get this money, you need to make a business plan and protect it, they will tell you about all the details and conduct "courses" on business.  Protection, as a rule, does not cause anyone difficulties, because  IT is clearly not within their area of ‚Äã‚Äãcompetence and it is difficult for them to hinder a person who works in this industry.  It is not necessary to return the money naturally (this question often arises), but it is necessary to fully report on the expenses, the CZ specialists will tell you about all these points in detail. <br>  The amount may not seem to be enough to start a business, but as a rule there is enough for small startups, and to develop your business, we turn to the small and medium-sized business development department for more substantial help. <br><br>  The support measure we are interested in is called ‚ÄúSubsidizing a portion of the cost of implementing a business plan for an entrepreneurial project (grants for starting one‚Äôs own business),‚Äù can be formulated differently in different areas.  Here you can get up to 300 tr.  (for innovative companies up to 500 tr.), for this it is necessary to draw up a business plan, but not how to get the first subsidy.  Now the emphasis is on a functioning enterprise that has the main assets and money necessary for business expansion, the more your invested funds, the more likely it is to get a subsidy!  I am glad that IT is one of the priority areas, so the probability of getting support is an order of magnitude higher than in the case of trade or services (not in IT). <br><br>  Thus, we get a fairly tangible start-up capital from the state, which will certainly be useful for any start-ups.  I also advise you to consider other support measures from the department, you will probably find something else useful for yourself, for example, subsidizing part of the cost of renting premises, staff training or participation in exhibitions, fairs, etc. <br><br>  Good luck in your business and your endeavors! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124262/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124262/</a></p>
