      The series ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù is included in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv%3Fref_%3Dtt_awd">200 most highly acclaimed serials</a> according to iMDB, and received the ‚ÄúGolden Globe‚Äù along with four dozen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1520211/awards%3Fref_%3Dtt_awd">other awards</a> .  The series also holds the first place in the total number of viewers in the history of cable television.  The premiere of the fifth season gathered an audience of 17.3 million people, which is also a record.  6 seasons of the series have already been filmed, and filming of the seventh is planned. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Walking Dead script was written by Frank Darabont, who worked on the TV series The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones and the City of Gangsters and adapted the Green Mile book for the big screen.  But either he is not interested in adapting Amber, or he is too busy with current work, as a result of which another person will be engaged in adaptation. <br><br>  The Amber Chronicles is an epic work telling about the life of the royal family, the ruling universe consisting of parallel worlds.  These worlds are "shadows" (in the author's terminology; in another translation - "reflections"), cast by the only "true" world of Amber, which is a stronghold of Order.  At the other end of the scale of countless worlds of shadows is the Court of Chaos. <br><br>  The members of the royal family and their blood relatives have the ability to move between different ‚Äúshadows‚Äù with the help of willpower.  Five of the ten volumes tell what is happening from the point of view of Prince Corvin, the other five from the point of view of his son, Merlin. <br><br>  First published in 1970, Amber Chronicles sold 15 million copies worldwide.  Actors Alessandro Juliani and Wil Wheaton in 2012 recorded <a href="http://www.audible.co.uk/series%3Fasin%3DB00KWRCITM">audio books</a> with the full version of "Chronicles". <br><br>  The author of Amber Chronicles is Roger Zelazny, American science fiction writer (1937-1995).  He was born in the family of a Pole and an Irish.  Already in 10 years Zhelazny wrote fairy tales.  At university, he was first engaged in psychology, and then transferred to the department of English literature.  In 1962, he received a master's degree from Columbia University with a degree in Drama of the Elizabethan and Jacobian Eras. <br><br>  Zelazny was fond of martial arts and fencing, got a black belt in aikido, played chess, studied Hindi and Japanese, was fascinated by meditation and mysticism.  All his hobbies are reflected in his books.  These are mostly fiction novels where science fiction is intertwined with fantasy and mysticism.  The author also often turned to the mythologies of various nations of the world. <br><br>  R. Zelazny has about 20 novels and four collections of short stories.  He received the ‚ÄúHugo‚Äù award six times, three - ‚ÄúNebula‚Äù, once - the French ‚ÄúApollo‚Äù, was awarded the prize of the magazine ‚ÄúLocus‚Äù for the creation of ‚ÄúThe Chronicles of Amber‚Äù.  He wrote several works in collaboration with Philip Dick, Fred Saberhagen, Thomas T. Thomas and Robert Sheckley. <br><br>  Zelazny was a close friend of George Martin, the ‚ÄúSong of Ice and Flame‚Äù series of which we owe a new surge of interest in fantasy works.  They participated in joint literary projects (Wild Cards series), and Martin even claimed that he was inspired to create A Song by Amber Chronicles.  <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/walking-dead-creator-adapting-chronicles-amber-tv-exclusive-040000815.html">Martin called elazny a</a> "narrator who has no equal", creating "bright, exotic and memorable worlds, some of the best in our genre." <br><br>  Founded in 2010, Skybound Entertainment is engaged in a variety of entertainment projects, from television and film to interactive content and computer games.  In addition to Walking The Dead, the company is producing The Outcast series, telling about a young man trying to understand why various supernatural things happen to him throughout his life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396311/</a></p>
