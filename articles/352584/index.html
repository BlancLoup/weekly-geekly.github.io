  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do the world need technical certificates?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some IT specialists and HR recruiters believe that the level of knowledge gained in a Russian or foreign university, as well as project experience, is more important than a certificate.  There is some truth in this.  Students and specialists who graduated from our universities brilliantly know how to solve business problems.  However, it is no secret to anyone that the movement of the Russian IT market is highly susceptible to events in large global markets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/un/eq/gnuneqqtry6lv2ynkjmxdsyjjl4.jpeg"><br><br>  In this regard, obtaining a certificate indicates an understanding of global processes and awareness of potential new niches that open up new business prospects.  And the Russian market shows a growing interest in such knowledge.  We decided to share with you some statistics on Azure-exams that are popular with us, and also tell you how to get them right and what training opportunities are available now.  Well, at the end of the article you will find 3 exam preparation instructions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  In order to increase the chances of those who wish to successfully pass the exams, we with colleagues and partners conduct several Russian-language webinars in preparation for the tests:

How much? </h2><br>  If you have already decided to receive an international diploma or certificate, then the next step is to answer the question: which program should you apply to?  Despite the large number of proposals, not really worth so much.  Each has its own characteristics and is suitable for certain categories of the most sought-after specialists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pk/gz/ha/pkgzhatacbvxoleshcywabhmqna.png"><br><br>  Read more <a href="http://cloudpro2020.ru/">here</a> . <br><br>  Today, the exam can be taken online and offline - at authorized testing centers.  Both in Russian and in English.  The cost of the exam is an average of $ 80 per attempt. <br><br>  But at the moment you can find promotional codes for free-delivery.  And it is important to understand that this is a temporary situation, and this will not always be the case.  Therefore, if you seriously decided not to postpone the exam for a long time - get your promo code until it is received by someone else. <br><br><h2>  Preparation options </h2><br>  Depending on which exam you are going to take, Microsoft will offer you the most effective training scheme.  <a href="https%253A%252F%252Fwww.microsoft.com%252Fru-ru%252Flearning%252Fexam-70-532.aspx%26data%3D04%257C01%257Cv-elshve%2540microsoft.com%257Cfa0b9a26f424423315a208d57842ff15%257C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%257C1%257C0%257C636547151519107844%257CUnknown%257CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwifQ%253D%253D%257C-1%26sdata%3DG0yGVUjFJBjzz0Cx9sJXQVXKfZospXCCISmjEEWilPs%253D%26reserved%3D0">On the page of each exam</a> , all the recommended resources, practical test tasks and now such a plan of preparation are already collected: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cr/le/xf/crlexfoa4clqljwre-i-j5sthfw.png"><br><br><h4>  Authorized Courses at Microsoft Learning Centers </h4><br>  And, actually, item number one in the recommended training options. <br><br>  There are several authorized training centers in Russia (below are detailed information) where you can receive training in preparation for the exam: <br><br><ul><li>  Offline in class. </li><li>  Remotely. </li><li>  In the format of open training (you can choose the pace of classes). </li></ul><br>  At the end of the course, you will receive in addition an official certificate from Microsoft: about the successful completion of the training. <br><br>  So, the <b>advantages of</b> this method of preparation: <br><br><ul><li>  Resources, teaching methods - all prepared by Microsoft.  Always the most current information. </li><li>  In authorized centers courses are taught by certified teachers.  You get the opportunity to ask a question, deal with difficulties. </li><li>  For practical work, you have everything you need: virtual machines are pre-configured, there are special stands, demo environments. </li><li>  Group classes.  The effect of the team does its work: common themes, new acquaintances, inspirational examples. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  Pleasure is not cheap. </li><li>  Duration of training is 5 days (40 academic hours). </li></ul><br><h4>  Official Microsoft Online Courses and MS Press Books </h4><br>  For self-study, Microsoft offers online courses on the <a href="https://www.edx.org/">Open EDx</a> platform.  This is the most current online content that Microsoft releases.  Courses are updated every few months. <br><br>  For those who like to page through and replenish the library - paper editions.  They can be purchased at the official Microsoft Press store.  Not cheap, but I must say that this is the most comprehensive source of information for training. <br><br>  So, the <b>advantages of</b> self-training: <br><br><ul><li>  Resources, for the most part, absolutely free. </li><li>  You are not bound by the attendance of courses and you can choose the pace you want. </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><br><ul><li>  You should be a disciplined enough person not to stretch your exam preparation for a long time. </li><li>  The most current technology content in English only. </li></ul><br><h4>  Trial Tests </h4><br>  Microsoft is ready to test its readiness for the exam on trial tests from Mindhub.  A complete catalog of tests and materials for training can be found on the <a href="https://global4.mindhub.com/shop/microsoft%3FfacetValueFilter%3Dtenant~content-type:practice-tests%26">website</a> . <br><br>  A fly in the ointment - a paid test.  And it is <b>not cheap</b> . <br><br><h4>  Hands-On Labs from Microsoft </h4><br>  As an alternative to trial tests, you can use laboratory work to upgrade practical skills.

The resource is being replenished and, I believe, will soon become a good simulator not only in preparation for the exam, but also in general in raising its professional level. <br><br><h2>  Language preparation and delivery </h2><br>  As we wrote above, you can prepare for the exam in Russian and in English.  On the one hand, the Russian language is more familiar and familiar - but as applied to exams it can play a cruel joke.  Firstly, not all terms in the translation version have the same obvious clarity, as in English.  Sometimes the questions in the translated version look much more complicated and flatter than in the original version.  Secondly, all the latest product documentation first appears in English and only then is localized into Russian - i.e.  initially focusing on studying the material in English, you expand the range of resources available for training. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion - if you take certification as a step towards an international career - then in international projects, English will come in handy for you a lot more!  But, for the sake of justice, let us say that it is possible to take in Russian, and the flow of those who donate significant. <br><br><h2>  Where certification is popular - some statistics </h2><br>  Cloud technologies and cloud approaches in IT are already firmly rooted in many countries of the world, and it is gratifying to see that Russia is far from the last in the number of certified cloud architects.  As can be seen from the graph below, on the territory of Central and Eastern Europe, we are second only to Poland and noticeably ahead of the Czech Republic. <br><br>  However, if you look at the world leader - the United States, the number of officially registered architects in our country simply cannot be compared, and as you can see from the graph - you can say, ‚Äúat the level of statistical error‚Äù.  And in order to make a qualitative leap and organize a real Digital Transformation in our country - we obviously need to push with the training of a sufficient number of qualified personnel! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/ua/ic/zxuaictxbm4izdtspzaverabnsm.png"><br><br><h2>  Instead of an afterword </h2><br>  In conclusion, it should be noted that the certificate is a long-term investment for career steps.  Nevertheless, the skills and knowledge gained in the preparation process will strengthen your professional level and achieve your business goals now.  Today, there are already quite a few professionals who have undergone relevant training and received a <a href="http://cloudpro2020.ru/">CloudPro Architect certificate</a> .  What use to prepare, you learned from the article.  This is a rather thorny path.  However, most of the specialists and directors who passed through it, do not regret that they chose him.  They see the preparation and certification process as a low-hanging fruit on the way to more attractive ones. <br><br>  If, after reading this article, you decide to postpone preparing for the exam, below you will find 3 very similar instructions for preparing for the three most promising examinations on Microsoft Cloud Technologies: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://rutechnet.blob.core.windows.net/files/70-532.pdf">70-532: Developing Microsoft Azure Solutions</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://rutechnet.blob.core.windows.net/files/70-533.pdf">70-533: Implementing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://rutechnet.blob.core.windows.net/files/70-535.pdf">70-535: Architecting Microsoft Azure Solutions</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352584/</a></p>
