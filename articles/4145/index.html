  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Deputies went to the record for the sale</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Friday, the State Duma approved in the second and third readings <a href="http://bit.prime-tass.ru/news/show.asp%3Fid%3D41075%26amp%3Bct%3Dnews">amendments to the Law ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù</a> , aimed at protecting the rights of special consumers (police, military and various kinds of special services).  Now, if the telecommunications operator wants to disconnect one of the power consumers (for example, because of a money debt), then it will be impossible to do this without the written consent of the consumer.  The Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications also received the right to establish additional licensing requirements for operators working with law enforcement agencies.  Finally, the amendments state that prices for communication services for security officials should be set on the basis of an economically feasible standard of costs and compensation for profits. <br><br>  These amendments were made by the relevant Committee of the State Duma on energy, transport and communications with the active support of the Ministry of Information and Communications.  When considering the amendments, lawmakers were in a hurry, because this Saturday they went on summer holidays.  As a result: in the first reading the bill was adopted <a href="http://www.mforum.ru/news/article/035494.htm">on Wednesday, July 5</a> , and on July 7 it passed the other two readings.  Now the law is in the Federation Council, which must decide its fate.  If approved, amendments to the Law on Communication will be signed by President Vladimir Putin. <br><br>  Having worked at such an accelerated pace, the deputies made a great contribution to the privatization process of the <a href="http://www.svyazinvest.ru/">Svyazinvest</a> holding.  After all, two years ago, the Government decided to sell the state-owned stake in this company (75% minus one share), but in two years this business did not get off the ground.  The reason is fears of security officials, who, being chronic defaulters, are afraid that the commercial owner of Svyazinvest will start cutting them off for debt.  The fears are well founded: recently the former general director of Svyazinvest, Valery Yashin, said that the total debt of state structures (including power structures) to the holding exceeds 5 billion rubles.  At the same time, about 2.5 billion courts recognized the correctness of telecom operators, but the government still does not pay money.

      The law adopted by the State Duma, in fact, allows security officials not to pay further.  It is worth noting that, back in June, the prospect of adopting such a law looked very distant, since the Government planned to prepare it <a href="http://cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2006/06/14/203579">only by the spring of next year</a> .  But the deputies, having enlisted the consent of the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications (or, most likely, acting from its submission), were ahead of the government and developed their own proposals on this issue.  True, even if the president signs this law and, thus, formally removes the last obstacle for the sale of the state-owned stake in Svyazinvest, the future future of the holding will remain unclear.  After all, the Minister of Information Technology and Communications, Leonid Reiman, and the head of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, German Gref, said that the privatization of Svyazinvest would not take place this year, although both of them are active supporters of it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs long as there is uncertainty as to who will be Putin‚Äôs successor in Russia in 2008, no one will decide to take such a large-scale step as the sale of the state-owned stake in Svyazinvest,‚Äù said Prime-Consult analyst Margarita Zobnina.  ‚ÄúHowever, in the event that at some point the corresponding certainty appears anyway, the law adopted now will be useful, as it will allow the holding to be privatized quickly enough.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4145/</a></p>
