There were rumors about the resignation of Zharov</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/64/kr/ms/64krmsihn0syfgprwxttnulojcw.jpeg" align="left">  Today, the Council of the Interregional Society of Scientists (ONR) <a href="http://onr-russia.ru/content/ONR-RKN">expressed outrage at the</a> actions of Roskomnadzor, which blocked 18 million IP addresses and seriously disrupted the performance of many Internet services and sites on the territory of the Russian Federation, trying to interfere with the work of the Telegram messenger. <br><br>  The opinion of the NRO is certainly shared by hundreds of commercial companies that have experienced difficulties and suffered direct financial damage.  Some representatives of the software industry suggest that if the blocking continues until the end of 2018, the damage to Russian companies <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3614069">will be about $ 1 billion</a> .  Amazon and Google will lose about the same amount. <br><br>  "Due to Roskomnadzor's unprofessional actions, Russian scientists were denied access to ResearchGate's specialized network of scientific contacts, to the archives of scientific journals of the largest publisher Wiley, to the central repository of Java libraries, to the website of the journal Science, Google search system and to a number of other network services that are constantly used in research work.  Interruptions in access to the KIAS information system led to the disruption of the submission of applications for grant competitions conducted by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research.  Due to the disruption of access to educational sites, the learning process at SkolTech, MSU, HSE and several other universities was partially paralyzed.  The site of the Free Network Community ‚ÄúDissernet‚Äù also suffered, exposing large-scale incorrect borrowing of other people's materials in the theses of many unscrupulous authors, including the head of Roskomnadzor A. A. Zharov, ‚Äùthe ONR <a href="http://onr-russia.ru/content/ONR-RKN">statement</a> said. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Scientists believe that the damage that Roskomnadzor has done to Russian science and education, and therefore to the whole society, can in no way be justified by the need to execute a court decision in respect of one private company.  The Council of the NRO also reminded that in accordance with Article 29 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation everyone has the right to freely seek, receive, transmit, produce and disseminate information in any legal way, freedom of the media is guaranteed, and censorship is prohibited.  Search, analysis and exchange of scientific information are the most important components of scientific work.

      The Council of the NRO demands ‚Äúto immediately stop the harmful activities of Roskomnadzor and to ensure effective protection of scientific, educational and other socially significant Internet resources from the dangers arising from this agency.‚Äù  According to scientists, employees and managers of Roskomnadzor, the fault of which caused interruptions in the work of these resources in Russia, should be held accountable for their actions. <br><br>  A similar statement was <a href="https://sovet-po-nauke.ru/info/25042018-internet-for-science">published by the</a> Council of Science under the Ministry of Education.  It says that due to the blockages of Roskomnadzor, full-fledged scientific work was under threat.  This is due to the fact that over the past few days there have been problems accessing the following sites: <br><br><ul><li>  the publishing house of the scientific journals in physics of the American Institute of Physics (aip.org); </li><li>  the library of the scientific publishing house Elsevier (linkinghub.elsevier.com); </li><li>  LaTeX scientific articles collection online editor (overleaf.com); </li><li>  the main online resource for working with bibliographies in scientific articles Mendeley (mendeley.com); </li><li>  Google Scholar full text research service (scholar.google.com); </li><li>  Google Docs Document Collaboration (docs.google.com) </li><li>  ResearchGate network of scientific communication and consultations (researchgate.net); </li><li>  Doodle meeting and conference planning service (doodle.com); </li><li>  many other sites that host specific scientific and popular projects, such as "Biomolecule" (https://biomolecula.ru), N + 1 (https://nplus1.ru), etc. </li></ul><br>  One of the serious problems was the interruption of access to a key resource for the identification of scientific articles dx.doi.org <br><br><h1>  Roskomnadzor under fire </h1><br>  Meanwhile, more and more high-ranking officials are expressing dissatisfaction with the actions of Roskomnadzor.  Yesterday <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/300337/">, the</a> head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of Russia Igor Artemyev <a href="https://geektimes.com/post/300337/">expressed</a> his opinion: ‚ÄúThe state cannot afford to sit in a puddle, and this is very sad ... I just see that this story itself, its current causes great damage.  I can say that I am very upset, I see how the younger generation reacts to this, it‚Äôs terrible just, ‚Äùhe said and expressed uncertainty that Roskomnadzor will be able to completely block Telegram. <br><br>  Today <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610233">, the</a> head of the Center for Strategic Research (CSR), ex-finance minister Alexei Kudrin <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610233">joined the</a> criticism: ‚ÄúI think this decision, this operation was carried out without sufficient preparation.  It was impossible to create a situation that entailed such consequences for users, especially for those who are not connected with Telegram.  These are really too serious consequences, ‚Äùhe said.  - It is immediately obvious that the initiators of these steps did not realize all the consequences.  They needed to think more seriously about whether these measures would achieve a result. ‚Äù <br><br>  Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich did not comment on the assessment of potential losses of companies from the actions of Roskomnadzor to block the Telegram messenger.  He answered the questions of journalists with one phrase: <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610305">‚ÄúAnd it works for me!‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Even the president‚Äôs press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610310">said</a> that Telegram still uses after the court‚Äôs decision to block the messenger in Russia - and sees nothing wrong with that.  Previously, Peskov <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/608456">reported</a> that he installed the ICQ messenger and started testing it. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610371">details of</a> yesterday‚Äôs meeting of Roskomnadzor employees with the participants of the IT industry became known today.  Recall, at that meeting, Deputy Head of Roskomnadzor Vadim Subbotin said: ‚ÄúContacts with Amazon have not yet led to positive results, perhaps for political reasons.  On the contrary, interaction with Google is becoming more constructive, and a substantive dialogue has begun. ‚Äù <br><br>  But now it turned out that representatives of Google, Microsoft and Amazon <b>did not come to the meeting at all</b> , ignoring the invitation: ‚ÄúWe invited representatives of international companies, and they could not just attend.  Both Google and Microsoft were invited, but answered that, unfortunately, they would not be able to come, citing the fact that there are no people who make decisions in Moscow, ‚Äùthe head of the Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies (ROCIT) <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/610371">told</a> Interfax. Sergey Grebennikov.  According to him, a representative of Amazon was not invited to the meeting, as "there is no way out for him." <br><br><h1>  Rumors about the resignation of Zharov </h1><br>  Judging by the mass of critical comments from all sides, the ring around Roskomnadzor is compressed.  Today, the <a href="https://t.me/alexlitreev_channel/868">first rumors about the resignation of Alexander Zharov</a> .  Information not confirmed.  The head of Roskomnadzor himself, the second day, does not give comments to the media and, apparently, does not appear in public.  In social networks, information about the resignation of Zharov <a href="https://tsargrad.tv/news/istochniki-soobshhili-ob-otstavke-zharova-s-posta-glavy-roskomnadzora_128333">spread like an avalanche</a> .  Even if they are not related to reality, they can play the role of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">self-fulfilling prophecy</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356286/</a></p>
