  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moscow Rescue Service will not reach the age of majority?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a month ago, a message appeared on the <a href="http://0911.su/forum_bridge/index.php%3Ff%3D10%26p%3D19347%26rb_v%3Dviewtopic">forum of the</a> Moscow Rescue Service (hereinafter MSS), stating that the work of the MCC information center ends on December 1, 2011. <br><br>  This means that the MTS 112 channel, MGTS phone 937-99-11, channels 0911, as well as, probably, ‚Äú9‚Äù and ‚Äú19‚Äù radio channels, cease their work. <br><br>  It should be noted that in the history of the MCC, this is not the first time that its employees are given a notice of dismissal.  A similar case was in March 2009.  However, then the service was lucky.

      At this time, according to employees, the situation is much more critical. <br><br>  What is the MCC can be found on the <a href="http://www.rescue.ru/about/">official website of the</a> service. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/share/4006/20111105/fromtime:09:05:34">On the closure of the MCC</a> on the radio "City-FM". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Below I give an open letter to MSS operators: </h5><br>  An open letter from the team of the Emergency Call Center of the Moscow Rescue Service to residents and employees of the operational services of Moscow and the Moscow Region. <br><br>  On Friday, October 28, the Director General of the Moscow Rescue Service told staff that by the end of 2011 the Emergency Call Center was completing its work.  The MTS 112 channel, MGTS 937-99-11 telephone, 0911 channels are the single channels for calling all operational, rescue and other emergency services, stop their work.  The Rescue Service has no prospects, the operators are asked to take care of their own future and find a new job. <br>  For 16 years, the operators of the Moscow Rescue Service have received calls from Muscovites and residents of the Moscow region, and often from other regions.  These were calls from those who needed help, from those who, having got into a difficult situation, did not know who to turn to, from those who just wanted to share their grief. <br>  We, the operators of the Moscow Rescue Service, consider it a happiness and a great success in life that we happened to do this work.  We feel a sense of pride in the results of our work.  Yes, everything was not always smooth, each of us had failures.  But always the mistake of a separate operator was perceived by the team as general.  We are a team - strong, friendly, professional.  And each of us has a sympathetic heart.  For us, mercy and compassion are not just words.  Now we can say that our colleagues lost consciousness in their workplaces from emotional overload and moral strain.  No, we are not complaining.  Just at that moment when you hear the cry of the mother in whose hands the child dies, you have to summon all your composure to help in order to get the address out of the mouth of the mother. <br>  "ADDRESS" - the cherished word.  The most important word.  If there is no address, no help will come.  This is the uniqueness of the work of the operator of any emergency service - as soon as the operator accepted the call and introduced himself, the organization of rescue operations begins.  Our work is imperceptible, but the fact remains: the faster information is received, the faster it will be transferred to services.  And the more accurate the address, the faster help will come.  Seconds solve a lot.  Often all. <br>  Carefully, from hand to hand, we pass on information to those who go to the field - strong and courageous, fearless and noble: rescuers, ambulance officers, police, traffic police departments - to all those who save lives with their hands, provide law and order, prevent negative developments.  THANKS YOU! <br>  Thank you Service 02!  Our experience with 02 controllers is fruitful and exceptional. <br>  Thanks to the Remote 03!  We know that you have affectionately call us ‚ÄúSavior‚Äù for the eyes. <br>  Many thanks to the police and traffic police officers.  On your shoulders is the ultimate responsibility - to arrive on time, to find, to correct the address, to meet, to ensure the passage of the rescue services. <br>  Words of gratitude express Service 01 - beautiful people work there.  Beautiful soul and attitude. <br>  TSUKS!  We have always felt support from you. <br>  We know what wonderful people work as dispatchers of municipal utilities of the city, services providing vital activity of a huge metropolis.  Responsiveness and understanding are always heard in your voice. <br>  We will keep special memories about the employees of all operational services of the Moscow Region!  How many people were found and saved with your help, only we know. <br>  Center for emergency medical care, Territorial Center for Emergency Medicine!  Let me express admiration for your professionalism!  Thanks you! <br>  We often remember our rescuers, whom we still call each other ‚ÄúMountaineers - Gorevtsy‚Äù.  MOUNT - rapid response team.  And although in recent years we rarely meet, each of us cherishes the warmest memories of our joint work with you. <br>  Sincere and heartfelt thanks to the management of the Yauzsky Gate holding company for the long-term financing of the Moscow Rescue Service project.  A project that saved the lives of many thousands of people. <br>  We are grateful to the management of MTS, which, the only one of all mobile operators, supported our Service and paid bills for processing calls on line 112. <br>  We are also grateful to the management of VimpelCom, Megafon, Skylink companies for their many years of fruitful cooperation. <br>  We wish health, happiness and prosperity to everyone with whom we somehow came into contact in our work. <br>  Knowing the deplorable situation of our Service, knowing that everything is nearing completion, we want to assure Muscovites and residents of the Moscow region that the operators of the Emergency Call Center will do their job conscientiously as long as possible. <br><br>  With great respect and appreciation <br>  Operators and staff of the Emergency Call Center of the Moscow Rescue Service. <br><br>  PS Dear Muscovites and guests of the capital!  Please go out of town, take care of yourself.  Check in advance the phone numbers of the local ambulance, police, rescue and utility services - because in the near future we will not be able to help you. <br><br>  And the last request!  Who can!  Help us arrange our last appeal on the media pages.  SOS! <br><br>  PS: For me, the MCC has always been a guarantor of road safety.  It is enough to drive through the city once with the ‚Äúantenna on the roof‚Äù in order to understand the full scale and importance of the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133588/</a></p>
