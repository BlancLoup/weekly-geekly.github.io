  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our experience: IT services outsourcing for a network of retail stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For several years now, our company (retail chain) has been actively using the services of outsourcing companies in the field of IT.  In this article I would like to share my experience in working with IT outsourcing with colleagues. <br><br>  Since 2011, our network of stores has doubled, many stores have opened in the regions and we began to attract outsourcing for the repair and prevention of computer equipment.  Almost all the schemes described below have tried their own experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/482/da0/298/482da02985304d1aa027db06f4e01173.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Little classification </h4><br>  <b>Company customers</b> can be divided according to geography and size of objects.  Customer facilities can be large / medium / small, they can be scattered throughout the country or concentrated in one city. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>

        </script>
      <br>
      Specifically, in our case, we have large objects in Moscow and St. Petersburg, many small objects in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as well as many small objects in Russia (no more than 5 in one city). <br><br>  <b>Outsourcing companies</b> can also be divided according to geographical principle and payment scheme.  Outsourcers can only provide services in one city / region or be federal.  According to payment schemes, there can be a regular subscriber, payment only for incidents, or mixed, when a limited number of incidents are included in the subscriber. <br><br><h4>  As we had </h4><br>  When facilities began to open across Russia, we began to attract local companies under the incidental payment scheme.  With the increase in the number of regions, it became more and more difficult to administer this network of local companies, as it was required to conclude a separate contract with each organization, monitor its relevance, verify mutual settlements, etc. <br><br>  Further, an agreement was concluded with a federal contractor for subscription services.  The first time it became easier, but the contractor turned out to be very unscrupulous: we received convenient administration, but almost all the incidents required strict control from our side, it was impossible to contact the manager, or those tasks were incorrectly transferred to the final implementers.  After some time we just called the manager, received contacts from him on the spot and communicated directly with the performers.  As a result, with a small scandal and mutual claims, the contract was terminated, and we fell back to the previous scheme. <br><br>  When the wave of reductions went in 2014, the IT staff was reduced due to the crisis.  Again, the question of administering a well-developed network of contractors became acute, and as a result, we returned to a single contractor. <br><br>  By the current moment, after trying several more large federal outsourcing companies, we stopped at two.  With both the contract.  In both cases, we pay only for incidents, no subscription fees.  In one, the specialists are more qualified and more expensive; we call them for complex tasks.  The other experts, to put it mildly, are simpler (once explained to a person on fingers than adsl differs from wifi), but they are also cheaper.  They are attracted to simple work (re-cable, replace the network card, etc.).  Basically, when no diagnosis is required and the root of the problem is obvious. <br><br>  If you have large objects or many small objects in one city, then it is much more expedient to have full-time specialists.  Outsourcing is beneficial if you have a lot of small objects scattered around different cities. <br><br>  We only outsource part of the second line of technical support.  As the practice of Megaphone has shown, the first line should be its own.  If you give the first line to an outsourcing, then about 80% of calls will be redirected to the second line due to the high turnover in the call center and low qualifications of the operators.  Money will be thrown to the wind. <br><br><h4>  Difficulties </h4><br><ul><li>  Small local companies - often do not work on weekends or after 18:00.  They have the unpleasant property of quietly breaking money without informing you about it.  As a rule, they insist on 100% prepayment of any equipment. </li><li>  Federal companies - their services are more expensive, although in fact people often work from the same local firms.  Delays in the performance of work are possible due to the long-term coordination of the branch‚Äôs actions with the head office. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><ul><li>  Local companies - their services are cheaper than those of federal companies, the quality of specialists is usually very high. </li><li>  Federal companies are less prone to ruin, they work late in the evening and on weekends, they are easier to administer (only one contract, easier to settle, etc.), they can supply equipment without waiting for a 100% prepayment. </li></ul><br><br>  Based on the experience gained over the years, I can confidently state that the most profitable option of outsourcing in the regions is direct contracts with local companies.  If you have an administrative resource for maintaining such a scheme, then you will receive highly qualified specialists at very modest prices. <br><br>  If you do not have an administrative resource, then do not listen to any promises about the fact that you will be relieved of all problems in the field of IT for the subscriber. <br><br>  Agree only on the payment on the fact.  There were breakdowns - we pay.  Nothing broke - do not pay.  Requested prevention - pay.  We did not ask for prophylaxis - we do not pay. <br><br>  Otherwise, for your money you will try to achieve prompt execution of applications and listen to all sorts of excuses of the manager. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291148/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291148/</a></p>
