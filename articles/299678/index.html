They conducted a large-scale study, which took 5 years.  This is not about overeating, smoking or brushing your teeth on holidays.  Everything is much more serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/008/a34/80f/008a3480f5f1b010c4f45ef0d733b3bd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the results of the study, the following were recognized as bad habits that hinder getting rich: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The second job (poor people do not invest, they get a regular job). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tote (oh, this indestructible thirst for winning). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reading books only for pleasure (the rich often read literature for career and professional growth). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Loans (judging by research, rich people are less likely to take loans, preferring to buy something simpler). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Letting the budget run ‚Äúdrift-free‚Äù (only 20% of the poor control their spending, trying to clean up the finances. Among the rich, this is 84%). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Do not save savings (the rich do not always save a lot, but regularly).

      Habit is an established mode of behavior, a well-learned action, in which a person experiences a constant need.  Habits bring us closer to our goal or away from it.  Thanks to the habit of not smoking, leaving the house, you are still a little closer to the goal of "being healthy", and with the help of revising the products before the cash register you reach the goal of "saving money". <br>  I repent, I have a lot of bad habits, ranging from the "night before" and ending with the lack of control of spending in the supermarket.  But I try to deal with them, replacing the harmful ones with the useful ones.  And not because from all the public and LiveJournal they shout: ‚ÄúForm good habits in 21 days, it's cool!‚Äù.  And because I want to <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achieve their goals</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/08e/bf4/354/08ebf4354c46562c02ca82d2198f73fc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Six steps to creating good habits</b> <br><br>  To form a good habit, you need: <br><br>  1. Analyze the existing habits and determine what changes are needed. <br>  2. Make sure that the new habit will help achieve the goal. <br>  3. Formulate habits clearly, specifically. <br>  4. Identify supportive or companion habits. <br>  5. Make a public commitment. <br>  6. Find like-minded people or a partner. <br><br>  And now a little more. <br><br>  <i><b>Step one.</b></i>  Analyze your good and bad habits in 3-5 days.  Ask yourself the questions: ‚ÄúWhy am I doing this now?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow can I do it differently?‚Äù.  For example, if you are going to sit imposingly in a chair, holding chips in one hand, in the other - a remote control, slow down.  If you want to just eat chips, then eat them in the kitchen and only then turn on the football. <br><br>  <i><b>Step two.</b></i>  Your habit must reach the goal.  Why do you want to quit smoking?  Why has your menu suddenly stopped including buns, pizza and fast food?  These are the goals: health and beauty.  Therefore, forming a habit, always keep in mind the ultimate goal, the final result.  Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat daily habit will help make my goal a fait accompli? <br>  The goals set by <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">SmartProgress</a> participants are to create useful habits: download a press daily, write 10 pages of a book, learn Java programming for half an hour.  And the very writing of the report also becomes a good habit. <br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/4c2/ee3/d4d4c2ee30bb4d119da5af05fbc32e01.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <i><b>Step three</b> .</i>  Formulate precise and specific habits.  Do not "do physical exercises every day," but "Exercise from 7.30 to 8.00 daily."  Just do not expect instant results - it takes time to introduce new habits and this is not always only 3 weeks.  The more complex the habit, the more time it forms.  For 21 days, you can train yourself to drink a glass of water on an empty stomach, and for jogging in the mornings, you may need more than a month. <br><br>  <i><b>Step Four</b> .</i>  Identify supportive habits.  What behavior will support your new actions?  For example, you create a habit every Sunday to buy healthy products for the whole week.  Immediately form the habit of cooking at home every day (to avoid the temptation to stick your teeth into a hamburger at McDonalds) and then you calmly adhere to the principles of proper nutrition. <br><br>  <i><b>Step five</b> .</i>  Make a public commitment.  This is an effective additional incentive, since by announcing the formation of a new habit in social networks, on thematic forums or SmartProgress, it will be more difficult for you to abandon your plans.  Such an artificial increase in responsibility will serve as a kind of control.  Want to complicate the task?  Then argue with someone that you bring the job started to the end.  For example, in SmartProgress there is a word price in monetary terms.  I will read professional literature every day to improve my qualifications - and hop, five thousand froze!  BUT?  What is it like?  In the words of Steve Pavlina, a popular foreign blogger, ‚Äúadd a stick to the gingerbread.‚Äù <br><br>  <i><b>Step Six.</b></i>  Find a partner.  Getting away from daily activities is much easier if you are accountable only to yourself.  But when at 6 am the bell rang: ‚ÄúI'm already at the stadium, waiting for you, grab a dumbbell‚Äù, then willy-nilly you crawl out from under the blanket (and the cat).  This is our psychology that we rarely miss meetings if it causes inconvenience to another person. <br><br>  A habit will become a character trait if: <br>  ‚Ä¢ You clearly understand the need for habits. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Your new activities fit well into the lifestyle and are supported by the environment. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Soon visible results appear (weight is lost, less often it pulls up smoking, you are less distracted while working). <br><br>  Want to be successful?  Change your habits and move forward! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5c9/8dd/d64/5c98ddd647dafba98e2bc8b614b98365.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299678/</a></p>
