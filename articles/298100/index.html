      The first thing that bumps into the memory of the IT park is, of course, the monumentality of the building: a large one, sparkling, shimmers in the sun - when you look at it, you receive, as our permanent leader of events and permanent guest of the IT park once said, Oleg Barannik ‚ÄúWow effect‚Äù. <br>  Having come here for the first time for an interview, I was afraid that I would not have enough eyes to embrace all this splendor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bba/e79/de1/bbae79de131246bf8db50c9f5ba2fb86.jpg"><br><br>  The complex of buildings of the IT park - a symbiosis of hi-tech design with the architecture of the 18th century - consists of a modern 5-storey building and two reconstructed buildings of the former barracks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d09/4f9/19b/d094f919b8904a07a0c6bff34201bb37.jpg"><br>  <i>The photo shows how the main building is connected by an overhead passage with adjacent old buildings.</i> <br><br>  The military commissariat used to be on the site of the technopark, therefore the opening of a memorial plaque on its territory in honor of the Great Victory was not accidental, and even symbolic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/715/86b/ad6/71586bad6dca40e88e6fdc19dfc561a9.JPG"><br><br>  But first things first. <br>  Our technopark is quite young, a couple of months ago it turned 6 years old.  And in general, the entire IT park team is young professionals (including our director, Anton Grachev), the average age of employees is 27 years. <br><br>  After a successful interview, the stress-day came - the day I was afraid was like fire, but the guys from the adjacent department did not forget to defuse the situation, so all that I remember after testing for strength is jokes of future colleagues who only did that they laughed and said: "That you, we are not like that, we are actually normal." <br><br>  Traditionally, a new employee colleagues conduct a tour of the IT park, which you can now virtually go with me, it will probably not be so exciting as with a stranger from follow me, but no less fascinating. <br>  I slightly changed the course of the tour, and we will start with the most interesting - the core of the IT park - Data center with a total capacity of about 10,000 servers. <br>  When entering it, you need to wear an ultra-modern shoe cover and a bathrobe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7db/b06/492/7dbb0649202f45169757ce8601666517.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/444/964/c33/444964c336554a36a56da21307cd2a4c.jpg"><br><br>  In the data center work biometric throughput systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a01/35a/a0b/a0135aa0bd8c4084b139cd2a9c035dbf.jpg"><br><br>  On the 4th and all other floors there are offices of residents, among them are such giants of the IT industry as Microsoft, ABBYY, Acronis and ICL-KPO VS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/769/cf5/28a769cf503e40c3b1e9f6e765247a57.jpg"><br><br>  On the third floor of the IT park, in addition to the offices of the residents, are located the Business Incubator (if the Data Center is the brain of the IT Park, then the Business Incubator is its heart) and co-working, in common people the carpet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2f/125/ad8/b2f125ad8bca495989e29d2a981ccbd3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96f/ca0/3ce/96fca03ce0294b80a846204d1ac89933.JPG"><br>  <i>Residents of the Business Incubator</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f49/c8b/9f2/f49c8b9f29c0486687cb6cecdd480f0a.JPG"><br>  <i>Business incubator</i> <br><br>  The second floor is the most interesting.  It is connected on both sides by the sleeves of a time machine - tunnels into the buildings of the former barracks, which I have already mentioned.  Outside, everything looks very authentic, and inside it is a modern IT-park hotel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b17/b4e/c00/b17b4ec0026f464099d11757e6975a9a.JPG"><br><br>  Although in some places you can still find echoes of that time, as, for example, in this loft, converted into the office of the company-resident FIX. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0e/369/263/a0e369263ce8454a8795201973334bc2.jpg"><br><br>  The second floor is also interesting in that it has a telepresence room or a video conferencing room - it is perfectly equipped to hold Skype calls with the IT park's embankment site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cc/368/c19/4cc368c193574081ac4be1499c15bf98.jpg"><br>  <i>Video Conferencing Room</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3b/e0e/349/b3be0e3497ce47f781f95868e10023ef.jpg"><br>  <i>IT park in Naberezhnye Chelny, which we will describe later</i> <br><br>  The first floor is an event place.  Conferences, exhibitions, selections to the Business Incubator, lectures and much more are held there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9f/90f/4a3/a9f90f4a39934c0780533af416a69446.JPG"><br><br>  And so, as they say, here we are - the trial period has started. <br>  Gradually, there was no time to get used to it - no wonder that there was a recruiting office on the site of the IT park.  I had to quickly mobilize and - into battle!  Although at first it was all hard and hard to understand, but terribly interesting!  However, the little snob inside me was constantly buzzing that the first impression, as usual, was deceptive.  And I'm glad he was wrong. <br><br>  Over time, I became convinced that the IT park is the coolest hub in Tatarstan for the development of IT technologies, but despite all its seriousness and solidity, it is at the same time a kind of second home where you can not only work, but also relax . <br>  For example, <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b11/b16/57b/b11b1657b72c4370afc59a034de38613.jpg"><br><br>  ... play mafia in the lounge on the 5th floor <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/661/167/530/66116753052244c7a09d738edff52ef7.JPG"><br><br>  ... attend a mehendi workshop <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e40/6f0/b2e/e406f0b2edfb4ce3a5e74aa63610cb62.JPG"><br><br>  ... join the bike ride with colleagues <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/6bd/729/06e6bd729d4d4d1d8109f7b4b4442b76.JPG"><br><br>  ... there is a parking lot near the technopark building, and inside there are showers <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5aa/0f7/264/5aa0f72645e94ff19b29f0e0636cabfc.jpg"><br><br>  ... work out at the gym <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df8/f93/0b9/df8f930b9b5f4a0bb9d867b68f0e1835.JPG"><br><br>  ... go in for sports tourism. <br><br>  In general, the sport at the IT park special love.  Corporate football team - proof of this.  Here they are, our eagles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e8/216/f1b/0e8216f1bd8f4fcfa56ecaf898158a73.jpg"><br>  <i>IT park team</i> <br><br>  I am still a beginner in an IT park, but I have already managed to make sure that our technology park is a whole IT world, it has a huge variety of activities, and experts from different fields are consolidating in it. <br>  And here you can not only work and relax, but also learn. <br><br>  Want to become a programmer?  Come to the IT Academy and you will be taught programming from scratch in 3-4 months.  The most successful students receive job offers on the day of graduation project defense. <br>  Is your child the future Zuckerberg?  Send your children to the IT academy or camp ‚ÄúiLand‚Äù for holidays at any time of the year. <br>  In addition, the IT park supports scholarships for students of IT faculties in Kazan, and the most recent innovation is the Kvantorium Children's Technopark opened in the IT Park of Naberezhnye Chelny. <br>  But that's another story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/821/918/00a/82191800a4d944d1b1ff689ec06be5fd.jpg"><br><br>  * according to the rating of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298100/</a></p>
