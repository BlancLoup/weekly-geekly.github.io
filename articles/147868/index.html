  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How is UniSender better than MailChimp?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d3/1be/94e/2d31be94ee1b3fcfb30ed4934263fa5a.png"><br><br>  One of the most frequent questions that we have to hear when discussing various email services is: ‚ÄúWhy do we need <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">UniSender</a> when we have <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a> ?‚Äù And it seems to us that the time has come for a thorough answer to this question. <br><br>  And don't let the title of the article bother you =) It would be strange if we didn‚Äôt have an answer to this question.  It would be possible to close the business and go home.  In the end, both UniSender and Mailchimp have thousands of users - who, I think, know what they are paying for.  Let's see: so, what can offer a domestic service in comparison with the world's largest service? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  Let's start the main thing: UniSender allows you to do both email and SMS distribution.  MailChimp can not send SMS.  Rather, there is a special additional system that, with skill, can be used.  But sending SMS on the same database, with the same ease as the mailing lists - in MailChimp will not work. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      Both systems allow you to set up a chain of letters, embed social network buttons in the newsletter.  As for the functionality of the split-test - of course, it is also implemented in both systems.  However, according to the results of testing, we managed to provide our users with the opportunity to do it in fewer clicks, although MailChimp has a very nice interface for selecting split-test parameters, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e8/631/130/9e8631130bc3a5de025cbc4c6085c4d3.jpg"><br><br>  But we have more opportunities to test various parameters, including the ability to select the parameter for comparison manually: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/557/ccb/072/557ccb0722c863f9007c839b54c17c42.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Statistics </h6><br>  Statistics collection is implemented in both services quite colorful.  Here, in our opinion, it is difficult to choose who is better.  You can view statistics in the form of diagrams, or in the form of tables.  It is possible to look at statistics of mailing in the mode of live time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/30e/80b/532/30e80b5320a35c323b85d3b6fbfacb81.jpg"><br>  <i>Mailchimp</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4bc/b8d/2b1/4bcb8d2b1c2edd8cab0d48b4f254372b.png">  <i>UniSender</i> <br><br>  Both services offer integration with Google Analytics, without which no marketing tool at all can be considered complete: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ddd/bac/747/dddbac747beb2382e641d9837bb6c2f2.jpg"><br><br>  Selecting preset templates in MailChimp more.  Our answer to Chamberlain is the opportunity to order an individual template for your project.  For a fee, of course. <br><br><h6>  Segmentation </h6><br>  Both services allow the segmentation of the mailing list.  <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/features/segments.html">Segmentation in UniSender is</a> possible in two ways: using tags and the recently introduced mechanism with advanced segmentation capabilities.  The second method is a universal method that allows segmenting for almost any task. <br><br>  MailChimp allows for segmentation by how often your customer wants to receive emails.  However, with us you can do it too: select the desired segment into a separate list and assign different frequency to these lists. <br><br><h6>  Corporate solutions </h6><br>  We position ourselves as a solution for the corporate segment.  It turns out that this is really the case: you can set up access for different employees with different levels of rights within the same account.  MailChimp does not allow this, which means that it will not be so convenient for a large company to use the service. <br><br><h6>  Spam reports </h6><br>  Both MailChimp and UniSender take on contact with the postal services to determine the causes of your mailing in spam, if that happens.  However, UniSender has a natural advantage in terms of working with Russian postal services due to its long-established working contacts. <br><br><h6>  Subscribe form on your site </h6><br>  Services are similar in that they provide the function of creating a registration form that can be placed on your website for collecting leads. <br><br><h6>  Free services </h6><br>  Both services provide full free accounts, so you can register and start working right away. <br><br><h4>  Account Registration </h4><br>  In terms of organizing the start of work, each service has its own ‚Äúcockroaches‚Äù: <br><br>  The registration form at MailChimp is more complicated; in addition, you must specify the legal address of the company and the website.  Until this information is provided, you will not be able to do the mailing. <br><br>  UniSender, in order to counter spammers, asks to indicate the source of the distribution base.  Usually, the check takes a couple of hours during business hours, after which the base is deployed and you can start work, or contact you to clarify any issues.  Some users are worried about this, but we are firmly convinced that reputation is more expensive. <br><br><h4>  Russian interface and support </h4><br>  We have already listed a number of significant differences between the services, but it is expected that the biggest difference will be in the ease of use of the service by Russian users.  MailChimp has no support in Russian.  In addition, online support works during business hours on the time of another hemisphere.  Our specialists are on the site exactly when you work, and the interface is in Russian.  In addition, we can quickly help you by phone if you are in Russia. <br><br>  However, a simple opportunity to translate it using Google Translate is built into the MailChimp website.  We played, but more to have fun, because it turned out about the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce6/34f/95e/ce634f95e25654aca255b6c6e2fc29bf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/771/cb5/50c/771cb550cd72e78e83d94b6ae28b1777.jpg"><br><br>  For those who did not understand that in the first picture - it is "Suport".  Nothing like?  =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5e/105/56d/c5e10556d47977ebc89488cc20cfeba6.jpg"><br><br>  True, you have to give MailChimp its due, they are trying: so, you can automatically translate the important components of the letter itself into a number of languages.  However, without support during working hours and with an English-language interface, you still have to solve problems for the most part on your own, or via email. <br><br>  In general, the linguistic advantages result in the following score: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdc/a78/cbc/bdca78cbcb0ff36eeda5077b82987a1a.png"><br><br><h4>  Paperwork for legal entities </h4><br>  Regional features do not end there: in case you make large mass mailings and use a paid account, with us you can pay with any available payment system (Quiwi, ‚Äã‚Äãwebmoney).  In the case of MailChimp, you will need a card, and then not any card will work.  In addition, we will prepare for you the legal papers required for accounting in a generally accepted format.  MailChimp has no such possibility, you will have to look for other ways. <br><br><h4>  Issue price </h4><br>  Here we decided to just do a comparative table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4d2/46f/97f/4d246f97fca06b5f7dff2e7067db11c3.png"><br><br>  Just in case: <a href="http://mailchimp.com/pricing/">MailChimp</a> <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/prices/">prices, UniSender prices</a> . <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  We have not forgotten anything?  Oh yeah, here are the instructions for <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/help/mailchimp.html">importing your database from MailChimp</a> ;-) <br><br>  <b>Successful mailings!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147868/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147868/</a></p>
