  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 days after launch. How we try to create media about technology in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Hello "Megamind"!  For the past 10 days, we are trying to create a blog about technologies and startups in Russia.  Today I would like to share the results and observations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abc/8d8/ee5/abc8d8ee56004b7789034a202f3aaf9f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Technocracy - techno log about venture capital, social networks, startups, applications and much more, which is associated with technology.  The reason is very simple - in our humble opinion, the niche is not quite full.  Even more than free.  Many media specializing in technology, overlook the events that occur here and now.

      The news about Apple spreads to several dozens of sites within one minute, but no one writes how a cool Russian startup has attracted 500,000 pounds sterling.  Everyone is writing about the new speech by Elon Mask and the new technology in Tesla, but no one is writing about the two graduates of the Robotics Faculty at MEI, who manually collect drones. <br><br>  It seems to us that the Russian market is deprived of attention.  As a rule, if Russian companies do not declare themselves, no one will remember them.  Everyone is more comfortable to write what is everywhere.  And it's not even exclusive - Russian companies that are doing cool stuff just don't notice.  This is not leaven patriotism, it is a simple observation. <br><br>  It seems to us that the audience will also be interested in what is happening here in Russia.  What are the achievements, innovations and successes of Russian companies, and not of Pinterest or Flickr, whose audience in Russia is not very big. <br><br>  The idea to create your own project in your head has already lingered for a long time, but everyone still could not reach it, until the news spread on the network that Facebook is introducing the dislike button. <br><br>  The fact is that I really like Facebook, I believe that Zuckerberg is the ideal of what a person should be at the intersection of business and technology.  He didn‚Äôt limit himself to the social network, constantly changing it, expanding, bought Oculus, Instagram (they then bloomed), turned on surround video in the chronicle, working on internet.org.  In a word, I sat and watched his speech, an online broadcast on Facebook (it was just the first experience of streaming video in the social network itself), when he suddenly said that he had been asked to enter a dislike button for a long time, but he was against it.  But he still introduces a button similar to dislike. <br><br>  In the morning I saw that my entire chronicle was filled with news about the fact that a dislike would appear on Facebook.  They wrote the Secret of the Firm, CPU (VC), theRunet, Euronews and other publications.  And all refer to each other - no one went to check, especially since the speech was recorded on video and was in public access. <br><br>  Then I realized that the niche is free and it will be possible to occupy it.  Well, or at least try.  Posted post, which then turned into <a href="http://technocratos.ru/opinion/no-dislike-no-party/">an article</a> .  And the irony, the article was written on September 4, the other day Facebook introduced new buttons, and the Secret of the Firm and everyone else wrote again ‚ÄúFacebook refused the announced dislayk button‚Äù - he didn‚Äôt announce it at all and was never going to enter it, but our media continues write without delving into the essence. <br><br>  A month passed and I was strenuously sawing this site (usual WordPress, but I have a liberal arts education, and I could barely manage to dig into the code and edit the theme files for myself), typed in the themes, wrote articles.  We started September 30th.  Then they hung the metric. <br><br>  During this time, 45 articles were published.  Well, 10 of them were still in September, to be honest.  Visited the site for 10 days 1 392 people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f0/cb5/819/7f0cb581961a48ffba2fc56cd3fa26af.png"><br><br>  The hypothesis that there are a lot of cool companies and tough specialists in Russia has been fully confirmed.  Here, for example, <a href="http://technocratos.ru/story/puzzle-english/">Alexander Antonov</a> .  Those who are older should remember his site RMP.ru (late 90s and mid 2000s), or the Lady (first dating site).  A veteran of the Runet has been doing business in Runet since 1995 (I honestly do not remember what I did in 1995. I most likely ate sand and learned to tie my shoelaces) very modest and will not tell anything about myself until you ask him.  By the way, his Puzzle English now visits 2 million per month. <br><br>  Or the very guys who <a href="http://technocratos.ru/story/flight-high/">manually build quadrocopters</a> .  Graduates of Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Faculty of Robotics.  Both are 24-25 years old.  Hand-picked and sold.  And fly their drones.  They are generally an interesting story.  The guys sincerely believe that they are on the outskirts of technology startups.  So they answered when I asked why nobody knows about them. <br><br>  Or <a href="http://technocratos.ru/story/lobster/">Olga Ershova from Lobster</a> .  She has a revolutionary product that constantly flashes on Techcranche and Bloomberg.  Potentially one of the strongest Russian startups, although it is based in London. <br><br>  Similarly with Zara Martirosyan.  The guys are in Yerevan, but the roots are Russian.  <a href="http://technocratos.ru/opinion/inkin-techcrunch/">We visited</a> recently on Techcranch Disrapt, make an application for fitness trackers.  They went out to the whole world. <br><br>  There are a lot of startups in Russia who do cool stuff.  Not the same as in the USA, but not so little that you don‚Äôt write about them at all, concentrating on global players.  And they all want to share experiences, to motivate by example, to talk about background history. <br><br>  In Russia, a lot of interesting events.  Everyday.  Do not change the design of Kinopoisk - Yandex will never return it, because it would mean weakness and failure, as a market leader.  Not.  Here are <a href="http://technocratos.ru/trends/mhealth-russia/">mHealth prospects</a> - this is potentially a major niche for startups.  And it is in Russia.  Even foreign analysts believe that Russia will become a leader in mHealth, and ours don't write about it. <br><br>  From the topics I would like to go to the process.  For the last 6 years I have been loving from a journalist to a PR manager, from an employee on the side of an agency to an employee on the side of a client, from an editorial board to a newsmaker.  This allows you to see the situation from two sides.  Here, as in the wisdom of Lenin, that has become a meme "The tops do not want, the lower classes can not," just to paraphrase "The first do not want, the second does not care." <br><br>  Journalists are not interested in the success of Russian companies, PR managers are not interested in journalists.  The second send sad press releases, the first sad send them back.  The second ones write cool articles, the first ones ask for money for them, like for jeans.  In the end, PR people are limited to regional publications, journalists are going to reprint material about Apple. <br><br>  That's the whole problem.  This is the problem we are trying to solve.  So far, not very good, but a little material. <br><br>  We abandoned the BuzzFeed format and do not write the article "10 startups that will surprise you" or "6 founders who do not sleep."  We decided to concentrate exclusively on the Russian market, only periodically publishing something global. <br><br>  Startups are happy to meet.  We published two requests for PressFid - more than 30 IT companies responded.  True, not all have been processed, since many PR people are still trying to send a press release, whereas we want simple human speech.  With those who succeeded, we made the materials and published. <br><br>  As well as among journalists, there are a lot of PR people among IT companies who do not know anything about their product.  It is sad.  But there are those who know everything better than the founders - we did the materials with them.  Sometimes there is such a thing (a letter that arrived on the launch day): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c8/c01/b2c/1c8c01b2ce51410a95d49ab51daee09e.jpg"><br><br>  In general, IT is a very positive area, aimed at creation.  In other areas of journalism is not so, believe me.  Working here and encountering representatives, you can feel positive, technology, creation and creativity in its pure form. <br><br>  A little bit about the project.  There is no investment.  Brother helped with hosting and domain.  There are a lot of topics - the Russian market of startups and cool projects is alive.  Boils and develops.  Both in breadth and depth.  The sphere is so deep and filled that diving once again does not emerge. <br><br>  Wish us success!  Thank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295224/</a></p>
