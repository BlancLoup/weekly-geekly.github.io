  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flash</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The morning began as usual.  Habrahabr, the tape of friends in LJ, ENT and even / b / Dvacha - although there was nothing interesting in the morning, it is not so easy to get rid of the habit.  Akiko went to wash, and when he returned, he heard the phone ring. <br><br>  - Akiko, hello!  - said his friend, Ytsuken <br>  - Good morning. <br>  - Yeah.  Listen, we here with Mao want to go to St. Petersburg, to the festival.  Do you remember? <br>  - Yes, she told me.  When he? <br>  - Tonight, will go two days. <br>  - OMG.  Where do we meet? <br>  - On Petrovsko-Razumovskaya at 14:00. <br>  - Good.  See you? <br>  - Until. <br><br>  Chaos Confusion, mean?  Or Chaos Constructions - as Mao used to say ... It doesn't matter.  - thought Akiko.  He put the laptop in the case and drove to the meeting place.  It was raining and the drops on the asphalt looked a little different from what Akiko usually saw them.  He met with his friends and they drove to the airport in a Ytsuken car. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      <br>
      The airport was completely empty.  No people, nothing.  Only light burned in some places.  Ytsuken said only that Akiko expects a ‚Äúmission‚Äù.  Quite calm Ytsuken and Mao, with nothing understanding Akiko, began to move forward through the airport, bypassing deserted customs and everything else.  They went to the aircraft and headed to the nearest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  - Um, and you know how to manage it?  - Akiko asked Ytsuken, who is still so confident of himself. <br>  - Yes, we flew with him for a long time in the simulator Google Earth.  - interrupted Mao <br>  - Well, okay ... - for some reason, Akiko responded more calmly <br><br>  Ytsuken really raised and flew surprisingly well to Peter himself.  Akiko was looking down at the approaching St. Petersburg airport already in almost complete confidence to get out of there alive.  Suddenly he saw a rocket flying into their plane.  The flash, the sound of the heartbeat, the darkness, a feeling of warmth ... Akiko woke up in a hospital in St. Petersburg. <br><br>  - Painfully!  He whispered, realizing that his arm and leg were broken and that he was lying on a bed in the hospital. <br><br>  The dawn was approaching.  There was a knock at the door - it was Ytsuken and Mao.  Mao silently approached and sent an open hand to Akiko.  A lightning bolt of greenish light appeared.  After a few seconds, Akiko felt better than ever.  Of course, no broken limbs were out of the question. <br><br>  Ytsuken kept talking about some kind of mission and they left the hospital.  She was surrounded.  About 50 people held them at gunpoint. <br><br>  - Imagine an electric arc between your charged hands!  - punished Ytsuken. <br><br>  Akiko was not even surprised when an excellent weapon came out of his hands.  He also realized that Mao would hardly be able to attack and must be covered.  Surrounding people began shooting - but that's just their firearm.  After a few seconds, they were all dead from the huge charge that passed through them, and several bullets hit Akiko and Ytsuken as if they didn‚Äôt fall - this was how the Mao treatment worked. <br><br>  They ran somewhere, but suddenly Akiko heard a sound.  He concentrated on him and then he understood that it was the doorbell in his apartment.  And he saw in front of him his own monitor, keyboard, mouse, and hands moving somehow.  He realized what had happened.  With superhuman speed, he pressed Escape and chose Exit at the end of the menu.  Before his eyes remained an open terminal with the inscription: Thanks for playing!  The Game started 2007 December 11 09:31, ended 2007 December 15 16:52.  And by inviting bash. <br><br>  <font color="green">akiko</font> <font color="blue">~ / the_game $</font> cd ../ <br>  <font color="green">akiko</font> <font color="blue">~ / the_game $</font> find the_game / -type f -execdir shred -z '{}' \; <br>  <font color="green">akiko</font> <font color="blue">~ / the_game $</font> rm -rf the_game / <br><br>  He typed these lines and fell face down on the keyboard - just fell asleep.  He did not care who came. <br><br>  <i>December 11th.</i>  The morning began as usual.  Habrahabr, the tape of friends in LJ, ENT and even / b / Dvacha - although there was nothing interesting in the morning, it is not so easy to get rid of the habit.  Akiko went to wash, and when he returned, he saw on the GNOME panel left from the evening of IDE, in which he was engaged in the development of the project.  He unfolded the IDE, flipped through the code to the end and saw the comment ‚Äú// It's done‚Äù at the end.  Akiko began to remember how he added the last code yesterday - something about the miscalculation of lighting in open spaces - and, in order not to forget that the project was finished, he added this comment to the end.  He smiled, started the project build and went to breakfast.  Breakfast was the way - going to the the_game / directory and running the executable file there, Akiko could not tear himself away. <br><br>  <i>December 10th.</i>  The sun had already set and Akiko had just finished his project, on which he had been working for more than one year.  Knowing his forgetfulness, he added a comment ‚Äú// It's done‚Äù at the end of the code.  The doorbell rang and, opening it, he saw a neighbor loli on the threshold.  She asked Akiko for a flash drive to rewrite the cartoon with a friend.  She liked Akiko and, without hesitation, gave her his flash drive, asking him to return it to the 15th, since he would need her. <br><br>  <i>December 15th.</i>  While the ‚Äúrm -rf the_game /‚Äù command was finishing to delete the files cracked by shred, Akiko remembered that he had saved the backup of the entire game to his flash drive.  He knew his neighbor's friend and her curiosity about other people's files.  If only their distracted someone, if only someone distracted.  - thought Akiko, already dropping his head on the keyboard. <br><br>  PS The names of the characters came up with my friend - or rather, I just asked for three names.  So matches with users of Habr are absolutely random. <br>  PPS If this is unbearably terrible, well, just note this post and I will never write anything again (at least here) to the literary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17553/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17553/</a></p>
