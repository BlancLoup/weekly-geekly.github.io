      Formally, techday will be divided into two parts: the main program and activities on thematic sites. <br><br>  The list of speakers, the program and the link to registration - under the cut.  Participation is free. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Main program </h2><br>  Here we organize two tracks for speakers, where experts will talk about the experience of implementing various solutions and their impact on business performance (What we do), as well as on the organization of work and ensuring continuous development (How we do).  Technical Director Kirill Yermakov, Agile Coach Maxim Gaponov, Director of IT and Development Andrey Protopopov, Head of QIWI Blockchain Technologies Alexey Arkhipov and others will speak on these topics. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8p1uHLtyadg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This will not be the ‚ÄúSpeaker Speaking - Everyone Listens‚Äù format.  Here anyone can voice their opinions on the topic of modern technologies and share stories on one of ten thematic hubs: <br><br>  Quality assurance, Back- and Frontend, Info Security, DataBase, Big Data, Machine Learning, Infrastructure, Teams, People, UX &amp; Design. <br><br><h2>  What are we doing </h2><br>  <b>11:00 - 11:45 - What you did not know about QIWI (Kirill Ermakov / Technology)</b> <br><br>  For the last three years, Kirill has led the operation and safety of the QIWI group.  In the past, an expert on web application security and developer of corporate data protection systems.  A member of many bug-hunting programs and "halls of fame" for security in companies such as Apple, Mail.ru and Yandex.  Founded Vulners, one of the largest vulnerability bases.  Advisor to Wallarm, which created an AI-based application protection system. <br><br>  <b>11:45 - 12:05 - Microservice architecture: how and why (Pavel Chernyak / Development of server applications)</b> <br><br>  He has been developing software for 10 years, of which the last 3 years have divided large monoliths into neat microservices.  The solutions created by Paul are actively used for the development of the company's business. <br><br>  <b>12:05 - 12:20 - The dark side of backend development (Dmitry Royenko / Development of server applications)</b> <br><br>  Dmitry's specialty is DevOps.  From the very beginning of his career he has been developing software in various programming languages.  Over the past 5 years, along with QIWI, I have gone a long way from several monoliths on virtual machines to hundreds of microservices in a private cloud. <br><br>  <b>12:20 - 12:35 - Changing the data schema during working hours: how we manage it (Peter Bobrov / Database Administration)</b> <br><br>  Works with databases for 20 years, including 8 years in the technical support of Oracle.

For the last two years, QIWI has been developing storage on Vertica and Hadoop. <br><br>  <b>13:20 - 13:40 - ML &amp; AI - from Excel to Neurons (Lydia Khramova / Business Modeling</b> <br><br>  He heads the group of business modeling.  Long and sincerely loves analytics and machine learning, and for six years it is mutual.  I am sure that to use data science in practice, you need not only complex neural networks, but also the ability to gracefully solve business problems, getting simple and useful conclusions. <br><br>  <b>13:40 - 13:55 - A bot to help you: we automate textual customer support (Nikolay Kartashov / Data Science)</b> <br><br>  Leads several data science projects, creating products that used to be very expensive or impossible to develop.

At QIWI, the company is responsible for infrastructure accessibility and SLA services compliance. <br><br>  <b>14:40 - 15:00 - TestOps.</b>  <b>QA Evolution (Anton Shakinko / Testing Server Applications)</b> <br><br>  Anton has been testing backend services and logic in databases for more than three years.  At the same time, he always tries to automate the work with the system: from a developer‚Äôs commit, run to the test and autotest run to the metrics of the laid out service to end users. <br><br>  <b>15:00 - 15:15 - How to build a secure Windows environment and not stop the company (Artem Korchak / Operation of internal systems)</b> <br><br>  Senior Windows System Administrator.
