  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As I watched Formula 1 on the BBC live via the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This article will be interesting to fans of Formula One from Ukraine and Belarus.  Unfortunately, not a single channel in Ukraine and Belarus has purchased the right to broadcast F1, therefore, in order to watch the races live, you have to invent various clever ways. <br><br>  I really enjoy watching the BBC broadcast.  Compared to other channels, they start broadcasting much earlier than the race, a lot of their own interviews, analysts.  Commentators: David Coulhard, Eddie Jordan, Martin Brundle.  In my opinion it‚Äôs better that hardly anyone can comment on the royal races.  Who once looked at the BBC will not be able to watch anything else.  There are of course drawbacks ... Good English is required because  no translation, naturally, no. <br><br>  I knew that the BBC has a great <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/tv">iPlayer</a> online broadcast <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/tv">service</a> .  It gives you the opportunity to view live broadcasts of all TV and rad BBC channels.  Plus, one or two days after the broadcast, programs are available for viewing and downloading.

All the rest is shown the message ‚ÄúNot available in your area‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/643/d7a/316/643d7a3168a7f32b3eb86c98e3dfa337.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To virtually get to this very territory had to resort to tricks.  We are working on several English projects and we have servers in England.  First, we wanted to set up a proxy on the server to go to the BBC through it and pretend to be British.  But then, a little googling found a simpler and more elegant solution, which can be useful in other cases. <br><br>  We found an article called <a href="http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/weblogs/azul/firefox-ssh-tunnel">Tunneling Firefox traffic over SSH</a> .  The article describes how you can make Socks Proxy out of it without changing anything on the server.  The only requirement is SSH access to the server. <br><br>  Everything is done is not easy, but very simple.  To run ssh in proxy mode, you need to run the command with parameters <br><br> <code>ssh -fND localhost:12345 login@server.net</code> <br> <br>  where 12345 is the number of any unused port.  You can read more about the parameters on the ssh man page, for example, here <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi%3Fssh%2B1">unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ssh+1</a> . <br><br>  After that, it is enough to configure the browser to work with SOCKS proxy on 127.0.0.1 and the selected port.  More details of all the actions described <a href="http://wiki.freaks-unidos.net/weblogs/azul/firefox-ssh-tunnel">in the article</a> . <br><br>  To do the same under Windows, you can use PuTTY.  When you start the session, go to the settings Connection-&gt; SSH-&gt; Tunnels and add the port.  Be sure to select Dynamic and click Add.  Destination in this case, you can not enter.  After that, connect to the server and do not close the terminal until you need a proxy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/870/622/abd/870622abdd83076f8f92edd593d1f49c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  iPlayer uses Flash.  I do not know how under Linux, but under Windows Flash uses the settings of IE for Internet access.  Therefore, it is necessary that IE be configured to work with a proxy.  Otherwise, Flash will go directly to the Internet and iPlayer will generate an error ‚ÄúNot available in your area‚Äù.  I just set everything up and started in IE. <br><br>  iPlayer is also available as a desktop application written on Adobe Air.  Allows you to download your favorite programs to your computer for viewing in the application or in wma format.  This option is suitable for those who have a very bad connection. <br><br>  Everything worked fine for me both on Saturday and Sunday (the BBC also shows free races).  Provider Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãWill in Kiev (Ukrainians understand) enough.  For all the time, only two times the video "slowed down."  For normal operation, a speed of about 1 Mb / s is sufficient.  If there is not enough speed, then iPlayer has a ‚Äúlow bandwidth‚Äù mode.  Picture quality gets worse, but still acceptable. <br><br>  Happy viewing and interesting for all of us season!  The start was intriguing. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  In the comments offered a few more options to watch the BBC from outside of England. <br>  1) <b>Use free proxies.</b>  A list can be found here <a href="http://proxy-list.org/">proxy-list.org</a> .  The proxy that I immediately found there worked fine and allowed me to watch the video by speed.  The main drawback of this method is that no one guarantees anything.  Those.  in the middle of the broadcast on the proxy, the speed may drop or the proxy will completely turn off and that's it.  One virtue is a freebie. <br>  2) <b>Buy VPN</b> .  <a href="http://kebrum.com/">Kebrum</a> and <a href="http://ivacy.com/">Ivacy were mentioned</a> .  Surely there are other similar services.  They do the same thing - they offer you a VPN and a choice of server.  Services are paid.  On demo access do not allow to connect to English servers.  The best price offer for Kebrum is $ 3.90 / month for 50 Gb of traffic.  For two or three races a month should be enough.  The full race record weighs about 3 Gb plus qualifications and tests ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116305/</a></p>
