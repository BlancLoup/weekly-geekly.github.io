  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex House on Scooter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> There is plenty of information on how simple Google, Yahoo and Microsoft workers live.  The situation with Russian IT-companies is more complicated: they are often not so open to everyone‚Äôs eyes, although it is interesting for potential employees and just curious to know - ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs inside‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/">"Yandex"</a> is one of the leaders of <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/company/">habraratinga companies</a> , and very few people will decide to challenge his leadership in runet.  The building where people work, thanks to whom ‚Äúthere is everything‚Äù, I visited at the end of last week. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The Moscow office of the company is located in the <a href="">‚Äúhouse on Samokatnaya‚Äù</a> ( <a href="">Samokatnaya</a> st., 1, building 21), a few steps from Yauza, the park named after  May 1, the two churches and the plant "Crystal" (admittedly, the place was chosen successfully).  From the metro station "Kurskaya" all the staff and visitors are transported to the office by a pleasant Ford minibus.  It is pleasant because it is free, it runs on a schedule once every 15 minutes and literally reaches the door of the building (which was especially important this February).  And by the way, he almost never goes empty.

      The fact that the person will now be in the office building of "Yandex", says the words "Find everything" on the automatically opening glass doors.  In the foyer, three projectors show the ‚Äúproprietary stand‚Äù of what the company lives: the first one displays the current search queries passing through the Yandex websites (of course, not all, otherwise the viewer could not keep track of them), on the second one - frames from history of the company, and the third - information from some services (weather, traffic jams, etc.). <br><br> <a href="" title="Entrance to the building of Yandex.

As <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> Bobuk says, it was done on purpose: ‚ÄúPeople come without badges, and then laptops disappear.  Laptops with time, of course, are, but the residue remains. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/810/168/188/810168188b03475309bfc1a033d9c16c.jpg" alt="   -" title="Bobuk and his status message"><br><br>  Beautiful photos hang on the stairs between the floors.  These really beautiful photographs were created by employees of the company, and you can even buy them - if you work at Yandex: about once a month they are sold at auction, and the proceeds go to charity purposes. <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: photo exhibition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26c/83b/2fe/26c83b2fe29debb1e3cc0486a5f1dd1d.jpg" alt="Yandex Building: photo exhibition"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: photo exhibition"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfb/a17/da7/dfba17da745995ec9e1d082ade6e7202.jpg" alt="Yandex Building: photo exhibition"></a> <br><br>  In total, the building has 3 floors and a dining room (for convenience, you can designate the floor on which it is located, zero). <br><br>  Such interiors are waiting for visitors on the ‚Äúworking‚Äù floors: <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: working floors"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/008/ae2/4a0/008ae24a0417ad6ac40f19cdbf4d1406.png" alt="Yandex Building: working floors"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: working floors"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d5/df5/3fb/9d5df53fbf5bb7888962eee7a914c9df.png" alt="Yandex Building: working floors"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: working floors"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7b/5de/8af/c7b5de8af0bccdec6caa5714f0004211.jpg" alt="Yandex Building: working floors"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: working floors"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/381/033/a9f/381033a9f7f35c5c155e77159b220d23.png" alt="Yandex Building: working floors"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: working floors"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4fd/fd5/79e/4fdfd579ece12bf816a99460887096eb.png" alt="Yandex Building: working floors"></a> <br><br>  "Developer floor" is characterized by a predominance of men: <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex Building: developer floor"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ffd/aa2/66f/ffdaa266f07b5310b69ce87d28ce1bb6.jpg" alt="Yandex Building: developer floor"></a> <br><br>  Employees can ask for a laptop that they like best.  Those who chose Apple products have already organized an internal e-mail list, in which they help each other in finding the right programs ‚Äî and simply chat: <br><br> <a href="" title="Ipple"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e3/bd0/ec6/0e3bd0ec645fba5640a7222e38d93b08.jpg" alt="Ipple"></a> <br><br>  Laptops are used no less actively than stationary computers.  On many tables, these two devices often stand side by side.  And thanks to wi-fi with a laptop, you can work everywhere - even on the stairs, even in the smoking room, even on the street.  The building has a free Yandex.Wi-Fi, so everyone can come to visit with their portable devices. <br><br>  By the way, some who wish to use this advantage for other purposes: one enterprising citizen has been actively using wi-fi for a while, sitting in his car parked on the banks of the Yauza River and sending spam.  After some time, it was calculated, approached the car and said "ah-ah-ah";  since then no such incidents have occurred. <br><br>  Meeting rooms - one of the most original premises in the building.  The most remarkable are the neighboring "GDR" and "Germany": <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: GDR and FRG"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ce/224/8ba/7ce2248ba504ae85576104ed5599d193.jpg" alt="Yandex House: GDR and FRG"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: GDR"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a8b/665/8a6/a8b6658a63c5bf9c780eaaae997eae0e.jpg" alt="Yandex House: GDR"></a> <br><br>  Their peculiarity is that in fact it is one room divided by the ‚ÄúBerlin Wall‚Äù, which is pushed aside when the magic button is pressed.  In the ‚ÄúFRG‚Äù there are game consoles and a projector, so that employees can devote their free time to ‚Äúvirtual boxing‚Äù or other games. <br><br>  In the smoking rooms, in addition to the usual chairs, interesting "devices" are installed: <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: smoking room"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea0/c7a/ebd/ea0c7aebd1f7d560a8952bfc1d22f133.jpg" alt="Yandex House: smoking room"></a> <br><br>  As Bobuk explained, developers, despite the presence of chairs, prefer to settle on the floor.  This habit defies logical explanation, and in the office they did not fight it by installing such seats. <br><br>  In the recreation room you can find darts, aero hockey and hookah.  And in the mini-kitchens on the floors there are coffee machines that ‚Äúpour in for a coin‚Äù: <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: mini-kitchen"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/262/895/436/26289543677c37b7433c0d9d435747f0.jpg" alt="Yandex House: mini-kitchen"></a> <br><br>  In addition to the smoking room and the lounge, you can spend your free time in the library.  This cozy room is literally created for relaxation, because, in addition to books, there is always sound insulation and sometimes a fruit basket. <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: Library"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/557/4a3/ad8/5574a3ad83cad3e568b8c11a3974db66.jpg" alt="Yandex House: Library"></a> <a href="" title="Yandex House: library, view from the window"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2c/8ef/871/b2c8ef871ebd1c5d6d492c262ed8ad8a.jpg" alt="Yandex House: library, view from the window"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: Library"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d90/508/258/d905082587815132e456da64a6063d38.png" alt="Yandex House: Library"></a> <br><br>  Of course, you need to eat in the dining room: free meals for employees are provided.  You can choose your own lunch: both the first and the second are presented in several versions (I managed to try only one option - Mexican-style soup and vegetables: delicious!).  As an answer to the question ‚ÄúA compote?‚Äù, All tables are packed with juice. <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: Dining Room"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c10/42a/396/c1042a396b2d74977bb4949255396364.jpg" alt="Yandex House: Dining Room"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: Dining Room"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d5/437/225/0d54372251559c0bc6825a780c6ca70e.jpg" alt="Yandex House: Dining Room"></a> <br><br> <a href="" title="Yandex House: dining room. Photo courtesy of the Yandex press service."><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f21/74c/26b/f2174c26b0647e4d09e8470e6857b96f.png" alt="Yandex House: dining room. Photo courtesy of the Yandex press service."></a> <br><br>  You can build your appetite by playing billiards or table tennis: a room with these games is located next to the dining room.  By the way, there is also a massage chair and a shower nearby. <br><br>  I did not succeed in getting to know all the Yandex employees living on Habr√©.  In general, to find all employees on the spot at the same time is absolutely unrealistic, because the company has a free schedule.  There are among the workers and those who come to work in the evening, and go to sleep in the morning.  Thus, both ‚Äúowls‚Äù and ‚Äúlarks‚Äù can feel absolutely comfortable.  Although it is noted that the largest number of people appear in their places at 12-13: it is at this time that lunch begins in the dining room. <br><br>  The Yandex office leaves a pleasant impression of itself.  By the way it is equipped, you can judge the attitude of the company towards its employees.  We have to admit that this is a very good attitude.  Let's try to compare: wait for new reports! <br><br>  <i>Thank you for organizing the report of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bobuk/" class="user_link">bobuk</a> Gregory Bakunov</i> and the press service of the company.  Thank you <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/stepp/" class="user_link">stepp</a> for technical support. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3698/</a></p>
