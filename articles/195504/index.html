    <h4>  VDS on Jelastic </h4><br>  To begin with, we added the ability to use VDS during beta testing.  This service is included in the basic Jelastic functionality, but has not yet been offered by any provider during beta testing.  Upon request, we provide this feature, while free of charge we allocate an external IP address for the beta period.  We remind you that beta testing will last until October 15. <br><br>  VDS allows you to significantly expand the range of tasks that can be solved on Jelastic.  For example, it can host a database that requires specific modules, such as PostGIS, or install a web server with Python support.  In general, you can everything that you did not have before.  At the same time, for VDS, similarly to other environment nodes, autoscaling works, and billing is carried out only for used claudlets (1 cloudlet = 200 MHz processor and 128 MB of RAM). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d00/33f/798/d0033f79805536245ae05e07cbb19833.png"><br><br>  In addition to using VDS as part of the environment, there is a scenario for its standalone operation.  In this case, an environment consisting only of VDS is created, and resource allocation is configured.  Since 3 cloudboxes on Infobox are free ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infobox/blog/194226/">we wrote</a> about this in the first post about Jelastic), they can be set as a lower limit for autoscaling.  Thus, you get a virtual dedicated server with a 600 MHz processor and 384 MB of RAM practically free of charge (only the hard disk is charged).  And if you need to place a more loaded project, you simply raise the upper limit of autoscaling and pay for the keylates that are consumed in excess of 3 free ones. <br><br>  Registration for beta on our site is <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/jelastic/">here</a> , and to activate VDS on your account you just need to write us an email at help @ infobox.ru. <br><br><h4>  Ruby support </h4><br>  The next innovation was support for Ruby.  The possibility of using Ruby environments is announced as a test, but no problems were identified during testing. <br><br>  Ruby is launched via an Apache web server with Passenger version 4.0.2 installed.  In the near future we will write a separate article on working with CMS, working on Ruby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c7/f2b/843/8c7f2b843f85b0dff4fcc0b094e7f3d3.png"><br><br><h4>  What should we build a portal? </h4><br>  The latest news is the addition of 1C-Bitrix: Corporate Portal to the application catalog for auto-deployment in the ‚ÄúCollaboration‚Äù edition.  We worked especially carefully on this application, since Jelastic, in our opinion, is the optimal platform for hosting corporate portals. <br>  Judge for yourself: shared-hosting cannot be by definition a sufficiently reliable solution for hosting a corporate portal, so we will not take it into account.  VPS and dedicated servers are quite complicated to configure and may also be more expensive. <br><br>  With Jelastic, thanks to the possibility of installing CMS in 1 click, the portal can be installed in a few minutes.  At the same time, you will receive a portal that will work in a well-optimized environment with high performance in the Beatrix performance monitor.  As a result of tuning the web environment, which we produced in conjunction with Bitrix specialists, we achieved a performance of 45 units from the basic 7 units, which is very good for this rather demanding product. <br><br>  As for the cost of hosting on Jelastic, not to be unfounded, we conducted tests under the load that can generate a small company of 25 employees.  A corporate portal was deployed from the catalog, on which 25 users were created (the number of users included in the license of this edition). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70c/694/8ad/70c6948ada1d9ed402442181fa2a2e6b.png"><br><br>  After that, using Xenu, we got links to all elements of the site (pages, css, js, images) and exported the result to a text file.  The advantage of Xenu is that it provides links to objects in exactly the order in which they are downloaded by the browser when the site loads, so when they are loaded sequentially, we get a more or less realistic imitation of the resource load. <br><br>  The resulting text file is divided into blocks.  Each block will begin with a link to the page and end with the last element of the page (in fact, we searched for the end of the block at the beginning of the next :)).  Then we shuffle the blocks together and save 25 copies of this file with the blocks going in a different order. <br><br>  We now turn to testing directly. <br>  25 VPS on CentOS, for each of which we installed siege and launched it with the following parameters: <br>  - from 1 - each copy of siege imitates an individual employee, therefore 1; <br>  -t60M - we test within one hour; <br>  -f /home/links.txt - the path to the previously created file with links; <br>  -H "Cookie: PHPSESSID = ntsgqk37lod6cauga70jd0tr03;  BITRIX_SM_LOGIN = admin;  ... "- we record the user's cookies; <br><br>  As a result, we get a rather realistic load of active work simultaneously of all users with the portal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc7/f27/800/fc7f278004cb95f0eab861a4409db110.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/d3d/1a9/b58d3d1a957b28883ca05ed9993754b4.png"><br><br>  The graph shows that the maximum number of Apache claudlets involved is 7 (1 cloudlet is 200 MHz).  Let's add to this 1 Nginx cloudlet and 3 MySQL cloudlets (their number was constant throughout the entire test).  Total we get - 11 klaudletov.  Minus 3 free cloudlet - already 8. <br>  MySQL consumes 2 cloudloads without a load, so it makes sense to put them static, that is, one of the 8 paid cloudlet turns out to be static, which means cheaper. <br>  1 Static claudlet 0.25 rub.  + 7 dynamic claudlets for 0.35 rubles.  = 2.7 rubles per hour. <br><br>  Suppose that our employees are active and use the portal 12 hours a day, the day costs 12 * 2.7 = 32.4 rubles.  At night, without load, the environment will consume 4 clouds, of which MySQL reserves 2 clouds, that is, 1 static will be paid.  0.25 * 12 = 3 rubles.  Total 35.4 rubles per day. <br>  35.4 * 30 = 1062 rubles a month of operation of the portal + disk space of 25 rubles per month for 1 GB. <br><br>  Compare with the recommended hosts in the list <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/partners/hosting.php">on the developer's site</a> .  We will look at offers from a CPU of 2000 MHz and RAM of 1280 MB (which is even slightly less than necessary), <a href="http://www.1c-bitrix.ru/partners/">recommended</a> for hosting a corporate portal. <br>  The most advantageous offer that was found - 1800 rubles per month.  This is excluding administration and deployment costs.  And during the deployment will require more resources than in normal operation. <br>  These are the results of testing and hosting cost calculations. <br><br>  <b>Information about the service and registration for beta testing <a href="http://infoboxcloud.ru/jelastic/">on our website</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195504/</a></p>
