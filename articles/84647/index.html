Do not be ashamed of it and do not hide it. <br><br>  He stood apart from the cisterns, alone and unwanted.  On top of the case were neatly laid documents and (!) Wiring diagrams to it, carefully pressed with the original remote, so as not to scatter.  When I saw this picture, I immediately realized that the TV was working, and they threw it out just like that, as unnecessary.  They didn‚Äôt even throw it out, but simply left it - suddenly it will come in handy. <br><br>  Without hesitation, I dragged him home.  I frowned, anticipating how my mother would grumble, tried to figure out how to explain to her more profitably.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  What I will do with it I already knew.  This idea stuck in me a long time ago, when I watched the transfer of something like ‚Äúwhile everyone is at home‚Äù early in the morning.  There guys did something similar, but very poor.  I then thought that I could have been better.  And so I had the opportunity. <br><br>  Unfortunately, all the work took place long before I started reading Habr, so I didn‚Äôt take pictures of the process.  Sketched a few sketches in stages + photos and videos of what happened. <br><br><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0072/IMG_4205.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Stage 1. All unnecessary - back in the trash. </h4><br>  And the excess is here - 80% of the entire device!  It was a pity to gut him, but it was worth it.  Carefully removed the kinescope and all the boards to it, the back cover with a bulge for the radiation tube is also no longer needed.  All that remains is a wooden frame with a front part. <br><br><h4>  Stage 2. We start to collect. </h4><br>  Behind a wooden frame we pin plywood with small nails, we can additionally add glue to the joints. <br>  Then we putty gaps and holes, other irregularities.  We paint <br>  I painted a simple black paint from a can, but you can make a creative multi-colored painting. <br><img src="http://i.imagehost.org/0408/3_27.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Stage 3. Disks. </h4><br>  I have accumulated a bunch of old / unnecessary / scratched CDs and DVDs, which until now were suspended from the ceiling by the threads and, spinning, created beautiful glares on the walls.  But I found a more useful application for them. <br>  The disks stuck inside the minibar, readable surface outward, something like this: <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0311/4_16.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Stage 5. Backlight. </h4><br>  First, the lighting was conceived in the form of a pair of halogen lamps on top.  But they are very hot, and it is not good for alcohol.  Then there were thoughts about all sorts of neon lamps, fluorescent lamps of various colors, etc.  But they have their drawbacks - some take up too much space, others require additional adapters. <br>  The solution came unexpectedly, beautifully and as cheaply as possible - Christmas tree garland! <br>  I mounted it with clips for a stapler, which I simply hammered. <br><img src="http://f.imagehost.org/0136/6_7.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Stage 6. Final. </h4><br>  My garland had 8 modes of operation, which were switched by pressing a single button on the block.  Tweeters in it was not, and if it were, would tear to hell.  By simple frauds with a soldering iron, connected the button on the TV to the button garlands.  Brought the wire out. <br><br>  So, we have: a minibar from a TV set on 5-10 bottles, one or two up to 40 cm high. The height is provided by a hole on the right in the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù, where it is convenient to put long bottles: they both fit and cannot be seen.  The modes of a garland are switched by the button of inclusion of the TV.  The whole structure fits on the shelf and does not take very much space. <br><br>  Here's what happened: <br><br><img src="http://b.imagehost.org/0591/IMG_4208.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://b.imagehost.org/view/0008/IMG_4210" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://b.imagehost.org/view/0149/IMG_4212" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://b.imagehost.org/0972/IMG_4215.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><video>  http://rutube.ru/tracks/2943401.html?v=a883978f43e20f4605bd17bac804e56d </video><br>  PS While writing the post, there were a few thoughts on improvement.  In particular, I want to add music. <br>  If anyone has any ideas - write, it's interesting to read. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84647/</a></p>
