The Android TV theme today is quite popular and enjoys the attention of developers, but in spirit this system is somehow closer to this resource. <br><br>  Along with many topics of interest to developers, we have always been interested in such questions as: ‚ÄúWhat is new is waiting for us in the near future in the IT sphere?  Where will the market be focused, what should users and developers focus on? ‚Äù  Several interesting reports were presented on these issues, presented at the <a href="http://wnconf.com/">White Nights 2015</a> conference held in St. Petersburg.

      Recently, the popularity of Android TV has increased significantly.  This is facilitated by several reasons: <br><br><ol><li>  The popularity of the Android platform itself is growing. </li><li>  Companies such as Philips, Sharp and Sony have begun mass production of TVs based on Android TV.  Thus, users do not need to buy additional consoles. </li><li>  More and more applications and games are being created for this platform. </li><li>  The functionality of the platform is constantly expanding.  For example, with Android TV you can use Chromecast, use a wide range of devices for remote control (remote controls, gamepads, iOS- and Android-devices). </li><li>  Ability to play your favorite games with friends both locally and online.  In fact, Android TV turns into a gaming console with great potential. </li></ol><br>  Since Android TV is based on Android, it would seem that any applications or games created for this OS should be supported.  However, porting applications still have to, although it will require a minimum of effort. <br><br>  As an example of a game adapted for Android TV, Natalya called Game Insight <b>Running Shadow</b> .  This is one of the first games that appeared on the console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf4/3ac/3b7/bf43ac3b7f284a98a4f2456392d8ffa3.jpg"><br><br>  The game is written in Unity.  When it was ported to Android TV, the changes did not affect the graphics and mechanic, the project did not require significant rework.  The game dynamics has changed, the project monetization scenario has been reworked.  For obvious reasons, the interface has changed: after all, the phones are controlled by touching the screen, and on TV these functions are assumed by the gamepad and the remote control.  The developers spent about two weeks on porting the game.  On average, Natalia noted, this process takes from one to four weeks. <br><br>  Following Running Shadow, a number of other famous games that are already available for download on Google Play have been ported: <br><br>  1. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.creativemobile.nno">Nitro Nation</a> from <a href="http://creative-mobile.com/">Creative Mobile</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f2/cfd/92a/5f2cfd92abac4e86aa5361319c21e4e1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/956/dee/ef9/956deeef9a884e649b6ca818b150ff8c.jpg"><br><br>  2. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.vectorunit.purple.googleplay">Beach Buggy Racing</a> from the company <a href="http://www.vectorunit.com/">Vector Unit</a> , which can be played over the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/e87/fd5/d23e87fd5c544945b1d120aad47f2f30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c3/e28/4a8/1c3e284a85ee4e9689aa6b055d9231e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8f/f1f/bb0/e8ff1fbb06654c859ac2fd6bdf19584e.jpg"><br><br>  3. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftDMHM">Minion Rush</a> from <a href="http://www.gameloft.com/%3Fsk">Gameloft</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/700/b40/980/700b409801c34568abf10da2e2e3575f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eac/ae3/8e9/eacae38e91ae48f0891bcbeab7047eb0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fe/ef1/d6b/6feef1d6b0984ec986375c2c1d9c4fea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/536/21d/2b7/53621d2b743145edaf6b89ebecde4623.png"><br><br>  Separately, I would like to dwell on such a fairly well-known game like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.hasbro.monopolydashchromecast">MONOPOLY Dash for Chromecast</a> from the owner of <a href="http://www.hasbro.com/">Hasbro Inc.</a>  This game is a virtual game table for Android TV, and allows players to connect from iOS- and Android-devices to play together over the network.  Thus, each connected player sees his deck of cards on his device, and the general playing field - the board - is displayed on the Android TV screen.  The game requires a Google Chromecast device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1c/bf1/4ac/a1cbf14ac72b4643ac4c43ba6215e3f0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ec/be0/e0b/0ecbe0e0b8f94769887e44cfca172201.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4d/b11/15b/f4db1115b9014c179ae00a07e2a78ce5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/293/2f7/bbf2932f7bb74fbbb6352e187b881c12.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Android TV and new horizons </h3><br>  You do not need to be a level 80 magician to make simple economic predictions.  At the moment, the cost of Android TV is extremely small compared to game consoles.  ‚ÄúOf course, it‚Äôs not a game console,‚Äù you say.  And you will be right, but only in part.  Here you should carefully consider the user's portrait. <br><br>  Since Android TV allows you to get Smart TV + at a reasonable price, you can access gaming applications on the big screen, we can add other categories to the standard user category - men of all ages: women and children of preschool and primary school age.  Thus, we can assume what prospects for application developers this platform opens up for us: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>The screen is like a card table</b> .  Developers have unlimited opportunities to create card games, from poker to a complex card-based economic strategy, both in the single-player mission mode and in the multiplayer mode.  You can immerse the player in the atmosphere of a virtual casino, on the battlefield, in the harsh world of finance, to give the opportunity to participate in historical events.  The idea is not new, but requires more detailed consideration.  First of all, the convenience factor is important here.  The user would rather play cards sitting on a comfortable couch and looking at the big screen than peering at images of small cards on a mobile device.  Card games are valued, for the most part, by a male audience, especially during after-work hours.  Which is just great for Android TV. </li><li>  <b>Games for companies</b> .  Any party can be even more interesting when funny games for a big company are used.  A bet worth doing on the element of random distribution of chances in the game strategy.  Random fantasy, a tricky task, games for guessing musical compositions, or a crossword puzzle and ‚Äúnoodle‚Äù on the net.  Many people underestimate this niche, and very vain.  There are not so many existing analogues, and the quality of applications leaves much to be desired.  It is desirable to allow users to play with each other, controlling the process from their own devices or using the joystick or remote control that comes with the Android TV. </li><li>  <b>Female audience</b> .  Do not focus entirely on the male audience, women make up a considerable - and grateful - share of Android TV users.  Simulation games, various farms, women's applications (including cooking recipes that can be viewed right during cooking), fitness trainers - all this can be used to attract a female audience who spend the most time at the TV. </li><li>  <b>Children's games</b> .  Any colorful projects that can take a child for several hours - the best that you can think of.  Adults are often fans of children's games, so an important dynamic plot and beautiful bright graphics are important components.  However, children's applications are not only games.  It can be as various educational materials, and children's interactive books. </li></ol><br>  The range of possibilities of Android TV is so huge that it is difficult to immediately cover all the variety of possible ideas for developers.  The main thing when creating applications is to clearly understand the portrait of your target audience.  Who knows, maybe soon the platform will be able to gain more popularity and become on a par with game consoles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/382259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/382259/</a></p>
