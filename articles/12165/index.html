I'll start with the young team <b>GRO Design</b> . <br>  Meet <a href="http://www.grodesign.com/main.html">www.grodesign.com</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/966/0a2/061/9660a2061a95641c6bbc80bdb7b514be.jpg"></div><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The first Nokia handset that I liked for many years is the 5300 Xpress Music.  Then I did not know that the design of this tube was created by GRO, a respected studio of mine. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.cep-telefonu24.com/assets/images/nokia_5300_cep_telefonu.jpg"></div><br><br>  This small office is based in the city of Eindhoven, in the Netherlands.  As I have already said, the company is young, it‚Äôs only 8 years old, but during this time the studio‚Äôs clients have become such giants as Nokia, Philips, Samsung, Grolsch, Grohe, NXT and other lesser-known brands in Russia. <br><br>  I learned about it from an article in the magazine MONITOR Unlimited (which I respect very much, for the efficiency and freshness of the published information) about the Scoot electroscientist.  Recently, Habr√© has already discussed various two-wheeled vehicles and I spoke rather sharply about electric cars and defended hydrogen ‚Äúcells‚Äù very hard.  But before this device, I would not resist. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.electroscoot.com/nonflash/_photography/1.jpg" title="Meet Scoot"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.electroscoot.com/nonflash/_photography/4.jpg" title="front and back"></div><br><br>  Here is what MONITOR writes about this concept: <br>  " <i>Scoot is a new project of GRO Design Studio, implemented in collaboration with proto Model Tim Model Makers and Korf &amp; van Mierlo photographers. The project has two main objectives: it gives the team an opportunity to explore new areas of the market and also to refresh our way of thinking. Later results may attract new customers who decide to work with GRO. "</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We started with market research.</i>  <i>In the fight against air pollution and traffic jams caused by the intensive use of personal transport, city authorities impose duties (London, Singapore) or reduce the number of parking lots, increasing the cost of parking (Amsterdam).</i>  <i>Investments in public transport are growing, but it still remains overcrowded, poorly compatible with your personal schedule and non-ubiquitous</i> . In short, the problem is clear - gasoline prices are rising, there is no place, global problems with ecology. And as a solution, an inexpensive, beautiful (‚Äúdesigner‚Äù "- this term I will often use to show a subtle aesthetic image of an object, things) and an easy-to-use scooter. 30 km / h, 6 hours or 50 km without recharging are technical data. And you can see aesthetic in the illustrations - clean lines nothing l  Shnego has a triangle type in his form, which makes him different from others, with his character and charm. For some time I could not understand what was on his wheels, but after looking it became clear that it was a steel polished disk instead of knitting needles. Say - original! <br><br>  Other prototype products are microwave and refrigerator for Samsung.  The digital form, uncharacteristic materials and such ‚Äúretrosis‚Äù in the direction of the 60s is a non-banal mixture.  Although I would not buy a microwave.  I like the one that in ‚ÄúBack to the Future-2‚Äù;) Both subjects came up for the Home Appliances Innovation 2002 competition. Nifiga did not win, but participation was also important - they were lit up in the end. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.productdose.com/images/products/draft_254_big.gif" title="makrovaveyv"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.reluct.com/home/gro_design_fridge2.jpg" title="fridge"></div><br><br>  By the way, the refrigerator is in the usual position - vertical.  But the world has long been a tendency to drag the kitchen into the living area.  Not just to tear down the wall between them, but to adapt the brutal kitchen appliances to the living space.  Roughly speaking, it‚Äôs not a shame to put on this refrigerator and TV.  Especially if you use it as a bar. <br><br>  By the way, GRO generally boast about their prototypes.  And they should not be ashamed of it at all.  Unfortunately, their site is mostly flash and it is not possible to tear out all the pictures.  Therefore, visit their projects section - there are many interesting things. <br><br>  Their things, as you can see, are rather unpretentious at first glance.  They are mostly invisible.  And this is not casual - as one of the directions of their concept of ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù - the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe thing ‚Äî which no-one uses.  GROs study the relationships of people and things, their interactions and their stay / coexistence in the same space. <br><br><img src="http://www.reluct.com/home/gro_anonymoustoaster.jpg" title="toaster" align="left"><img src="http://www.reluct.com/home/gro_anonymous_kettle.jpg" title="electric pan" align="left">  So, for example, these devices manifest their functionality during work, but as soon as you finish eating and clean up these items become just a cube and a cylinder, they change their semantics, I‚Äôm not afraid of the word.  Their purpose to us is more "not clear" and does not bother.  In a world where food and drinks are being poured in from all sides, sometimes it is good to stay in a corner of the world that does not remind you of food, and you only want to eat when you want it, when your stomach really requires it, and not tasty advertising. <br><br>  I would also like to tell you about the table + lamp and lamp-lamp, but the article turns out to be already long, but I could not get decent pictures.  But lastly I will show you a device, a gadget, the purpose of which you will surely be surprised: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.reluct.com/home/GRO_design_boombag.jpg" title="Boom-bag!"></div><br><br>  This naive handbag is nothing more than an iPod speaker.  It is made of waterproof fabric, NXT flat speakers are embedded in it, and the red label is the control panel.  The player is connected inside the bag, which, if I understood correctly, has its own battery, which allows you not to plant the player itself and which you can charge.  Now imagine such a healthy black man from the very center of Brooklyn, with his pants half-exhausted, his biceps pumped up, which is waddling along the street and holding this handbag on his shoulder, from which hard hip-hop is being poured over the whole quarter ... <i>We are all different, but still we !</i>  - next time about Moooi.  Or maybe not ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12165/</a></p>
