The purpose of this topic is not to compare the two operating systems, but some points will still be viewed as positive or negative, both in themselves and in relation to another OS.  Opinion and views on the operating system are purely subjective.  Speaking of Android and iOS, you can not ignore the phones on which they are installed, so the article will also affect mobile devices on these operating systems.  Please all the faint of heart and categorical not to read this post.  The article contains a lot of text and does not contain pictures.  If anyone has not changed his mind to read - please under the cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Meet Android </h1><br>  I met the Android OS when I bought myself an LG P500 (Optimus one) phone.  Even then there was a keen competition of manufacturers: who is more powerful, who has a better display, etc.  I chose a fairly budget option and enjoyed using this device.  On the phone was a version of Andoid - 2.3.3.  I listened to music on the phone, tried to watch the video.  Of the games I played only chess, I went to the Internet via Wi-Fi, but there was no special need for the Internet: the Internet was at work and at home, but I didn‚Äôt have to have it anymore.  I put various programs on the phone: from Vkontakte to Titanium Backup.  Some programs needed root access and I installed root access to the device.  In general, everything was like that of people and I was, in principle, pleased with the phone.  In principle, because the technologies are not standing still: you won't surprise anyone with a 3MP camera (although once it seemed that a camera with a 3MP camera took very good pictures. But then it was about the lenses ... I understand), there was little internal memory and Google applications that were placed on the internal memory - they ate it mercilessly, the processor was not very fast and it started to affect applications (rather large applications and files opened for a long time).  The phone started to lose quickly in value and I decided <s>to</s> sell it.  I could not immediately buy a top-end phone, since the difference in money was very significant.  In the end, I found a replacement for my Optimus One in China ...

    <h2>  Buying a Chinese Phone </h2><br>  I was looking for a phone that would be inexpensive, but at the same time, powerful enough, would have a sufficient amount of RAM, internal memory, which would be with a good display and on Android 4. Everything indicated that it was necessary to look for a phone in China: prices there are low, and product quality has risen significantly lately.  In addition, in the field of mobile phones in China, this technological boom.  On Habr√© one can often see reviews of Chinese phones and I read many of them.  Some reviews contained links to stores where you can buy them.  I stopped at one store: I bought a phone on <a href="http://www.pandawill.com/">Pandawill</a> .  I like this online store because there is a good description of phones and filters with which it is easier to find the product you need.  Also in the store are often promotions and discounts.  In general, the store lures customers as they can.  I ordered a phone THL W3 +.  This phone has a dual-core processor and a clock speed of 1 GHz, smart screen, gigabytes of RAM and four gigabytes of internal memory.  According to the characteristics, the phone completely satisfied my requirements.  The phone came without any problems a couple of weeks after ordering.  Turning back, they can say that before buying on Pandawill, you can look at the same phone on other Chinese sites.  Perhaps in another store the price will be lower.  For example, you can visit the store <a href="http://www.aliexpress.com/">Aliexpress</a> .  I haven‚Äôt yet been buying mobile phones on Ali, but I bought many other things and they all came without problems.  Pandawill has a good selection, a great description and various discounts, but not the fact that everything is cheaper there. <br><br><h2>  Andoid 4.04 in Chinese phone </h2><br>  THL W3 + was on Android 4.04.  The Russian language was not in the system, but I quickly found the firmware with the Russian language, and this defect was corrected.  I used this device in full: I often surfed in nete (and not only via Wi-Fi), I watched movies, downloaded a bunch of programs, games and widgets.  I put root access and installed a program to record conversations, I also put different programs for photos (PaperCamera, Instagram), to enter social networks and navigators.  I tried to use the phone in full and was glad that I had a fairly powerful phone and one of the latest operating systems.  Of course I did not pay for the application.  I'm not the user who is used to paying for content, especially since a large number of Android applications are free or the light versions were enough for me.  At first, I was pleased with everything, but over time, my euphoria was gone and I began to notice various minor flaws that, in consequence, began to irritate. <br><br><ol><li>  The first thing that caught my eye was the micro usb connector.  The fact is that the connector was deeper than other gadgets that used micro usb.  Accordingly, I could charge the phone and connect it to the computer only with the wire that came with the phone. </li><li>  The internal memory of the phone (4GB) was not all accessible and was divided into 2 parts: the memory of the phone and the internal memory.  The application could only be transferred from the internal memory to the phone's memory, which means that the memory card could only be used for data.  In addition, I was often confused: where is the memory card, and where is the memory of the phone.  One was called "SD Card", and the second - "SD Card 2". </li><li>  The phone saw the memory card only in FAT32 format, which means that you will not be able to write to it a file larger than 4 GB.  If you have a 4GB memory card, then that's okay, but if the memory is 32 GB and you want to throw a large movie ("* .mov"), then it will not work.  I was prompted to try to format the memory card in ExFat format, but I did not try to do it.  But unsuccessfully tried to format in all other formats. </li><li>  At some point, the memory card slot got buggy: the phone every five minutes tried to read the memory card.  At this moment, the screen spontaneously ignited, there was a memory card and the screen went out again.  It is not hard to guess that because of this glitch, the phone‚Äôs battery lasted only a few hours (in normal mode, the battery was stable for 24 hours).  The point was not about the data on the memory card that the programs could access.  I formatted the memory card and put another card, but still nothing helped.  I do not know what was the glitch, but it helped only that put the memory card to 4 GB (it was 32 GB and 8 GB).  At first I wanted to tighten the Pandawill service center, but then I just sold the phone. </li><li>  Andoid 4.04, of course, it was cool, but the technology did not stand still and new versions of Android came out.  As it turned out, THL was not going to update this phone to newer versions of Android.  Sadly, it seemed that the new version could fix some glitches.  The new versions of Andoid carry the improvements in Google applications that are not available in other versions.  It's a shame to watch when updates pass by you.  I think that was the reason why I wanted to try another platform, iOS. </li><li>  The speaker of the phone was very loud and, even on a quiet sound, many of my colleagues heard what the interlocutor said on the opposite wire.  This unpleasant moment is also found on many phones of famous brands, alas. </li><li>  The next problem can probably be attributed to the G-Sensor.  When I opened the Sky Map application and tried to look at the constellations, my head was spinning: just the picture on the screen jerked.  I tried to configure the sensor and the G-Sensor, but it did not help.  When I played games on the phone, it seemed to me that the sensor is not always obedient, but I don‚Äôt undertake to judge the sensor exactly, perhaps my fingers are crooked. </li><li>  I poured the melodies onto the internal memory, into the Ringtones folder, but the melody sometimes flew off.  A small glitch and maybe it's in the firmware, but it was unpleasant </li></ol><br><br>  With the shortcomings, like, everything.  I can not say that the Chinese phones are bad and should not be bought.  It‚Äôs worth buying if you want to get a cheaper phone.  I bought a Chinese phone in the fall of 2012.  During this time, the Chinese have further advanced in the production of mobile phones.  Phones are available on newer versions of Android and have a nice price tag.  My advice: choose enough well-known Chinese manufacturers: ZTE, Lenovo, MEIZU, HUAWEI, THL, ZOPO.  Pay attention to the internal memory of the phone and the price tag of the phone.  If the price of the phone is lower than the rest, then they obviously saved on something.  In general, I figured for myself such maths: if a Chinese phone costs $ 200 in China, then in Ukraine there is an analogue, but with a famous brand, it costs about $ 350.  You can calculate the coefficient (1.75) and understand how much you overpay for the brand. <br><br><h1>  Hello iphone </h1><br>  I heard from my friends and acquaintances about how cool the iPhone is: their super design and applications work more stably and in general they are always one step ahead.  You can hear a hundred times, but it's better to try it once.  I decided to buy an iPhone, respectively, with iOS on board.  One thing I knew for sure: I did not want to pay for the iPhone the amount that it really cost and was looking for ways to save.  In the end, I bought an iPhone 4s on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a> , at auction.  In the description of the phone it was written that he was ‚ÄúUnlocked‚Äù and I began to expect the arrival of this pleasant invention.  I bought the phone for $ 350 + shipping $ 40 (in the country, too, was not free).  I ordered through an intermediary ( <a href="http://meest.us/">Meest</a> ), because Americans do not want to send goods abroad, well, at least the offers with delivery to Ukraine were much less.  After a couple of weeks, the iPhone came and I soon started getting to know iOS. <br><br><h2>  Before you start working with the iPhone ... </h2><br>  I didn‚Äôt manage to get acquainted with iOS right away, as it turned out that the phone is locked.  Got on Ebay, began to peer at the description of the phone and saw that at the very bottom it was written: ‚ÄúMay have been unlocked‚Äù, which means ‚ÄúAlready been unlocked‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan be unlocked‚Äù.  Just the seller with the grammar is not friendly.  I wrote to the support service, they say, in the description of one thing, but in fact - more.  I was told that I could return the phone and get my money back.  I poserfil in nete and found that the phone can be unlocked for $ 100.  I figured: I spent 40 dollars on delivery to Ukraine, now another 40 dollars will have to be spent on return shipping and I hardly get the money back for delivery.  In addition, there may be friction that I am outside the United States.  In the end, I decided that I would not return the phone and try to unlock it.  A miser pays twice, you will think, and, in a sense, you will be right.  In addition to the phone being locked, it was also locked to the Verizon operator.  From this, the cost of unlocking was $ 100.  If it were AT &amp; T, then you could unblock for $ 10 (old rates, now the prices have changed a bit).  In general, I took to do with the phone "NeverLock": unlock so that they would no longer be blocked.  I found several sites that can unlock the iPhone and that do not look like a scam.  I can credit the two main sites: <a href="http://letsunlockiphone5.com/">letsunlockiphone5.com</a> and <a href="http://www.officialiphoneunlock.co.uk/">officialiphoneunlock.co.uk</a> .  I used the services of both sites.  The first site could not be unblocked, as the phone was blacklisted (BlackList).  How to remove the phone from the black list, I definitely will not say, since I did not do it.  For this, exactly, they charge an additional fee and in general it is "hemorrhoids" and very few people take it up.  The second site wrote on its page that it can unblock <u>any</u> phone, even from the blacklist.  I used the services of the second site and a few days later I received a message that the phone could not be unlocked.  The email support service did not answer, and landline phones were outside the Ukrainians and calls were charged.  I did not want to return the money, referring to the fact that the site says that money is not returned if the phone is blacklisted.  The fact that they had written on the site about the unlocking of <u>any</u> phone did not play any role.  I have already lowered my hands and measured with the loss of 100 dollars.  A couple of days later a message came from a third-party company to evaluate their service.  Under the link, I wrote a negative response and after a couple of hours I received a message that I would get my money back if I removed the negative response.  I removed the response and got my denyuzhku back.  These are the ‚Äúcarousels‚Äù ... Bastards, what else can you say ?!  But, well, that ended.  In the end, I went to the radio market, bought a chip for $ 50, inserted a card and said ‚Äúhello‚Äù iOS.  I successfully updated the operating system to 6.1.3 (the latest, at that time) and, perhaps, I would get up to iOS 7. This is to the fact that the chips are not particularly oppressed in using the operating system. <br><br><h2>  Hi, iOS </h2><br>  After turning on the phone, I was pleasantly surprised to see the choice of the Russian language, despite the fact that the phone is American.  Also, I was pleasantly pleased with the smooth movement on the desktop and the high-quality screen of the phone, which, along with a comfortable and beautiful design, made me even more pleased with the purchase.  I immediately took to install the programs that I had on Android.  To install the software, you had to create an Apple Id account and enter credit card information.  No cards - no applications, even if the applications are free.  Next - ‚Äúbetter‚Äù: when installing or updating applications, I periodically, but quite often, asked for my password.  At some point, this began to annoy, especially since the password is not short and must consist not only of numbers.  I can say that many applications that come ‚Äúfrom the box‚Äù to the iPhone are of high quality.  That is, they do not want to replace them and they perform their functions perfectly.  There is a stopwatch, timer, compass, player and more.  Android also has good stock applications, but not all Android phones are Nexus phones, which means that the manufacturer imposes its applications on you.  Some may like you, and some you may not.  Of all the applications, I liked Skype for iOS the most: talking on Skype using a phone is as good as using a headset.  I can also praise the GPS in the phone: it worked perfectly and quickly caught satellites.  In general, there are a lot of reviews of the iPhone and many different positive responses and I would not want to go into positive details: I want to point out the "unpleasant" moments that pushed me back to Android again. <br><br><ol><li>  All new mobile phones, smartphones come with a micro usb connector.  To charge the iPhone and connect it to the computer, a different wire is required: a 30-pin connector, or Lightning, for newer devices.  If you have all the gadgets from Apple, then there is no problem, but in other cases you have to look for a wire to charge. </li><li>  Apple loves the original wires, adapters and other parts.  Perhaps that is why my iPhone 4s from the outlet and the Chinese adapter was charged only by 75%, and even by 66%.  When charging from a laptop, the charge reached 100%.  Nasty little thing. </li><li>  I did not use Siri on my phone, but once, for fun, I asked her (Siri) to turn on Bluetooth.  Siri understood the request, but answered that she could not do it.  Why are you me, Siri, since even you can not turn on Bluetooth?!  In the 7th version of iOS it was promised to be fixed, but I did not wait for the update.  In vain, of course, I went to bed with Siri.  As far as I know, Google's voice assistant also does not perform this function, but at least they do not brag so much about their function.  Well, I think so. </li><li>  In order to enable / disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS - I had to climb into the menu.  It is strange that there was no quick access to such important features of the phone.  Again, in the 7th version of iOS promised to fix. </li><li>  Apple's cards could not be used in Ukraine, as they were not accurate.  About the navigator, I generally keep quiet. </li><li>  I never managed to put the weather forecast from another service.  Only Yahoo weather forecast.  In general, Android has widgets that you get used to very quickly, it's a pity that they are not in iOS. </li><li>  I had a Bluetooth headset that worked fine on Android phones, but it didn't work on the iPhone.  It worked more precisely, but I was hardly heard.  I could not fix this bug. </li><li>  Applications from AppleStore are visible only for the country to which the credit card is attached.  There are moments when the update came out, but for now it is not available to you.  Offensively </li><li>  I decided to install offline navigator on the phone.  Previously, on Android, I had a croaked Navitel.  I installed a trial version of Navitel on my iPhone, and when the trial period ended, I saw the price for the full version of the program.  The price tag of 40-50 dollars obviously surprised me.  In addition, this program can only be used on iOS.  I asked myself the question: on which operating system will my future devices be?  The answer was: Android.  Then I finally realized that I want to return to Android and the future for it.  I never bought a Navitel, as there are excellent free navigators, you just have access to the Internet, though not the fastest. </li><li>  On Android, I had a program that switched sound profiles over time: on weekdays from 9 to 18 there was one sound volume, at night there was a mode without sound, etc.  For iOS, I did not find such a program, such a program simply does not exist, since developers do not have access to sound profiles.  There are programs that change the sound by location, but not by a pre-planned time.  It is possible that this has already been fixed in the new version of iOS, but not a fact. </li><li>  Most iOS apps are paid.  For me, a freeloader, this is important. </li><li>  In the phone book I have phone numbers that begin, for example, at 067, and not at +38067.  The shortened number did not identify the subscribers from the address book.  I think it's because of the chip. </li><li>  The Internet was switching from a Wi-Fi network to the Internet via GPRS.  That is, I left the house, decided to go on the Internet, but he does not catch right away.  It‚Äôs time to switch the phone to airplane mode and back.  It helped.  I think this is also due to the chip. </li><li>  In games and when watching movies, the back cover of the phone was often noticeably heated.  Unpleasantly somehow, although in winter, probably, you can warm your hands. </li><li>  I'm sick of everyone having the same melody on the phone.  The iPhone is ringing and the floor of the bus starts checking its phones.  I decided to put my own melody and realized that for this you need to do frauds in iTunes or use third-party services.  I don‚Äôt understand why complicate things when the Apple product philosophy came down to ease of use and minimalism. </li><li>  In order to throw a movie on the phone - you need to convert the movie into the desired format, with the video codec H, 264.  Tired of doing it, especially if you want to throw serials on the phone.  I only later learned that you can throw a movie just on the video application using iTunes.  In the same paragraph, you can add that for transferring data (except for photos) you can not do without iTunes. </li></ol><br><br>  I can not say that all the troubles came from iOS.  Somewhere it was the specificity of the phone and could be corrected in another model;  somewhere the problem was that there was a chip on the micro sim.  I can not say that iOS is a bad operating system.  and the iPhone is a bad phone.  Not at all.  Simply, all these shortcomings have led me to return to Android again.  The iOS user is strongly influenced by the habit: if you are used to the operating system, you don‚Äôt want to switch to another.  Users who have previously used iOS may know solutions that make it easier to use the system.  For example, throw a movie without converting. <br><br><h1>  Back to Android </h1><br>  Many of the shortcomings with Android and mobile phones, on which he stood, could be corrected by buying a Nexus phone.  So I did: I sold the iPhone, and for the same money I bought myself a new Nexus 4 with a guarantee.  I still use this device and am very pleased.  First, I always have the latest version of Android.  I am sure that in a month the updates for the phone will not stop.  Secondly, the phone has 16 GB of internal memory, which is quite enough for my applications, movies and music.  I have no confusion with a memory card and I can upload a file of any size, within free memory.  Thirdly, at the price of Nexus 4 is not much different from Chinese phones, and the build quality is high.  I will not say that the phone is the most powerful, with the highest resolution of the screen and a large amount of memory, but the characteristics that are in it completely satisfy me.  Of course, there is no perfect mobile phone and an ideal OS: some Nexus devices may not be updated over time, but at least the latest updates will be available longer than from other manufacturers.  If you buy yourself a phone on Android, then I recommend taking Nexus or Google Play Edition, but everyone, of course, has his own.  By the way, my headset, which did not work well on the iPhone 4s, works fine on the Nexus 4. <br><br>  I hope I did not get tired of the article and she will help someone when choosing a phone.  Maybe even someone will save a lot of time and money.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201704/</a></p>
