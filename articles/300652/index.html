      In our past issues (‚Äú <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/20146/">Millennials and Internet marketing - how to shape the future of the financial industry</a> ,‚Äù ‚Äú <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/19954/">Millennials watch videos most of all, is that so</a> ?‚Äù, ‚Äú <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/20502/">Innovation lessons from 4 millenial marketing specialists</a> ?‚Äù) We have already dealt with such an urgent consumer question behavior of the modern generation.  Today's article is a kind of logical continuation, with more recent statistics. <br><br>  So, the <b>millennials, or the Zeta generation, is a generation of people born roughly between the beginning of the nineties and the middle of zero.</b>  What the older generation called ‚Äúnew technologies‚Äù or ‚Äútechnologies of the future‚Äù for representatives of the Z generation is already a given and present.  The term ‚Äúdigital person‚Äù is often synonymous with millennial, since the main unifying feature of all the representatives of this generation is regular use of Internet communication and digital technologies. <br><br>  If we talk about the segmentation of the millenial audience, the same rule applies here as for the audience of consumers in general.  They can be segmented into unique and specific subgroups, with the additional criterion of separation by gender.  Why?  Surely you yourself can guess that gender in many respects determines the lifestyle and behavior when shopping. <br><br>  Some statistics.  According to the <b>Bureau of Labor Statistics</b> , <b>women master higher education more quickly</b> : 60% of them are pursuing master degrees, about half of which are legal and medical, and 42% are MBA students. <br><br>  In the working path, women also achieved great success - more than half of managerial positions, compared with 26% in 1980.  About ‚Öì of American doctors are women, as are 45% of the collective in law firms. <br><br>  Despite all these achievements, women still periodically face difficulties, especially when it comes to salary levels.  50 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, women still receive an average of 77 cents for every dollar paid to men.  However, another interesting fact should be taken into account: according to a 2012 survey by the <b>Pew Research Center</b> , <b>40% of American working wives receive a higher salary than their husbands.</b> <br><br>  So what gender differences need to be considered when setting up advertising campaigns for milleniali? <br><br>  <b>Men - an earlier ‚Äúaudience‚Äù</b> <br><br>  When analyzing the millennials with regard to gender division, it turns out that men are more willing to accept changes and want to be aware of the latest technologies. <br><br>  This statement is supported by the study ‚ÄúDDB Worldwide survey of US Internet users‚Äù, from which it follows that <b>40% of men will be happy to buy on the Internet everything that is possible, while women with a similar opinion account for 33%.</b>  Men are more likely to shop at online auctions, use online shopping applications more often and tend to compare prices using smartphones, and also retailers use applications more readily than female buyers. <br><br>  What does this mean?  <b>Men are the most interesting target audience for modern digital marketers</b> .  The successful case is a viral video from The Dollar Shave Club, which, like "hot cakes", was spread among enthusiastic millennial men in social networks, thanks to which it significantly increased the fame of the advertised brand. <br><br>  <b>Men - ‚Äúlone rangers‚Äù</b> <br><br>  If we talk in general about millennials, they are socially active - both online and off-line.  They willingly commit group activities - travel, go hiking, gather in clubs for the interests. <br><br>  But if you take into account gender differences, then men more often behave like loners, - they eat alone, they travel, etc., - while women prefer to ‚Äúgo to bed‚Äù or spend their free time with friends or family members. <br><br>  Given these features, and the impact on the target groups need to be different.  For example, to focus the attention of male travelers on the possibility of quick check-in for flights, for women to arrange group discount trips for goods of famous brands. <br><br>  <b>Millennial mothers are more responsible</b> <br><br>  Today‚Äôs mothers are already far from those that used to be when the man was the unconditional head of the family with a priority vote.  Now women bear much greater responsibility on their shoulders for making important decisions than their mothers and grandmothers.  The Pew Research Center found that <b>in 43% of couples, women make decisions in more areas than their men.</b>  The main decision-makers in pairs are 26% of men, while couples who share responsibility equally account for 31%. <br><br>  It is not surprising that mothers make up a significant part of the consumer audience, especially those who became them for the first time.  They often turn to social networks, blogs and forums for advice on products and products for children.  And these mothers really have a strong impact on brand promotion.  <b>50% of them leave recommendations on products every day or at least once a week, and 21% of them tell friends or family members about them at least once a month.</b> <br><br>  Therefore, <b>when targeting such an important audience segment, marketers need to try to ‚Äútake their place‚Äù, imagine what they can be concerned about and how they can be helped.</b>  Such an approach will cause the greatest loyalty to the brand. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <br><br>  Considering all the above gender features of millennials, it makes sense to consider the men and women of the generation Z as two different groups.  Spend enough time segmenting your audience and identifying the most characteristic gender-related behaviors of your users, and the effect will not take long. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg206052016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300652/</a></p>
