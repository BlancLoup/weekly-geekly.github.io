  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Network under the ruling?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Network under the ruling? <br><br>  Recently, authorities are increasingly talking about the need to streamline activities in the field of home local area networks.  Recently, even Deputy Director of the Financial Investigation Department of the State Control Committee Yevgeny Mochaylo spoke on this subject, mentioning that a government resolution will be issued soon.  So far, there are no documents regulating this sphere of communications. <br><br>  According to the city authorities, this document will provide an opportunity to legalize the business, as well as allow KGC to determine the addresses of the authors of Internet content and control their work.  In general, the authorities started talking about the need for this document last year.  At the same time, the administrators of these networks expressed fears that their offspring might cease to exist altogether.  However, half a year ago, Sergey Popkov, chief engineer of Minsk city telephone networks, denied information about the authorities' intention to liquidate illegal local networks.  ‚ÄúMinsk residents have nothing to fear,‚Äù he said then.

      Quite recently, the European Radio for Belarus reported that the authorities plan to adopt a document on streamlining the activities of local networks by August.  What caused the urgent need for the preparation of such a document, specifically the authorities do not voice.  As the administrator of one of the Minsk networks, Alexander, said, ‚Äúthe authorities are afraid of the scale with which the networks are expanding.  Firstly, the content transmitted in huge volumes between computers today is absolutely uncontrollable, while all the data transmitted through external channels of the Internet can be traced very easily.  Secondly, let it be a small, but still business.  And since the authorities are inclined to overestimate its scale, it seems to them that it is a question of huge money, which the budget does not receive in the form of tax collections.  Although, as it seems to me, the first aspect is more important. ‚Äù  Alexander Alekhnovich, chief specialist of the architecture committee of the Minsk City Executive Committee, expressed the same point of view in one of his comments: ‚ÄúIt is not known what they do in these networks, what kind of information is being pumped.  I think this should be monitored.  If people download pirated movies, this is bad.  It is unknown at what age there is someone who - maybe, pornography is pumped. ‚Äù  According to Alexander, the problem is political in nature: ‚ÄúIf oppositional youth leaving messages on the forums and LiveJournal can be tracked down and predict their plain plans, then in the case of home networks this is impossible.‚Äù  According to Alexander, it is impossible to legalize home networks: ‚ÄúIf you come to the ZREO and say that you want to register your network, you will be offered to bring a bunch of certificates, stamps and certificates that you will have to collect the year.  They can not be collected!  Therefore, while the network can not be legalized.  And with the introduction of the document being prepared, the authorities will be able to simply cut off all the wires, but the registration procedure will not be simplified.  Ultimately, the network may simply disappear.  Another scenario is possible: they will be taken away from the administrators - those enthusiasts who created them and who bought the equipment.  But this is unlikely - most likely, the installation of the housing and communal services electricians will simply be cut off. ‚Äù  By the way, experts predict that the future of networks will be the same as the past of external air conditioners and satellite dishes.  On the question of Onliner, what local networks interfered with, which enmeshed houses in the capital, the representatives of housing and public utilities for the most part only shrugged their shoulders.  It turns out that ordinary employees of housing and communal services even plainly don‚Äôt know what it is all about.  Only once from an electrician of one of the ZhREO of the Moscow district, Vladimir managed to hear: ‚ÄúAnd who gave them the right to pull these wires through the whole house?  This is not safe - electric discharges pass through it, it can catch fire.  And who will be responsible for this?  Go figure out who puts them there if something happens.  And they will make us guilty: the type we overlooked.  It's time to end this mess! ‚Äù  According to some information, a total audit of the entire housing stock of the city is now expected in Minsk.  And all suspicious networks of wires that were not held by housing and utilities staff are allowed to be cut off. <br><br>  By the way, now the laying of home networks and help in their legalization of the population took the help and providers.  As told Onliner RUP "Beltelecom", "at the moment Beltelecom does not own home networks, and also does not deal with their construction.  exploitation.  control of their condition, etc.  Therefore, the position regarding private home networks is difficult to express. As we have already said, until 2010, the implementation of the MetroEthernet project is planned, the task of which is to organize fast and high-quality access to the Internet.  interactive TV and telephony through a single cable and modem.  The conditions created for the introduction of modern telecommunication technologies will contribute to a better development of communication between users than what is offered by other providers today. ‚Äù  At the same time, Igor Sukach, director of AtlantTelecom, actively protests against the liquidation of networks, noting that ‚Äúthe home network is a kind of user community that has united in common interest.  Denying people the creation of such communities is a big mistake.  In fact, this is the same thing as driving people out into the street.  Are few people on the streets drinking beer, behaving oddly? ‚Äù.  If the authorities decide to liquidate the networks in a single house, Sukach suggests that the subscribers of the network contact the provider to help their child to legalize - ‚ÄúThis is the fastest way out of this situation.‚Äù <br><br>  Today in the capital, you can literally be a home network subscriber in every home, especially in residential areas.  By some estimates, the growth of the home networking market is about 200% per year.  As a rule, a new network arises as soon as five or six like-minded people have gathered, who have decided to connect their computers over a local network.  However, today there are associations in Minsk, where the number of computers is more than two thousand!  For example, the metropolitan network Uruchie Network brings together as many as 6000 computers!  3000 computers unites the VOSTOK network.  It is impossible to calculate how many computers in Minsk are networked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13207/</a></p>
