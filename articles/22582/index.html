  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Let's apply the IM experience in combating email spam?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The scourge of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century - spam.  Every day we receive dozens, if not hundreds, of letters to the emails calling for an increase in dignity or wealth.  Of course, third-party anti-spam software or quality mail (for example, <a href="http://gmail.com/" title="Here they fight spam.">Gmail</a> ) can help us, but this is not always enough. <br><br>  When developing software that interacts with users, sites or services, they use different ways to ensure access and delineation of rights.  The most popular concepts: "black list", "white list". <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The existing methods of combating spam are based on the use of ‚Äúblacklists‚Äù, in which the addresses of the senders are entered, the words used to identify the letter as spam, as well as the means of formatting the text.

      Why not use white lists?  It's very simple: a letter from an address that is not in the address book is not accepted.  In this place, I feel, you will try to argue.  I will explain. <br><br>  Many are willing to pay a certain amount for sending a letter.  There were also ideas for paying for mail not with money, but with the resources of your computer (they left to smoke or drink tea, and the computer at that time spent 10 minutes searching for a cure for cancer, thus paying for sending a letter) .  In both cases, you have to "pay."  I suggest a way in which the board will be that you spend a minute, and ideally less, to add the addressee to the white list. <br><br>  To allow someone to send you correspondence, you need to know about the fact of a person‚Äôs desire.  Here we will be helped by the experience of various anti-spam bots that are embedded, for example, in IM.  Used <a href="http://www.qip.ru/" title="Alternative ICQ Client">QIP</a> ?  If they dug deep, they probably included or saw the settings of the above bot.  The bottom line is that an unauthorized contact must answer the question, after which it is able to communicate with the person at the other end of the line.  This will allow to eliminate robots that send spam, as well as to produce a semblance of an attack on the spammer's box, if he suddenly indicated the real address. <br><br>  Let's return to the mail.  When a person has answered the control question, you will be invited to add a person to your address book or a ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù.  And then write, please, as much as you like. <br><br>  If each person has the opportunity to specify his own question, then spammers will be very hard, because they will have to manually specify the answer for each address.  I think they will give up this ungrateful thing.  And if there is a list of questions that are asked in random order? <br><br>  But imagine what kind of freedom on the business cards, if there is also indicated an atypical answer / password: <br><br>  E-mail: cvetochek@domain.ru * @} -&gt; - * <br><br>  The main thing is that this functionality does not necessarily force the user to torture people writing letters to him.  It is enough to make such an ‚Äúerotic‚Äù, as it is fashionable to say lately, tick in the settings: ‚ÄúEnable antispam‚Äù. <br><br>  And there is just around the corner "social mail", when the white lists are taken from your addressees up to the third, fifth, etc.  laps.  Of course, anonymously. <br><br>  <strong>UPD:</strong> Of course, this all provides for server implementation.  Here google could try :) <br><br>  The development of ideas and search for pitfalls in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22582/</a></p>
