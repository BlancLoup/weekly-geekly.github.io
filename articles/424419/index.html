  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What happens when creating a Flexbox container?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  This is a translation of the article by Rachel Andrew, one of the developers of the CSS specifications. </p><br><p>  In a short series of articles, I‚Äôm going to spend some time unpacking the <strong>Flexbox in detail</strong> - just like I did in the past with the <strong>grid</strong> .  We will look at what <strong>Flexbox</strong> was designed <strong>for</strong> , what it really does well, and when we cannot select it as the layout method. </p><br><p>  In this article, we take a closer look at what actually happens when adding <strong>display: flex</strong> to your style sheet. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="flex-konteyner-pozhaluysta">  Flex container please! </h2><br><p> To use <strong>Flexbox</strong> , you need an element that will be a <strong>flex</strong> container.  In your CSS, you use <code>display: flex</code> : </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/PBRGQO" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Let's think a bit about what <code>display: flex</code> really means.  In the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display-3/"><strong>Display Module Level 3</strong></a> specification, each value of the <code>display</code> property is described as a combination of two elements: an internal and external display model. </p><br><p>  When we add <code>display: flex</code> , we actually define <code>display: block flex</code> .  External display type of our flex-container block;  it acts as a block level element in the standard stream.  The internal display type is flex, so the elements directly inside our container will participate in the flex layout. </p><br><p>  This is something you may never have thought about, but you probably still understand.  The flex container acts like any other block on your page.  If you have a paragraph followed by a flex container, then both elements behave as we want from block elements. </p><br><p>  We can also assign the <strong>inline-flex</strong> value to our container using <code>display: inline flex</code> , i.e.  The flex container acts as a row-level element with children that participate in the Flex layout.  The child elements of our lowercase flex container behave the same as the children of our block flex container;  the difference lies in how the container itself behaves in a general layout. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/YjaGvZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This concept of behavior of elements with an external display type, defined as a block on a page (plus an internal display type) dictates how their children behave, is very useful.  You can apply this reasoning to any block in CSS.  How does this element work?  How do the children of this element act?  Answers relate to their external and internal display models. </p><br><h2 id="stroki-ili-stolbcy">  Rows Or Columns? </h2><br><p>  As soon as we have defined our flex-container, some initial values ‚Äã‚Äãcome into play.  Without adding additional properties, flex elements are displayed as a string.  This is because the initial value of the <strong>flex-direction</strong> property is <strong>row</strong> .  If you do not change it, you will get a series. </p><br><p>  The <strong>flex-direction</strong> property determines the direction of the main axis.  It may take other values: </p><br><ul><li>  column; </li><li>  row-reverse; </li><li>  column-reverse. </li></ul><br><p>  Our items in a single row will be placed, starting at the starting edge, in the direction of the line and displayed in the order in which they appear in the source.  In the specification, this edge is called <strong>main-start</strong> : </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8e/16a/120/e8e16a120a051f715d85068963e0d716.png" alt="Pic_1"><br>  <em>Fig_1.</em>  <em><strong>main-start</strong> - the beginning of the line direction</em> </p><br><p>  If we use the <strong>column</strong> value, the elements will start to be located from the starting edge in the block direction and, therefore, form a column. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e8/61e/cc9/2e861ecc98526fce8c7699138843e95c.png" alt="Pic_2"><br>  <em>Pic_2.</em>  <em><strong>main-start</strong> - the beginning of the block direction</em> </p><br><p>  If we use <strong>row-reverse</strong> , the layout of the <strong>main-start</strong> and <strong>main-end</strong> will be swapped;  so the items will be laid out one after another in the reverse order. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/12b/53e/83b12b53efe17c02bd786f07b6da9f70.png" alt="Pic_3"><br>  <em>Fig_3.</em>  <em><strong>main-start</strong> - from the end of the line direction</em> </p><br><p>  The <strong>column-reverse</strong> value does the same thing. </p><br><p>  It is important to remember that these values ‚Äã‚Äãdo not "switch the order of elements", although this is what we see, they simply change the place where the flow of elements begins, switching the layout of the <strong>main-start</strong> .  Thus, our items are displayed in reverse order, but this is because they begin to spread from the other end of the container. </p><br><p>  It is also important to remember that when this happens, this is a purely visual effect.  We ask the elements to display themselves, starting with the final edge;  they still flow in the same order, and this is the order your screen reader uses, as well as the order in which they can be tabulated.  You should never use <strong>row-reverse</strong> if you really want to change the order of the elements.  To do this, make changes to the original document. </p><br><h2 id="dve-osi-flexbox">  Two axis flexbox </h2><br><p>  We have already revealed an important feature of <strong>flexbox</strong> : the ability to switch the main axis from row to column.  This is an axis switch, so I think it‚Äôs often easier to understand things like alignment in a grid layout.  Using a two-way grid, you can align on both axes in almost the same way.  <strong>Flexbox is a</strong> bit more complicated, because some events occur depending on whether you are working with the main or transverse axis. </p><br><p>  We have already encountered the main axis, i.e. the axis, which you define as the <strong>flex-direction</strong> value.  The transverse axis is a different direction.  If you set the <strong>flex-direction: row</strong> , your main axis is along the row, and the transverse is down the column.  Using <strong>flex-direction: column, the</strong> main axis will be located down the column, and the transverse - along the line.  This is where we need to consider another important feature of the <strong>Flexbox</strong> , and this is the fact that it is not tied to the physical directions of the screen.  We are not talking about a row from left to right, or a column from top to bottom, because this is not always the case. </p><br><h2 id="rezhimy-zapisi">  RECORDING MODES </h2><br><p>  When I described the row and column above, I mentioned block and line directions.  This article is written in English, which has a horizontal recording mode.  This means that when you ask <strong>Flexbox to</strong> provide you with a string, you will get a horizontal display of your flex elements.  In this case, the <strong>main-start</strong> is on the left - at the place from which the sentences in English begin. </p><br><p>  If I worked in a language from right to left, such as Arabic, then the starting edge would be on the right: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/JBLEdZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  The initial <strong>flexbox</strong> values ‚Äã‚Äãmean that if all I do is create a <strong>flex</strong> container, then my items will start on the right and appear moving to the left.  <strong>The starting edge in the line direction is the place where sentences begin in the recording mode used.</strong> </p><br><p>  If you find yourself in vertical recording mode and refer to the string, your string will work vertically, because that is how lines of text are executed in a vertical language.  You can try this by adding a write mode property to the flex container and setting its value to <strong>vertical-lr</strong> .  Now, when you set the <strong>flex-direction</strong> to <strong>row</strong> , you get a vertical column of elements. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/oMqBXa" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  Thus, the row can work horizontally, with <strong>main-start</strong> on the left or right, and also work vertically with the <strong>main-start</strong> at the top.  It is still a <strong>flex-direction</strong> line, even if our minds, accustomed to horizontal text, find it hard to think about a line running vertically! </p><br><p>  So that the elements are located in the block direction, we set the value for the <strong>flex-direction</strong> property to <strong>column</strong> or <strong>column-reverse</strong> .  In English (or Arabic), we see elements displayed one above the other down the page, starting at the top of the container. </p><br><p>  In the vertical recording mode, the block direction runs across the page, since this is the direction of the blocks located in these recording modes.  If you specify a column in <strong>vertical-lr</strong> , your blocks will run from left to right vertically: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/yqKgeb" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  However, no matter in which direction the blocks are displayed, if you are working with a column, you are working in a block direction. </p><br><p>  Understanding the fact that a row or column can run in different physical directions is useful for understanding some of the terms used for <strong>Grid</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  We do not refer to "left and right" or "top and bottom" in <strong>Flexbox</strong> and <strong>Grid</strong> , because we make no assumptions about the recording mode of our document.  All CSS becomes more aware of the write mode. </p><br><p>  If you are interested in some of the other properties and values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are implemented to make the rest of the CSS behave in the same way, read my article on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/understanding-logical-properties-values/">logical properties and values</a> . </p><br><p>  As a summary, remember that: </p><br><ul><li>  flex-direction: row <br><ul><li>  main axis = inline dimension; </li><li>  main-start will be where the sentences begin in this recording mode; </li><li>  transverse axis = block direction; </li></ul></li><li>  flex-direction: column <br><ul><li>  main axis = block direction; </li><li>  main-start will be where the blocks start laying out in this recording mode; </li><li>  transverse axis = row direction (inline dimension). </li></ul></li></ul><br><h2 id="nachalnoe-vyravnivanie">  Initial alignment </h2><br><p>  When we use <strong>display: flex</strong> , some other events also occur.  Some initial alignment is performed.  In one of the following articles in this series, we will look at alignment.  however, in our <strong>display: flex</strong> study, we should consider doing initialization. </p><br><blockquote>  <strong>Note</strong> : It is worth noting that, although these alignment properties began life in the <strong>Flexbox</strong> specification, the <strong>Box Alignment</strong> specification will eventually replace them, as specified in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">Flexbox</a> specification. </blockquote><br><h3 id="vyravnivanie-glavnoy-osi">  ALIGNMENT OF MAIN AXIS </h3><br><p>  The initial value of the <strong>justify-content</strong> property is set to <strong>flex-start</strong> .  This is how our CSS would be like this: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs css"><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.container</span></span> { <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">display</span></span>: flex; <span class="hljs-attribute"><span class="hljs-attribute">justify-content</span></span>: flex-start; }</code> </pre> <br><p>  This causes our flex elements to line up from the starting edge of the flex container.  This is also the reason why, when we specify a <strong>row-reverse</strong> , they switch to the final edge, because  now it becomes the beginning of the main axis. </p><br><p>  If you see an alignment property that begins with <strong>justify-</strong> , then it is applied to the main axis of the <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  Thus <strong>justify-content</strong> aligns along the main axis and places our elements at the beginning. </p><br><p>  Other possible values ‚Äã‚Äãfor <strong>justify-content</strong> : </p><br><ul><li>  flex-end; </li><li>  center; </li><li>  space-around; </li><li>  space-between; </li><li>  space-evenly (added to <strong>Box Alignment</strong> ). </li></ul><br><p>  These values ‚Äã‚Äãdeal with the allocation of free space in the flex container.  That is why the elements are located near or are separated from each other.  If you add <strong>justify-content: space-between</strong> , then any available space is distributed between all elements.  However, this can only happen if there is free space.  If you had a tightly packed flex-container (without additional space after all the elements were laid out), <strong>justify-content</strong> would not do anything at all. </p><br><p>  You can see this by switching the <strong>flex-direction</strong> to the column.  Without a height, the flex container has no free space, so setting the <strong>justify-content: space-between</strong> parameter will do nothing.  If you add height and make the container taller than you need to display elements, then the property will have an effect: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/wxmgrW" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="vyravnivanie-vdol-poperechnoy-osi">  ALIGNMENT ALONG TRANSVERSE AXIS </h3><br><p>  Elements are also aligned in one line along the transverse axis of the flex-container.  The alignment that we perform is to align the blocks relative to each other in a row.  In the following example, one of our blocks has more content than all the others.  Something tells other blocks to stretch to the same height.  This property is <strong>align-items</strong> , which has an initial <strong>stretch</strong> value: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/GBxryJ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  When you see an alignment property that begins with <strong>align-</strong> and you are in a <strong>flexbox</strong> , then you are dealing with alignment along the transverse axis, and <strong>align-items</strong> align elements along the flex line.  Other possible values: </p><br><ul><li>  flex-start; </li><li>  flex-end; </li><li>  center; </li><li>  baseline. </li></ul><br><p>  If you do not want all the blocks to stretch to the height of the highest, then installing <code>align-items: flex-start</code> aligns them all along the initial edge of the transverse axis. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/RBMKyN" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3 id="nachalnye-znacheniya-dlya-elementov-flex">  Initial values ‚Äã‚Äãfor Flex elements </h3><br><p>  Finally, the flex elements themselves also have initial values, they are set to: </p><br><ul><li>  flex-grow: 0; </li><li>  flex-shrink: 1; </li><li>  flex-basis: auto. </li></ul><br><p>  This means that our elements will not grow by default in order to fill the available space on the main axis.  If the <strong>flex-grow</strong> parameter is set to a positive value, the elements will grow and take up any available space. </p><br><p>  However, blocks can shrink, since <strong>flex-shrink</strong> has a positive value of 1. This means that if we have a very narrow flex-container, then the elements will be as small as possible before the overflow occurs.  This is reasonable behavior;  in general, we want them to remain inside their blocks and not overflow if there is a place to display them. </p><br><p>  To get the best layout, the <strong>flex-basis</strong> property defaults to <strong>auto</strong> .  We will understand what this means in the next article in this series, however, most of the time you can think of <strong>auto</strong> as being ‚Äúbig enough to hold content‚Äù.  You will see that if you have flexible elements that fill the container, and one of them has more content than the others, then it will be given more space. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/embed/preview/JBLWJo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This is <strong>Flexbox</strong> flexibility in action.  When <strong>flex-basis is</strong> in <strong>auto</strong> and there is no indication of the size of the elements, they have the basic size <strong>max-content</strong> .  It would be the size when they stretched and did not carry the line break.  In this case, the free space is divided between the elements in the proportion described in the following note of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/">the <strong>flexbox</strong> specification</a> . </p><br><blockquote>  " <strong>Note</strong> : when allocating the missing space, the flex compression ratio is multiplied by the base flex size. This distributes the missing space in proportion to how the element can contract, so that, for example, a small element will not contract to zero until the larger one is noticeably reduced.‚Äù </blockquote><p>  The larger element has less free space and we get the final layout.  You can compare the two screenshots below, both taken from the example above.  However, in the first screenshot, the third block has less content, so our columns have a more even distribution of space. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2be/0a9/c28/2be0a9c2851e73e1e52d9eb1388cfa27.png" alt="Pic_4"><br>  <em>Fig_4.</em>  <em>Elements are transferred to give more space to a larger element.</em> </p><br><p>  Here, <strong>Flexbox</strong> helps us ultimately get a reasonable end result without the intervention of the person who wrote the CSS.  Instead of evenly reducing the space and eventually getting a very high element with several words on each line, it allocates more space for this element to accommodate itself.  Within the framework of this behavior, there is a key to real options for using the <strong>Flexbox</strong> .  <strong>Flexbox is</strong> best suited to accommodate multiple elements ‚Äî along a single axis ‚Äî in a flexible and meaningful way. </p><br><p>  I have covered here only some details, but we will look at these algorithms later in this series. </p><br><h2 id="zaklyuchenie">  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  In this article, I took the initial values ‚Äã‚Äãof Flexbox to explain what actually happens when you specify <strong>display: flex</strong> .  This is an amazing amount as soon as you begin to unpack it, and several properties contained in it turn out to be many of the key characteristics of flexible layouts. </p><br><p>  <strong>Flex</strong> layouts are flexible: they try to make the right choices about your content by default ‚Äî shrink and stretch to get better readability.  Flexible layouts support recording mode: the directions of rows and columns are related to the recording mode used.  Flexible layouts allow you to align elements as a group along the main axis, choosing a way to allocate space.  They allow you to align elements along their flexible lines, to move elements along the transverse axis relative to each other.  It is important to note that flexible layouts understand the volume of your content, and try to make the right basic decisions to display it. </p><br><p>  In future articles, we will explore these areas in more detail and further consider when and why we can use the <strong>Flexbox</strong> . </p></div>
