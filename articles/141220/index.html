After reading reviews on watch phones and examining all the offers on the Ukrainian market, I stopped at the domestic company AirOn, which has been producing them since 2010.  Now they have released a flash-like chasofon in a sporty style for people who do not like to stay in one place and still want to stay in touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3d/b68/a38/c3db68a380195aca973312e1cd37699c.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Or just want the original gadget, so as not to all!  Why do I need it?  - ask me, I answer - I love unusual devices and I love to run.  So I managed to combine these aspirations in Flash.

      The gadget looks like a sports watch.  Or rather - on a big sports watch.  I think the design is nice and neat.  If we consider that the chasofon is exotic in our area, then it can also be called original.  But it cannot be said that it has become for me an indispensable device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/514/757/292/5147572929a617c8c49033d78b610d0d.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  If design is a matter of taste, then the quality of the case and its ergonomics can be assessed more or less objectively.  The body is made well, without noticeable flaws.  As befits a sports watch, the Flash case is made of plastic, and the strap is made of rubberized plastic and does not contain metal parts, except for the stylus and fastener.  To the touch it is very nice.  A large range of openings on the belt will allow you to fix on the hand as a slim, and full.  I didn‚Äôt check how strong the strap is, but I think that if you don‚Äôt drag a potato-laden trailer with it on a trailer, nothing will happen to it.  The main thing is that the fastening on the arm is reliable - during active gestures the gadget does not fly away anywhere.  Running into them is also convenient, even better than with an ordinary metal clock.  Not to mention holding a handset in my hand or pocket, while I can listen to music through headphones or radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91a/b53/c46/91ab53c4641b1ad0c69439eb3b50aed3.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  On the side panel there are three buttons that serve the basic commands of any phone.  Such as receiving and resetting a call, unlocking the screen, launching the main menu, and so on. Pressing them is convenient, but only with your right hand if the gadget is on the left.  There is also a specific USB port, that is, it is non-standard.  Only the supplied cable fits it, so now the main thing is not to lose it.  Headphone out?  There's no such thing.  Instead, the same specific USB is used.  So you can not connect your favorite Koss, Sony, Sennheiser or whatever you have.  Complete headphones do not shine with high-quality sound, but you can listen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6a/1c0/ccb/d6a1c0ccb89f1e6172c91c8389c95359.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  AirOn Flash is perfectly compatible with networks of Ukrainian operators.  According to the manufacturer, the clock phone works in all GSM bands, but only within 2G.  I have nothing to argue.  It works in the Kyivstar network normally, without breaks and failures.  And from the operator of complaints like "an unknown device was detected on the network" did not arrive.  So everything is fine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1cb/6e0/0af/1cb6e00afcc076da89da431cc8fad5c1.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  The Flash clock supports Bluetooth V2.0, which is used to connect the corresponding headset.  Despite the fact that you can use the speakerphone and a wired headset, it is the Bluetooth headset that is the most convenient means of communication.  Flash supports all major profiles, including A2DP (but I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to check it).  I am satisfied with the co-operation with my private Jabra.  I didn‚Äôt notice much difference in the quality of voice transmission with other mobiles. <br><br>  A few words about autonomy.  In the course of my research, Flash Watch Phone works 2-2.5 days, depending on conversations and the use of other applications.  And the battery has only 480 mAh, which is less than the most budget phones.  Apparently the small screen and the ‚Äústandard‚Äù filling for the mobile eat nothing at all.  Well, really, I speak it a little - about 20-30 minutes a day.  So we can say that the autonomy is good, but not record.  Unusually, the battery acts as a removable cover.  By the way, it is convenient to charge the clock phone along with the headset - it takes up the battery charge in about the same time. <br><br>  The chasofon has a screen with a diagonal of 1.8 inches, 176x220 pixels.  When the gadget is on hand, the analog clock is visible on the full screen.  Set the format of other hours is not possible, but the screen saver of the main screen can be changed without problems.  After unlocking the screen, the clock changes to the main thing with icons, like a regular mobile phone.  The screen is touch-sensitive, so you can control both your finger and the stylus.  As for me, the stylus is definitely better because of the small display and, accordingly, small icons.  By the way, he is always at hand, because he hides right in the strap.  And he telescopic, if that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a57/c9a/85f/a57c9a85fcc5b0bf8b70dc3cf6ddd564.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  Another confirmation that Flash can be added to the family of mobile, is the presence of his built-in camera.  Indeed, without a camera, a telephone is not a telephone.  The camera at the gadget to put it mildly is not the coolest.  There is no flash and autofocus, but the resolution is only 0.3 Mp.  There is a video.  The camera settings are standard: you can choose the resolution (maximum 640x480), the quality of shooting, white balance, etc. And even with the best quality settings, you can only shoot during the day - strange spots appear at night.  Although there is a special mode for night shooting.  Conveniently, you can shoot using the central button.  And it is inconvenient that it is difficult to catch the necessary angle in the frame when the watch is on hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec6/e79/bba/ec6e79bba0365fb9edb64fd72436bbb0.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  If you are planning to take spy photos without being noticed by others, then be prepared to put up with their mediocre quality, after all, 0.3 Mp.  You can remove the silhouette of an enemy submarine, but you cannot fix the Pentagon‚Äôs evacuation plan with all the details.  Test photos taken with maximum quality settings in daylight are attached.  Night is better not to watch :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d0/212/7ea/9d02127ea3d490f56f03df3577eefdd9.jpg" alt="   AirOn Flash" title="Photos taken by the AirOn Flash watch player"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/519/14b/eb2/51914beb2309477a6e26f2fa251c035c.jpg" alt="   AirOn Flash" title="Photos taken by the AirOn Flash watch player"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/768/a49/c31/768a49c319872e5472e3a146e67dfe56.jpg" alt="   AirOn Flash" title="Photos taken by the AirOn Flash watch player"><br><br>  I did not expect great opportunities from the gadget, but I was very attracted by the convenience in using this form factor.  Each of us once had a regular dialer with buttons, which had a standard set of functions: in addition to calls and SMS, included a clock, calendar, contact list, alarm clock, stopwatch and other useful things, including a couple of games.  Here is the same set and Flash chasofon.  Plus you can add here an electronic compass and the function of reading electronic books. <br><br>  And what about memory?  The gadget has a built-in super-fast 512 GB SSD.  Just kidding, of course.  He has nothing in memory, namely 793 KB.  The daddy Video, Photos, etc. are created in memory. There are only 8 camera shots taken here.  Well, it's not scary, because the memory can be expanded with a memory card.  MicroSD cards with a capacity of up to 16 GB are suitable.  I am not going to shoot reports, and there is no need to store a lot of photos.  With the video, the situation is similar.  It turns out that the memory is needed only to store music.  With a dozen albums on the card is placed.  And that suits me.  Still, this is not an iPod. <br><br>  I also note that hot-swapping of cards is impossible - the slot for them is under a removable battery.  Conveniently, when you connect a gadget via USB to a computer, you can freely exchange data between them.  And you can use it as a flash drive. <br><br>  So what else?  A, set of delivery.  It includes: wired headset, charger (USB cable and adapter to the plug), stylus, warranty card.  Bluetooth-headset will have to buy or use an existing one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/052/790/4a8/0527904a800f8bf47cea50a5cdc647b8.jpg" alt="  AirOn Flash" title="Overview of the AirOn Flash watch"><br><br>  I will try to take stock, although it is still too early to do this, because my gadget is just recently.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa chasofon is good.  The question is how to implement it qualitatively.  AirOn did this in the form of Flash, but it was not without flaws.  The gadget copes with its main task - it replaces the mobile during outdoor activities or is ready to become the second handset in everyday life, but not the main one.  Is the price justified - $ 200?  Yes, if you understand what the device can and cannot do.  And apply it according to the recipe.  That's all.  So a lot of text has been interspersed.  Thanks for attention :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141220/</a></p>
