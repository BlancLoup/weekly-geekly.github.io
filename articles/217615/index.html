      This course is for people who have a craving for physics or mathematics or computer science or creating something with their own hands, but at the same time there is a fear of the word "engineer".  This course will tell and show what engineering professions are and how they are paid, who is such an engineer by nature and what are his tasks in his daily activities. <br>  <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/inzhenernoe-delo">Detailed course description on Lectorium.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Bionics.  Nano cyborgs </h4><br>  St. Petersburg State Electrotechnical University "LETI" <br>  Author: Angela Andreeva <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvP79GpfQDo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgq8YPJvmEXS-jhM630j1dAk6ISiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This course is an opportunity to acquire knowledge in one of the most sought after and paid fields of modern science.  What does bionics do?  This is an actively developing scientific and technical area, in essence, uniting biology and technology.  Man has long borrowed his ideas from Nature in everyday life, but bionics embodies them in design solutions and information technology.  Cybernetic mechanisms, artificial organs, smart skin, new materials that copy and, at times, surpass natural analogs in their properties - all these are realities of modern scientific high-tech production.  At present, bionics has received a significant impetus to the new development with the advent of nanotechnology and the minimization of the objects being created.  Bionics leads the development of medicine, electronics, military industry ... As part of our course, you will learn about the latest developments in the field of nanoelectronics, the creation of nanorobots and cyborgs. <br>  <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/bionika-nano-kiborgi">Detailed course description on Lectorium</a> <br><br><h4>  Theories of money.  From shell to bitcoin. </h4><br>  European University at St. Petersburg <br>  Posted by: Julia Vymyatnina <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbHjr7IKBno%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhPeV9usuIRD2U5kTk5vlsuEf5V6w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is a course about the phenomenon that each of us faces daily, which people all over the world often and with anxiety argue, as it has become an integral part of our life (especially in the city!) - about money ... During the course you will understand how Economists determine what can be considered money and how their value is determined.  Is such a necessary condition - gold or silver shine, in order to have undeniable value in market relations?  You will also learn about the history of the appearance of money.  You learn what was used in different cultures as money, and how their subject image changed.  Theories of money presented in our course are both widely known and rarely mentioned.  You will become familiar with their main points and representatives.  You will see how the ideas of the classics contribute to solving modern economic problems and crises.  And also learn the recommendations on the conduct of monetary policy, which can give these theories.  And at the end of the course we will try to clarify the essence of the most recent phenomena of the monetary sphere, each day taking possession of our world - electronic money, bitcoins, etc. <br>  <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/teorii-deneg-ot-rakushki-do-bitkoin">Detailed course description on Lectorium.</a> <br><br><h4>  Heavenly Mechanics </h4><br>  St. Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (NRU ITMO) <br>  Author: Alexander Chirtsov <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCxdSWNEjXo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrCinUUdStCBx-fiYXeVD_RBDJ2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To date, physics has already made quite a few discoveries that have allowed modern technologies to send humans into space, launch artificial satellites into near-earth orbit, and calculate the positions of the neighboring planets in our solar system.  But on what foundation are these achievements?  The calculation of the motion of celestial bodies involved in celestial mechanics.  Knowledge of the laws discovered by Newton is still a necessary condition for solving problems of a cosmic scale, in the most direct sense of this expression.  In the course you will get the classic knowledge that makes possible the launch of interplanetary ships and allow researchers and engineers all over the world to advance science.  This six-week course will introduce you to the basic internal laws governing space.  Celestial mechanics is one of the most interesting branches of physics, where you can start exploring right now. <br>  <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/nebesnaya-mehanika">Detailed course description on Lectorium.</a> <br><br><h4>  Do you know what western projects are?  For which audience are these courses? </h4><br>  We do not want to do the second / third / tenth coursera or edx.  We want to make the project similar in format, but for a different audience. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, we discovered that video recordings of general education, introductory courses and first-year lectures are very popular in our <a href="http://www.lektorium.tv/medialibrary">media library</a> .  We were inundated with letters like ‚Äúindignant schoolchildren of Taganrog demanding to lay out a course of optics‚Äù.  It turned out that the media library is also used for vocational guidance.  Schoolchildren are looking for a university, choosing a direction.  Bachelors - look to what professor go to the magistracy.  And someone seriously reflects on graduate school. <br><br>  And it is for this audience that we launch this project.  The courses about which are written above were originally created for those who are looking for their vocation.  That is why these courses are deeply authorial, with a very specific manner of teaching.  They are read by people who are burning <br>  his own business.  They teach because they can not teach.  And looking for supporters. <br><br><h4>  Do universities not mind? </h4><br>  Very much for. <br><br>  It turned out that there are adequate administrators in universities who are well aware that: <br>  1. MOOC is an image project for an external audience, rather than recording streaming lectures posted on a moodle for university students. <br>  2. Running MOOC on its site is obviously a losing business.  Although there are enthusiasts to do everything on the basis of the university, but, unfortunately, such projects do not catch up with good traffic. <br>  3. There must be at least a thousand students on the course.  Otherwise it is not MOOC <br><br><h4>  What format, what's inside? </h4><br>  Classic set: videos of 7-10 minutes, tests, checklists, communication on the forum, clear deadlines. <br><br>  Pleasant additions: some universities offer bonuses at the end.  For example, increased scholarship for admission or travel grant.  Read more in the course descriptions. <br><br><h4>  Who participates in the project? </h4><br>  We have attracted funding from the <a href="http://pre-seed.ru/">Foundation for Preseeding Investments of</a> St. Petersburg and individuals.  Invaluable support is provided by the Presidential Lyceum No. 239 (where, in fact, this project was born) and its director Maxim Pratusevich personally. <br><br><h4>  Who takes these courses? </h4><br>  Lectorium Studio was the first studio in Russia to participate in the creation of a course for Coursera.  We had the honor of recording video in St. Petersburg and Kaliningrad for Pavel Pevzner and his team (hello, Kohl Vyahhi! <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vyahhi/" class="user_link">Vyahhi</a> ).  It was a harsh school that we will never forget.  But the main thing is that everything turned out well and on time.  This <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics">bioinformatics course</a> had 30,000 students, it was very difficult for the program.  I am sure many habrovchane remember him. <br><br>  And then we realized that we did not stop.  We want to not only shoot lectures for the library - we want to make academic MOOC. <br><br>  Therefore, we shot and unmounted the first courses on our own to set the bar, although in the future we plan to post courses produced by universities. <br><br>  This is a small movie with cutting from different courses that we are preparing for publication.  Not trailers, namely educational videos.  They are made to be relevant (both in content and in the picture) and after 5 years. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MRnBntL-Ew%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhwX7BSvIVNvSpv1eqmWSjLCEvzlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  When is the launch? </h4><br>  We will look at the dynamics of registrations.  Part of the courses will be launched in May, part in the fall. <br><br><h4>  And who else will join? </h4><br>  We are planning up to 20 universities this year.  With some production courses have already begun, but not formalized relationship. <br>  How will it be possible to officially announce this - I will immediately write. <br><br><h4>  But there is an excellent course on SEO, personal efficiency and sales growth ... </h4><br>  Thank you, do not continue.  The lectorium for a gun shot does not allow business trainers to come along and deals only with serious educational content.  We work only with legal entities, all content is checked by expert advice. <br><br><h4>  And what about the media library? </h4><br>  Media Library will not throw.  We shot over 3000 lectures and will continue to develop this area.  The media library has completely different tasks. <br><br>  If you have any questions, write to the comments or email me at somov@239.ru.  I will answer all. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Jacob Somov <br>  director of Lectorium </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217615/</a></p>
