  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tightening of measures to regulate the runet has positively impacted the Safe Internet business.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russia is tightening measures to regulate the Internet.  However, for companies like Vitaly Sattarov's <a href="http://safeinet.ru/">“Secure Internet”</a> , this situation is only beneficial.  At the end of last year, eight medical students from the extremist organization ISIS were calculated in the Stavropol region.  Propaganda was carried out with the help of videos, special sites and communities in social networks.  The videos and the organization “ISIL” itself are included in the federal lists of extremist materials and banned in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  Since July 2012, the company has been a resident of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580)">Skolkovo</a> IT cluster.  In 2014, the revenue of “Secure Internet”, according to Sattarov, exceeded 30 million rubles.  The State Duma has adopted a series of laws on filtering Internet traffic.  The number of orders the company continues to grow. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In 2007, programmers Vitaly Sattarov and his partner Alexei Voronin left <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Rambler</a> , collected several hundred thousand dollars and opened the Safe Internet company.  “We used to work with big data and understood that this is a promising direction.  It became clear that you need to move in the telecom.  There are huge data arrays and many tasks that need to be solved, ”recalls Sattarov.

      The company has developed its own xTerrica DPI platform.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_packet_inspection">DPI</a> (from the English. Deep packet inspection) is a high-speed technology for the accumulation of statistical data, verification and filtering of network packets according to their contents.  According to Sattarov, there are almost no competitors in Russia who could analyze traffic at such speeds.  “And if they do, it will take them another two years to negotiate with major operators,” adds the entrepreneur. <br><br>  In 2010, a client appeared (the name of the company was not disclosed) on which it was possible to check the performance of the new system.  Internet traffic from all employees converged at one point.  The speed and amount of data were perfect for the test.  Sattarov says that at that time they were looking for access to similar companies at conferences, through acquaintances: “I was surprised then how easy it was to go from the street wherever you go.” <br><br>  The most difficult task was to reach large telecom operators.  Sattarov had no experience with such companies and could not get a contract.  Therefore, he began to offer cooperation to regional Internet providers almost for nothing. <br><br>  “If we knew in 2007 how hard it would be, then maybe we wouldn’t do it,” he admits. <br><br>  For several years, "Secure Internet" was content with small orders.  Then the company managed to attract an investor to continue development.  From 2010 to 2011, the Seed Investment Fund of the Russian Venture Company ( <a href="http://www.rusventure.ru/ru/investments/fpi">FPI RVK</a> ) invested about $ 1 million in the company (at the exchange rate of that time) in exchange for a 26% share.  “Information security is now in trend, our project“ Internet Security ”is a unique Russian development in this area.  Moreover, the solutions are much more efficient and cheaper than their foreign counterparts, ”said the representative of the RVC FPI. <br><br>  “They do not interfere in our work, but it became easier for us to participate in the negotiations.  We became their portfolio company, and not just a start-up, ”notes Sattarov. <br><br>  In 2012, deputies adopted a law on the blacklist of sites.  Since the company's system could analyze traffic, it could filter it, the developers reasoned.  Soon it was possible to sign the first major contract - with <a href="http://mgts.ru/">MGTS</a> , a subsidiary of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B">MTS</a> .  Since 2011, MGTS has been responsible for filtering traffic in schools.  “At first, we blocked sites on lists that were sent to us,” says Vadim Dolgov, who led the project on filtering the Internet in schools at MGTS.  But in 2012, the operator announced a competition to develop a filtration system for schools. <br><br>  According to Dolgov, about eight companies participated in the competition, including major Russian integrators - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei">Huawei</a> .  The winner was "Secure Internet".  “Their base copes better with sites on the Russian Internet, and the system of the same Huawei is more adapted to foreign resources,” explains Dolgov.  According to him, the traffic filtering system, which is now installed at MGTS, is estimated at hundreds of millions of rubles. <br><br>  In 2014, Secure Internet began working with all Moscow schools - these are 4,000 institutions.  In other regions, while competitors are working.  About 30,000 schools in the regions are provided by Rostelecom.  “We hold competitions at the level of our macro-regional branches, and the competition is quite high,” notes Alexander Karpuzikov, head of the product development and solutions department <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">at Rostelecom</a> .  There is no “safe Internet” among contractors.  “I have never heard of such a company,” says Dmitry Vostretsov, general director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SkyDNS">SkyDNS</a> , who won the competition in Buryatia.  In any case, her ability to filter traffic at super speeds is not a competitive advantage, since in schools the channel usually does not exceed 10 Gbit / s, he adds. <br><br>  Recently, the Safe Internet company launched an English-language website.  The company plans to enter foreign markets.  But everything is not so simple: without the support of a large operator, nothing will turn out.  “We need to at least do a joint project with a European company, I think we’ll manage it in a couple of years, <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/295721-pod-kolpakom-kto-stroit-biznes-na-regulirovanii-interneta%3Fpage%3D0,0">”</a> Sattarov <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/295721-pod-kolpakom-kto-stroit-biznes-na-regulirovanii-interneta%3Fpage%3D0,0">said</a> in an interview with Forbes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293302/</a></p>
