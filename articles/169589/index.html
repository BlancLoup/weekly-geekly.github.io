At the end of October of that year, the RT version was released, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhLOvm-hEE3o">review of</a> which we have already done.  A week ago, to the delight of users, Pro appeared on the market (and in my hands). <br><br>  And, apparently, Pro'Fessional Surface is professional only in hardware, since in many ways the novelty pumped up.  Although, not everything is as bad as it seems: Surface Pro has trumps up its sleeve ... <a name="habracut"></a>

Of these, the user is available 29 and 89 GB, respectively.  Many Western resources scolded Microsoft, but in my opinion there is no problem, so there is a slot for a MicroSD card. <br><br>  <b>Battery performance</b> <br><br>  Surface RT works for about 7-8 hours, Pro has slightly different results ... <br><br>  Playing FarCry 2 via HDMI (graphics: medium, 1080p) - 1.3 hours <br>  Surfing the web with Internet Explorer - 4.5 hours <br>  Work in Photoshop CS6 - 4 hours <br>  Work in Premiere Pro CS6 - 2.5 hours <br>  Watching a MKV movie (Remux) - 2 hours (and 30% charge left) <br><br>  <b>Screen quality</b> <br><br>  Apart from the fact that Surface Pro has an excellent screen with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (for RT 1366 at 768), it has twice more powerful backlighting in comparison with its counterpart.  In general, the screen resolution in tablets is already a philosophical topic, since in my opinion FullHD resolution is much more suitable for tablets with a 10-inch screen.  One good person wrote a very large and interesting article why 1920x1080 is better than 2048 √ó 1536.  <a href="http://www.ecoshop.biz/%3Faction%3Dreview-0222">[link]</a> <br><br>  <b>Speed ‚Äã‚Äãperformance</b> <br><br>  I used to use GeekBench 2, since it is universal: from Android from iOS to Windows. <br><br>  My result: 5432 points <br><br>  Here you can drive any device into the search (whether it is a laptop, tablet or phone) and see how many points it is gaining on the GeekBench 2 test. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I managed to do 3D benchmarks (and in fact, I just forgot). <br><br>  <b>Noise</b> <br><br>  Surface Pro has two coolers for cooling Intel Core i5, so there was a concern.  But it quickly passed when I worked in Photoshop for 2 hours.  The only time I heard the roar of the propellers was with Far Cry 2. <br>  At least, the Surface works much quieter than any of the MacBook Air. <br><br>  <b>Pen</b> <br><br>  The stylus is made by Wacom, it is convenient.  The only thing that is frustrating is that without him something is just uncomfortable ... but how well the words of Steve Jobs sounded: " <i>God gave us 10 styli, so let's not invent another one</i> ."  Invented. <br><br>  On this topic, you can always talk, but I will confine myself to the fact that I would call it a very convenient, but not understandable thing for me (like Surface itself). <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  To understand all the horrors and wonders of Surface Pro, I had to spend the whole week with him before we took the review.  The device is cool, but it's not ‚Äúa la iPad‚Äù and it's not an ultrabook.  I'm afraid to call Surface a tablet, so this is something third.  I find it difficult to name the classification, so in the House Surface it can be something new, a kind of device for dragging from table to table and for export to business meetings. <br><br>  I really liked the stylus, since I use Photoshop.  It really is more convenient than cool.  And usually all sorts of innovations do not give birth further.  Surface Pro is powerful, it is not thick (!), It is very elegant.  And he ... dear.  Still, it‚Äôs a pity to give $ 1000 for a new classification device, so Microsoft needs to strive for the price of the RT version and then I will buy it. <br><br>  Useful materials: <br><br>  - Another Surface Pro review on Habrahabr <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165357">[link]</a> <br>  - Ubuntu on Surface Pro <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169075/">[link]</a> <br>  - Review Surface RT on Habrahabr <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158613/">[link]</a> <br>  - Video review of Surface RT and the delights of the touch version of Windows 8 <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhLOvm-hEE3o">[link]</a> <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> <i>review and the article were ready yesterday evening, but the insertion from YouTube did not work on the site.</i> <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> <i>Friends, your best gratitude for the post - these are pluses in karma.</i>  <i>For the previous topic with an overview of the iPad 4 128 GB, I got a lot of minuses, and, apparently, because of the brand advertising, which is present at the end of our commercials.</i>  <i>But you must understand that any project requires funding and Rozetked was created in order to do the most high-quality and interesting video reviews in the CIS.</i>  <i>Moreover, many liked our reviews.</i>  <i>Therefore, before casting the author of the topic with minuses, think about your decision once again - after all, we post only to our blog, for which we donated a lot of money, and besides, no one has yet reviewed the full Surface Pro and at least interesting!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169589/</a></p>
