  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ideas and results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Correlation</strong> <br><br>  Once I noticed that there is a correlation between criticism and success.  The more intense the criticism, the more obviously the one who is criticized has set himself the higher task.  And the closer he is to the realization of his task, the less sincere and close he becomes to other people and the more his criticism. <br><br>  - Oh, he is such a fool, he does not listen to smart people, he doesn‚Äôt know what, his project will fail!

      And if he really fails, there is no end to happiness!  Here it is!  Done what they said!  They were not listened to and, behold, the project was bent!  Hurray comrades!  Once again proved that we were right! <br><br>  I tried to understand this phenomenon and realized that the problem is in the vision of the project‚Äôs goals and objectives that are usually set for themselves by one and the other. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The usual such criticism is people with their own and others' not realized ideas, hanging on sites like this, which are at the peak of progress.  Often, at first glance, they can be called "creative" or "ideological."  They gladly criticize the actions and actions of others ‚Äúnot as talented and creative‚Äù as they.  When you first meet them you think, oh my, what a smart and talented person this is, he has so many good ideas, because he is right! <br><br>  <strong>Success</strong> <br><br>  Here you need to decide who such a successful person.  This is the person who performs the task.  Will this task be earning money, discovering something, launching something.  Never mind.  The important thing is that the task is completed.  The more often he performs tasks, the more successful he is.  The clearer the task is posed, the clearer and less its solution is tied to the ‚Äúslope‚Äù, but the closer it is. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúA creative person with ideas‚Äù pays too much attention to details.</strong> <br><br>  Yes, the details are important, even very, but as long as they meet the requirements of the task.  And if the task is to open a club for 10 million and return the money in 2 years.  That, in case it is executed, it does not matter if the speakers in this club are bought at market prices or 50% more expensive.  The main thing that did not go beyond the budget and beat off.  And in order to solve this problem you need to do a lot of hard work.  Not one person is able to go deep into each area and understand it.  Yes, he is not worth such a task, to understand the little things. <br>  His task is different. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúCreative people with ideas‚Äù do something mainly to be appreciated.</strong> <br><br>  If they start a project and involve some people in it, they do it not to have interesting, well-paid work for these people and not to release a new, unique, very necessary and useful product for the consumer. .  Not.  They do this so that friends say: - you are awesome! <br><br>  They call it "self-realization." <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúCreative people with ideas‚Äù are very afraid of failures and mistakes.</strong> <br><br>  The secret of success in any field, from business to creating works of art, is that, in addition to a clear understanding of the purpose of your actions, you have to love mistakes, the more and more you fall for it, the more experience you have and the further you will progress endeavor. <br><br>  Creative people are so afraid of mistakes that they either simply start nothing, leaving all plans at the level of evening chatter with friends (read the discussion on Habr√©) or, having made a mistake, stubbornly do not want to admit it.  The problem here is that if you do not admit to yourself an error, for example, to refer to external circumstances, it means to commit it for nothing, without taking any benefit from it for your business. <br><br>  By the way, ideas are always more beautiful than implementation.  When it comes down to business, you are drowning in the details and forced to want or not to leave things to chance or delegate them to other people.  Therefore, the result will always not be as chic as an idea, but, more often, with time, it can be corrected. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúCreative people with ideas‚Äù are afraid not only of failures, but also of success.</strong> <br><br>  In fact, they, all the same, are afraid to screw it up.  Therefore, when success is close - they jump off the horse into the bushes, because they are afraid that jumping into the arena at full gallop will fall in front of the entire public. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúCreative people with ideas‚Äù believe that the whole secret of other people's success is in money.</strong> <br><br>  Not wanting to delve into their beloved, they are trying to explain the success of other people with imaginary random facts.  In the fact that these other people have money, that's why they succeed, but in general they are fools and with their money one could do everything better.  Creative people do not understand that money is not taken from the sky, money can also be a goal and can be earned, you just need to work for it, and not talk about success, not luck, and how it could be done better. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúCreative people with ideas‚Äù refuse to work for money, explaining that they are not for sale.</strong> <br><br>  In fact, they simply do not know how to work.  Working for an uncle is always easier than for yourself - in this case you have less responsibility for the result.  They are afraid that they will be demanded.  And unless you implement something for yourself you should not be demanding?  Shouldn't you at least learn and see what it really demands?  Otherwise, there is not any difference for whom you work, if you know how to complete the job.  If you do not know how to bring it for others for money, you cannot do it all the more for yourself. <br><br>  <strong>"Creative people with ideas" do not finish their projects to the end.</strong> <br><br>  When they do decide to do something definite, they make it 80-90%, but then they throw it.  This is because they balance to the point of painful self-doubt and manic-paranoid stellar disease.  Having done some kind of project for 90%, on the one hand, they satisfy their star disease, because they did something and this is something cool, everybody talks about them again, but they don‚Äôt finish it completely, because they don‚Äôt really believe in the fact that it is in general necessary for someone and that it will be noticed by someone, that is why they don‚Äôt want to spend time on routine tinkering and error correction. <br><br>  <strong>Summary</strong> <br><br>  If you recognize yourself or your friend in this text and you are really interested in the question of how to get rid of these shortcomings, here are the rules that I made for myself to embody ideas with a 99 percent result and finish my business to the end: <br><br>  1. Explain clearly, on paper, the purpose of the project.  Honestly admit to myself why I need it.  For the sake of money, for the sake of glory, for the sake of being to try, for the sake of study, for the sake of a woman, for the sake of power.  It doesn‚Äôt matter, it‚Äôs only important to honestly admit to yourself why I am doing this and what results I want to achieve.  Also clearly understand why this project is needed by my partner, employee, colleague. <br>  2. Spend time and as efficiently as possible assess what needs to be done, what means to have and how much time to spend on this project.  Will I need the result of this project for such a price? <br>  3. Determine what I will lose and what I will not be able to do while I will be engaged in the implementation of this project.  Again, I appreciate whether I am willing to pay such a price for the expected result? <br>  4. Do not whistle about the project to anyone except the persons directly involved in it.  This allows you to have inside a compressed springtime cool idea about which you want to tell the whole world so much!  But the best way to tell the whole world about it is to realize it. <br>  5. Most importantly.  I open the secret.  In fact, there are plenty of ideas.  The problem is in their implementation.  Yes, you often meet people with no ideas.  They are so long engaged in the fact that they bring things to the end, that they no longer have time for distracting fantasies, so they try, if necessary, to attract you, so as not to clog your brains with all sorts of crap, and use your meanders wandering in chaos of thoughts.  But the point is not in ideas and you most likely do not possess anything special, you just allow delirium to take place in your head and in this delirium good ideas periodically boil and drown.  There is no point in the idea, unless you finally get its embodiment.  And now there is a full internet of ideas, I don‚Äôt want to do it! <br><br>  That's all, I wish you good luck in the implementation of your ideas! <br><br>  PS As you understand the term ‚Äúcreative people with ideas‚Äù is quite conditional - I can‚Äôt find a better one.  Contrasting their results even more conditional.  :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26851/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26851/</a></p>
