      The conflict between the United States and China has a negative effect on Huawei‚Äôs business.  The company is gradually losing access to the most important resource developers.  For example, to the intellectual property of different American companies. <br><br>  So, in the future, the company <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453426/">will not be able to release their phones with a microSD memory card module</a> .  The reason is a one-sided breakup of the SD Association and the Chinese company.  Thus, Huawei will be forced to exclude a slot from all of its smartphones, including the 2019 Mate line, Honor line, and others. <br><br>  In addition, the company was removed from the list of members of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which prevents it from participating in the development of new wireless technologies within this organization. <br><br><h3>  Runet bypassed television both in terms of profitability and audience reach </h3><br>  The Russian segment of the Internet is gradually growing.  On the daily reach of the audience, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453984/">Runet has already bypassed TV</a> .  True, the TV channels still have a more extensive monthly and weekly audience than the Runet, but there is no doubt that the Internet will soon pass over TV in this. <br><br>  Plus, television has already lost the status of the most profitable media in Russia.  According to experts, last year Internet companies earned about 203 billion rubles from advertising, and television channels - 187 billion. In the first quarter of this year, television advertising revenues decreased by 6%, which will probably allow the Internet to get ahead even more. <br><br><h3>  New ARM processors for mobile devices </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b0/8a6/825/1b08a68256b452ff51cb0f329674020e.jpg"><br><br>  The British company ARM has announced <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453954/">new processors for mobile devices</a> .  These are the Cortex-A77 processor, the Mali-G77 video accelerator and the ARM ML neural processor (NPU).  The company said that the new chips are designed for high-end phones, 5G and IoT gadgets, autopilot machines, for the operation of neural networks and for performing artificial intelligence tasks. <br><br><h3>  Quantum phone for 30 million rubles </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/550/01b/719/55001b719f023f46563967867cb704a4.jpg"><br><br>  The company Infotex and the Center for Quantum Technologies of Moscow State University <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453922/">presented the first telephone in Russia with quantum communication protection</a> .  The device works as an IP phone that is connected to the quantum key distribution client and the server. <br><br>  Serial production of such phones will begin by the end of this year.  The company plans to sell its device to large corporations.  The fact is that the cost of the system starts from 30 million rubles.  The basic set includes a server and two terminals.  One of the potential customers of such a communication system is Sberbank. <br><br><h3>  The size of earnings is determined by genetics. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/741/05f/a26/74105fa269ffcee7d8e24ba720b9b627.png"><br><br>  A study of Finnish sociologists shows that heredity <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/453856/">affects the level of a person‚Äôs earnings</a> .  According to the results, it became clear that for women, genetic characteristics determine their income by 40%, for men - by more than 50%. <br><br>  The researchers analyzed the financial situation of a large group of identical and fraternal twins.  It is worth noting that it was the twins who became the usual object of observation in sociology for scientists.  They can very clearly demonstrate the role of congenital signs in comparison with acquired. <br><br>  Despite the fact that much depends on genetics, scientists emphasize that the genetic conditionality of socio-economic inequality does not make it insurmountable. <br><br><h3>  Software engineers and DevOps specialists get the most </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46f/27f/729/46f27f729ccae21061170670591baa96.jpg"><br><br>  Experts Stack Overflow studied the working conditions of 90 thousand developers around the world. <br><br>  It turned out that software engineers and DevOps specialists get the most: <br><br><ul><li>  Lead Software Engineer (Engineering Manager) - $ 95 thousand per year; </li><li>  Software Resiliency Engineer (Site Reliability Engineer) - $ 85 thousand per year; </li><li>  DevOps-specialist - $ 71 thousand per year; </li><li>  software engineer for working with data (Data Engineer) - $ 66 thousand per year; </li><li>  data scientist / machine learning specialist - $ 61 thousand per year; </li><li>  data analyst / Business analyst - $ 59 thousand per year; </li><li>  software developer for embedded devices and applications - $ 57 thousand per year; </li><li>  full-stack developer - $ 57 thousand per year; </li><li>  backend developer - $ 56 thousand per year; </li><li>  Developer of corporate applications - $ 56 thousand per year. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454372/</a></p>
