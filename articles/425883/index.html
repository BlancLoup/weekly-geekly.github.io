      - I already told you everything.  - Gena entered uncertainly.  - What else do I need from me? <br><br>  - Your versions do not converge.  - shrug Semyon.  - Gennady blames Peter and his closest aides.  How did you say there?  Tops? <br><br>  - Yes, tops.  The fish rots from the head.  - nodded Gena. <br><br>  - What the fuck fish?  - Peter was outraged. <br><br>  - So, stop!  - slammed the table with his hand Semen.  - Quiet!  I ask the questions here!  This is my property sunk into oblivion!  And I will figure out who is to blame!  I arrange you a confrontation! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Isn't it obvious?  - Gena plucked up courage.  - Whatever down there doesn’t happen, the one who is above is always to blame. <br><br>  - In general, yes.  - nodded Semyon, a little calmer.  - Of course, it would be more convenient for me to simply blame Peter, our captain, for everything.  But I, besides Titanic, still have someone to surf the oceans, red and blue, and my first and most important goal is to understand the true reasons in order to prevent such a development of events. <br><br>  - Absolutely!  - supported Peter.  “Anyway, you won’t return the lost, and we are left with ...” <br><br>  - us?  - I understood eyebrows Semyon.  - And here you are, in general? <br><br>  - Well, what about ... - Peter began to fuss.  - Is it ... <br><br>  “Not really, dear.”  - frowned Semyon.  - The question of why you now get up at the helm is far from being resolved.  So sit and shut up until I ask you a question. <br><br>  “Sorry, of course, but if ...” Peter leaned forward. <br><br>  “No ifs.”  - firmly answered Semyon.  - Our town is small, port.  I know all the owners personally.  If you decide to go to someone else, I will provide you with such a reputation that you will sweep the pier.  It is clear? <br><br>  - I see.  - Peter smiled.  - As you wish, Semen Arkadyevich. <br><br>  - This concerns you, Gennady.  - Semyon pretended not to notice the irony.  - Clear? <br><br>  - Clear.  - shrugged Gena, who had time to calm down a bit.  - Just me shit. <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - I will go to another industry.  - Gene smiled.  - At the shipyard.  My acquaintance works as my boss there, he promised to take me to his place. <br><br>  - And what will you do there, let me ask?  - smiled in response Semen. <br><br>  - The equipment, as here.  - shrugged Gena.  - What is the difference?  What's on the Titanic, what's in the factory - everywhere equipment, wires, electricity.  I do not care. <br><br>  - By the way, about the equipment.  - Semyon began to stir the papers lying on the table.  - So, where is it ... And here!  Your report about problems with the equipment.  So? <br><br>  - So.  - Gena answered, looking at the papers.  “I compiled it when I discovered problems.”  It was necessary to purchase ... <br><br>  - Stop.  - Semen raised his hand and turned to Peter.  - Peter, have you seen this paper? <br><br>  - No, for the first time I see.  - fiercely shook his head Peter.  - Gena, what is it? <br><br>  - Well, there were problems with electricity.  - Gena answered uncertainly.  - I did everything I could, but I needed a stabilizer. <br><br>  - Why do I find out about it just now?  - cried Peter.  - What are you, the creature, hid from me problems with the equipment? <br><br>  “I ... I ...” Gena began to stutter. <br><br>  - What am I?  Shouted Peter.  - Head from the buoy! <br><br>  - So quiet.  - strictly said Semyon.  “Gena, why didn't the piece of paper reach the captain?” <br><br>  - I… <br><br>  - Bitch you!  - Peter shouted and turned away, unable to restrain emotions. <br><br>  - Quiet, I said!  - raised his voice Semyon.  - Gene, answer. <br><br>  - There has never been a reaction to these papers.  - quietly muttered Gena.  “I've been working for Titanic for a long time, and I know ...” <br><br>  - What do you know there, nit?  - Peter turned back.  - Your business is small!  Found a problem - fix it!  You can not - call someone who can!  You need to buy something - you turn to me! <br><br>  - Yes, I sense something from you ... - muttered Gene. <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - Go to hell, got it already!  - Gene cried out unexpectedly for everyone.  “You sit there upstairs, you don't know a damn thing and you don't want to know!”  I have written to you how many of these papers?  BUT?  What are you doing with them?  Wipe your ass? <br><br>  - Bitch, yes, I love you ... - Peter jumped off the spot. <br><br>  - What are you me?  - Gene also jumped up.  - Come on, come here ... <br><br>  Peter suddenly froze on the spot - apparently appreciated the build of Gennady, who was one and a half times more, in all senses. <br><br>  - Well, what, piss?  - shouted Gena. <br><br>  - Sit down both.  - strictly said Semyon, saving the situation and Peter.  - Peter, is that true?  About the paper. <br><br>  - Of course not.  - Peter answered in a conciliatory tone.  “It may seem to you there, from below, that I use your pieces of paper ... Well ... I use it not for its intended purpose.”  But it is not.  Just you understand, Gena ... <br><br>  - What should I understand?  - Genes' aggression has not yet died away, but he sat down in his place. <br><br>  - There are many of you, I'm alone, that's what I understand.  - continued Peter.  - I try ... That is, I tried to respond to all the problems and ideas that the team means, but ... I'm tired, Gena.  Here you are, of course, well done, business usually says, and the rest? <br><br>  - And where does the rest?  - frowned Gena. <br><br>  - Besides, you are not the only one with papers.  Do you understand?  I zadolbalsya, honestly, to understand them.  Sometimes after all such nonsense will be written, even if you stay, at least fall.  And everyone needs to answer something, take some measures, at least make up the appearance, pat him on the shoulder.  Do you know how people react to patting on the shoulder? <br><br>  - How? <br><br>  - Begin to generate these pieces of paper with crazy speed.  - Petr complained.  - There are so many of them that I have no time to steer.  That's why I ... Well, I stopped paying so much attention to them. <br><br>  “Yeah, and they didn’t know about the leak ...” Gena smiled. <br><br>  - Leak?  What flow?  - entered Semyon. <br><br>  - Yes, Serega saw a leak, for a long time.  - shrugged Gena.  - I told him - go, report, idiot. <br><br>  - And what is he?  - frowned Semyon. <br><br>  - Nothing.  - frivolously answered Gena.  - What is the use of something?  If he won, he stopped paying so much attention to them ... <br><br>  - But this is a leak!  - outraged Semen. <br><br>  - Yes, it was small ... - confused Gene.  “The Titanic didn’t go down to the bottom because of this leak, that's for sure.” <br><br>  - Wait ... - shook his index finger Semyon.  - A lot more information?  Well, about leaks or something like that. <br><br>  - Dohrena.  - nodded Gena.  - Only no one delivers her particularly upstairs. <br><br>  - Why? <br><br>  - What's the point?  - shrugged Gena.  - If something serious, we repair ourselves, well, or there, if the threat is serious - we don’t want to stay without work - then we report.  And if, let's say, we see, well ... Not a very serious problem, or we know how to do it better, so in general ... <br><br>  - What is it?  - Namupil eyebrows Semyon. <br><br>  - Nothing.  - answered Gena.  - Tops once.  You come to them, as if you are asking for something ...  Well, why the hell do we need it? <br><br>  - What is wrong with you, huh?  - indignantly threw up his hands Peter.  - One fucking piece of paper you did not read, and all?  Had a bad temper like a young lady?  Sit down, pour tears?  Are you a man, damn it, or who? <br><br>  - Behind you.  - with a serious look answered Gena.  - I told you, no one will run to you once again.  Think why. <br><br>  - Well tell me.  - Peter depicted a willingness to listen. <br><br>  - Why do you know something ... You do not know this.  - quietly answered Gena.  - You treat people like cattle.  I sat down at my height, afraid to get dirty, I wanted to shit on the team.  I know ... <br><br>  - Yes, what do you know there, huh?  - Peter was outraged.  - Where does this opinion come from?  Who did I want to shit, huh?  Well?  Have you ever seen me yell at someone?  Or humiliated a team member? <br><br>  - Yes, all of you, directors, are the same.  - Gena waved his hand. <br><br>  - Listen, you're like a kid.  - said maliciously Peter.  - All the directors are the same, all the women ... Well, then you know.  You yourself get up, try to manage a company like Titanic Plus!  BUT?  You think, since you are a system administrator, is it smarter than everyone else?  And there is nothing more complicated than your servers and equipment? <br><br>  - Well, I'm telling you.  - Gene smiled.  - I'm the boss, you're a fool.  On the contrary, that is. <br><br>  - Yes, and here it is!  - Peter threw up his hands.  - Every job is important and necessary!  And yours, and mine!  The only difference is that I have to solve all the questions!  Do you understand?  Everything!  And not only yours, or Seregins, or anyone else there ... But I cannot do this work if I do not know about the problems on the ground! <br><br>  - Well, it can be seen.  - with a smile nodded Gena. <br><br>  - Listen, Gennady.  - entered Semyon.  - Peter is right in many ways.  You, of course, well done, keep confident, and in general the guy is imposing, surely you are popular with girls. <br><br>  - It is what it is.  - with an idiotic smile answered Gena. <br><br>  - Only this is not enough.  - strictly answered Semyon.  - You are responsible for the entrusted site.  Just like on the rest of the team.  Each stands in its place.  Everyone is important and needed.  But this does not mean that information should be kept in itself. <br><br>  “Yes, I said the same ...” began Gena. <br><br>  - I heard what you said.  - interrupted Semyon.  - And this is just baby talk.  All the directors are bad, alone you are good down there.  And therefore we will not say anything to anyone, otherwise we will be sent to hell.  I, you know, was not born the owner of a group of companies, I also started from the bottom.  Do you know how I became director? <br><br>  - Not.  - Gena answered uncertainly. <br><br>  - Head from the ass once pulled out.  - continued Semyon.  - Or tongue from ass.  And he began to talk.  About the problems of development, ideas began to offer.  At the same time he pulled his hands out of his pockets, and began to work - to realize his ideas.  I didn’t scream that the boss couldn’t hear me, or send me, or make me do it myself. <br><br>  - Your position is comfortable.  - continued Semyon.  - Now here, in the confrontation, you're done.  You know everything, about all the problems in the course, but what's the point?  Where have you been before? <br><br>  - I am ... <br><br>  - Yes, garbage is all you listen to yourself.  - hard answered Semyon.  - Sit, mold me patterns here, like a politician on TV.  Do not listen to you, do not understand you.  But you're in chocolate - and you have ideas, and your hands are not from your ass.  You sit like that mountain that does not want to go to Mahomet.  Ask you - tell me where some problems.  Do not ask - can not be said. <br><br>  “No, no,” Gena began. <br><br>  - Yes, Gena.  - again interrupted Semyon, more and more burning.  - Who do you think you are, anyway? <br><br>  “I didn’t think of myself as anyone ...” muttered Gena. <br><br>  - No not like this.  - Suddenly smiled Semyon.  - You think you are nobody.  And you live in any way.  And all your life you will be nothing.  Because you are an infantile fool, excuse me.  You still think the world is spinning around you. <br><br>  “No, I don’t think so, I ...” Gene tried again to insert at least a word. <br><br>  - Yes, I know.  - waved a hand Semen.  - It was such a person.  Eternal insult to the whole world.  Guilt towards yourself.  And with a sense of guilt to live oh, how uncomfortable, here and hide for irony - like I'm such a specialist here, such a specialist.  The director himself should bow to me in the legs so that I could at least say something to him, or, God forbid, tell me his Idea (on this word, Semyon raised his index finger above his head)! <br><br>  - What did you do!  - could not resist Gena.  - I'm not like that!  I want the company to develop, just like you! <br><br>  - Why don't you do anything then?  - smiled Semyon.  - You just sit and scratch your ChSV, how clever you are, and the rest - shit on a stick.  You go to work, just to stand aside and laugh.  Just like for the rest of your life, you look at the country, the city, your yard.  You look and think, or even chatting sometimes, somewhere on the Internet, how all these morons got you.  Everything is to blame, you're the only D'Artagnan. <br><br>  “Well, Semyon Arkadyevich ...” Peter entered.  - Gene, in general, a good admin.  When you say it, it does everything on time and efficiently. <br><br>  - That's right, "when you say."  - nodded Simon.  - All such.  When you say - they will.  When you do not say, they will not do it.  And how do you, director, say if you have no idea where any problems are? <br><br>  - Well, I hold regular meetings, ask people about the problems.  - Peter shrugged. <br><br>  - Well, and tell you a lot of problems?  - smiled Semyon. <br><br>  - No, not really.  - answered Peter.  - So, on the little things.  Usually they say "there are no problems, everything is solved in working order." <br><br>  “Doesn't the very necessity of holding these meetings bother you?”  - asked Semyon. <br><br>  - In terms of?  - did not understand Peter.  - What about no meetings? <br><br>  - How much time do you spend on meetings?  - Simon leaned forward. <br><br>  - Well ... In different ways ... It happens all day. <br><br>  - Do you spend all day trying to catch information about problems?  - smiled Semyon. <br><br>  - Well, yes ... No, not necessarily.  - Peter hesitated.  - Sometimes we discuss development ideas, projects ... <br><br>  - How does it look?  "Well, tell me your ideas for the development of the company"? <br><br>  - Something like that.  - Peter nodded.  - Not everyone is constantly in the context of development, it is necessary to immerse in order ... <br><br>  - Whom immerse, Petya?  - laughed Simon.  - It is necessary to immerse you!  They all cook in these problems all the time, and everyone knows about them!  They have plenty of ideas on how to do better, more optimally, faster!  Only they do not tell you about it!  You have to pull this information out of them with ticks. <br><br>  - Why?  - Peter frowned. <br><br>  - Why, the hell knows why.  - Semyon suddenly became serious.  - So, if in a simple way to answer, everyone's head is in the ass.  Or the head and ass are confused in some places, forgive my French. <br><br>  - In terms of?  - Peter was perplexed. <br><br>  - Yes, in direct.  Inversion of life values, or more precisely - workers.  - continued Semyon.  - Gena, how do you feel about tasks? <br><br>  - Well, how ... I do.  - answered Gena. <br><br>  - No, I'm not talking about that.  Not what you do with them, but how do you treat them. <br><br>  - I relate?  - Gene did not understand the question.  - Well, as ... It is necessary, it means it is necessary. <br><br>  - Here!  - smiled Semyon.  - For you, the task is hemorrhoids.  This is problem.  It is necessary to tinker with it, to think, to move.  Much better able to be homeostasis, when nothing happens, energy is saved and you can live on.  Calm, confident, like in a swamp.  And from the tasks you need to run, and away. <br><br>  - Therefore, Peter, you and the meeting are so boring.  - continued Semyon.  - People are afraid of tasks.  And how to avoid tasks?  Mum in a rag!  Answer that everything is good in your department!  You can’t complain to any of your colleagues, otherwise you will respond as if goes around comes around - you press, you are pressed, and a waterfall of tasks begins. <br><br>  - I understood.  - Peter nodded.  - You probably have the answer, what to do? <br><br>  - The answer is, but what's the point ... - Simon spread his hands.  - Truth, axiom, you can not think of anything easier.  Any challenge is an opportunity.  This is a train that passes by the provincial station where you are stuck.  If you take the train, you will reach the next station.  Or to the end, where you wanted there.  If you don't sit down, you will remain in your backwater with smelly pasties and a dirty apron.  And what are you doing with these trains? <br><br>  - What?  - Peter asked with interest. <br><br>  - Nothing, as a rule.  - shrug Semyon.  “As you see the train, you run and hide.”  And if the machinist does notice you anyway, or the head of the train station pushes you into the train, you immediately turn sour, complain about fate, sit down in the vestibule somewhere near the exit, and dump it at the very first station.  To be in the next outback. <br><br>  - I understood the metaphor.  - Peter nodded. <br><br>  - A sense of something ... - waved Semen.  - Understand everything, make units.  You, Gena, by the way, what do you think? <br><br>  - I think, Semen Arkadyevich, in vain you so rarely visit us.  - with a pleasant smile answered Gena. <br><br>  - Yes, right now, and there is nowhere to be.  - laughed Simon.  - Pissed on the Titanic, mediocrity. <br>  Peter and Gena smiled nervously. <br><br>  - Okay.  - still smiling, continued Semyon.  - In the end, figured out.  All are guilty, no one is to blame.  Let me be guilty, to hell with him.  We will assume that, even though I am standing at a beautiful train station in the VIP zone, a smart, high-speed, mind-blowing train drove me to me.  And you know what? <br><br>  - What?  - uncertain asked Peter. <br><br>  - I'll sit in it!  - loudly said Semyon.  - And I will reach the final!  Are you with me? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425883/</a></p>
