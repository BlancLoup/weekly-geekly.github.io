  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelance: reboot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We're glad to share the good news: we have returned to the regular work on updating Freelance.  In recent months, we have accumulated a lot of technical and moral debts to our users, we will try to settle with them as soon as possible and transfer the service to a new technological structure.  In the meantime, we re-assembled Freelance under a new scheme, worked a little on user reputations and corrected the logic of working with orders and performers.  Further, everything in order in detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76a/3d7/843/76a3d7843c4746039751c7abdaa0e2e5.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  New scheme "Freelansima" </h4><br>  We started with the fact that we re-assembled ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù in the same way that we had been refining the last year on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù.  After all, the logic of "Freelance" is very similar to the logic of "My Circle": both there and there are announcements with the help of which they collect responses from interested applicants and then choose the most suitable one.  Both of the same service are used by the same people from the Habra community: so why should they learn to use our services twice if it's easier to simply transfer their experience from one service to another?  In the end, we, as developers, are easier to maintain one single standard and not produce unnecessary entities. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù scheme proved to be quite worthy: the users of this service practically do not ask questions about how everything works, and their activity has increased by a factor of two and a half.

We have a main menu with the main sections - jobs / orders, specialists / freelancers.  There is a user menu, divided into a menu for the employer / customer, and a menu for the applicant / performer.  Separately, there is a user's personal account, which is accessible only to him and with the help of which he manages all his data and activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/521/7ce/c99/5217cec99ebe4cd6b2543f314d45856f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We decided not to touch the styles of the service elements ourselves yet, leave them as they are.  Some styles borrowed from "My Circle".  If we change them, then gradually, this is not the most important thing, in our opinion. <br><br><h4>  User reputations </h4><br>  Then we took the first step towards working with user reputations.  After all, when it comes to performing a one-time order, it is very important to be able to trust each other.  The customer must be sure that the chosen performer will do everything qualitatively and on time, and for the contractor it is important that the customer does not go beyond the outlined tasks and, when performed, will immediately pay for the work done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20a/a74/c5d/20aa74c5d3cb46efbdc17e28ef130458.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We started with the fact that we clearly divided two roles in which users of ‚ÄúFreelansima‚Äù can act: they can be both customers and performers. <br><br><ol><li>  For each user, we derived the history of his orders: now you can see which orders the user placed and which he carried out;  it is also now clear that those with whom he negotiated about these orders speak about these orders (the latter is in the draft so far). </li><li>  We completely abandoned anonymous orders: before responding, you should always be able to find out in detail who the customer is, what is its history of past interactions with the service. </li><li>  The user menu is divided into the menu for the customer and the menu for the artist, as well as the personal account. </li></ol><br><h4>  New order logic </h4><br>  The display of user history dictated the new logic of work with the placement of orders. <br><br>  Previously, all orders for which the performer was located were hidden in drafts and became completely inaccessible to everyone except the author of the order.  Now orders with the performer are moved to the order archive.  However, they disappear from the search, but remain available in the profiles of the customer and performer. <br><br>  Previously, if a user had a subscription to a service, then all of his current orders were automatically hidden in the draft.  Now they just disappear from the search until the subscription is paid again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/934/b6e/db9934b6e8864a5587fb96222206dd3a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  What we plan to do next is to finally transfer the portfolio from Brainstorage to Freelance and make a complete system for working with the portfolio on the ordering service itself.  We understand that this is perhaps the most unpleasant thing that our users face and we very much regret not having solved this problem for so long.  We promise to fix it. <br><br>  Next, we plan to deploy our own feedback system about each other on ‚ÄúFreelansime‚Äù.  Now, as in the situation with the portfolio, reviews can be left on Brainstorage, and then only imported to Freelance.  We will fix this, and still try to make the reviews related to those specific orders in which the user participated. <br><br>  <b>This is all the news so far, good luck in your search for interesting orders and professional performers!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305864/</a></p>
