The population is two times smaller than it currently lives in Moscow.  But this did not prevent them from giving the world Ikea, H &amp; M, Volvo, Saab, Ericsson and Carlson. <br><br>  And also a wonderful company Axis Communications is from Sweden, or simply <a href="http://www.axis.com/">Axis</a> .  It does not need an introduction for those who are familiar with the IP video surveillance market.  At least because in 1996, Axis released the world's first IP camera. <a name="habracut"></a>

As technologically (analog cameras at that time gave significantly better quality), and by architecture.  If now the vast majority of IP cameras use the embedded Linux version on board, then the world's first IP camera contained a very simplified custom implementation of a web server without using Linux.  But be that as it may, this was the first and very important step in replacing analog video surveillance with IP.  In my opinion, this is comparable with the appearance of the first digital camera, which marked the beginning of the end of the largest Kodak corporation, which stubbornly did not notice the digital revolution in progress.  And, for sure, seeing the high cost and low quality of the first ‚Äúsoap cases‚Äù - underestimated the situation.  And then, with a capitalization of almost $ 40 billion, it rapidly fell to zero. <br><br>  Interestingly, the history of the Axis company itself begins in 1984.  At first, she specialized in the development of print servers, which she successfully engaged in for more than 10 years.  And then, since the release of the first IP camera in 1996, there was a shift towards the then new IP video surveillance market, which was partly created by Axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/daf/f68/8a3/daff688a3b5cb5f304ce85fb763fded2.jpg"><br><br>  Modern Axis cameras are based on a proprietary chip designed specifically for working with video.  This is a symbiosis of processors based on RISC architecture and DSP.  By controlling the production of hardware and software, Axis engineers were able to achieve truly unparalleled image quality with maximum compression.  Thanks to this, Axis confidently maintains its status as an industry leader, setting the trend for other manufacturers of IP-cameras and participating in the formation of standards. <br><br>  And now, Axis cameras support working with our <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/">Ivideon</a> cloud-based video surveillance <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/">service</a> .  Together with Axis, we managed to port our module for two generations of ARTPEC-3 and ARTPEC-4 processors used in cameras.  So for their work with the cloud, Ivideon no longer needs a computer and an external IP address.  Our application installed in the camera independently communicates with one of our data centers and makes the camera available in your <a href="https://my.ivideon.com/">Ivideon account</a> or in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client">Android</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/en/app/ivideon/id464234175%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86a/1b0/9e4/86a1b09e4c40ad59d1afa572c1939d08.png"><br><br>  Axis cameras have a very high quality motion detector and some video analytics functions.  So in the video archive you will see only really important events, and not a huge number of false positives due to the matrix noise and low light.  Naturally, Ivideon supports the function of pre-recording, which will allow you to see the moment of occurrence of the event, and not just what happened after it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb3/5c1/9d5/eb35c19d5fa326c0f9004df04ecbece2.jpg"><br><br>  Some models have an SD card slot.  So videotapes can be stored not only in our cloud, but also duplicated locally, in case of disconnection from the Internet.  Thus, it turns out a hybrid and centralized and decentralized surveillance systems. <br><br>  But the most important thing for the sake of which it is worth stopping your choice on Axis cameras is to stream live video on your website or in your blog using <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/kak-vstroit-zhivoe-video-v-vash-blog-ili-sajt/">Ivideon</a> .  If you want to show a really high-quality image, especially in conditions of changing light, then you are unlikely to find better equipment than what Axis offers. <br><br>  Here is an example of the broadcast camera <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/v1/%3Fserver%3Dc592677aaef5fee3c85f9112097ffbea%26camera%3D589824%26lang%3Den">Axis from the office of our partner in Kiev</a> . <br><br>  We are very proud of the fact that Ivideon‚Äôs development was highly appreciated by Axis, which was reflected in the productive collaboration on integrating Ivideon into camera firmware.  Despite the fact that Axis is already a corporation with offices in more than 20 countries of the world, it is very great that it has not lost its desire for development and innovation, confirming this not only in advertising directories, but also in practice. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> A question was asked in the comments.  <i>And what exactly is the "integration of Ivideon in camera firmware"?</i> <br><br>  The vast majority of IP cameras present in the market are poorly adapted to work via the Internet, that is, if you connect such a camera at home / in the office, it will take a lot of effort to watch it, for example, remotely on an iPad.  Configure an external IP address on it (often, you need to buy one).  If the camera is connected to the router - set the redirection of the dedicated port on the router to the camera.  If the camera operates using the RTSP protocol (in fact, all cameras are encoded in H264 or MPEG4), then there is a possibility that it can function only over UDP (not all manufacturers implement over TCP).  This means that your provider or other providers may ‚Äúcut‚Äù UDP traffic on their way to you and you will receive not a video, but a set of colored / gray squares.  In addition, there is no question about any encryption.  All traffic is in clear.  And in general, it is not convenient to ‚Äúlog in‚Äù even to 2 cameras by IP address. <br><br>  Therefore, we have created a special module - an application for IP cameras, which is installed directly into the firmware and serves as a client for our cloud service.  After <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/podkljychenie-kamer/">personalization</a> (camera bindings to your personal account), our module itself establishes a secure SSL connection with the nearest datacenter and waits to receive further commands.  These can be commands for requesting live video, a list of archived recordings (if there is an SD card in the camera), the archived recordings themselves, receiving information from the built-in motion detection or alarm inputs for recording to a remote archive and others.  In fact, this is just an embedded version of Ivideon Server, which is available on our website <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/programma-videonabljudenija/">for Windows, OS X and Linux platforms.</a> <br><br>  What is the complexity of integration?  First of all, to solve this problem, we need the tools and the SDK to build our module for the specific chip used in the camera.  Not all manufacturers are ready to provide such tools and access to the camera so that we can install our application in the firmware.  Therefore, it is doubly great that the leader of the industry, not only quickly provided everything necessary, but also consulted and helped in every way during the development process.  In addition, each manufacturer in its own way implements the interface of interaction with a motion detector built into the camera and for obtaining additional information.  We needed to write an implementation for Axis in accordance with the documents they also provided. <br><br>  As a result, in addition to our cloud service Ivideon, in addition to the standard functions of surveillance systems, the Axis camera has the following features: <br><br>  - no need for external / static IP address <br>  - connection of all cameras scattered geographically in a single personal account <br>  - location of cameras on the map <br>  - ease of connection and convenience of work.  No need to drive in IP-addresses of cameras, for example, on the iPad.  Their list will be downloaded from your personal account when you enter your e-mail and password after installing the application. <br>  - the ability to remotely view from anywhere in the world on our website in your personal account of live video and archive with sound (as well as on Android, iPhone and iPad) <br>  - the ability to export recording from any camera to AVI without going to the place <br>  - video recording service in our cloud (if something happens on the site, your recordings will not go anywhere) <br>  - full encryption of all traffic over SSL <br>  - the function of transferring rights to view the video and archive to other personal accounts (if the access to the cameras must be differentiated between different people) <br>  - the ability to embed video from your camera on your website.  This can be done in 3 clicks.  The rest of the work will be done by our CDN.  And it is actually free. <br>  - there is no site but there is a desire to share video from your camera with friends?  Post to social network?  <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/rasshiryaem-vozmozhnosti-sistemyi-delites-video/">No problem either</a> . <br>  - need to be notified that your camera is turned off?  There is such a function. <br><br>  We do not seek to earn money on the sale of equipment.  Therefore, all our developments, including ready-to-use firmware, as well as detailed instructions for installing them are presented <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/ip-camera-firmware/">on our website</a> .  This is primarily necessary for those who, for one reason or another, have already become the owner of cameras supported by us, but without our service on board.  Nevertheless, for those who prefer to buy cameras that are already ready for use and tested by our specialists, we have opened our small <a href="http://xn--b1aedjb6ag.xn--p1ai/shop/">online store</a> .  All prices listed on the cameras are on the same level as in other companies, and somewhere even lower. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151903/</a></p>
