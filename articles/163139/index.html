History of success?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d43/a9f/995/d43a9f995ca579c011580b302a033f3a.jpg"><br>  For three years, I posted a centner of applications in the Apple Appstore. <br>  Most of them are interesting only to my inflamed brain. <br>  Some bring up to 100 dollars a year.  No need to laugh, listen further. <br>  The number of games with an annual income of 1000 dollars is equal to the number of fingers on the hand of an English programmer. <br>  And one application of a hundred shot.  To date, December 19, it has earned 248,457 money and by the New 2013 promises to overcome the quarter-million milestone. <br>  According to a survey conducted on Habr√©, 82% of locals consider this a success. <br>  I have to agree with them. <br><br>  The article has a funny story, how and why it happened. <br>  Examples of software code will not be.  For examples of software code, go to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6931958/is-it-possible-to-compile-fortran-code-for-ipad%3Frq%3D1">stackoverflow.com</a> . <br>  Stern editors are warning that the application is free, and the article is useless.  So without links. <br><br>  <b>The editors throw me out for the fifth time from the Game Development hub.</b>  <b>I'm at a loss.</b>  .

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Six Towers App Reviews </h4><br><blockquote>  Complete shit </blockquote>  Pavel Roitberg, Director of MTS Products and Services Development Department. <br><br><blockquote>  In terms of commercial success, the application is not interesting for us. </blockquote>  Ed Rumley, COO, Chillingo at Electronic Arts. <br><br><blockquote>  Dude, never touch the keyboard again, it's not yours </blockquote>  Dolboeb user from the Russian AppStore (the most benevolent review). <br><br><h4>  Publishers with Habra </h4><br>  Starting failure in the apple store did not upset me.  Congenital snobbery of a graduate of the fur-mat and interesting work helped. <br>  And one day in early August ... <br>  And then one day in early August 2011 a habrezhatel <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/golubevpavel/" class="user_link">golubevpavel</a> contacted me and said: - Boyfriend, I am tired of watching you suffer.  Sign an agreement with us, make money. <br>  - Like this?  - I was surprised. <br>  - We will pull out your game in the top 25 of the British Appstore and be in chocolate.  But for this, fulfill three wishes. <br><br>  1) Make the game free; <br>  2) Insert advertising; <br>  3) Insert purchases inside the app. <br><br>  It would be nice to redo the design, I thought, but said nothing and quickly fulfilled three wishes. <br><blockquote>  Half of the revenue is yours, half is ours. </blockquote><br>  Contract on 15 sheets.  The fax fastened our handshakes across the ocean. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/andreyd22/" class="user_link">andreyd22</a> started an account for me at <a href="http://www.appfigures.com/">appfigures.com</a> so that I can keep track of revenue.  By and large, everything was built on an honest word.  There are more decent people in the world than we are shown on TV. <br><br><h4>  Application in the top </h4><br>  The next day, the application jumped into the top 25 British appstore and I began to frantically monitor revenue. <br>  There was no time to program.  The numbers were updated hourly. <br>  200 dollars a day from in-app purchases.  $ 100 from iAd advertising. <br><br>  Three days later, Paul said: - The application is a success.  We go to the US top 25. <br><br>  Three days later, Six Towers was in the US Top 1. Programmer vanity was satisfied.  The game kept in the top week.  Brought crazy money.  $ 10,000 per day.  See diagrams. <br><br><h4>  IAd Annual Daily Profit Chart </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1bd/0e1/656/1bd0e165651238c21fa7b71adf532a81.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Annual chart of daily profits from in-app purchases </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/289/955/4e5/2899554e59f01773d5bf88e4cf1ed60b.jpg"><br><br>  Familiar Muscovites twisted his finger at his temple - Guy, you will not see the money. <br>  I feel sorry for them. <br><br>  Hypocrites shouted - you are using gray schemes of promotion.  And encouraged to buy paid reviews.  This is a joke, right? <br><br><h4>  Leftover Apple Pie </h4><br>  During the last year, on the tail of its own success, the toy brought in an income of about $ 100‚Äì200 per day. <br>  Here is the iAd profit chart for the last month. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b46/f2d/0e8/b46f2d0e869b82e3a117255c9a2528bb.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a chart of profits from in-app purchases over the last month.  In the current version of the program, I refused to buy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a4b/bc3/fa4/a4bbc3fa453b98f076d0acc101e0dff8.jpg"><br><br>  For these casual games, advertising generates three times more income than purchases.  It makes no sense for the dollar to turn off advertising that makes a profit every month.  By the way, an amazing fact - for almost all applications, the percentage of those who made an internal purchase is 2.5.  That is, out of 4,000,000 downloaded 100,000, click the buy button. <br><br>  This review does not include a report on advertising from <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a> .  I hasten to inform you that I found a way to make up with google and received the first money from placing <a href="">admob</a> advertising in my application.  This should be separately written in the continuation of my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145609/">article, as I was offended</a> .  I hasten to inform you that google is still a good corporation. <br><br>  I think another year she will delight me and my many children. <br><br>  -Dad, let me collect turrets. <br>  - Hold on, son, just do not click on advertising. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163139/</a></p>
