Sometimes you wonder why the most moronic, ideas are fired, and those who have worked for a long time can be merged into the basket.  But not always "luck" is the place to be. <br><br>  There are sad statistics - 80% of startups work on the cart.  The reasons are different: starting from the product itself, ending with the inability to sell. <br><br>  We all create or create a product, our startup.  We believe in him and in ourselves.  Some are convinced that this is their life‚Äôs work, they become geeks.  In my opinion this is the worst thing that can happen. <a name="habracut"></a>  But more about that later.

      Consider startups with a ‚Äútwist,‚Äù because creating an e-shop of cell phones and shouting that you have created a megastartap that will push the Euroset, connected and the whole world, already seems nonsense. <br><br>  So, choose a niche and "raisins".  The next, obligatory step is a trip to a potential client.  Choose at least 50 potential consumers of your product and go! <br><br>  At this stage, you can understand how much your product is interesting to consumers. <br><br>  We chose 30. Now we understand that this is not enough.  Our project is already fully working, but it turns out there are those who are willing to pay, but in a different way.  Now we are working on the principle of monetization.  And how many such customers have gone? <br><br>  It is better to interview and meet with potential clients together.  To each objective "no", you did not find 10 subjective "yes." <br><br>  You understand - the project is a bomb, it is needed.  Congratulations, 5% of your success is guaranteed. <br><br>  Create a one-page page with a description of your project.  Do not be lazy, describe it correctly, simply and with a minimum of letters.  Make a field with the input of soap and the button "report release".  Start collecting customers before the project is released.  The same applies to already working projects, before the release of a new functional or ‚Äúraisin‚Äù. <br><br>  With the advent of the Internet in our lives, the way to advance has become a huge amount.  But offline ways remain the best way to attract.  I mean personal connections, cold calls, word of mouth, etc. <br><br>  You can light up a separate book to the promotion channels, but here I want to dispel the need for SMM for the b2b segment. <br><br>  Do not spend money on SMM, time and effort until a certain point.  Soc.  b2b network is not a way to promote a project, but a way to control those who are already working with you.  There will always be satisfied and not very.  A positive review will be written by every thousandth who has received positive emotions, but a negative one ... Well, you know :-).  So, having already a decent mass of customers, the group on the social network allows users to pour out their emotions, questions, etc., where you need it, and not all over the Internet. <br><br>  And finally, do not become geeks, do not finish your product endlessly, spending all the money, in the hope that the project is a bomb and he himself will sell.  You have to sell now.  An ideal business should be built first in the head, and only then in the heart. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293634/</a></p>
