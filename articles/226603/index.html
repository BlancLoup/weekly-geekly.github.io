  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Huawei routers and switches successfully passed the test</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The results of tests carried out at the Technopark FSUE ZNIIS indicate that the AR1220VW router and S5700 28C-EI switch manufactured by Huawei Technologies comply with the stated functional requirements. <br><br>  Huawei and FSUE ZNIIS are conducting equipment certification and since 2003 have implemented a number of joint testing projects, including the Softswicth flexible switch, IMS solutions and IP / MPLS.  Since the modern measuring base of the institute is constantly expanding, in the future it is planned to focus not only on telecommunications equipment, but also to test equipment of the enterprise level.  One of these tests is described below. <br><br>  As part of testing communications equipment, the PMU ZNIIS cooperates with large international standardizing organizations (ITU, ETSI, etc.), conducts an independent assessment and confirms the compliance of the equipment with the stated specifications.  Such works are carried out both within the framework of mandatory state certification, and upon the request of individual manufacturers, enterprises and telecom operators. <a name="habracut"></a>  Manufacturers in this case receive an additional advantage when selling equipment (a kind of voluntary certification), and operators and other equipment buyers may not divert resources to conduct testing on their networks (or reduce the test program).

      Testing equipment provides a variety of benefits to its manufacturers and potential customers.  The former can use the results in various public events conducted by the company, as arguments in negotiations with customers, to develop new tests that better reveal the capabilities of the equipment in different scenarios.  There is an extra argument in the competition.  Customers receive greater confidence in the compliance of the purchased equipment with the stated requirements. <br><br>  For example, according to the load tests carried out earlier, the convergence time of OSPF on Huawei routers and switches reaches 30 and 200-300 ms, respectively.  The number of BGP routes that the AR1200, AR2220, and S5710 equipment can take has been checked with the CPU load.  We performed load tests with NAT and PBR - building CPU load dependence on traffic, transit time of Industrial Ethernet packets through a crowded 10G channel with QoS setting.  The zero delay variation in these tests demonstrates the benefits of hardware QoS support and the VxWorks RTOS, which Huawei uses. <br><br>  Huawei's next-generation AR1200 series routers are enterprise-class equipment, built on the basis of a universal routing platform (VRP) and a multi-core processor.  They combine routing, switching, WLAN support, 3G services, voice services and security features.  The AR1200 family includes four models - AR1220, AR1220V, AR1220W and AR1220VW.  This integrated solution for corporate networks provides non-blocking switching, has high performance and functional characteristics, offers system expansion options, meeting the requirements of network expansion and enterprise development.  Support for wired (copper and fiber) and wireless networks (WLAN, UMTS: (3G, LTE)) means the flexibility to choose network access methods.  A comprehensive security mechanism includes user access control, packet recognition and active protection against attempts to breach security.  The services are managed by iTec, NQA and NetStream. <br><br>  The AR1200 devices function as routers of branch offices and provide flexible remote access, including connections via a dedicated line :( Ethernet, E1, xDSL) and using wireless access: (WLAN, 3G, LTE).  The AR1200 can also act as a local IP PBX with IVR functions and call statistics, or used as a voice SIP gateway for corporate networks.  In the event of a global network failure, the public switched telephone network is used as a backup for calls.  If the SIP server in the central office is unavailable, the SIP server built into the AR1200 router communicates between the branches and between the branch office and the PSTN, ensuring the reliability of voice services.  The AR1200 also provides quick VPN channel deployment and branch office authentication. <br><br>  Compliance with 3G standards, including CDMA2000 EV-DO, WCDMA and TD-SCDMA, meets the requirements of wireless communication between the branches and the central office.  3G can be used as a supplement for a wired communication channel.  This additional channel improves the stability of the network.  The NQA function allows you to control the quality of the 3G communication channel (SLA).  Support for voice and 3G features determines the application of the device.  It can be used as a router for a small office with the possibility of reservation.  It is well suited for the SOHO segment. <br><br>  AR1200 routers have proven to be inexpensive equipment with good capabilities.  They provide support for fast convergence for both routing protocols and MPLS LSP, support MPLS VPN + Fast Reroute, which allows its use in scenarios with an increased requirement for connection reliability. <br><br>  The latest testing also involved Huawei S5700-28C-EI-24S intelligent power-saving Ethernet switches with 24 ports of 10/100/1000 Mbps and four additional ComboSFPs.  Gigabit switches for enterprises of the S5700 series are the next generation equipment developed by Huawei to meet the requirements of broadband access and aggregation of multi-service traffic.  These switches are designed specifically for small and medium enterprises.  S5700-EI is a third-level gigabit switch with support for all existing routing protocols for IPv4 and IPv6 (except for EIGRP).  It is positioned as an access level and aggregation device.  The ability to connect 4x10G ports without oversubscription allows it to be used at the aggregation level with the ability to connect to the kernel.  Hardware QoS control allows you to customize equipment for any, most demanded applications. <br><br>  These switches can work in the campus networks of enterprises, providing various network services, such as: IGMP V 1,2,3, HTTPS, IPv6 ,, RMON, SNMP V1,2 ,, Telnet, RIP, OSPF. <br><br><h5>  TESTING SCHEME </h5><br>  The AR1220VW router and S5700 28C-EI switch manufactured by Huawei Technologies were tested with basic settings ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/1.pdf">1</a> ) for compliance with the stated functional requirements on the reference model communication network (see Figure 1) at the FSUE ZNIIS Technopark in Moscow.  For measurements, the Spirent TestCenter SPT-N4U-220 hardware generator / traffic analyzer and the electronic START UP JS-309 stopwatch were used. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cd/cdd/250/8cdcdd250b8bc88c38cec32ca0b85f75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 1.</b> Wiring of the equipment of the AR1220VW routers and the S5700 28C EI switch to the reference network. <br>  During the tests, the time of convergence in the OSPF domain (with the definition of the mechanisms affecting it), the correct classification and processing of traffic in accordance with the specified service rules, the possibility of implementing queue maintenance mechanisms, including the formation and maintenance of the PQ priority queue, the function of passing transit traffic on labels LSR ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/2.pdf">2</a> ).  A check was made on MPLS scalability and switching time between switching routes by tags ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/3.pdf">3</a> ) ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/4.pdf">4</a> ).  The results of all these tests were positive.  Regarding the last two tests, after adding more than one hundred static routes by tags, the routing table still had the opportunity to receive new route records, and the time required to combine and redirect traffic to the backup switching route by LSP tags after the main route was unavailable, was 20 ms ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/5.pdf">5</a> ) ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/6.pdf">6</a> ). <br><br><h5>  MAIN RESULTS <br></h5><br>  According to the test results, the AR1220VW router and the S5700 28C-EI switch support mechanisms that affect the convergence time in the OSPF domain, and also correctly classify and process traffic of various classes according to the specified service rules.  Increasing the bandwidth occupied by low-priority traffic does not affect the characteristics of the traffic stream with the highest priority (percentage of packet loss, transmission delay).  These actions only affect the characteristics of the stream with the lowest priority. <br><br>  To test the switch's ability to handle traffic of different classes, several flows of equal size were fed to the incoming interface of the Huawei Quidway S5700 switch.  The streams were assigned DSPC ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/7.pdf">7</a> ) tags, and the Traffic Control parameters were configured so that, with a total channel bandwidth of 100 Mbps, specify the guaranteed bandwidth for streams with a DSCP ef tag of 50 Mbps (for all streams in total), and for all streams labeled cs3 - 40 Mbps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ff/19b/21d/1ff19b21db3ddc7ea9f084636f846911.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 2</b> .  Testing of two channels with different priorities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/639/a32/5fa/639a325fa097876ca431d4057c626e1c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 3.</b> Low-priority flow test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7bd/e5b/d45/7bde5bd4569f589155aa7f9c8d4e2881.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 4</b> .  Adding two more threads. <br><br>  As can be seen from the graphs obtained (see Figures 2-4), priority traffic (red) is provided with guaranteed throughput with a different number of low priority flows.  This confirms the ability of the equipment to handle traffic with different priorities. <br><br>  The AR1220VW router and the S5700 28C-EI switch also support the formation and maintenance mechanisms of the PQ priority queue (QoS Priority Queue) (see Figures 5 and 6).  Due to this, an increase in the bandwidth occupied by low-priority traffic does not affect the characteristics of the traffic stream with the highest priority (percentage of packet loss, transmission delay, throughput for high-priority traffic).  These actions only affect the characteristics of the stream with the lowest priority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/0ac/ed1/6bb0aced19e10f992ab23c1c4e58e04c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 5</b> .  Initially, there are two channels with different priorities.  Their total bandwidth exceeds the allocated bandwidth, which causes conflicts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b0/a94/5c7/4b0a945c77e022eaf16c1c0cb48e3142.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 6.</b> As a result of applying PQ ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/8.pdf">8</a> ), the diagram became smoother, packet losses and delays decreased. <br><br>  Testing the transit traffic transfer function by the LSR ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/9.pdf">9</a> ) label switching router also gave positive results: there are no lost packets and no packets with the wrong tag value.  The AR1220VW and S5700 28C-EI equipment supports the transit traffic function with LSR label switching with label replacement and correct packet transmission with the new label (see Figure 7). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d4/4bc/acd/8d44bcacd22b1e269bd977030217dc60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Figure 7</b> .  Test network configuration.  As the results showed, label switching is successful. <br><br>  To test the MPLS scalability, testers tried to determine the maximum number of switching routes by LSP tags that the router can serve ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/10.pdf">10</a> ).  Many routing routes have been added to the MPLS routing table.  After adding more than a hundred static routes by tags, the routing table had the opportunity to accept new route entries, which indicates high scalability. <br>  In the switching test between label switching routes, the time it takes for the router to redirect traffic to the backup switching route using LSP labels was determined after the main route became unavailable due to a network topology change or unavailability ( <a href="http://www.landata.ru/new_dokunents/raznoe/11.pdf">11</a> ). <br><br>  The test network configuration was in accordance with Figure 1. In this test, two routes were configured: R1 - R2 and R1 - switch L3 - R2.  The first is selected as a priority.  After the physical breakdown of the R1-R2 connection, an automatic switch from the main MPLS route to the backup route was performed.  This switching took place within 20 ms. <br><br><h5>  FINDINGS </h5><br>  All six tests provided by the ‚ÄúProgram and Test Methodology‚Äù gave a positive result.  The test results showed that Huawei Technologies' AR1220VW and S5700 28C-EI equipment supports mechanisms that affect convergence time in the OSPF domain, correctly classifies and processes traffic of various classes in accordance with specified service rules, and the increase in the bandwidth used by low-priority traffic is not affects the characteristics of the traffic flow with the highest priority (the percentage of packet loss, transmission delay), and affects only the characteristics of the flow with the lowest priority.  It supports the possibility of implementing queue maintenance mechanisms ‚Äî the formation and maintenance of a priority PQ queue, as well as the function of transmitting transit traffic with switching by LSR tags, replacing the tag and correctly transmitting the packet with the new tag.  These switches and routers provide flexible MPLS scalability mechanisms, switching between label switching routes.  At the same time, the time required to combine and redirect traffic to the backup switching route via LSP tags due to unavailability of the main one as a result of a change in the network topology or unreachability was 20 ms. <br><br>  These results indicate that the AR1220VW router and the S5700 28C-EI switch manufactured by Huawei Technologies comply with the stated functional requirements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226603/</a></p>
