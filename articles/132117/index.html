  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A friend will help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a year ago my wiring burned in the kitchen.  Repairs were made just a year ago by people from neighboring countries (and, as it turned out, not very well).  It was necessary to look for a good electrician.  Among friends there were no such people, he began to ask friends and acquaintances about their environment.  And the man was found, even two.  Time spent quite a lot. <br><br>  And then the thought occurred to me: why not make a <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/helpfriend">service</a> where people could point out their skills and look for the right people among their closest associates? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  VKontakte I had about 100 friends, started flipping and remembering who was doing what.  The results were deplorable - only 30% knew the occupation (20% were my colleagues), 70% had no idea what they were doing.  The idea continued to strengthen. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      I began to ask friends and acquaintances about whether they knew the skills of their friends, would use the service of finding the right people in their surroundings.  The results are the same as mine ... <br>  He told about the idea to his colleagues.  Everyone liked it.  Two agreed to participate in the development.  Began to think through the concept.  It turned out a whole sheet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/869/0d0/7e6/8690d07e64f34a723b7382d2e1338b8c.png" alt="Plan"><br><br>  So, the goal of the project: to enable people to find each other by their skills.  People can seek skills from friends and friends of friends.  If the person in the environment is not found, you can place an order and specify this skill.  This order will be seen by all people with this skill and will respond to it. <br>  We agreed that the first step is to implement the application for VKontakte.  Engaged in designing the interface.  It turned out the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/348/c5c/44b/348c5c44ba4fee2a75f2b165eac1436d.png" alt="Sketch"><br><br>  And then the problems started.  One friend found a new job, he had a child.  In short, he had no time left for the project, although there was a desire to continue.  The second was disappointed in the idea and decided not to continue. <br><br>  I myself have never been involved in web development (my professional activity is related to 1C projects) and there are almost no acquaintances in this field.  Started in the old-fashioned way to search through friends.  Time passed, but the people did not seek.  I was almost desperate, but then one person responded, and the ice was broken.  All discussed, outlined deadlines. <br><br>  After 3 weeks, the design was born: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28d/e83/23a/28de8323a009fdf57778744d269ef6dd.png" alt="Design"><br><br>  Layout also went without a hitch, but problems started with programming.  First, the programmer went on vacation, then he began to break the deadlines and in the end simply refused to work (he suggested either to move the deadlines for 2 months, or leave). <br><br>  Again I began to search among my acquaintances, I found it in a week, we agreed to start in 2 weeks.  I started, I studied everything ... and simply disappeared ... <br><br>  A month has passed, but there are no movements again.  In the end, I decided to do myself bringing the application to mind (I had little knowledge).  The study and revision took about a month. <br><br>  What happened, you can see here: <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/helpfriend">vkontakte.ru/helpfriend</a> <br><br>  <b>This is my first project, really looking forward to feedback, comments, suggestions.</b> <br><br>  Plans to create a separate website, authorization through Facebook, application for Android. <br><br>  ps The author of the topic and the project is not me.  If someone wants to share an invite for the author, his email is: zhloby3k@gmail.com <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> After entering professional skills, you need to press Enter. <br>  <b>UPD2: Looking for</b> people (web-specialists) for the development of the project, write to zhloby3k@gmail.com. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132117/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132117/</a></p>
