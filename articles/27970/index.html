      There is something else ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... this is not talked about in textbooks and business consultants rarely recall, it is a <strong>will</strong> . <br><br>  It is believed that it is either there or not.  Somewhat more it is dismantled in terms of motivation.  Motivations of others, not of yourself (by the way, others are easier to motivate). <br><br>  How to motivate yourself to do 2 years of the project, from which, perhaps, rushing the first 3 months, while you in your mind you share the skin of a dead bear.  But when, in your imagination, you already had sex with all the girls of the dream on this skin, hung it on the wall, held it by the fireplace, boasted to colleagues, wore dry cleaning and finally, when she wore her friends under her slippers, you sewed a hat from her - The only thing holding you back is not to quit this occupation and not to engage in a new, more interesting project - your will. <br><br>  Have you noticed in the past decade that the bulk of businessmen were former athletes?  Perhaps not far away, not quite clever stubborn people not accepting objections?  Do you think the point is simply that they could ensure their physical security? <br><br>  <b>If there is a will, there will be a plan, and performers, and resources, and knowledge.</b> <br><br><h2>  Where does it get and how not to lose it? </h2><br>  <strong>First</strong> , you need to set a very high goal.  Such that it is not erased under the slippers of friends.  To do this, it should not be your personal gain, or even the benefit of your family, but the benefit to society.  Then you yourself will remember it for a long time - others will not let you forget.  To know how to implement it, develop a plan. <br><br>  <strong>Secondly</strong> - you should be shoved not only from the goal, but also from the very process of its achievement.  The most dangerous thing is to hang in the process, not reaching the goal. <br><br>  <strong>Thirdly</strong> , the will can and must be trained.  Gradually moving to more long-term projects.  This is well written by <a href="http://www.miu-mau.org/">Miu-Mau</a> : ‚Äú <em>The main occupation of a person will develop his spirit if he is regularly engaged in work that requires overcoming great difficulties</em> ‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.miu-mau.org/74.html">Why does a person need big projects</a> ). <br><br>  <strong>Fourth</strong> , to have a real mock target.  This can be either the layout of the building, or a picture on the blackboard with chalk, or an inscription in numbers in a notebook, but it should be.  Boris Abramovich knows a lot about this, he even invented such a word - volpinism.  He calls this model "Frontier of Growth", but essentially it does not change: <br><br><blockquote>  Frontier growth.  Being engaged in volpinizmom, you must establish yourself lines of growth.  In your enrichment, you will move from one line to another, jumping higher and higher.  If there is a recession somewhere, it means that you need to return to the original indicator, you set the bar a bit high ... <br><br>  Frontier must always be in your mind and not come to the forefront at the same time.  The best thing is to drive it into the subconscious, so as not to think about it, but vaguely to feel. <br><br>  I will share my method: I wrote a certain number (my own milestone) on different pieces of paper, in organizers, on the handset, at production meetings, in ministers for receiving, etc.  All the time, only a number, without comments, without undue clarification, I have taught myself that this number is obvious in the future, that it is mine, belongs to me by right, that I should get used to it, and not be surprised when it occurs in my checkbook. </blockquote><br>  Read it in more detail, there is also about faith - <a href="http://kocby.ru/biz/berezovski.html">kocby.ru/biz/berezovski.html</a> <br><br>  <strong>Fifth</strong> - be a man, the boy said - the boy did!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27970/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27970/</a></p>
