Obviously, this is the answer of Apple and its iPhone 4S, and, knowing about the popularity of Smasung Galaxy SII, it is safe to say that the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù handset will at least have the same success.  So why is the Korean brainchild better or worse than the iPhone 4S?  Let's try to find out. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main, at the moment, "rival" iPhone 4S has serious characteristics, and the new features of Android 4.0 take the device to a serious level.

      So, for a start we will deal with the specification of both devices: <br><br>  <b>Display</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S: As with the iPhone 4, the esque has a 3.5-inch TFT screen with a resolution of 640 x 960 pixels.  This means that ppi (density of pixels per inch) is 326 pixels.  In addition, the Retina-display iPhone supports up to 16 million colors and has IPS technology (this means that when you rotate the phone, the image will not distort the colors).  The screen is protected by tempered glass, covered with an oleophobic mixture - it is resistant to scratches and less than others stains from grease and dirt. <br><br>  Galaxy Nexus: This giant has a really big and at the same time high-quality display - 4.65 inches.  What about ppi?  As far as this would seem surprising, the Nexus has 316 dots per inch.  This is facilitated by the screen resolution - 720 x 1280 pixels.  Here, the same 16 million colors, but there is one advantage - Super Amoled.  Quality mark.  Black color is transmitted much better than the iPhone display. <br><br>  But how many people need this 4.65 inches?  As practice shows, with an iPhone screen (3.5 inches), you can reach your finger to any point on the screen, and with such a ‚Äúhulk‚Äù like Samsung, you can feel yourself not with a phone, but with a tablet in your hands.  This question will always remain a matter of controversy: everyone chooses for himself. <br><br>  <b>CPU</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S: The 5th generation of Apple phones is equipped with a dual-core 1 GHz Apple 5 processor based on ARM Cortex-A9 and a PowerVR SGX543MP2 GPU video chipset.  According to the official statement given by Apple, the A5 is more powerful than the A4 (used in the iPhone 4 and iPad) twice.  Regarding graphics, the results are simply incredible - a 9-fold increase in productivity (compared to the iPhone 4).  At the presentation of the device, Epic Games experts presented the 2nd part of the famous iOS fighting game, Infinity Blade.  The game will appear in December this year and will be supported exclusively by iPhone 4S. <br><br>  Galaxy Nexus: Samsung has a 1.2 GHz processor and, like the A5, is based on ARM Cortex-A9.  The phone has a powerful TI OMAP 4460 chipset. It is not clear for what tasks it will be used: there are no such productive games in the Android Market as in the App Store.  Perhaps the chip ‚Äúhelps‚Äù the phone to record Full HD video and play it.  I think, in this regard, the iPhone 4S clearly wins - if Nexus has future projects designed for such ‚Äúpower‚Äù in the future, then Apple already has everything for the brainchild. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S: without departing from the topic, let's proceed to the comparison of cameras in both devices.  The iPhone has an 8 megapixel camera and can shoot photos at up to 3264 √ó 2448 pixels.  But is it in pixels?  The number "8" in this case is no more than the marketers move.  Another thing is that inside the new ‚Äúmiracle camera‚Äù.  Even at the presentation, it became clear that the camera in the iPhone 4S is one of the main innovations.  Apple engineers managed to make a real breakthrough: face autofocus, stabilizer, 5 internal lenses.  In addition, the iPhone was ‚Äútaught‚Äù to record Full HD video with 30 FPS (frames per second).  Those who have already managed to hold this miracle in their hands say that the camera is the best that can be seen on the mobile market. <br><br>  Galaxy Nexus: Here you can ‚Äúmeet‚Äù already 5 MP (and not 8) with the ability to shoot 2592 √ó 1936 pixels, but the same Full HD-video and the same 30 frames per second.  Nexus promises to appear on the market only next month, so in comparison with the iPhone 4S does not go yet - perhaps the potential of the device is just as good as the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, therefore, only fantasy and analytical flair work in the current situation.  But what can I say - Nexus has a front 1.3 MP camera, while the iPhone 4S has only 0.3 MP.  But, as practice shows, no one has ever complained about FaceTime. <br><br>  <b>Communication / Internet</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S supports the following standards: GPRS, 3G HSDPA, 14.4 Mbps - HSUPA, 5.8 Mbps, Wi-Fi 802.11 B / G / N, EDGE, Bluetooth 4.0 with A2DP support, Wi-Fi HotSpot and USB 2.0 .  In addition, the phone has a GPS chip and even GLONASS!  As far as you can remember, iPhone 4S supports 2 communication standards - CDMA and GSM, in order to switch from one to another, just go to the settings and make a couple of ‚Äúgestures‚Äù.  The iPhone does not support the LTE standard, but the maximum data load using 3G has doubled to 14.4 Mbps. <br><br>  Galaxy Nexus: GPRS, 3G HSDPA, 21 Mbps - HSUPA, 5.76 Mbps;  4G (LTE), EDGE, Wi-Fi 802.11 A / B / G / N dual-band Wi-Fi HotSpot, DLNA, Bluetooth 3.0 with A2DP support and MicroUSB 2.0.  This is where the Nexus takes its charge - 4G support.  This is exactly what the consumer needs (we do not take the Russian market).  Download speed 21 Mbps - you can only dream about it.  In this issue, that Samsung, that HTC and other manufacturers have long been ahead of Apple. <br><br>  <b>Memory</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S has 512 MB of RAM and comes in three types: with 16, 32 and 64 GB of internal memory.  The memory card slot, of course, does not have (but why, it is asked, do you need it?). <br><br>  Galaxy Nexus has twice the amount of RAM (1 GB), but will be sold only in two versions - with 16 and 32 GB of memory.  No matter how strange it would seem, but you can't install memory cards in Nexus either.  However, another question arises - are these 64 GB of internal memory that Apple gives us?  Most users have enough and 16. <br><br>  <b>Battery and Dimensions</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S has at its disposal a permanent ‚ÄúLi-Po-battery‚Äù at 1432 mAh, this is enough for 6 hours of video recording and 10 hours of talk in 3G mode.  The size and weight of the device: 115.2 x 58.6 x 9.3 mm, 140 grams.  Unlike the iPhone, Nexus has larger dimensions, but weighs less: 135.5 x 67.9 x 8.9 mm, 135 grams.  It has a 1700 mAh battery installed, but with such a huge display it would seem strange?  I don‚Äôt think ... It‚Äôs not entirely clear how long Samsung‚Äôs flagship will be enough, so this part of the dispute also remains open. <br><br>  <b>iOS 5 vs Android 4</b> <br><br>  iPhone 4S: The eternal struggle of two operating systems, the holders of the mobile market - iOS and Android.  A few days ago, Apple released iOS 5 with a huge number of new features, including iMessage (messaging service), a new notification system, and Siri: <br><br>  - New notification center.  Now, all that accumulates in the "piggy bank" with not read mail, SMS or missed calls is in one place - the center of notifications.  The system is implemented by analogy with that in Android - just hold your fingers across the screen from top to bottom. <br>  - iMessage.  With this service, users of Apple products can communicate with each other for free.  iMessage is built into the Messages application and is supported by the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. <br>  - Kiosk.  Logs, as you know, can now be bought in digital form, and they will be stored in a separate folder-application "Kiosk". <br>  - Reminders.  Another new application in iOS.  With this program you can store the necessary information and tasks for the day, week or month in advance. <br>  - Twitter integration.  The 140-character messaging service is now built right into iOS 5 ‚Äî it's incredibly convenient and practical. <br>  - PC-Free.  Previously, in order to download music, activate the iPhone or, for example, download a new firmware, it was necessary to connect the device to iTunes, now all these operations can be done using the device itself. <br>  - iCloud.  About the "cloud" service from Apple said and written hundreds of thousands of words, so in short: all your data, photos, contacts, etc. can now be stored on Apple servers, therefore, by synchronizing this or that device, you can be sure about security.  In addition, it is just convenient. <br><br>  Of course, Android 4.0 Ice-Cream Sandwitch, like iOS 5, got a lot of new features: <br><br>  - The operating system has become "united" in the literal sense, Android 4 is suitable for both phones and tablets.  All this is similar to the situation with iOS. <br>  - Finally, the opportunity to create screenshots!  If you remember, such functionality appeared in the 1st version of iOS.  Trifle, as they say, but nice. <br>  - Again, as in iOS, Android has introduced the function of creating folders for applications. <br>  - Improved interface.  Android 4.0, with respect to past versions of Android, has undergone major changes in appearance.  The system began to look much laconic. <br>  - Virtual buttons.  In Android devices, apparently, there will be no more touch keys, they will be replaced by virtual ones built into the system and located at the bottom of the screen.  This will allow more space for full-screen applications. <br>  - Android Beam function based on NFC.  With this, users of Android-appartov will be able to share various content, bringing the gadgets to each other.  Something reminiscent of infrared. <br>  - Added support for Open Accessory API, this is a programming interface that allows you to interact with various equipment <br>  - The introduction of Google services for working with video and music: this includes Picassa photo gallery <br><br>  Compare two systems?  At least - irrational.  That iOS, that Android are intended for different tasks and have potential in different areas: iOS is simpler and has an ideal interface for an ordinary user, Android is an open OS that suits Gikam rather.  This can also include BlackBerry OS for business and Windows Phone 7, whose share has not yet been characterized by a key public. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/430/ace/09b/430ace09bfc57efd815ee069b3afee81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>One advantage of the iPhone 4S</b> <br><br>  If you think on a global scale, then there is one ‚Äúbut‚Äù that will allow the iPhone 4S to remain at the top of popularity with respect to the Galaxy Nexus, this is Siri.  The voice assistant so impressed the public that many people bought (or would buy) the iPhone 4S only because of Siri.  The service allows you to control your phone with your voice, ask any questions: find out news or, for example, fresh jokes.  Siri is so perfect that it can perceive even the most "broken" English (or German and French).  The only drawback of the system is support for only three languages.  It is annoying, but fair - Apple, in order to ascertain the correct solution for the introduction of Siri, it is necessary to look at the reaction of people and only then develop the project further.  It is possible that soon Siri will ‚Äúspeak‚Äù in Russian, but this can only be believed with a great deal of optimism.  However, we still hope. <br><br>  What's better?  Galaxy Nexus or iPhone 4S?  This is not a thriller or a fairy tale, so we have neither a good nor a bad end - these devices are different - one for me and the other for you.  The main thing is that there is a choice, and when there is a choice, there is the will to choose.  Whether you buy an iPhone 4S or a Galaxy Nexus, you won‚Äôt make it happen - both devices are revolutionary and have many useful functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b9/113/49f/4b911349fed4efdbe4c033ccd0a042ec.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130825/</a></p>
