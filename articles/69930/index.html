The realization of how easy large companies can <s>hope for ..</s> deceive people just dumbfounded me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with posts on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/context/64087/">this</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/context/66346/">this one</a> .  The bottom line is that the runner suspended payments to webmoney (most likely because of the crisis, because I do not see another reason).  Then I thought that it would be nice to order a payment so that it would pass quickly.  July 21, 2009 I ordered the payment, I thought in 2 weeks it would already be at the price of my wallet.  But as they say, figs were there. <br><br>  A month has passed, the end of August, I call the runner. <br>  - How's it going with my application? <br>  - The application for payment is confirmed, it is in the queue for payment in the financial department. <br>  - And when will the payment be? <br>  - I can not tell you not to encourage.  I myself do not know the timing, but I think it will be soon. <br>  Ok, I honestly waited until mid-September, and yesterday I rang the runner again.  The manager advised me to make a payment to the advertiser's account, saying that it goes faster (2-5 days).  And I made a request for payment to my second account (advertiser).  I thought that at least I could do something with this ‚Äúmoney‚Äù.  Fig was there. <br><br>  Today comes such a letter: <br>  <i>Hello,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We inform you about the termination of legal relations and the closure of the partner account in the service &lt;Runner&gt;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Reason: poor quality transitions.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ground of decision: p.5 of the Rules of participation in affiliate programs of the ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù service</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>According to the above rules, the work of affiliate programs will be suspended, and all funds accrued for poor-quality transitions, impressions or calls will be returned to the affected clients of the service "Runner".</i> <br><br>  After the call to the Runner, it turned out that suddenly all of my transitions turned out to be ‚Äúlow-quality‚Äù (they did not explain what ‚Äúlow-quality‚Äù transitions were to me, but they said that some of them click on the transitions themselves).  Perhaps you will suspect that I have made the transitions for myself, but I dare to assure you that I didn‚Äôt do that (it makes no sense).  And they still carried out an additional check of my delayed payment, and (oh, of course!) Transitions on it also turned out to be of poor quality.  To my question, how is it that at first the transitions were of high quality, and then suddenly they became substandard, the manager could not answer. <br><br>  In general, they <s>grabbed the</s> money they gave back to advertisers, they blocked the account, and my sites were no longer registered there.  I got 8 pieces, and now the runner hate fiercely. <br><br>  Everyone comes out of the crisis in different ways, apparently the runner does not shun, and such methods of "cost reduction".  But I think for a company that takes 50% of its partners' income, this is already too much.  Ugly, businessmen comrades! <br><br>  PS And the most interesting thing is that they never turned off the display of their advertising to me on the site, although they blocked the account.  Those.  money is still able to collect.  It leads to certain thoughts ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69930/</a></p>
