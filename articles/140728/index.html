Therefore, if you really want to read about the tablet itself, then rewind a year ago.  But if ‚Äúpractically everything is the same‚Äù, then have we once again been mistaken for fools and are selling the same thing as before?  Let's get a look.

      The expectations of Internet dreamers and the assumptions of sofa analysts have not been confirmed - the new product does not have either a three-dimensional screen, no built-in projector, or anything else like it;  Home button and left!  Moreover: many characteristics remain the same, the main changes can be counted on the fingers of one hand - they improved the screen, camera and wireless connections. <br><br>  The box of the novelty is no different from the box with the tablet of the previous generation - there are no visual differences (keep this in mind if you rob <s>Apple</s> store - the boxes are very easy to confuse). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66e/83e/d91/66e83ed91721fd4fa99f4ef9f3146d53.jpg"><br><br>  There is some ambiguity with the name of the device - ‚ÄúiPad HD‚Äù, ‚Äúthe new iPad‚Äù ... these two synonyms are unlikely to take root in the people - most likely the novelty will be called exactly as iPad 3. <br><br>  If the iPhone 4S from the iPhone 4 can be visually distinguished by the location of the separators of the ‚Äúbumper‚Äù antennas, then the new tablet does not differ from the ‚Äúold‚Äù one at all - even the inscriptions are the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b64/9a4/315/b649a431533c1ed46a13f36891d18fde.jpg"><br><br>  The only thing that has changed is the weight and thickness of the device: the novelty has become almost 60 grams (+ 8%) heavier and 0.8mm thicker than its predecessor.  But these, again, are not the most obvious differences - not every owner of the second ipad will notice them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a19/3f3/77d/a193f377d1a8bf4c890dfcd3255b2900.jpg"><br><br>  The rest - all the same monolithic case without any complaints about the quality of performance, cool metal back side and brand display with front.  But this is good - all those accessories that have ever been created have remained compatible, and this is a car and a small truck. <br><br><h2>  <font color="cc0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Screen</font> </h2><br>  But on this, perhaps, the most interesting begins =) Well, or enjoyable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/157/097/db8/157097db8a12f97b15cccf8007b4d2b2.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://images.apple.com/ipad/features/images/retina_icon.png" align="left" alt="image">  The diagonal of the device has remained the same: neither more nor less than uneven 9.7 inches.  But the number of pixels that make up this screen has increased significantly - if earlier it was 786.432 pixels (resolution 1024x768), now their number has grown to 3.145.728!  The resolution on the unchanged diagonal was 2048x1536 - what the hell is higher than in many even the most expensive HD TVs!  If you divide the number of pixels by the dimensions of the matrix, then it turns out that for every millimeter there are more than 10 pixels - try to imagine this by looking at the ‚Äúregular pixel‚Äù of the monitor or communicator.  The screenshots in the article have been reduced several times - in their original size they simply would not fit into the average monitor. <br><br>  What did all this really mean?  In fact, we have a very clear image with no hints of pixels.  The most obvious example is a piece of the map, which on the second ipad looks like a reduced image for the article (with blurred hard-to-read porridge in the captions), while the novelty will have a readable and clear text as on a clickable source: <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6001/30575835.0/0_70eea_f2756c52_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b7/9ae/f21/9b79aef21db8ea36007472db4034e436.png"></a> <br><br>  Any element: text on the screen, icons in the status bar, application icons ‚Äî anywhere from these elements you will not see pixelation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afa/84e/28c/afa84e28c708e3ab793e2ffa2872f598.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bd/256/858/8bd2568589626a1e825d8887d5217bbd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c0/9fe/428/2c09fe428ce018ab97f90882aca48c1c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2b/85d/fd2/f2b85dfd29f9889136f20daccccb930c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afe/e35/1f9/afee351f942b8a611a48951a720852d9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/139/f94/afb/139f94afb5202b2e9bfe9b52e31ac9bc.jpg"><br><br>  Even if you take a screenshot of the screen and bring it as close as possible, the image will remain quite clear: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/1c1/4d2/c9a1c14d2d3c93268dc4fe4eb06f2f4c.jpg"><br><br>  Logging in with their AppleID, the tablet offered several updates - almost all of them said that games or applications began to support the new Retina display. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faa/39c/4d5/faa39c4d5abf87f27096ae377ce6aa8e.jpg"><br><br>  I agree that it is rather stupid to lay out money for a new tablet for the sake of ‚Äúscreen alone‚Äù, but the screen is exactly what you will see 100% of the time you interact with the device.  The eyes will be very happy for such a gift - unwittingly this change immediately catches the eye, the screen is simply amazing!  Brightness remained at the same level, as well as the color rendition (my subjective opinion). <br><br><h2>  <font color="cc0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Camera</font> </h2><br>  The front camera is still ‚Äúlame‚Äù - even with good lighting it always has noise and other results of artificial image processing.  But we must understand that it is not at all for creating photographs (the resolution is only 640x480), but for video calls in all kinds of facestakes and Skype.  And for this task, the camera just suffices - in this respect, the image has become brighter than before. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/124/80d/229/12480d229e55c680432f920dd0aced68.jpg"><br><br>  The rear camera (now this 5-megapixel iSight) still has the same large and fast ‚Äúviewfinder‚Äù :), but the amount of noise has noticeably decreased.  But there appeared a more realistic color rendition, face recognition (up to 10 pieces per frame - it‚Äôs not very clear <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139816/">why this function is</a> , but I don‚Äôt give a tooth that it‚Äôs not just that).  A separate item liked the minimum focusing distance from which the tablet can now photograph - focusing on objects from a distance of about 5 centimeters!  Before macro photography, of course, is still far away, but it will be much easier to photograph a list of lectures (not on weight, but resting on fingers).  Each photo has a resolution of 2592x1936 and takes an average of 1.5-2 MB. <br><br>  The camera has learned to make video recordings in FullHD format (1920x1080) - the recording quality again loses to individual devices and the shooting process itself will not be as convenient, but the function as such is clearly not superfluous ... and then, like in a joke about a cow cake, which was not useful. <br><br><h2>  <font color="cc0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Work</font> </h2><br>  If the first version of iOS for the iPad had a lot of questions and complaints, then by now (iOS 5.1) everything is pretty cool, the device works like a clock.  If we talk about performance, then it is enough for all existing games and applications - whether it is a heavy Infinity Blade 2 or new three-dimensional maps in Yandex.Navigator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e33/645/d28/e33645d282ea1ee9742e5c0c3e96a10b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d17/a5b/faa/d17a5bfaac17921c3debf7e212945281.jpg"><br><br>  High-speed performance is achieved thanks to the new Apple A5X - a dual-core processor (with a clock frequency of ~ 1 GHz) with a four-core graphics processor.  I did not notice any significant overheating during operation (even resource-intensive games) - all within the framework of propriety. <br><br>  The amount of RAM has doubled - it became 1GB, in contrast to 512MB installed in iPad 2. At the same time, the battery life seemed to be about the same - about 10 hours, although I didn‚Äôt have enough time to check it out :) <br><br>  Not the slightest slowdowns, no complaints about the work as a whole - you can really get to the bottom of the shortcomings of each of the applications.  There are no problems in the event that you run a few dozen programs and leave them ‚Äúhanging in memory‚Äù ... In general, everything is fine - absolutely no comments. <br><br><h2>  <font color="cc0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">LTE</font> </h2><br>  Both versions of the updated tablet received Bluetooth version 4.0 and support for the 802.11a / b / g / n protocols.  There was no problem with that either. <br><br>  As for LTE, for obvious reasons, I have nothing to say here - it remains to be hoped that Yota will not refuse a solvent audience and will adapt in one form or another after launching its LTE network (in Moscow this event is scheduled for April 15) . <br><br><h2>  <font color="cc0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  What are the impressions left by the new iPad?  Overall, exceptionally good.  But, unfortunately, he did not cause as many emotions as the first one managed to cause - now the iPad is already perceived as something proper and customary, as if it always was.  A revolution did not happen, but, in fact, no one promised it - it‚Äôs just that we are all sitting here and waiting for such spoiled ones.  The third iPad is just a good continuation of what has already been, to which many have become so accustomed ... just improved (perceptibly - only the screen) what one often encounters while working and nothing more.  There is no special sense to upgrade from the second model to the third one ... on the other hand, you also bought your new monitor (instead of the old one) just for the sake of a new screen;) <br><br>  But there is one more thing that is pleasant, namely, the reduction in prices for the entire lineup of the previous generation.  If you reacted with skepticism to the release of the first ipad, you didn‚Äôt mature for the second one, then now it‚Äôs definitely time to drop all doubts and break the piggy bank - the price has become so affordable that it risks even the inveterate opponents who don‚Äôt want to pay for the brand ".  However, even after the price reduction, it is better to buy in stores abroad in Russia - the difference with our price is enough for a couple of accessories and a gentlemen‚Äôs software suite. <br><br>  And since we started talking about stores, you won‚Äôt be considered for advertisements - I‚Äôm grateful to the <a href="http://cplaza.ru/">Computer Plaza</a> store for the device provided for the test, thanks to the special street magic you can always find the most fresh one - thanks! <br><br>  <font color="#0685de"><b>¬ª</b></font> <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">Official Apple Website</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140728/</a></p>
