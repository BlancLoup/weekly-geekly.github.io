      <b>Compiler Warnings for Objective-C Developer</b> <br>  <a href="http://oleb.net/blog/2013/04/compiler-warnings-for-objective-c-developers/">Angl</a> <br>  Compiler warnings are one of the most useful tools for a developer.  The compiler may not only warn you about obvious errors, but also point to code, which may be syntactically correct, but potentially dangerous or simply wrong. <br><br>  <b>"Sparkling daggers" or as we did the Arab project</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177477/">Rus</a> <br>  It all began more than optimistic: customers from the UAE (a new market for us), a presentable appearance of representatives, promises of other contracts, ‚Äúmoney is not a problem‚Äù.  All this in total has played a cruel joke with us and, to our misfortune, we subscribed to this development.  I wanted to try.  In the end, this turned into a termination of the contract unilaterally, but not from the client, but by us - an outsourcing company. <br><br>  <b>Package Manager for Xcode</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177775/">Rus</a> <br>  Today I found a project worthy of the attention of all developers writing for iOS / Mac OS and using XCode, the plugin manager for XCode.  The name of this project is Alcatraz.  Seeing this miracle, I immediately wanted to test it. <br><br>  <b>Apple reported on the results of the previous quarter</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/177779/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ff/a79/cdb/3ffa79cdb95d820b81bc6655c87e34aa.png"><br>  Revenue - 43.6 billion (more than last year's figure of 39.2 billion), profit - 9.5 billion dollars, which is less than the same quarter last year, when it received 11.6 billion.  For almost 10 years, this is the first time that quarterly profit is less than last year. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Google has banned applications that update to bypass Play</b> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">Angl</a> <br>  On Friday, the company updated the policies of the Play Store and banned apps from updating to bypass Google Play. <br><br>  <b>GameDev and the candelabrum: the story of the transfer "Mariage" on Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177467/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e8/201/87f/7e820187fc47c9b09acf1217126c881d.png" alt="image"><br>  For writing the game, one developer from Belarus was originally hired, who promised to release the application within two months, given that I provide him with a ready-made design.  At the same time, as far as possible, a colleague should help him.  The work was estimated at $ 2000 +% of sales.  After receiving an advance of $ 1000, work began to boil.  It was October 2011. <br><br>  <b>Basics of security of the Android operating system.</b>  <b>Native user space, part 2</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175517/">Part 1</a> / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176131/">Part 2</a> / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176631/">Part 3</a> <br>  In the second part, we will look at where system.img, userdata.img and cache.img come from, as well as how security is provided in the Native user space. <br><br>  <b>The crib on the graphic design of Android applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://petrnohejl.github.io/Android-Cheatsheet-For-Graphic-Designers/">Angl</a> <br>  Developer and designer Peter Noadzhl published "The crib for graphic design for Android."  In it, almost everything you need to know to create graphic elements of applications and design pages on Google Play. <br><br>  <b>NASA launched three smartphones into orbit</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177903/">Rus</a> <br>  Modern smartphones have reached the level of performance and reliability when they can already be used in space projects.  At least, this is what the agency NASA, which designed the three experimental satellite PhoneSat satellites running ordinary Nexus One smartphones, thinks so. <br><br>  <b>Fidonet's arrival on Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177785/">Rus</a> <br>  The Fidonet network in the twenty-third year of its existence in Russia comes to the Android operating system. <br><br>  <b>As I wrote Pacman'a, and what came of it.</b>  <b>Part 1</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178037/">Rus</a> <br>  Why Pacman?  The answer to this question is quite simple, and, perhaps, has already flashed in the thoughts of someone from the readers.  Yes, quite right, it was a test task for the ZeptoLab company.  From the requirements of this task, the tools used in the development are clear: Android NDK, C ++, OpenGL. <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br><br>  <b>Nokia: quarterly results</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177419/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d4/a39/3af/3d4a393af5b1169396aed798a284876e.png" alt="image"><br>  The results, of course, were predictable, but, it seems to me, it is worth stopping their attention.  Therefore, I prepared a brief overview of the situation for those who might be interested in this subject. <br><br><h4>  Firefox os </h4><br><br>  <b>The first phones on Firefox OS dispersed in a few hours</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177747/">Rus</a> <br>  Madrid startup Geeksphone today launched the sale of the first phones for developers on Firefox OS - Keon models for $ 119 and more powerful Peak for $ 194 (without reference to the operator).  According to TechCrunch, these are in principle the first devices with Firefox OS on board, and both phones were sold out a few hours after the start of sales. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>Facebook bought Parse backend for third-party mobile apps</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178053/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca6/869/569/ca6869569d9090eb91a7479becfebbc3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The social network allegedly bought a startup Parse, which develops a cloud backend for mobile applications, for $ 85 million (mBaaS: mobile-backend-as-a-service).  The deal was officially announced today both on the Parse blog and on Facebook. <br><br>  <b>Unity3d stops supporting Flash</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177881/">Rus</a> <br>  The Unity team made a difficult decision to abandon Flash.  As a result, the sale of licenses for this platform stops, support remains for 4.x. <br><br>  <b>Themes design.</b>  <b>Blackjack and WeakReference</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/178061/">Rus</a> <br>  Once I faced the task of making theme support in an Android application.  About what was achieved and how it was implemented - in the article. <br><br>  <b>NARR8 launches online editor to create interactive stories.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/narr8-online-redaktor.html">Rus</a> <br>  Online editor of interactive stories will be available to users in May.  Content authors will get a handy tool with a simple and intuitive interface that includes a large collection of sounds, backgrounds, images and effects. <br><br>  <b>Pathmapp Launches Real-Time Test Platform for iOS Applications</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/pathmapp-zapuskaet.html">Rus</a> <br>  Pathmapp decided to create their own solution that would allow developers to test different designs and apply them in real time.  After last year's debut at TechCrunch Disrupt in San Francisco, today, a startup officially launched the platform for A / B testing native iOS applications, allowing mobile developers to optimize their applications without having to significantly change their workflow or usage experience. <br><br>  <b>Application Tests at Little Eye Labs</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.littleeye.co/">Angl</a> <br>  Little Eye records everything that happens on the screen, as well as tracks other less noticeable indicators, such as memory usage and data transfer volume.  After the test is completed, it displays graphics and video that can help developers understand what happened while the application was running. <br><br>  <b>PlaneQuest: physical toys on tablets</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tablettop/planequest-where-miniatures-tablets-tablettop-gami">Angl</a> <br>  The PlaneQuest project aims to open a new game mode in which players can interact with the tablet application using TabletTop Miniatures (TTMs) - toy figures with a special conductive base, thus connecting the physical and digital world. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br><br>  <b>How the glasses are arranged Google Glass</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177859/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6c/816/1ad/e6c8161adc9904d822183f7b104cd83a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Great infographics on Google‚Äôs ‚Äúcomputerized‚Äù glasses. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>Peter Molyneu pushed two options for monetization in Curiosity</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/177415/">Rus</a> <br>  In the last update, the author added to the built-in purchases the ability not only to delete cube elements, but also vice versa - to increase them back.  For different amounts, you can add from 10 to 500 thousand items. <br><br>  <b>Opera: iOS remains the leader in mobile advertising</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/ios-ostaetsya-liderom-v-mobilnoy-reklame.html">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba6/683/e4a/ba6683e4aa1aa4554c8faf5e9cfe1770.png"><br>  Opera has just published its latest State of Mobile Advertising report for the first quarter of 2013.  According to this report, the iPhone regained first place in terms of advertising, selecting it from Android.  As well as iOS continues to hold the first place among the platforms in terms of monetization. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178227/</a></p>
