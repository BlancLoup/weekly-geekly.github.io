  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the secure smartphone DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator: outlast everyone!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You may have heard about the brand DEXP.  He is still young, but he is actively conquering the market.  It owns the brand of the largest Russian electronics retailer DNS (over 1,200 outlets in 421 cities).  The company was founded in Vladivostok and eventually "sold out" throughout Russia.  The main focus of its activities is on the inhabitants of the regions, and not on the jaded metropolitan residents.  For these reasons, the DEXP brand was created, under which the company brings quality smartphones to the Russian Federation at affordable prices.  The trick here is that DNS is a very, very large network with a serious turn.  In the DNS, they don‚Äôt spend power and money on ‚Äúmaking their way‚Äù with their devices on the counters of other hardware stores (and oh, how not cheap - plus significantly affects the prices of products for the consumer).  There is a network - and DEXP devices, by and large, only in it are sold.  And at very tasty prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0c/198/0d5/b0c1980d51b668950d4e60aedd0e10a3.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last year, DEXP introduced the Ixion line of smartphones.  This is a ‚Äúcollection‚Äù of Android-backgrounds with different technical characteristics, and one thing unites them - an increased battery capacity.  This solution is a novelty for the Russian market.  The manufacturer for the first time gave consumers a large selection of ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù smartphones.  The line is sold successfully.  It is not surprising that it is constantly expanding.  In the fall of 2015, another 8 models were added to the collection.  The most curious of them is the DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator protected smartphone.  The device is not afraid of diving into the water (to a depth of one meter) and dust.  Protection class - IP67.  Let's finally get acquainted with the "Dominator" in detail. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator is supplied in a black and blue box familiar to DEXP.  In it you will find the smartphone itself, unpretentious headphones, charging and data cable, instructions and warranty, as well as a removable antenna for using the device as a walkie-talkie and a screwdriver to remove the back cover.

Not.  He is just huge!  Especially when you consider that the screen has a diagonal of only 4.5 inches.  This "brick", in thickness - like three ordinary smartphones.  However, there can be no other, because before us is a shock-resistant device in a powerful rubberized case.  Using smartphones with one hand is quite difficult.  Well, except that you have a very big hand.  It should be understood that this device is not for everyone, but only for those whose work or hobbies are associated with some kind of extreme.  That is for builders, fishermen, climbers, loggers and so on.  Convenience here fades into the background, most importantly - endurance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11a/f54/102/11af541023dd90b6417c8e1bdf100f60.jpg"><br><br>  DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator reliably lies in a palm thanks to the rubberized case.  The material is "hard", while not covered with scratches or fingerprints.  The design of the tube as a whole can be described as brutal, but bright. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/790/aec/add/790aecadd1d318a0a4197dd223c31a56.jpg"><br><br>  The front panel has a yellow edging and is protected by Gorilla Glass 2. Above the screen are the speaker, front camera, light and proximity sensors, below the display is a microphone.  Control buttons on-screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c9/68f/b76/2c968fb76fb1e7f8a18a075c4ec937e2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3e/db4/c31/e3edb4c31a562877cf66f634eac4e35c.jpg"><br><br>  The yellow border of the screen is not just a design element.  It is also rubberized and stands a couple of millimeters above the screen.  Thereby it protects the display glass from scratches and other damages when falling on hard surfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/018/ade/832/018ade8321de32f407ba6bd46b499f1e.jpg"><br><br>  On the back panel there is a camera and a flash (also a flashlight) sunk deep into the case, the speaker cuts.  Part of the back cover is removed.  It is mounted mega-securely on 6 bolts (for their unscrewing and need a screwdriver).  Under it you will find two microSIM slots, a slot for microSD and a battery-brick (4,200 mAh - no joke!). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ae/815/932/0ae81593280b5d9cf81e4cb470b67dd2.jpg"><br><br>  It‚Äôs worth taking a look at the removable cover.  Firstly, it has a plastic frame inside.  This frame falls exactly into the rubber seal of the battery compartment, thus ensuring the tightness of the inside of the phone.  Secondly, the bolts are firmly held in the removed socket, that is, it is unrealistic to lose them. <br><br>  On the left side of the phone - the volume control keys, as well as the camera launch button.  The camera button when pressed twice turns on the laser pointer (its ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù is located on the upper end of the smartphone).  The keys are built into the rubber casing of the device for tightness, so they are pressed quite tightly, but clearly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/878/bda/7b2/878bda7b2025ba3419c35e577f127059.jpg"><br><br>  On the top of the phone is the aforementioned laser, the on / off key, and the antenna connector hidden under the plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c04/775/5cb/c047755cb51b0025536910083e49e87f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/6eb/e8e/8f86ebe8ed43199e246e59572f0f0fdf.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side of the device are three more keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c03/1c9/1ce/c031c91cef7f86e51f1aed6c75c2a459.jpg"><br><br>  One is SOS (an emergency alert option for loved ones, more familiar to the "grandmothers", but for travelers or workers in dangerous professions, too, will come in handy), the second is turning on the flashlight, the third is activating the connection by radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb5/c16/665/bb5c16665a3ef7ba60790767e2b5a923.png"><br><br>  At the bottom of the phone under the massive stub with special "teeth" hiding the headphone output and microUSB connector.  It is quite convenient to use this plug, since the developers have well thought out the opening / closing mechanism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/313/0da/67f/3130da67f99695403701413a40ea9cb5.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cover there are two slots for SIM-cards and one for the microSD card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb0/be0/53a/bb0be053a8da45d064db89125b981431.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2d/cdb/61f/c2dcdb61fdcc1509a7d69314cfa3f615.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Display </h2><br>  The DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator uses an IPS matrix without an air gap.  We liked everything - juicy shades, high brightness, maximum viewing angles.  The resolution is 960 x 540 pixels, and at a diagonal of 4.5 inches, the grain is not striking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d6/5ff/270/0d65ff270e715dfe872eece5c0aed634.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  The main camera has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  The module provides pictures and videos of good quality.  It focuses and shoots quickly, the photos are clear, the colors are ‚Äúalive‚Äù.  Although such a brutal machine was created clearly not for highly artistic photos.  Like not for selfies.  However, the 2 megapixel front camera allows you to make decent quality shots or chat over video. <br><br>  Examples of photos from the main camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d6/3b3/c9a/3d63b3c9ad3b60a10dcc5f1e27ea5500.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f8/b35/d18/8f8b35d18d5558aa00f98f52eea04858.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dab/ac6/f4c/dabac6f4ce13fdc82dafde5d7459b438.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a0/c44/899/6a0c448993f8f5ed9a058c3e67dea0b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a37/62f/19a/a3762f19a00340c163a4c1a22572ed59.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/104/db6/08a/104db608aecf17bb11b13361926a45e5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46d/181/308/46d181308cf18d3881bee73db8586706.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Hardware platform </h2><br>  In DEXP, they were so carried away by the protection of the device that they left the iron ‚Äústuffing‚Äù with residual attention.  The smartphone runs on a 4-core MediaTek MT6589 chip (1.2 GHz cores).  He was announced in 2013.  On the other hand, the amount of "RAM" is quite acceptable for this screen resolution - 1 GB. <br><br>  We do not claim that Dominator is ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù.  With normal use, everything is bright.  The interface works smoothly, applications start and switch without problems.  A lot of tabs in the browser or downloading / updating a large number of programs can make the device a bit ‚Äútwitch‚Äù, but this is not critical.  HD video is played without any complaints.  But modern 3D games like Asphalt 8 or Dead Trigger 2 will start without obvious lags only at the minimum graphics level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/094/340/2d8094340d1a542558e52c9795154d36.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/154/61d/fab/15461dfab698a8f409db8d1ce19c48c0.png"><br><br>  On the other hand, we do not have a gaming smartphone.  And if you want to play cards or ‚Äúevil birds‚Äù to leave the campaign, there are no problems with casual games. <br><br>  In the benchmarks "Dominator", of course, also does not shine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa0/073/e1f/aa0073e1f8d1d3612912539a647622c6.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/971/e5d/d23/971e5dd237565a29a464d03d44c4648c.png" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/d54/3d5/cd4d543d5df3dacd429c99624488170a.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40e/230/466/40e2304661bc29ed6b8efb366efdbd2c.png" width="350"><br><br>  The amount of flash memory - 8 GB.  In reality, a little more than half is available, the rest is ‚Äúeaten up‚Äù by the OS.  If you actively listen to music or watch videos, then 8 "gigs" will obviously not be enough.  A slot for memory cards (up to 32 GB) is always at your service.  Among other features - Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n.  The navigation module determines the position quickly and clearly.  There is support for 3G and two slots for SIM-cards - in general, the standard set for such smartphones. <br><br>  Unusual option - Walkie-Talkie, to put it simply - work as a walkie-talkie.  Standard - UHF 400-470 MHz, power 1 watt.  Travelers and all sorts of extremes sure to come in handy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/309/fb4/efd/309fb4efdcbe1ed519bce7122678325b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93c/c39/2f9/93cc392f9fb498b5a4c891985ddc6ce7.jpg"><br><br>  Recall that to use the radio, you must attach the antenna from the kit.  It looks cool - the tube begins to resemble telephone bricks from the 90s! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e4/7c4/949/5e47c49494155e5288e81453f0e9c810.png"></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef5/6a8/fa1/ef56a8fa1d2f2cbe71ee1c4555ce9ae3.png"><br><br>  Dominator also has a built-in magnetic sensor.  This means that he has a full-fledged compass, and not digital, like other smartphones.  "Hikers" is also useful.  The sound in the headphones or the speaker did not cause us complaints.  Especially note the very, very high volume.  When talking, too, everything is fine - voice transmission and audibility at the level. <br><br><h2>  Software part </h2><br>  Due to the use of the old chipset, the OS version is outdated - Android 4.2.  Updates, most likely, will not.  We believe that the main audience of the device is not critical - all the current software on the 4th version works and will work for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74f/9a1/681/74f9a1681ec1c4b9b1122dae8eb34309.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c71/f3b/1a3/c71f3b1a3c9713e51a6bf8d832ef7e7b.png" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2be/a5d/a2d/2bea5da2dbebcb957c06e9c87f2c3c57.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/70d/51a/8ed/70d51a8ed1e42a5fc1c286115374db65.png" width="350"><br><br><h2>  Battery </h2><br>  If you have not forgotten, our ‚ÄúDominator‚Äù refers to the series of ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù DEXP Ixion smartphones.  And the battery capacity of 4,200 mAh covers all its disadvantages.  As for the hardware, the device is rather weak - an old chipset, a low resolution of the screen, so there is nothing much to eat the battery.  In the standard usage scenario (every day 30-40 minutes of calls, 1-2 hours of the Internet, periodic GPS launch to build a route, often listening to music, reading or casual games, a few photos), the phone lasted for 3-5 days!  If you go online and use various programs even less often, then 7-8 days on one charge is a reality! <br><br>  A few more measurements: <br><br>  ‚óè Internet surfing via Wi-Fi - up to 14 hours. <br>  ‚óè View HD-video - up to 16 hours. <br>  ‚óè Reading - up to 20 hours. <br>  ‚óè Listening to music with the screen off - up to 42 hours. <br>  ‚óè Casual game - up to 15 hours. <br>  ‚óè 3D game - up to 9 hours. <br><br>  In general, with the DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator, you can go to the farthest hike and climb the highest mountain. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  DEXP turned out to be a great smartphone for a certain category of users.  He is super-mega-durable (checked and dropped!), Not afraid of water (yes, and drowned) and dust.  And it also has a 4,200 mAh battery and can lend on one charge for more than a week!  The tube is perfect for travelers, lovers of extreme tourism and various active sports, for employees of difficult and dangerous professions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fc/599/2f2/0fc5992f2e26ed1987221208fa82b063.jpg"><br><br>  Just imagine - you went on a hunt and got lost.  Launched a compass or maps with GPS - oriented.  If dark - turn on the flashlight (it is very bright).  If there are your colleagues somewhere, and the cellular connection does not ‚Äúcatch‚Äù, they contacted them by radio.  They saw the helicopter - they highlighted it with a laser pointer so that they would notice you.  Everything is very bad, are you exhausted?  Press the SOS button and notify your relatives or colleagues.  In the end, they dropped the device into a dirty marsh - they caught it, poured water from a bottle and went on to hunt further.  Cool stuff for real men! <br><br>  We also mention the high volume of sound, high-quality materials of the case, reliable assembly, good cameras, excellent IPS-screen, a large number of keys on the sides of the case for switching on various options. <br><br>  Are there any downsides?  First, the device is too big and fat.  But a super strong phone cannot be thin and elegant.  Secondly, the 4-core chipset is weak and old by today's standards and, as a result, an irrelevant version of Android.  But the target audience of the protected tube is hardly critical.  The device costs 15,990 rubles.  Obviously, most of the amount is not for the standard "stuffing", but for a very reliable case and additional chips like radio, laser, magnetic sensor, emergency alert option, etc. <br><br>  DEXP Ixion P145 Dominator really stand any extreme tests.  And help them withstand you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369267/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369267/</a></p>
