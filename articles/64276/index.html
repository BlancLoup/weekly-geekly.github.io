  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Harsh everyday service engineer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I had a chance to work for some time in such a mysterious field of activity as ‚Äúinstallation of commercial equipment, service and 1C franchisee‚Äù.  In practice, this means that you (with a partner) rush like crazy bees around the city and establish another outlet or repair broken equipment in an already running one.  By the degree of nervousness, this position takes place exactly between a sysadmin in a bank and an enikeyshchik in the office: the responsibility is like the first, and the level of knowledge of users is worse than the second.  Awful combination. <br><br>  Perhaps many of these stories seem trite.  And there is.  But someone can suddenly feel and decide to try yourself in this area.  Or decide to absolutely definitely never try.  It's not bad too.  Although the main goal of this topic is to tell how someone works, so that you can later buy bread at a department store or beer in your favorite bar.  Rather, so you can sell them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To be honest, all this mysterious technology, standing under the counters, most often is no different from the one that stands under your table.  Except for fiscal registrars and some other small things.  But this is not easier for anyone.  Never, never go to such a position, if there are any others.  They can pay well for all this, but no salary pays for the arrival of another representative of the beautiful accounting floor, for whom ‚Äúsomething does not work‚Äù.  And these unforgettable calls from bars and convenience stores ...

      ‚ÄúThis is B ****** (names are reasonably censored).  Our ticket office flew, it does not send data. ‚Äù <br>  "What time is it?  Nine in the evening?  The most influx of visitors?  Now we will ... " <br>  Gentlemen bartenders dragged keg with beer and gently slammed it on a handyly folded wire at the bottom of the ticket office.  The wire is not simple, but gold ... I mean, not a network card, but a real COM.  Only in the cash machine, by the way, which is a regular computer in a compact package.  And what will happen to him after bridging all the wiring, I think, is understandable.  One chip just exploded, and what a miracle the rare mother didn't fly - is unknown.  Fortunately, there was only one PCI available, into which they plugged a board with two ports, strictly forbidding to repeat such experiments. <br><br>  "Hello, this is A ****, when you run the trading hall in our place?" <br>  The product in this beautiful store is so stormy that the chef - 1Snik - has been fighting for the ‚ÄúTrade 7.7‚Äù configuration for the second week.  Why all this does not work out of the box, science is unknown.  And the work, by the way, is worth it.  Although we have already installed the most common PC in the hall, we connected it with a network to the accounting department (which required a vitukha to go under the false ceiling and drill four walls of awesome length with a drill) and now we are trying to teach the skills of working with the Shaitan machine of two saleswomen.  The girls seem to understand everything.  What a blessing ... Only two days later, it turns out that all the bookkeeping is moving to the other end of the building. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHello, this is A *******, we are shocked by your equipment, come!‚Äù. <br>  Convulsively I think, where and what was not grounded when passing the accounting.  Everything seems to be in order ... but you never know?  I come, sit down in the place of an accountant (stern aunt in years and dimensions).  Ay!  Indeed, beats.  Nowhere is a trace of a cliff, sockets made from 220 here are made before us, but from a pair of ethernet so frustrating should not.  Suspiciously I look at the systemists and immediately pay attention to the freshly washed floor and the telephone wire stretching along the plinth.  And then the thought works quickly.  The cleaner ‚Äî oh, that terrible sleep of an IT professional ‚Äî neatly chopped the wire with a mop, and he whipped it onto the wet floor, and from there - along the metal legs of a cheap chair.  You start after this believe in coincidence. <br><br>  "Hello" - and this is the chef.  - ‚ÄúThey brought us a ticket office here, it does not work.  Understand. <br>  That's because bad luck: the "cashier" is a monoblock computer with a touchscreen, card reader, barcode scanner, the devil in a mortar.  And the information on how to disassemble this thing has to be searched for a long time on the network, it is not possible to crack it with a raid.  And, just flew hard.  Nothing replaceable.  Let's pull out one of the four, put in the desktop, acting as an accounting machine in the same store.  Or was it a restaurant?  Who sold them a system with four hard drives, but without a cdrom (corny there is no place left on the cable), considering that actually the bookkeeping and music collection for the soul, along with backups, takes as much as 25 gig out of 500?  Ah, some kind of "office that was before us" ... <br><br>  Yes, if another firm ‚Äúled‚Äù to you the store, you need to prepare for surprises.  Break the twisted pair, and then push the bad twist into the channel in the wall so that it is not visible?  Configure 1C backup to hard with the base itself?  Glue gun barcode scanner to the table with superglue - ‚Äúnot to be stolen‚Äù?  This is all your predecessors will provide. <br><br>  There is no worse moment in the installer‚Äôs life than trying without noise and dust - in the direct sense of the word - to stretch a whistle on a plasterboard ceiling in an expensive clothing store.  Well, who, for the sake of some computer programmer, would take dozens of black suits from hangers, in fact?  And plaster dust is pouring, pouring ... <br><br>  Although no, it is worse.  For example, to assemble a computer on an ATX board in an AT-box package.  Yes, yes, even with a large round hole under the keyboard connector.  It had to cram as many as three PCI cards, which is rare for a cash register machine.  And when transporting two of them fell out of the connectors and burnt these connectors along with them to hell grandmother when first turned on.  Who came up with a brilliant idea to save on the body?  Well, I do not exactly collectors. <br><br>  Or trying to figure out what's all the same buggy in an old brand POS from HP, built on some strange microATX.  Both its COM ports refused to be friends with the electronic scoreboard, giving out krakozyabry and curling the entire machine.  The cause was never found. <br><br>  Well, stories about store owners trying to spend as little money as possible on the equipment are a topic for a completely separate article.  Although it happens the other way around: the spectacle of the <b>licensed</b> <a href="http://www.kerio.ru/ru/firewall">Kerio Winroute Firewall</a> in the design office for three cars was very pleased.  "What for?!".  "And that was ... we were advised."  More than 300 euros, as a garbage question. <br><br>  In general, a good job.  Weaning to be surprised at trifles, and even very little seems ridiculous after her.  Like after the army. <br>  Good luck to you.  And smart users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64276/</a></p>
