  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who "goes to the clouds": Western IT startups that use virtual infrastructure</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is predicted that by 2020 the volume of the cloud computing market <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/10/amazon-google-make-next-100-billion/">will reach</a> $ 121 billion. By that time, 80% of US small businesses <a href="https://www.intuit.com/company/press-room/press-releases/2014/IntuitStudyShowsHowtheCloudWillTransformSmallBusinessby2020/">will switch</a> to a virtual infrastructure.  Already, there is a tendency to migrate startups to IaaS. <br><br>  Andrew Chen (Andrew Chen), an investor and consultant for such technology projects as Dropbox, Product Hunt and Tinder, <a href="http://andrewchen.co/startups-are-cheaper-to-build-more-expensive-to-grow/">suggested</a> that startups are cheaper to build than to scale - the costs for employees and marketing are growing. <br><br>  However, the cost of virtual infrastructure only <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/business/21648685-cloud-computing-prices-keep-falling-whole-it-business-will-change-cheap-convenient">becomes cheaper</a> .  In an attempt to attract companies from among the "unicorns", providers reduce the cost of services for them.

      What major foreign startups have already switched to virtual infrastructure?  Why was it profitable for them?  Understand below. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/345408/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/co/lj/pccoljvsbqeik0i8vlqku84udoi.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582-%25D1%258F%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-2004655/">jahiro97430</a> <a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/service/terms/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Who chooses the virtual infrastructure </h2><br>  Earlier this year, the company that manages the instant messenger service Snapchat, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-02/snap-signed-five-year-2-billion-deal-to-use-google-s-cloud">signed an agreement</a> with Google.  Under the terms of the deal, Snap is committed to spending at least $ 400 million a year for five years on Google‚Äôs cloud services. <br><br>  Snapchat uses virtual infrastructure for most of its <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14661126/snap-snapchat-ipo-spending-2-billion-google-cloud">operations</a> : data storage and management, analysis and security.  On the eve of the IPO Snap, it also became <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/2/9/14555202/snap-amazon-google-cloud-services-deal">aware</a> of a similar deal of the company with Amazon worth $ 1 billion. <br><br>  Thus, over the next five years, Snapchat <a href="https://siliconangle.com/blog/2017/02/09/move-google-snap-big-cloud-deal-amazon/">will spend</a> $ 3 billion to launch and maintain its services in the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/lc/16/eelc169rdrfiat7htbocdnyl7ly.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="">Marco Verch</a> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Reusing_content_outside_Wikimedia">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  A year earlier, Netflix completed its long migration to Amazon‚Äôs virtual infrastructure.  From 2016, all important processes - from managing streaming video to behavioral analytics and employee and customer data management - <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/02/11/netflix-shuts-down-final-bits-of-own-data-center-infrastructure">occur</a> in the cloud.  Netflix <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-intuit-juniper-go-all-in-on-amazon-cloud-2016-1">decided to</a> reduce the number of its own data centers with a more active transition to leased capacity.  In addition, the service develops CDN <a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com/Open-Connect-Overview.pdf">Open Connect</a> . <br><br>  In 2016, after seven years of its existence, Uber also <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-outsourcing-infrastructure-to-public-cloud-2016-5">decided to switch</a> to cloud infrastructure.  The main functions of the application <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/19/wtf-is-cloud-computing/">form a</a> single service ordering a taxi in a virtual environment.  Uber has not yet made a choice in favor of this or that supplier, so the main market players are fighting for the maintenance of the company, which is present in 70 countries of the world. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2015/09/10/airbnb-shares-the-keys-to-its-infrastructure/">According to</a> Mike Curtis (Mike Curtis), vice president of technology at Airbnb, their service for accommodation and short-term rental housing since its inception has been working on a virtual infrastructure.  In 2008, a young startup chose a cloud instead of its own equipment, and today not a single member of the Airbnb technical team <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2375303/cloud-computing/how-airbnb-used-amazon-web-services-to-conquer-the-rental-market.html">spends time</a> servicing corporate servers. <br><br>  In early 2016, Google <a href="https://news.spotify.com/us/2016/02/23/announcing-spotify-infrastructures-googley-future/">announced</a> its move to the virtual infrastructure of the streaming service Spotify.  Up to this point, he rented space in data centers or acquired server and network equipment to be closer to his customers. <br><br>  Another streaming service - Hulu - this year <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-infrastructure-is-now-behind-three-main-streaming-media-providers/">transferred</a> its key services and applications to the AWS infrastructure.  Through the cloud, Hulu broadcasts its video content in a Live TV format. <br><br><h2>  Why projects choose IaaS </h2><br><h5>  1. Flexibility </h5><br>  In most of these examples, one way or another, the decision on migration is associated with growth problems.  As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/02/22/could-snapchat-have-saved-money-by-building-its-own-cloud-infrastructure-instead-of-paying-google/">noted by</a> Yishan Wong, the former CEO of Reddit, at the early stage of a startup‚Äôs life, a virtual infrastructure is a reasonable solution.  While the amount of permanent computing resources for service maintenance is unknown, it is difficult to predict the load drops.  The cloud leaves the possibility of scaling. <br><br>  For example, at the time of the final transition from Netflix to AWS, the service <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/02/11/netflix-shuts-down-final-bits-of-own-data-center-infrastructure">had</a> eight times more clients than in 2008 when the migration began.  The company has attracted 75 million subscribers from 130 countries, the application is constantly changing, more and more functions are being added, and the volume of data is growing.  <a href="http://www.computerweekly.com/news/4500273047/Netflix-is-now-100-all-in-on-the-AWS-cloud">According to</a> Netflix, vice president of cloud solutions development, Yury Izrailevsky, supporting such rapid growth of the service would be extremely difficult based on its own data centers. <br><blockquote>  "The flexibility of the cloud allows us to add thousands of virtual servers and petabytes of memory within a few minutes, which makes such an expansion possible," said Izrailevsky. </blockquote>  The transition to the cloud also <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-intuit-juniper-go-all-in-on-amazon-cloud-2016-1">allowed the</a> company to reduce costs, but Yuri sees this as a side positive effect.  Willingness to scale has become a major accomplishment of Netflix. <br><br><h5>  2. Availability </h5><br>  Turning to the IaaS provider, Uber <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-outsourcing-infrastructure-to-public-cloud-2016-5">thinks</a> first of all about geographic expansion and resiliency.  For example, Uber traditionally <a href="https://eng.uber.com/tech-stack-part-one/">used a</a> hybrid cloud model to avoid problems with accessibility for users - if one data center fails, it is ‚Äúinsured‚Äù by the data center from another city.  Now the company is ready to transfer the authority to the IaaS provider and diversify the load on its servers. <br><br>  In the case of Hulu, the <a href="http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/platforms/hulu-rolls-amazon-s-video-cloud/167876">choice of the</a> provider freed the company from the need to create its own data centers, and the Live TV product was able to quickly enter the market and become accessible to a larger audience.  IaaS provides all the requirements for streaming video, the availability of which is just as important as the timely taxi call in the case of Uber. <br><br><h5>  3. Release of resources </h5><br>  Mike Curtis <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/2375303/cloud-computing/how-airbnb-used-amazon-web-services-to-conquer-the-rental-market.html">explains</a> why Airbnb works in a public cloud with a desire to concentrate all efforts on solving problems unique to a startup.  A technical team can develop new products instead of maintaining servers.  The advantage of Airbnb is that the company immediately began working in the cloud, so that it did not need to migrate further. <br><br><h5>  4. Work with data </h5><br>  Npole Harteau, vice president of infrastructure solutions at Spotify, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2016/02/29/why-spotify-really-chose-google-cloud/">said</a> that the decision to switch to Google‚Äôs clouds was made because of the tools for working with data.  Spotify <a href="https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/02/Spotify-chooses-Google-Cloud-Platform-to-power-data-infrastructure.html">offers</a> personalized playlists for millions of people around the world.  According to Google, ‚Äúthe migration to virtual infrastructure allowed the company to update the technology stack, replacing Hadoop, MapReduce, Hive and a number of custom tools for data collection with more modern and efficient counterparts‚Äù - namely, Google designs. <br><br><hr><br>  So, Western companies, moving to the "cloud", choose flexibility, accessibility and the ability to fully focus on their own developments. <br><br>  Reducing costs for them is rather a pleasant side effect. <br><br>  And what about Russia?  What guides domestic startups that have (for now) a little less opportunity than Netflix?  We will tell in our next material. <br><br><hr><br>  PS Here are some more posts from our corporate blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/funkcionalnost/iaas-pervye-shagi-posle-arendy-oblachnoj-infrastruktury/">First steps after renting cloud infrastructure</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/luchshie-praktiki-migracii-i-razvertyvaniya-infrastruktury-v-oblake-iaas/">Best Practices for Migrating and Deploying IaaS Cloud Infrastructure</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/razmeshhenie-biznes-kritichnyx-prilozhenij-v-iaas/">Placing business-critical applications in the IaaS cloud: what to look for</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345408/</a></p>
