  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where in Russia from bachelor to quality pump to the IT-master?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all farmers. <br>  I re-read the information about IT education, because lately it has been worrying me a lot: just a year left before I write my diploma (!!!), and then I will become a bachelor of mathematics.  Here I came across <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/126619/">an article</a> just written about me and those like me: <br>  She struck a chord.  And I decided, based on her, to roll my own, as a continuation of reflection - where to go IT bachelors.  In my opinion, training in the IT-magistracy is a good prospect.  But only, I think, not all graduate schools are equally useful, but only those that can give really high-quality training, so that later it would be possible and able to work. <br>  Considering that only good practices can give good practice, I went into the depths of the global network to find in Russia (for the time being, I didn‚Äôt really want to go abroad) for magistracies supported by serious IT offices. <br>  For several hours I honestly watched what falls on the search engines for requests: <b>‚ÄúIT master's program‚Äù</b> , <b>‚Äúmaster's degree IT‚Äù</b> and similar keywords. <br>  And I made the following label out of everything I collected: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/771/c74/825/771c7482540a167bc50983fe592fae2a.png"></a> <br><br><br><h4>  Wherefore, briefly summarizing what I did. </h4><br><br><h5>  Information Management </h5><br>  I found this magistracy through the site of a certain IT Academy company, which is engaged in distance learning.  Everything seems to be very tempting, but the courses are not about software development, but about its sales, implementation, and analysis of the IT technology market.  Organized on the basis of MISiS.  By the way, do not consider it a PR, but on the <a href="http://www.academy.it.ru/ru/program/school/business/magistr/index.php%3Fproduct_id4%3D8401">site of</a> this very MISiS there are so many different magistracies in various scientific fields that I really wanted to try to learn there.

    <h5>  Information Management - <b>part two</b> </h5><br>  The only one, judging by the information of the <a href="http://www.itmane.ru/msc-it">website of the RANEPA</a> , the specialty here is the head of the information service.  During the course of study, it is proposed to take courses in Research Methods in Management, Company Development Management, Electronic Marketing, IT Strategies and Business Strategies of the Company, after which, as the Academy confidently states in the Academy, graduates become ‚Äúbusiness leaders‚Äù because they do not just ticks, ‚Äùand get knowledge by working. <br><br><h5>  Master in Moscow State University </h5><br>  Supported by the SAP University Alliance.  <a href="http://erp.cmc.msu.ru/">They promise paradise</a> , but for 400 thousand.  On the other hand, in the quality of this educational paradise, I have little doubt.  On the third hand, it is not entirely clear who I will become after all - a manager-implementer, or a developer?  Disciplines are a lot of both plans.  We were pleased with the availability of the Employment block with links to different companies.  Upset the exorbitant cost of training. <br><br><h5>  Mathematical and computer software </h5><br>  At the request of the ‚ÄúIT Master's Program‚Äù, this was exactly the <a href="http://www.skbkontur.ru/education/programs/prepodavanie">first link</a> .  The announcement promises to teach and from the Microsoft Innovation Center, SKB Kontur, RAS.  The system is as follows: the Masters degree in Computer Science at Mathematical Institute of UrFU (Ekaterinburg) is taken, and all sorts of goodies like ‚ÄúCompetitive, multi-threaded programming‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevelopment under conditions of changing requirements‚Äù and the like are added to it  And like, all for free.  There are two stages of selection, but in general the requirements are adequate.  They are my favorites so far, because, in fact, this is the only required master degree not in the ‚Äúcapitals‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  Masters from IBS </h5><br>  I am dragged from them.  Realistically.  Each direction of the magistracy is supervised by some department of the company, the top 10 interns are immediately recruited, students are paid a high stipend, they receive up to the line of certificates of real value and certificates.  It is implemented on the basis of <a href="http://fibs.mipt.ru/">MIPT</a> and <a href="http://ibs.misis.ru/index.php">MISiS</a> , but alas, oh!  I do not have 300 000 rubles!  And another specialty - IT consulting and analytics - is not quite desirable ... <br><br><h5>  Independent Moscow Institute </h5><br>  Who does not know <a href="http://ium.mccme.ru/">what kind of institution this</a> is - shame on you and shame (and also, cons in karma!) NMI is my old dream.  Unfortunately, pure science is taught here, but on a level that I am not sure if I could pass at least one session here.  And most importantly, this paradise for geeks and nerds is free. <br><br><h5>  School of Data Analysis </h5><br>  I am sure everyone knows what it is, but just in case, I repeat.  It is organized by <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/">Yandex</a> , among the three areas there are basic ones: ‚ÄúComputer Science‚Äù, of course, - ‚ÄúData Analysis‚Äù and the desired one - ‚ÄúSoftware Development‚Äù.  The study is organized, as I understand it, on the basis of MIPT, and at the end Yandex certificates are issued.  Internally in Russia in St. Petersburg and Moscow.  Is free.  Some solid pluses, except that it is not a master's program, but I, after all, do not want to join the army and want a diploma of a state unit. <br><br><h5>  Internet data analysis and artificial intelligence </h5><br>  A master's degree from the same Yandex, on the basis of HSE, should solve problems with the army.  On the <a href="http://ma.hse.ru/list">website of</a> this magistracy in the description of the department, there is a reference "further", but it is not pressed.  Instantly disappointed.  Information on the magistracy - zero.  In the lists of graduate students and teachers observed intersection with the SAD. <br><br>  Here is a brief overview.  In fact, I would like to see your comments: which masters and interesting programs I missed?  Suddenly, one of you is learning from these programs, or some other - what advice?  Where else can I learn to practice solving real problems? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139136/</a></p>
