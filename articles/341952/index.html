One will open the first day of the event, another will open at the beginning of the second! </p><br><h3>  Thomas Dallien (aka Halvar Flake) </h3><br><p>  <b>Machine learning, attack and the future of automation</b> </p><br><p>  Thomas Dallien began his activities in reverse engineering and technical means of copyright protection in the mid-90s.  Then he immediately began to use reverse engineering techniques to study vulnerabilities.  Thomas initiated the heap-exploitation of Windows, comparative analysis of patches and binary files, as well as a variety of other reverse engineering techniques.  In 2004, Halvar founded zynamics, a company specializing in reverse engineering technologies.  Meanwhile, his research on reverse engineering, the development of exploits using backward-oriented programming and knowledge management technologies applied to reverse engineering, continued to be published.  In 2011, ‚Äúzynamics‚Äù was acquired by ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù, and for several years that followed, Halvar was engaged in protecting technologies for big data and machine learning at every corner discussed at that time.  In 2015, Halvar received the Pwnie award and decided to take a year break to travel, read and cut the waves on the surf. </p><br><p>  In his report, Thomas Dallien will talk about machine learning and the upcoming fundamental changes in the field of IT today literally do not stop.  Although it is difficult to weed out the delusions and myths generated by the general agitation, it is obvious that computer technologies are increasingly moving to the level of abstractions for which classifiers are just as common as branching operators.  What about attack research?  Does at least the home business have immunity from automation?  Or will ‚ÄúAI‚Äù (in any of its manifestations) affect it?  Or maybe already influenced? </p><br><p>  This report will tell you what AlphaGo can teach us, and also identify those areas of the industry where machine learning will take a step forward in the coming years (although it is difficult to say how big it is). </p><br><h3>  Shay Heron </h3><br><p>  <b>Encrypted Memory Attacks: Beyond One Bit</b> </p><br><p>  Shay Geron is an associate professor of mathematical sciences at Haifa University, the head of engineering and technical services for cloud information security at Amazon.  Earlier, Shea was the chief engineer and senior cryptographer at Intel.  His areas of interest include cryptography, information security, and algorithmization.  Shea is the creator of such instruction sets for processors such as: AES-NI, PCLMULQDQ and seeing VPMADD52 in the near future, as well as various microarchitectural features that contributed to the acceleration of encryption algorithms.  He contributed to the development of open source libraries (OpenSSL, NSS), increasing the speed of symmetric encryption, algorithms using public keys and hashing.  Shay Heron was one of the architects of the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) technology and was responsible for its implementation and cryptography.  In addition, he became the creator of the Memory Encryption Engine. </p><br><p>  His report focuses on the security of user data in a virtualized cloud environment, which is a growing concern for both the users themselves and the providers of cloud providers.  The hypervisor provides the hosting administrator with the ability to read any memory area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe guest virtual machine. Consequently, there are no guarantees that the administrator does not use these capabilities to gain access to user data.  This threat is not prevented, even if the entire memory is encrypted with one (secret) key.  Guest virtual machines can be isolated from the administrator if the memory areas are encrypted with a unique key for each guest machine.  At the same time, the capabilities of the hypervisor in accessing memory will not be changed, and reading the memory of the virtual machine decrypts the encrypted data of the virtual machine with the wrong key, which does not give the attacker any advantage.  This is what guided the developers of technologies that are embedded in the latest processors. </p><br><p>  Anyway, the main idea and premise of this report is that any technology that uses unique encryption keys does not guarantee isolation of the administrator hypervisor from guest virtual machines.  As an illustrative example, a new type of attack ‚ÄúBlinded Random Block Corruption‚Äù (BRBC) will be demonstrated.  In the same scenario with unique encryption keys to a virtual machine, the attack allows the cloud provider to use the capabilities of a (trusted) hypervisor to log into the guest virtual machine (not to mention accessing the encrypted memory), which completely compromises the confidentiality of user data.  In addition, we will also demonstrate that even non-boolean values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be effectively attacked by attackers, in order to increase the privileges of processes running in protected virtual machines. </p><br><p>  This again suggests that memory encryption itself is not a defense-in-depth mechanism from attackers with read / write memory capabilities.  Greater security is achieved if the memory encryption mechanism includes an authentication mechanism. </p><br><h1><a name="main_track"></a>  Main track </h1><br><p>  In addition to keynote presentations, the main track can be heard reports from researchers from around the world.

But how much do you trust third-party solutions and products?  We want to share with you our Pentester experience how online chat rooms can broaden the attack surface on a company, its employees, customers and even the chat vendor itself.  Consider specific attacks for different platforms, from XSS to RCE, from the Web to mobile applications and desktops.  Minimum rocket science, easy report with bikes, real state of affairs and pentester tricks from the bins. <br>  A place for those who want to relax from the binarium and learn about real pentest cases. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/aleksej-tyurin/">Alexey Tyurin</a> <br>  <b>Another look at MitM HTTPS attacks</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The goal of TLS / HTTPS is to protect against MitM attacks.  We are used to looking at TLS / HTTPS attacks from a cryptographic perspective.  And if we take a look at TLS basic architectural solutions?  For example, the fact that certificate authentication is possible only to the level of a single host or - even more broadly - a group of hosts.  And if we recall that TLS / HTTPS is not some essence in a vacuum, and that modern systems are an interlacing of technologies, protocols and consist of many services, then by adding a little bit of logic and tricks, we will be able to conduct successful MitM -attack on https! </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speakers - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/yasil-spelman/">Yasil Spelman</a> , <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/brajan-gorents/">Brian Gorentz</a> and <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/abdul-aziz-hariri/">Abdul-Aziz Hariri</a> <br>  <b>For the Common Good: Using the VMware RPC Interface for Fun and Benefit</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Virtual machines play a crucial role in modern computing systems.  With their help, often isolate multiple clients on the same physical server.  Researchers and security experts use virtual machines to isolate potentially dangerous code, and then examine and analyze it.  It is assumed that when running on a virtual machine, potentially dangerous code cannot be executed anywhere else.  However, this method is not completely reliable, since vulnerabilities in the hypervisor of a virtual machine can open access to the entire system.  This scenario was once regarded only as hypothetical, but two independent demonstrations at the 2017 Pwn2Own conference showed that this was possible.  This report details the connections between nodes in VMware.  In addition, the presentation describes the functionality of the RPC interface.  We will discuss the methods of automatically intercepting or analyzing RPC requests sent from the guest OS to the main one.  We will also demonstrate how to create tools for sending requests to the RPC interface in C ++ and Python for fuzzing.  Finally, we will show how to use vulnerabilities like Use-After-Free in VMware by sequentially parsing the fixed vulnerability. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/mett-ou/">Matt Oy</a> <br>  <b>Recent exploit trends, counteraction and detection tactics</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  When high-level means of counteracting attacks are introduced into the system, attackers have to move away from traditional methods of exploitation.  The same happened with the release of Windows 10. Thanks to recent updates of attack prevention technologies, such as Control Flow Guard (CFG), the traditional methods for executing code by rewriting the function pointer are simply outdated.  So, there are three main trends in exploit development for Windows 10. <br><br>  Hunt for read-write primitives to get a full view of memory. <br>  Search for logical vulnerabilities and their exploitation. <br>  Using social engineering to execute malicious code. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/aleks-matrosov/">Alex Matrosov</a> <br>  <b>We betray the BIOS: what is wrong with the guardians of the BIOS</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> This presentation is intended to be a signal for hardware vendors, BIOS security researchers and security experts, as well as advanced stakeholders who want to know about current UEFI research and threats detected.  The situation is serious, but with the right tools and knowledge, we will prevail.  In recent years, the security situation of the UEFI firmware has become increasingly critical.  On the one hand, increased activity from the community of researchers of information security.  On the other hand, more and more information about implants for UEFI appears, for example, these are state-funded implants from HackingTeam.  Most often the information becomes public due to leaks, because there are no means for detecting implants for UEFI, and the implants themselves are used for targeted attacks. <br><br>  The role of UEFI in the world has grown significantly in recent years: the firmware is used in computers and laptops, smart devices, cars, drones, and so on.  Fortunately, UEFI security is also improving in many ways.  The level of security that is shown by modern suppliers of equipment for enterprises has grown significantly.  However, not all suppliers are the same.  Unfortunately, some of them do not use modern hardware protection, for example, the protection bits provided by Intel many years ago for SMM and SPI (BLE, BWE, PRx).  Since there is no active memory protection at the hardware level, the devices of these manufacturers become easy targets for attackers.  In my performance on Black Hat Asia this year, I showed these vulnerabilities by installing a permanent rootkit in SPI flash memory (on a computer with Microsoft Windows 10 and active Secure Boot). <br><br>  However, hardware manufacturers, such as Intel, introduced protection technologies, such as Boot Guard (starting with Haswell) and BIOS Guard (starting with Skylake).  When loading the platform, Boot Guard checks whether UEFI is on the list of trusted components of Secure Boot, and thus protects it from attacks using firmware.  With active BIOS Guard, only protected modules can modify flash memory with SPI, which protects against permanent implants.  Both technologies run on a separate processor, known as the ACM (Authenticated Code Module), which isolates them from intruders and protects against attacks in a race condition.  Such security technologies are sometimes referred to as UEFI rootkit killers.  There is no detailed information about these technologies. <br><br>  This presentation will talk about the specific possibilities of using them on hardware with the most advanced Intel processors, such as Skylake and Kaby Lake.  Most of the available information was obtained from UEFI firmware modules using reverse engineering.  These modules (DXE and PEI) can be started, configured and installed using the ACM code.  In addition, in the report I will address the weaknesses of such protective technologies.  What is wrong with the BIOS guardians?  How difficult is it to bypass such protection and install a permanent rootkit from the operating system?  You will get answers to these questions in the report. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/ralf-filipp-vajnmann/">Ralf-Phillip Weinmann</a> <br>  <b>ARM hardware tracing</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Iron tracing is a powerful means of obtaining coverage information throughout the system in real time and without wasting resources.  The ARM CoreSight architecture includes the Embedded Trace Macrocell technology, which allows access to the trace via the JTAG interface, exported via the ETM port, and reprogrammed to be executed only by software, while being stored in a ring buffer.  In Linux version 4.9 and higher, ETM-based tracing can be used without additional configuration, since ARM CoreSight is supported by the performance subsystem.  However, on other operating systems, low-level programming is required.  This report discusses the availability of ETM-based program execution tracing on systems based on ARMv7 and ARMv8 architectures, and also explains how to set up program tracing yourself and use code coverage information to improve fuzzer efficiency. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/dzhon-dunlap/">John Dunlap</a> <br>  <b>Jumping over the fence: comparing and possible improvements to existing JMP transition-oriented programming tools</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This report will demonstrate the tools created by the speaker for JOP attacks (Jump Oriented Programming).

For vulnerabilities that will allow you to remotely run the code in these applications are willing to pay up to $ 500,000. <br>  In this report, we will examine the surface of remote attacks on Android applications and smartphones, as well as smart devices.  Then we take a closer look at the many critical vulnerabilities for the implementation of remote attacks.  Among them: remote code execution, remote interception of control over the smartphone, remote control of a smart device, and so on.  We will be able to control the device through the open port vulnerability and even silently execute code through the pull protocol vulnerability. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/shtefan-gerling/">Stefan Gerling</a> <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/shtefan-gerling/"><br></a>  <b>Nightmare at the front door</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  We will talk in detail about electromechanical locks.

The method has already shown high effect.  This kind of phasers work with instrumented binary files, so the phaser can use code coverage information collected at runtime to change the input data to maximize code coverage. <br><br>  However, the foundation for most coverage-based fuzers is the instrumentation of the source code.  Great efforts are being made to bring this method to the world of Windows, where a lot of very important software is available only in binary form.  Unfortunately, all modern Windows solutions are limited in the ability to effectively search for vulnerabilities.  Their disadvantages include poor performance or the need to use a special processor and the latest version of the OS. <br><br>  We will introduce Darko, a new fazzer for real sets of binary files with debug information.  It has several undeniable advantages. <br>  Tremendous speed: the performance test shows that our fuzzer works much faster than existing solutions. <br><br>  Intelligence: Darko combines static analysis and analysis of tagged data, which significantly expands the coverage, and also allows you to find vulnerable code much faster. <br>  At the core are only software components: the latest model of processors or OS versions are not needed to operate a fuzzer.  Thus, Darko can be deployed where appropriate, including within the virtual machine. <br><br>  Last but not least.  Our solution works on different platforms and architectures, and not just on Windows.  Darko also supports all popular OS and processor models (Windows, Linux, MacOS, * BSD, and so on on X86, X86_64, ARM, ARM64, Mips, PPC, Sparc). <br><br>  In this report, we will talk a little about fuzzing feedback-based coverage and focus on the problems that the available solutions have.  Then we will describe how to create a feedback phaser to overcome these problems.  Finally, to show the effectiveness of Darko, a list of vulnerabilities registered in CVE will be presented.  You are also waiting for some cool demonstrations. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speakers - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/sergej-temnikov/">Sergey Temnikov</a> and <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/vladimir-dashhenko/">Vladimir Dashchenko</a> <br>  <b>"Silver Bullet" among vulnerabilities and backdoor.</b>  <b>Hunting for more than 30 thousand suppliers using a small token</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The report will describe the latest research of the Kaspersky Lab's critical infrastructure protection team, which affect various serious vulnerabilities in the popular token management tool.  15 vulnerabilities were found, including several for remote code execution, multiple DoS vulnerabilities, and one strange software logic feature that allows an attacker to manipulate configuration files and a proxy server for updates, intercept the system user's NTLM hash and perform other questionable actions.

Robots, in fact, are computers with arms, legs and wheels, so potential threats to their environment increase exponentially, and the vector of such threats has not been considered in detail in computer security before. <br>  In a recent study, we discovered several critical vulnerabilities in household and industrial sharing robots from reputable manufacturers.  We passed all the findings to the developers and now it‚Äôs time to reveal the technical details, threats and ways of compromising the various components of the ecosystem of robots with the help of practical exploits.  In live demonstrations, we show different exploitation scenarios in which there is cyber espionage, dangerous internal threats, damage to property and much more. <br>  Using realistic scenarios, we will describe how modern robot technologies are unsafe and why hacked robots are more dangerous than other vulnerable technologies.  Our goal is to make robots safer and prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities that can cause serious damage to companies, customers and what is around. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/nikolas-alehandro-ekonomou/">Nicholas Alejandro Economou</a> <br>  <b>Using GDI to run malicious code in ring0 primitives: Reboot</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The evolution of modern Windows kernel-using techniques for attacks forces suppliers to make tremendous efforts to ensure software is protected against exploits, including using sandboxes in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and the latest versions of Office. <br>  At the same time, Microsoft has strengthened its attempts to protect the Windows kernel and, in particular, the Windows 10 kernel, by adding important protections against exploits to each new version (most fully in the Anniversary and Creators Update).  In 2015, as a result of a well-known incident with the Hacking Team, there was a leak of kernel exploits with new techniques for using GDI objects, which are described in detail in the first report ‚ÄúUsing GDI to run malicious code in ring0 primitives‚Äù. <br>  With the advent of Windows 10 Anniversary Update (RS1), some of this technology has been neutralized.  A year later, in the second version of the same report, new techniques were introduced for the use of GDI objects.  In April of this year, with the release of Windows 10 Creators Update (RS2), another part of this technology was neutralized.  Despite Microsoft's attempts to eliminate the vulnerability, the latest techniques for using GDI objects remain as effective as in previous versions before Anniversary Update (RS1). <br>  In the new presentation I will talk about a reliable way to run the code in Windows 10 Fall Creators Update using these techniques.  At the end I will demonstrate how to get out of the Microsoft Edge sandbox using the techniques described. </div></div></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Speaker - <a href="https://2017.zeronights.ru/speaker/dzhejms-forshou/">James Forshaw</a> <br>  <b>Using access tokens to bypass the UAC system</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Description of the report</b> <div class="spoiler_text">     (UAC),  ,   Admin-Approval,  ,         Windows Vista.
