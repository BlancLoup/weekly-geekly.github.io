  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Set to turn any apartment into a "smart home"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year, REDMOND released the world's first line of Ready for Sky smart appliances.  A kettle, a slow cooker, a convector and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/264310/">even an iron</a> - all of them can be controlled remotely, which provides new degrees of convenience, freedom, economy and security.  Public interest in smart solutions turned out to be quite high, although, on the way of all solutions from the Internet of Things (IoT) area today stands one serious barrier: economic.  That is, the user, in principle, would not mind having smart devices at home.  But the point is not that they are more expensive than usual - just REDMOND Smart Home devices cost the same as similar devices of the same class, but without smart functions.  The fact is that household appliances are durable goods, and, roughly speaking, if a person already has a good kettle, iron or heater, he will not run to buy a new one just because he is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù - rather, replacement will occur only at the end the life cycle of an old device. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/270324/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63a/d4c/0e4/63ad4c0e489a32f49ef5b3903fe9e0d2.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13a/834/bec/13a834beccabb44ae01f8c1dd4f3cfa8.png"></div><br>  The new smart socket REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S will help to make old devices ‚Äúsmart‚Äù now.  This small compact device is most similar to the adapter-adapter from one type of sockets to others, like those with which travelers travel, only here the plug and socket are European.  Being inserted into an ordinary white outlet, the device protrudes a couple of centimeters from it and remains practically invisible.  At the same time, of course, it can be easily transferred from one room to another - exactly the outlet that is needed at the moment will become ‚Äúsmart‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/922/db3/45e/922db345e51e3152fa43925ff4df9558.jpg" width="500"></div><br>  The number of scenarios for using smart sockets is limited only by your imagination.  The most obvious ones are, for example, the remote shutdown of irons, castings and other fire-hazardous devices, which you never remember under the law of meanness, whether you turned them off or not: you have to turn around halfway to return and check.  Here you are always in the application to see the current status of the outlet in real time.

The mode is called ‚ÄúI am at home‚Äù.  So the logic with the default disconnected load is an excellent solution for home security and energy saving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05a/018/706/05a018706fa9b5ec1c0ae9cd2882f212.jpg"><br><br>  Or, for example, you can transfer all the sockets to the locked mode - if there are children left at home, they will not be able to turn on any electrical appliances or, say, stick a clip or knitting needle into the socket.  And this is not only about kids: for example, a schoolchild, thanks to a smart socket, cannot turn on the TV until he does his homework. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f6f/42c/71b/f6f42c71b53c99faa457742338ec656d.jpg"><br><br>  At the right time, you can turn on the floor lamp and the music center - such an ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù is guaranteed not to let you sleep through: this is not a smartphone, where you pressed the ‚ÄúEnd‚Äù button and went to bed for ‚Äú5 minutes‚Äù, but got up after two hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6c/62e/c12/e6c62ec1267537fd17d1d6efdedb76a2.jpg"><br><br>  You can also set a timer for the heater (so that it warms up the house to your arrival) and the humidifier (to compensate for the work of the heater). <br><br>  In winter, you can extend the daylight for plants and aquarium fish, including daylight lamps for them for a certain period, and you can turn on the ‚Äúwarm floor‚Äù in the corridor in advance from the walk or, for example, fill the bath with water (electric valves) not unusual, and cost $ 20). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/297/4df/d3b/2974dfd3bacfde9de0d404743305b6f3.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, you can remember the movie "Home Alone" and with the help of smart sockets to imitate the presence of the house of the owners, when in fact there is no one.  For example, you went on vacation for two weeks with your whole family, but you have lights in the evenings, and during the day, the TV is on for one and a half hours.  Remember how our parents and grandmothers protected the home from thieves?  That's right: leaving the house, turned on the louder kitchen radio! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd5/199/e58/fd5199e58581805e925da32506496003.jpg"><br><br>  The ability to work anywhere allows you to use REDMOND smart sockets not only in a city apartment, but also in the country: it will also be appropriate to turn on the lights in the garden to scare off thieves, heat the water in the boiler for coming from the city on Friday evening and, of course, timely water the garden, controlling the pump. <br><br>  In addition to single outlets, REDMOND also released the RSP-E101S smart network filter for four outlets.  It, among other things, can automatically turn on only if there is a smartphone attached to it in the immediate vicinity, providing additional protection for the computer against unauthorized access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fe/190/998/7fe19099882706d4c6fc2cfd2c26d5f6.jpg"><br><br>  The principle of operation of the REDMOND Smart Plug is quite simple.  Inside the case there is a power relay designed for current up to 10A (i.e., devices can be connected with a capacity of up to 2.2 kW) and a Bluetooth controller that connects the socket to a smartphone with the Ready for Sky control application installed.  The range of action, even if there are obstacles in the signal path, is up to 15 meters, that is, it works with guarantee within the apartment or a country house. <br><br>  In addition, the outlet can be controlled via the Internet at any distance, even from another country.  To do this, you need a gateway - any gadget on Android 4.3 with the free R4S Gateway program installed, which will receive signals from your main gadget over the Internet and transmit commands to the Redmond smart technology via Bluetooth.  The brand‚Äôs product range includes a REDMOND Gateway smartphone router with an MTS SIM card and a special tariff for telematics devices: for about 10 rubles a month, 5 MB of traffic is provided, which is more than enough to remotely turn on and off sockets every 5 minutes and another smart technique.  But no one forbids using any other smartphone or tablet on Android as a gateway, and everything will work when connected to the Internet in almost any way: via Wi-Fi or via 4G / 3G / 2G from a SIM card of any operator.  Transmitted data (both between the smartphone and the outlet, and between the smartphone and the Internet) is encrypted, so unauthorized access to sockets is excluded.  It is the rosette, because they can be connected an unlimited number, making it "smart" at least the entire home electrical network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6e6/720/e04/6e6720e04c292b4ba4c568415ae91f3a.jpg"><br><br>  Sockets with the ability to remote control from a smartphone are present on the Russian market for five years.  True, so far these have been GSM-based solutions, managed via SMS.  SMS sockets are approximately twice as large as REDMOND SkyPlug, and also not very convenient in that you need to insert a separate SIM card into each of them.  To control GSM sockets, you need to send SMS text commands without making any mistakes with their syntax (keep a cheat sheet at hand or create templates for these codes in your phone).  And, of course, you will have to pay all the SMS messages from both the smartphone and the answers from the sockets, and when there are a lot of them, you need to monitor the account balance on each of the SIM cards of your ‚Äúzoo‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c3/8c5/57b/1c38c557b268e5b34e9c517411078b6b.png" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8b/7c8/2e2/d8b7c82e2952e78e38c94b6ddd0bba80.png" width="350"><br><br>  In addition to GSM sockets (‚Äúsmart sockets‚Äù, let's say, the first generation), there are several types of smart sockets on sale.  Including, from quite popular Korean and Chinese brands of electronics.  Most of the smart home appliances on the Russian market work via Wi-Fi.  It is really more convenient for someone to use such a data channel: after all, in fact, who doesn‚Äôt have wireless Wi-Fi at home now?  But at the same time, Wi-Fi has its drawbacks, which forced REDMOND to make a choice in favor of the Bluetooth + smartphone-gateway bundle. <br><br>  The main advantage of the selected Redmond solution using a smartphone-geytveya - autonomy.  The home Internet may turn off, the router may hang, and then you will lose touch with all the smart appliances.  At the same time, the smartphone gateway is autonomous and completely stable: it will provide constant control over the smart equipment, while retaining all its ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù functions and almost without dependence on the electrical grid.  Of course, we must not forget to replenish the balance (about 10 rubles per month) and charge the smartphone gateway about once a week (power consumption when using the R4S Gateway application and Bluetooth is minimal).  Well, another advantage of Bluetooth-control technology REDMOND Smart Home - the ability to control from a smartphone directly, without the use of "intermediary devices";  in the case of most analogs from other manufacturers, all control over them will pass through a special router-gateway, even if you sit right next to your smart outlet. <br><br>  The R4S system benefits from analogs from the point of view of security: competitors' solutions are protected only by a pair of login-password, which is not enough for reliable protection against hacking by intruders.  At the same time, REDMOND requires physical ‚Äúpairing‚Äù of devices, and all data transfer channels are securely encrypted - this is originally embedded in the Bluetooth and mobile data packet transmission protocols. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/122/ff7/1bf/122ff71bf94c819a0a7cd362c2b2e40c.png"><br><br>  There are also private examples that confirm the correctness of the choice by REDMOND of exactly the solution according to the scheme ‚Äúyour smartphone&gt; Internet&gt; smartphone-gateway&gt; Bluetooth&gt; smart technology Smart Home‚Äù.  For example, not everybody has a wired Internet at the dacha - and as mentioned above, there are a huge number of applications for smart technology.  You can, of course, use the same smartphone distributing Wi-Fi instead of a router at the dacha, but it will be rather fast to sit in the ‚Äúrouter mode‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f18/e12/ffa/f18e12ffa0bb847a39b2bfd8f21e55e5.png"></div><br>  Based on the same wiring diagram from the relay and the Bluetooth controller, as in the SkyPlug socket, the REDMOND SkySocket RSP-S202S smart socket was built.  It has an E27 base and supports lamps up to 30 W (for home LED and fluorescent lights, this is enough with a large margin);  in addition, it has a built-in temperature sensor that provides protection against overheating in case of installing a lamp greater than 30V, power.  Buying such ‚Äúsmart pedestals‚Äù is a much more reasonable solution compared to ‚Äúsmart bulbs‚Äù, because it is purchased only once, and you can use any of them.  ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù lamps are much more expensive than ordinary ones, and serve as much, that is, with them you overpay for the controller each time.  At the same time, lamps from different manufacturers are often incompatible with each other and with existing controllers - here each of them tries to implement the vendor lock-in, in order to sell their lamps at inflated prices. <br><br>  Lamps do not have to be switched on only from a smartphone: they are offered the REDMOND SkyLight RC-B21S light control unit, installed in the chandelier hood.  It takes commands from the switches RL-S1S (they can also be tied directly to the bases and to the sockets). <br><br>  Smart caps can be used, for example, to turn off the night light in the nursery when the baby falls asleep, in a long corridor, in the stairwell or in a large office with several cabinets.  On conventional analog switches, it would be impossible to implement such a scheme with the ability to turn on and off the light on each floor or at each door, if there are more than two, then Soviet communal apartments are remembered, where each tenant had his own light bulb in the bathroom, in the toilet and in the kitchen, included after own counter. <br><br>  All Redmond smart devices work without a central host controller, that is, the parameters set by the Ready for Sky application are stored in the memory of a specific outlet, base, etc.  Thus, the current state of the smartphone (whether it is turned on and whether it is at home, working normally or frozen, etc.) does not affect the functioning of the systems: it is needed only to send a command to change parameters once.  This increases reliability and stability. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/598/309/28d/59830928da528e421224ec556551a8fa.png"></div><br>  In addition to new home upgrades, REDMOND also released the smart tracker SkyTracker RFT-08S.  It connects to the smartphone and hangs up on the keys, luggage, dog collar or baby clothes: now you will never lose them, because you will instantly hear the signal that the distance to the tracker has started to increase significantly.  This happens if someone stole your bag, or the child ran while you turned away, or, for example, the keys fell out of your pocket on the go.  The tracker can show the approximate distance to the smartphone, so that it can be used as a kind of locator for a quick search for missing.  In addition, the tracker has a motion sensor, so it can be used, for example, to detect the opening of a refrigerator door or window. <br><br>  Of the additional functions of the tracker, the built-in digital thermometer should be noted, as well as the button for activating the camera of the smartphone.  It will allow you to make self-portraits from any angles (‚Äúwalked away, press the button‚Äù) to the main camera of the smartphone without any selfie sticks, and also help to secretly remove something without attracting attention: a person who does not direct the lens to you, but simply holding a smartphone in his hand, does not cause any suspicion. <br><br>  REDMOND did not become the first to engage in the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù on the Russian market.  However, it was Redmond who were the first to make these technologies accessible (in all respects) to the masses.  The prices for smart home appliances do not exceed the cost of analogs without ‚Äúsmart functions‚Äù, and smart sockets and smart sockets are much more economical than standard GSM sockets with SIM cards and ‚Äúsmart lamps‚Äù.  At the same time, installation and management of all REDMOND smart equipment is simple and intuitive.  Soon in this blog you will see "solo" reviews of interesting new products in the field of "smart home" from REDMOND - stay tuned! <br><br>  You can buy REDMOND smart appliances in the <a href="http://multivarka.pro/lp_smarthome/">official online store of the brand</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371715/</a></p>
