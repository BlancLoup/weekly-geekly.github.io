But can the cold weather damage the phone?  Let's try to find out by placing 6 phones in low temperature conditions until they stop working.  Then, for a good result, we will put some of them in liquid nitrogen.  What happens to the phones in extremely cold temperatures? <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/cellfreeze-4l-1109.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Motorola KRZR.  It was 4 times immersed in liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -48 ¬∞ C and thrown on the floor for final destruction.

      It is believed that the cold and mobile phones are not compatible. <br>  For example, cold can cause crystals in the display to freeze or slow down the response in batteries.  And even if you are not at the <a href="http://www.ruschudo.ru/miracles/280.html">pole of the cold</a> , you will most likely NOT be surprised with a temperature of -20 ¬∞. <br>  But how long can the phone hold out in the cold in working condition? <br>  Try to find out. <br>  To help, we called our friends from Environ Laboratories (the Foundation for Ecological Research), which is engaged in testing space and industrial products in extreme conditions.  We gave them samples of six phones from different manufacturers.  All models were ordinary phones, not specifically designed for low temperature conditions. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/cellfreeze-1l-1109.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The work of Environ Laboratories was to freeze the phones in a <s>special room in the</s> refrigerator (the lowest temperature there reaches -73.33 ¬∞ C) until all six phones stop working and detect at what temperature it happened. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/cellfreeze-2l-1109.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, we spat on the terms of use and warnings on the box and stuck these phones in really extreme conditions. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/cellfreeze-3l-1109.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It all started from + 4 ¬∞  (the temperature is equivalent to the <s>evening in late autumn in New England to the</s> day in autumn in Moscow), we let the phones work for about 30 minutes before they lowered the temperature by another 3 ¬∞  down. <br>  We repeated the procedure every half hour until the phones stopped working altogether. <br>  If the phone was ‚Äúdying,‚Äù we put it back in a room at room temperature to see if it ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù. <br>  In addition to minor deviations (a slight darkening of the screen, slowing down the key response), none of the phones had serious consequences at -23 ¬∞ C, although Samsung‚Äôs battery indicator showed a low charge level, although it was fully charged before that. <br><br>  At -28 ¬∞ C, some phones began to turn off (pressing the power button quickly enlivened them) and on the displays of some of the phones it was difficult to read anything. <br><br>  The fun began at temperatures below -34 ¬∞ C: five of the six phones had serious problems with batteries, and the Nokia display turned into a muddy blue square, while the rest of the phones were covered with strange stripes. <br><br>  Lowering the temperature to -40 ¬∞ C, we finished off all the phones, except one, except for the old Motorola Krzr of one of the employees of PM. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/cellfreeze-5l-1109.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The phone continued to work up to -48 ¬∞ C, after which he ‚Äúdied‚Äù battery. <br><br>  Fortunately, none of the damage was ‚Äúfatal‚Äù - all phones were brought back to life, after returning to room temperature. <br>  The status of "killers of electronics" was still behind us, and I did not want to leave the Environ laboratory so quickly, so we turned our attention to vats with liquid nitrogen. <br><br>  The lowest temperature recorded on Earth is -89 ¬∞ C, but we just could not cope with the desire to dip the phone in a bucket of liquid nitrogen with a temperature of -192.6 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  Surprisingly, Motorola survived after several dipping into nitrogen.  The battery is disconnected, but as soon as the phone warmed up, it returned to life again without visible damage.  We even threw the "frozen" phone on the floor.  And of course we expected it to break, but the fall caused only minor external damage. <br><br>  All this continued until we plunged our Krzr into liquid nitrogen 4 times in a row and threw it on the ground - this was its ‚Äúend‚Äù.  After a while, the screen still turned on (of course, it was unreadable) and surprisingly, the sound continued to work, just like some buttons. <br><br>  The results were amazing.  The conclusion can be made as follows: <s>Alaskans in the</s> northern regions of the country during the cold season may experience some problems with the display and with a quickly discharging battery, but nothing but a warm room will not cure them. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/frozen-phone-illo-1109%20copy.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And if our phone survived bathing in the coldest liquid on Earth and remained in the end working condition, then yours will undoubtedly ‚Äúsurvive‚Äù on a slope or during a long stay on the street in winter. <br><br>  (note of translation) <br><br><h2>  Gag </h2><br>  My curiosity after translating this article did not leave me alone and looking in my box I found an old Motorola V300, belonging to my uncle (may he forgive me).  First of all, I charged the battery. <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/test1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since at home I did not find either a freezer or liquid nitrogen, which made me very <s>upset</s> (because if I had found all this it would be a <s>little</s> very strange) I decided to measure the temperature in my freezer.  And it was -17 ¬∞ C.  Looking again at the article, I decided that I could at least check if the display was dim.  In general, I put the phone in the freezer.  It's been 30 minutes.  Looking at the phone, I realized that nothing happened to it, there is no darkening and the battery remains full.  I decided not to give up and put the phone for another 30 minutes.  And lo and behold!  The battery meter shows one of three divisions, but to my misfortune, no darkening has happened.  Deciding that this time was not enough, I shoved him again for an hour.  At the end of an hour, I again took it out of the freezer.  This time the battery was already running out.  The phone hysterically begged for mercy with short beeps and the message ‚ÄúBattery Low‚Äù on the display.  To my surprise, the display remained normal.  It was also noted that the buttons began to be pressed with a strange crunching, which was very addictive (I think everyone loves to burst the balls on the bags with pimples). <br><br><img src="http://opera-mobile.info/images/weather_vs_mobile/test2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><br>  That small part of the <s>bullying</s> tests that I managed to make at home turned out to be similar to the tests carried out in the article.  So I can not disagree with the result of the tests that the phone in the cold will only be discharged and will not receive any serious damage. <br><br>  PS: a warm room did not return the lost sticks on the battery indicator, so you have to charge. <br><br>  <a href="http://opera-mobile.info/overviews/54-coldweathervscellphones">House article :)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76657/</a></p>
