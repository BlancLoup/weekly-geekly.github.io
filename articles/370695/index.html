But even in the history of human civilization, this was <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1006">not always the case</a> .  And this situation is not standard even for our <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259F%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">Milky Way</a> (well, and other galaxies, too). <br><br>  And during the transition to the scale of millennia, even <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">in the disk of</a> our Milky Way there are places (with dense clusters of stars) where something constantly happens: let's say, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/M_71_(%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5)">M71 globular cluster</a> (shown in the photo) has <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap141210.html">about 10 thousand</a> stars in diameter of only 27 light years (in the same radius from us there are less than 250 stars).  Such a density of stars leads to the fact that over several thousand years, the starry sky is completely transformed, and star maps become hopelessly outdated (due to the rotation of individual stars, their groups, and groups of their groups around a common center of mass).
