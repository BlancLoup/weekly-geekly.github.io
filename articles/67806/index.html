  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Laziness IT-Schnick from a different angle: maybe it is not "laziness" at all?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© already a lot has been said about the fight against laziness.  I will try to tell my point of view.  It differs from those published here at least in the fact that in my understanding laziness is not laziness, it is different.  I really hope that it will be original and there will be no repetitions.  To begin with, let's assume the worst thing: You are a freelancer (lazy, just terrible) and at the same time a programmer. <br><br>  How does ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù arise (I will continue to write without quotes)?  In my spare time from spitting into the ceiling, I thought a lot about this topic.  :) And came to the following conclusion.  Laziness in itself is not a natural state, it can be caused by several factors that need to be urgently removed from life.  Laziness ... It is rather apathy, unwillingness to do anything.  She does not appear herself, and she herself does not pass.  You can wait for her disappearance for months.  And that's because the point is, if you try to deal with it in the vein, as they write here, it will not help, because you are not fighting with what the essence of the problem is.  Or rather - as a rule, laziness too quickly develops into something more, you are lazy for about 10 minutes, and then something more global comes. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So.  The lack of apathy is based, in my opinion, on the presence of happiness.  In other words, as long as you feel good and comfortable, there is no reason for ‚Äúlaziness‚Äù (apathy).  Fighting laziness itself is the same as fighting symptoms - the disease will kill you anyway, just later. <br><br>  <b>1) "All life is work."</b>  When you wake up and the first thing you think: ‚ÄúI have a project (s), we have to do it urgently!‚Äù, This is not life.  Everyone knows how the happiness of a freelancer (free time and free schedule) turns into his tragedy when he digs into projects to the top, and only 3 hairs stick out on the surface of life.  How it turns out is not a secret either - if you have scored a lot of projects or if you cannot cope or are just tired. <br><br>  Need to defuse the situation.  It is necessary to make so that having risen in the morning, having wiped eyes, the only thing "urgently for the computer" did not occur. <br><br>  <i>Solution:</i> First, I recommend not to take more than 1 project at a time, even if it is 100 rubles.  Secondly, do not put off until the last minute, if not banal.  Thirdly, do not constantly sit at the computer and press F5 on the mailbox in the hope that the customer has sent something - go to the street for a couple of hours.  Experience has shown that these 2 hours can be spent in two states: 1. wait and worry, running from the kitchen and back, 2. walk and relax, meet someone.  And in any case, the customer will vry send something in 2 hours (and there are sluggish ones that you wait every 5 minutes, and they appear only after two days).  Let the customer wait for the best answer, not you (but do not get carried away). <br><br>  That is: love yourself more work!  Work is bread, but bread is not the whole life.  Bread can always be obtained in other ways, go to work as a loader, make your project, change the specialty, grow a vegetable garden and bake it yourself.  Has such a thought come to mind?  Have a quiet breakfast, wash your face, go for an hour, think about nature or have sex with your beloved.  The main thing to think about is that you need to respect and love yourself more than anyone else in this world (and believe me, if you do not go too far, it is also more pleasant for an employer to communicate with a calm and rested person). <br><br>  <b>2) "I will not succeed."</b>  Sometimes it happens that the project is complex, the customer is nervous, and the performer does not like himself, and over time he simply cannot approach the work.  Very often this happens when it is already an emergency.  I had it - urgently, just urgently, something needs to be done, but on the contrary I became mourning over "I still do not have time," and as a result I only made it worse (deadline passed, the work was not done).  I do not know about you, but I sometimes drank (to relax), from which everything became even worse. <br><br>  <i>Solution:</i> understand it right away will not succeed.  Need to pull yourself together.  The following was the most effective way for me.  Do you have a familiar person you are most afraid of?  Or make a collective image.  As an option - do not be afraid, but respect.  Or the image of the person you want to be like (for me, this is a very strong-willed, pumped up rich and intelligent guy of uncertain age 30-40 who wanted to put everything that he was not interested in and who only did what he wanted in life but became rich smart and strong). <br><br>  Submit it.  And imagine that he is threatening (in the "case of fear") or degradingly evil (in the case of "respect") voice tells you extremely coldly: "I got up and went to work."  Calmly, without mat so.  In general, you know better.  Maybe you are afraid of Gopnik, and if you are ‚Äúhit‚Äù, you will become stupid.  Apply this image.  It is necessary that right to the bone penetrate from this mental voice.  I do not have time to notice how I finish the project. <br><br>  <b>3) "I love freelancing / work, but the rest of my life is guano and I don‚Äôt want to do anything."</b> <br><br>  <i>Solution:</i> you need to get lost in the work like in a magical forest so that you can forget about all your troubles for freelancing.  Immediately it will not work, for this you need to overcome "laziness." <br><br>  You can overcome laziness again, taking an interesting project for you.  Which will cover you with your head.  Copywriter?  An interesting topic of the article.  Programmer?  A project with bugger technologies and code requirements, not performance.  Designer?  Draw a design on the theme that you like best in life (nature, food, women, whatever).  The main thing is to feel that you LIKE to work.  Try not to take the routine later. <br><br>  <b>4) "The budget is too small, the time is not enough, zakazik unpleasant person."</b> <br><br>  <i>Solution:</i> Give up and everything.  Work only with those you like.  If you work with someone who is annoying, there will be no mood, no money, nothing.  Let idiots work with idiots, and you find yourself an adequate partner. <br><br>  <b>5) "How I am tired of freelancing!".</b> <br><br>  <i>Solution:</i> Change your occupation or find a job.  Maybe later want to come back.  It took me a two-week break to flare up again with a passion for customers, projects and the mysterious "requires a performer." <br><br>  In my opinion, all this causes the so-called laziness.  The list can be supplemented, but laziness definitely has a reason, it must be found and beaten against the wall until it lags behind.  This is not about you personally, but about some external circumstance that causes a state of ‚Äúwell, see.‚Äù <br><br>  Summing up, in general.  Lack of laziness is harmony with oneself, with the outside world, and a feeling of happiness, a lack of feeling that something in life is wrong. <br><br>  In dogonku something else, in case laziness is quite normal and there are no obvious reasons for it.  It happens, of course, that you just don't want to do anything.  You need to feel that things are more important than any nonsense.  For example, I played a lot in wow.  But some time ago I realized that ‚Äúpumping a paladin‚Äù is the same kind of work, you need to do this for 8 hours a day.  I'd rather make a couple of projects, I thought - both money and reputation, but real, not a toy one.  To boast that you have ‚Äúfallen‚Äù level 80?  Girls on acquaintance, colleagues?  This is all nonsense, because without prompting it is clearer what is more important.  But you just need to feel it.  With hindsight, everyone is strong.  Such a method was already described somewhere here, but I repeated it only for WoW.  For example, in ‚ÄúStalker‚Äù or ‚ÄúCounter Strike‚Äù it does not work, there is no feeling of wasted time.  And in the MMORPG, it would seem that he had already killed a month, and he ‚Äúpumped‚Äù only up to the 40th level.  Fu, nafig, nafig. <br><br>  A similar effective way, as already mentioned, is with a ‚Äúlittle man in my head‚Äù.  You can not yourself, imagine someone who in two words can make you tremble. <br><br>  And yet, if you feel that you are starting to be lazy, quickly behind the computer, open the project and start writing code.  Just without thinking.  It blows away in minutes. <br><br>  I hope, the essence of the problem I told you, I had no goal to stock up on solutions for all occasions, because for each they are different.  You just need to sit down and think - what is wrong in my life, why am I lazy, maybe I'm unhappy?  Thoroughly and thoroughly delve into your life - think about why you don‚Äôt want to work, maybe you didn‚Äôt wash the dishes last week, or maybe you aren‚Äôt satisfied with your wife (for obvious reasons) or one of the cases described above.  I will repeat myself: ‚ÄúTo fight with laziness itself is the same thing as fighting symptoms - the disease will kill you anyway, just later.‚Äù Cancer eat your brain while you take analgin from headache.  Hard (the more I revised "House"), but the comparison is as good as a point. <br><br>  Thank you, I hope for an invite and I hope that someone really helped to see the Universal Evil. <br><br>  Original on <a href="http://dimoning.ru/habrotopik-len-pod-drugim-uglom.html">dimoning.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67806/</a></p>
