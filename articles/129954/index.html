  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My impressions of Samsung Smart TV or the future is here.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading the articles of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/129949">habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/129949</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/128792/">habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/128792</a> published recently, and comments to them, I suddenly realized that my experience of using such a TV (46d6530) and the experience of many others users are extremely polar.  In this article I will try to summarize my experience using this TV. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, I have a new apartment.  Just finished repair.  I brought my body home, hoisted it on a parquet box, but what should I connect?  Of the blessings of civilization, only the Internet, and he is wired into a router, there are no pachcords in the apartment, there was still no critical mass of rubbish :) Here I was pleased with the body for the first time, without any red tape, announced that it had discovered a WiFi network (before buying did not really find information on the presence / absence of the WiFi module), asked to enter the security key, and then announced that the connection was successfully established.  After connecting to the grid and a quick overview of the Smart mode menu, the ability to view videos on YouTube and a couple of foreign services was found.  I was very pleased with the ‚ÄúSearch‚Äù section of a video that searched all available sources (YouTube, a connected USB pocket, DLNA, etc.), which already had a list of the most popular requests, in the first place is naturally ‚Äúporn‚Äù which hangs like that and I don‚Äôt know how to remove it, since there is nothing good about this request, but it was briefly explained to children what it is for a long time ... In general, the first test was passed. <br><br>  Go ahead, DLNA started up with a half kick, NetBios sees the balls too.  An external screw connected via USB is indexed and all media content on it is available with a bang.  For several days, the family was provided with quiet evenings at the screen - the children watched ‚ÄúMasha and the Bears‚Äù from YouTube, my wife and I, which were downloaded to our laptops earlier.  Two days later it became boring.

      In the market, a lot of entertaining and not very interesting programs were found, which are reviewed in the articles I mentioned, again for a long time they did not occupy us.  I really wanted to torrent.  Looking ahead to say that I am behind the times ... It turns out you may want more :) <br><br>  In general, on the Internet, <a href="http://pristavka.de/">pristavka.de</a> was found (please do not consider it as an advertisement) with a great forum dedicated to these TVs.  After reading this forum, I learned that there is some kind of program that allows you to watch videos online from "most popular video directories."  Here the installation instruction was found.  All this was done, and then the FUTURE began for me. <br><br>  In total, the catalog has about a dozen different online services, for example - ex.ua, vkontakte.ru, seasonvar.ru and others.  All of them support search, and most have internal cataloging, by genre, release year, etc. ... Any movie, any series is at a distance of 5-10 clicks of the remote control, video in DVD quality on the 20Mb / c channel is played without problems, 720p sometimes slows down ( depends on the time of day and the server) before pressing a pause, 1080p without a prior pause (during the pause, the TV buffers the stream) almost never goes.  Over the next week, we reviewed the films more than the previous year, probably :) All the same, laziness is the engine of progress, do not think that you want to watch, do not download, you just choose the movie you like lying on the sofa and watch it if it isn‚Äôt interesting - you choose another ... <br><br>  After two weeks it became boring.  News, football, cartoons in the morning for children - this was not enough.  My provider broadcasts 180 channels on IPTV, on the computer they look great, I wanted to watch them on TV.  Turning to the same forum, a quick solution was found, creating my playlist of channels, based on the provider's playlist and adding it to the same video viewing application, I was able to watch IPTV on the big screen.  The picture quality naturally does not compare with any analog TV.  The number of channels is even more so.  There are of course minor flaws, such as the speed of channel switching, the need to wait about a minute after turning on the TV until the Smart mode is loaded, but these shortcomings can be said to discipline :) The TV was used more consciously, not as a continuous broadcaster but as a source of necessary information on demand. <br><br>  Much of course not yet perfect.  The browser is not possible to use, for some reason it is terribly slow, the remote control is not convenient.  There is no availability of IP channels in one click as to analog TV.  Typing is quite inconvenient and there is probably a lot more.  But still, this is another one of those few things that gave me the opportunity to feel that I live in the 21st century! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129954/</a></p>
