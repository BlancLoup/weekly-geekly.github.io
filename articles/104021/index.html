And there are those in which the size of the netbook remained, the time of work and the absence of a drive <s>and a glossy screen</s> . <br>  Today, you, Habradam and Habragod is represented multimedia netbook ASUS Eee PC <b>1215N</b> . <br><img src="http://img180.imageshack.us/img180/2991/img7794j.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Intro </h4><br>  In the summer in front of me was the choice of which netbook to take.  After looking at J.Market, and rejecting immediately the models with Intel GMA graphics, I began to reconsider the rather stingy selection of netbooks on nVidia ION. <br>  First, the choice fell on the Lenovo S12-1N, but then went over to the EeePC 1201N. <br>  It went to the purchase, but then came across an announcement EeePC 1215N, and I, remembering the saying "miser pays twice" and biting his lip, went to the sea empty. <br>  When he returned, he rushed to look for a model in the shops, and, happiness! On September 8, he arrives.

    <h4>  First impression </h4><br><br>  And so, we face a small neat box. <br><img src="http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1374/img7777e.jpg" alt="Box"><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the Microsoft Office 2010 sticker. :) <br>  Opening the box, we see a set: a netbook, a battery, a charger, a soft case (an ordinary case, black), a thin instruction manual and a warranty card. <br><br>  Some people wonder in surprise: What about driver discs? <br>  What for?  There is no drive in the netbook, and the driver can be downloaded from the ASUS website. <br><br>  We get a netbook, look around ... And then I was in for an unpleasant surprise: there was no USB 3.0 in the netbook. <br>  Fortunately, this is the only disappointment with this netbook. <br><br>  In general, a lightweight netbook, it is pleasant to hold in hands, a matte metallic cover, "porous" plastic from below. <br>  In the same place, two strips of DDR3 RAM are hidden under the cover with such a screw.  There is also a Windows 7 Home Premium key sticker on the bottom. <br><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/4903/img7989.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I was surprised and disappointed that there were two slats of 1 GB each, and not one of 2 GB, because I wanted to expand to 4 GB right after the purchase. <br><br><img src="http://img812.imageshack.us/img812/8073/img7986.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Quite thin, in comparison with the ProBook 4720s all the more. <br><img src="http://img444.imageshack.us/img444/1995/img7978.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From one side, the connectors (Left to right) of the memory, VGA, HDMI, USB, as well as the ventilation grill and SD card reader look at us. <br><br><img src="http://img691.imageshack.us/img691/4254/img7994o.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand (from left to right) Jack 3.5 headphones, Jack3.5 microphone, 2xUSB (which should be 3.0, by the way) and Ethernet. <br><br><img src="http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/8926/img8002s.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Yes, he's matte! </h5><br><br>  In fact, the 1215N is a revised and revised Eee PC 1201N: a matte case, a long operating time, a more suitable netbook processor. <br>  In fact, the screen, the frame around the screen and around the keyboard are glossy. <br>  Another advantage is the enlarged touchpad, 5x8.5 cm, a whole testing ground!, With multitouch support. <br>  The keyboard is quite comfortable, Fn is not swapped with Ctrl. <br><img src="http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/9477/img8021p.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Filling </h4><br><br>  Inside this netbook hides a powerful stuffing: dual-core (4 threads) Intel Atom D525 1.8 GHz processor <br><img src="http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/2071/45216499.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... as well as nVidia ION2 (GT218) discrete graphics with 512 MB of internal memory.  1080 video on YouTube is quietly played (4K slows down), games such as NFW: Underground 2, NFS: World, Half-Life 2 do not slow down a bit. <br><br><img src="http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/7216/71508743.gif" alt="image"><br><img src="http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/9935/54079409.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Intel GMA 3150 graphics are next to discrete graphics, switching between them is carried out depending on your needs thanks to nVidia Optimus technology! <br><img src="http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9334/33667815.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  And as a result, the performance index 3.3 <br><br><img src="http://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6932/63031688.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ... and 3413 points 3Dmark'05 at a resolution of 1366x768 and with double anti-aliasing. <br><br><img src="http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/3400/97622146.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Pcmark'05 such points <br>  HDD: 3647 <br>  CPU: 2165 <br>  Memory: 2300 <br><br><br>  This particular model is equipped with a WD hard disk of 320 GB <br><br><img src="http://img840.imageshack.us/img840/2252/52071040.jpg" alt="image"><br> <a href="http://img405.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3D81169725.jpg"><img src="http://img405.imageshack.us/img405/9182/81169725.th.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <a href="http://img231.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3D85512596.jpg"><img src="http://img231.imageshack.us/img231/7246/85512596.th.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <a href="http://img641.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3D83653612.jpg"><img src="http://img641.imageshack.us/img641/9763/83653612.th.jpg" alt="Free Image Hosting at www.ImageShack.us"></a> <br><br><h4>  Those.  Specifications </h4><br><br>  The netbook performance is amazing.  Watch HD movies, Skype and firefox, memory and memory devouring - all at the same time - within the powers!  Moreover, heavy things like photoshop and new games, and they were able to do. <br><br>  One of the downsides is that the speakers are located at the bottom and sound "down."  On the table or another surface, we still have some, but the sound, on the knees of the same Epic Fail. <br><br>  So, <b>Characteristics</b> <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> 12.1 inch, 16: 9, 1366x768 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Intel Atom D525 1.8 GHz, HT, 64-bit <br>  <b>RAM:</b> DDR3 2 GB, expands to 4 GB, 2 slots, 1066 Mhz <br>  <b>Hard Drive:</b> 250/320 GB + 500 GB Online EeeStorage for 1 year <br>  <b>Video card:</b> nVidia ION2 (GT218) 512 MB / Intel GMA 3150 256 MB <br>  <b>Ports:</b> 3xUSB, 2xJack3.5, VGA, HDMI, Ethernet, Kensington <br>  <b>Wireless interfaces:</b> Bluetooth 3.0, Wi-Fi b / g / n <br>  <b>Card reader:</b> SD <br>  <b>Webcam:</b> 0.3 Megapixels, with good lighting, the picture quality is high, and when lighting is lowered, noise appears. <br>  <b>Battery:</b> Li-Ion 6 cells, works 6-7 hours, 5400 mA * h <br>  <b>Installed OS:</b> Windows 7 Home Premium / ASUS ExpressGate <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 1.4 kg <br><br><h5>  Advantages and disadvantages </h5><br><br>  Pros: <br>  + Availability of discrete and embedded graphics at the same time <br>  + nVidia Optimus <br>  + Long working time <br>  + Good screen resolution <br>  + Availability of HDMI port <br>  + Shutter at the webcam :) <br>  + RAM up to 4 GB <br>  + Large touchpad <br>  + Bluetooth 3.0 <br>  + ExpressGate <br>  + Not easily soiled, light and thin in moderation. <br>  + The presence of the cover in the delivery <br>  + Win7 Home Premium, but not the flawed Starter. <br>  + 6-7 hours of battery life. <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - Glossy screen and frame around the screen: (. <br>  - Without USB 3.0 <br>  - Columns are located "down" <br>  - The price that went beyond the ceiling of 20k (I specifically bought at 21,500). <br><br>  This netbook is available in three colors: black, silver and red.  Specifically silver here. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  This netbook is undoubtedly one of the best in terms of performance / running time. <br>  But for me personally, for absolute happiness, USB 3.0 is not enough. <br><img src="http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/3866/soniclarge.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104021/</a></p>
