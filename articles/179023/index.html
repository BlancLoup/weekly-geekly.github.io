  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia Lumia: a smartphone that has survived</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The endurance of our phones has served as the basis for hundreds of memes and myths.  Suffice it to recall the legendary Nokia 3310, which was not equipped with special protection, but at the same time had a huge margin of safety and earned a reputation as truly unkillable. <br><br>  Subsequent models also did not lose face: the Nokia 1600 was found inside the fish and continued to work, and the Nokia 3720 Classic managed to stay in touch even after being <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUqK97furfBA">frozen in jelly</a> . <br><br>  We have already talked about numerous innovations in Nokia Lumia, but something has remained unchanged throughout the company's history - the traditional build quality and reliability.  It is not surprising that from time to time we get stories about falls and other troubles, from which our smartphones come out with dignity.

Samsung's tablet is too cold to turn on, and the phone felt great. </blockquote><br><br>  It is worth noting that in Russia, as in Finland, in winter the temperature sometimes reaches -20 degrees, but smartphones continue to work as if nothing had happened. <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IndestructableNokia4.png" alt="image"><br><blockquote>  2-year-old daughter dropped Lumia 920 in the toilet.

Fortunately, colleagues found disappearing under a half-meter layer of earth.  The device was literally trampled deep into a massive car.  The screen, unfortunately, crashed during the incident, but the phone remained fully operational. <br><br>  Surely you also have similar stories, we will be glad to hear them in the comments. <br><br>  For now - let's see what makes the Nokia Lumia 920 so resistant to external influences. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  The screens of many models from the Lumia line <a href="http://www.corninggorillaglass.com/products-with-gorilla/nokia">are protected by</a> Corning Gorilla Glass, thanks to which smartphones with no visible losses withstand carrying in a pocket with keys, falling on a hard surface and even falling under the car. <br><br>  Such properties are achieved by chemical treatment (ion exchange), during which sodium ions in the material are replaced by potassium ions.  By the way, Gorilla Glass is used not only in the production of electronics, but also in the automotive industry, in the production of household appliances, in construction. <br><br>  Of course, there is no completely unbreakable glass and even Gorila Glass can be split if desired, but this will require considerable effort.  But now you can forget about the protective film.  In addition, a special film will not survive the game of Fruit Ninja with a knife.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYuQAbo3-Gp0">Unlike Gorilla Glass</a> . <br><br><h4>  Polycarbonate case </h4><br>  All electronic components of the Lumia 920 (and several other models of the Lumia range) are housed in a monolithic polycarbonate housing.  The same material is used, for example, in the production of protective equipment for hockey players, cyclists, motorcyclists, representatives of other strength and extreme sports. <br><br>  Polycarbonate has high strength and toughness (250-500 kJ / m2), which is why our smartphones are not very susceptible to damage from falling and impact. <br><br>  In addition, the components that make up the polycarbonate, allow us to achieve excellent color intensity.  Thanks to this, new opportunities for working with color open up, smartphones are very bright.  They acquire their colors not after the body has been molded, but before the casting.  The material is stained in mass - and this makes minor scratches almost imperceptible.  The paint does not peel off and the phones longer retain a great appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8eb/0da/42e/8eb0da42eb6875e160eb94acfdcae31f.jpg"><br>  <i>This is what <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/174969/">the</a> Lumia 920 of our colleague looks like after six months of use without a case and after an uncountable number of falls.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a9a/bd9/5b9/a9abd95b9cdb30adb79af078fbf57c64.jpg"><br>  <i>Even the chip from the next meeting with asphalt is not evident.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcc/713/57c/dcc71357ca51e6069a43f02cb1bd4831.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179023/</a></p>
