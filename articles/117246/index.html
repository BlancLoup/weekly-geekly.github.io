      But let's get everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is Fast Lane Ventures? </h4><br>  We are a Russian company that develops and promotes promising, innovative Internet projects. <br><br>  Our goal is to launch, develop, support and promote interesting profitable projects for subsequent sale to strategic investors. <br><br>  The company was founded in 2010 by entrepreneurs of the Direct Group holding (known for its projects KupiVip, Otto.ru, Ozon.ru, Rusfinancebank, etc.).  And in just one year of its existence, Fast Lane Ventures launched as many as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/FastLaneVentures%3Fsk%3Dapp_103273159756669">seven new Internet companies</a> .  In the development - another seven, which will start this year. <br><br><h4>  How are we different from similar companies? </h4><br>  The fact that we have no direct analogies.  At the moment, we are the only venture company in Russia that not only invests its own funds in the implementation of promising ideas, but also organizes the entire process of launching a project from scratch.  That is why we can safely call ourselves a new type of venture company. <br><br>  Working on a ‚Äúfull cycle‚Äù business model and having all the necessary resources to create new Internet companies, we completely take on the organization of the whole process: from the search for an idea to its realization and transformation into a profitable business. <br><br><h4>  Our core values </h4><br>  The Russian Internet today provides a huge number of business opportunities, the main thing is to be able to use them on time.  That is why speed is our main value.  We are moving Fast Lane!  :) <br><br>  No less important components of our work are a responsible approach to everything that we do, and the desire for effective interaction with all participants in the creation of new businesses. <br><br><h4>  Our secret of success (briefly :) </h4><br>  Our projects are based on successful, already proven models of Western Internet businesses or unique proprietary models.  Thus, we select only potentially successful projects. <br><br>  In addition, we have developed our own know-how, which allows you to quickly and accurately evaluate any idea.  We are studying its financial prospects and opportunities for implementation.  We launch the ‚Äúcasting‚Äù ideas into development: we create an IT platform, form a team, provide financial, marketing and legal support to the company being created, find the right partners, and finally launch the project.  From the moment the idea is approved to the start of a new business, 50 days pass.  We achieve such high rates thanks to the Fast 50 technology that has already been tested in practice, which is based on international standards for creating start-ups. <br><br>  At first, we invest our own capital in a new business, and at a certain stage ‚Äî when the company is already viable and dynamically developing ‚Äî we attract outside investors. <br><br>  The high speed of our work allows us to take on many projects and grow very quickly.  On average, we ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù one business per month! <br><br><h4>  Our partners </h4><br>  We have an extensive partner network of Russian and international companies from the most diverse market areas.  We cooperate with: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ trade brands <br>  ‚Ä¢ MASS MEDIA <br>  ‚Ä¢ organizations in the service sector <br>  ‚Ä¢ payment systems <br>  ‚Ä¢ search engines <br>  ‚Ä¢ logistics companies <br>  ‚Ä¢ software developers <br>  ‚Ä¢ copywriters <br>  ‚Ä¢ marketers and many other companies <br><br>  And we are constantly looking for those who share our values, and invite them to join our team, because together it is easier to develop and step forward. <br><br><h4>  our team </h4><br>  In each project we attract a team of professionals and talented entrepreneurs.  And since the number of projects is constantly increasing, we always need specialists in the field of management, entrepreneurship, e-commerce, business development, marketing and PR, attracting investment, personnel management, web development, etc. <br><br>  We declare with all responsibility that in many ways our team is unique.  Our employees possess knowledge and skills that are rare for the Russian business, which they have acquired in a variety of Internet companies, including Western ones.  This allows us to implement any, even the most daring projects. <br><br>  We are proud that we have combined a lot of highly qualified specialists under our wing, and are ready to accept more!  If you have already worked in the Internet business, come to us.  No matter in which field you have experience, our projects are diverse, and perhaps it is your skills that we need. <br><br>  If your professional experience is not great yet, but at the same time you are ready to learn, you are purposeful and not without ambitions, our company is ready to accept you into your team. <br><br>  Since each of our employees is a part of our business, from the very beginning newcomers act as full members of the team.  This allows them to gain invaluable entrepreneurial experience and subsequently become the project leader myself. <br><br>  Fast Lane Ventures prides itself on both independent thinking and teamwork.  The main thing is the desire to develop, to believe in yourself and maintain a high rate of our life. <br><br>  Join us, it will be interesting!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117246/</a></p>
