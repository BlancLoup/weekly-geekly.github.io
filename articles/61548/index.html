Googling a bit, I found two whole projects implementing a similar system, but I still decided to write a detailed statement of the idea.  Maybe it will bring someone to think. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is necessary to create an operating system browser. <br><br>  <b>What for?</b> <br>  The logic is very simple: today the availability and quality of internet connection is growing very fast.  Russia, of course, is a separate case, but in Europe and in America, a fast internet connection is already becoming commonplace.  In addition, various online services are growing like mushrooms.  It is already possible to do any work online ‚Äî edit office documents, listen to music, there are even whole online OSes. <br><br>  Theoretically, now you can completely abandon the classical model of working with a computer, and do everything with the help of online services, without installing any programs on your computer.  In theory, this model of work gives a lot of advantages.

      First, the entire load is transferred from the client computer to remote servers.  Thus, from the user's point of view, computer performance is limited only by the speed of the Internet connection. <br>  Secondly, the user no longer needs to worry about transferring his data from one computer to another: all data is stored on servers equally accessible from any client computer. <br>  Finally, online services make it easy to organize teamwork. <br><br>  Next, you should pay attention to the fact that users often start a computer just to open a browser (usually the audio player and the IM client are started with the browser, but convenient online services already exist for listening to music and for instant messaging).  Thus, the user loads a bulky operating system, and then uses only the minimum set of its functions. <br><br>  <b>What i suggest</b> <br>  You can create an OS that will be designed to work with a single application - a web browser.  Moreover, you can make it in the form of a LiveCD.  Of course, it can no longer be called a valued OS.  Here are the advantages of such a system.  Such a system can load and work very quickly.  In such a system, all system resources will be initially designed to operate the web browser. <br><br>  That is, you can make the browser work much faster than on all classic systems.  All free RAM can be used for caching web pages.  From the user's point of view, such a browser will work incredibly fast.  The process scheduler of such a system should be different from the schedulers of conventional systems.  It should be sharpened to perform just a few processes, so you can achieve a good increase in the speed of execution of one particular application.  In general, the core of such a system can be very well ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for the work of one particular browser, achieving good performance. <br><br>  In addition, in the development of such a system, you can not worry about protection.  Since the system runs one application, you can not worry about viruses and similar hazards.  Only the browser can be attacked, and its developers should have thought about protecting the browser (and I suggest taking a ready-made browser). <br><br>  You can also integrate the system with popular online services, for example, implement a virtual file system that uses some kind of file hosting, synchronize browser bookmarks with services such as del.icio.us, etc. In addition, you can create a number of services oriented it is on this system. <br><br>  <b>On the other hand, the following problems occur.</b> <br>  If the system is made in the form of a LiveCD, then the question arises: where does the user store their settings and files?  A logical solution suggests itself: to organize an online service specifically for this.  Thus, immediately after the system is booted and the Internet connection is established, the user will be prompted to enter one password and all his settings, cookies and saved passwords will be available to him. <br>  It is necessary to implement a good equipment autoconfiguration system that will quickly determine and initialize the necessary minimum of equipment. <br>  When downloading, you need to avoid questions to the user as much as possible.  It is necessary to implement the scheme ‚Äúinserted a disk - pressed the button - it worked‚Äù.  The user is not required to know the details of the device of his computer, so everything that is possible, the system must decide and configure without user intervention, even if the user can do some of the work better.  Nevertheless, there is a moment in which questions to the user cannot be avoided - setting up an internet connection.  To do this, you need to make a program that will in step-by-step mode find out from the user the type of connection, and if you need the username and password to connect.  The interface of such a program should be as simple as possible, and the simplest, most understandable and complete reference documentation should be written for it, which can be called up at any time in a simple and obvious way.  Any housewife should be able to quickly start our system. <br><br>  <b>Practical considerations</b> <br>  The basis of such a system can take the Linux kernel.  It will be necessary to remove all unnecessary from it, turn on all the necessary drivers and implement the hardware autoconfiguration system (I must say that such systems are already used in Linux-based LiveCDs, for example, Knoppix and Ubuntu).  As a browser, you can take Firefox (it will have to make a number of changes).  Also, you will need to include in the system a number of add-ons to the browser, such as a Flash player and the like. <br><br>  <b>Receiving a profit</b> <br>  Of course, I intend to distribute this system for free.  However, with its help you can make a profit.  You can get money from corporations like Google for integrating our system with their online services.  Such a business scheme is quite capable of generating a large income, subject to the popularity of our system. <br><br>  PS Topic moved from my LiveJournal: <a href="http://i1ey.livejournal.com/9895.html">http://i1ey.livejournal.com/9895.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61548/</a></p>
