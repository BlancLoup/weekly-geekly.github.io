    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the new series, four types of batteries: AA 2450 and 1000 mAh, AAA 900 and 500 mAh.  They cost, respectively, 499, 249, 349 and 199 rubles for four jokes (~ 125, 62, 87, 50 rubles apiece). <br><br>  A small and lightweight Winning charger for two AA / AA batteries that connects to any charge from a smartphone / tablet with USB output costs 199 rubles.  A large STORHOGEN charger for 12 batteries, which can be hung on the wall, costs 2499 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27b/92c/cce/27b92ccce4858179bff7c9aabec8f680.jpg"><br><br>  I tested the new batteries and chargers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/363/7b0/bb8/3637b0bb8148a0197c6075a3ce6662ca.jpg"><br><br>  All batteries are made using Ready to Use technology (or LSD).  This means that they are sold already charged and do not lose their charge for a long time during storage after charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/622/054/7d8/6220547d8756d178e4ffe4b4921538b1.jpg"><br><br>  For smaller batteries (AA 1000 mAh and AAA 500 mAh), the manufacturer guarantees 1500 charge-discharge cycles, for larger batteries (AA 2450 mAh and AAA 900 mAh) - 500 cycles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d29/850/c6a/d29850c6a1289dbee1c6a99481230783.jpg"><br><br>  All batteries are made in Japan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67e/c74/f19/67ec74f196e756ab756fa14aae0bde74.jpg"><br><br>  It is very likely that they are made at the same factory and using the same technology as the famous Eneloop, which were previously sold under the Sanyo brand, and now under the Panasonic and Fujitsu brands.  Here are just Eneloop Pro AA 2450 mAh in Russia from 330 rubles for a joke, and even in the cheapest Dutch online store ru.nkon.nl they are sold for 2.1 euro per piece (now it is about 150 rubles), and in IKEA AA batteries 2450 mAh cost 125 rubles apiece. <br><br>  To accurately determine the capacity, I used the <a href="http://ammo1.livejournal.com/470053.html">analyzer Oleg Artamonov</a> .  The AA 2450 mAh batteries were discharged with currents of 500 mA and 2500 mA, the remaining batteries with a current of 200 mA.  All batteries were first discharged without pre-charging, to check how much energy was left in them after they were charged during manufacture. <br><br>  Batteries were discharged to a voltage of 0.9 V. At my disposal there were 4 copies of each battery, I tested everything. <br><br><h4>  Accumulators IKEA LADDA AA 2450 mAh 703.038.76 </h4><br><br>  Discharge current 500 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f3/b06/aa6/9f3b06aa605199927260e8057d32b5db.png"><br><br>  The real capacity is 2460-2540 mAh, which is higher than the declared one by 0.5-3.5%.  The difference between the worst and the best instance - 3%. <br><br>  A discharge current of 2500 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a54/946/916/a54946916d37f04d00e868146b3d5c9a.png"><br><br>  A discharge current of 2500 mA is a very heavy duty for batteries, in which they become very hot.  In real life, no one consumer is so tormented by batteries.  There are only consumers (for example, flash units and cameras with flash) that consume a very large current for a few seconds, but after that the battery has time to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù. <br>  In such an extreme mode, the batteries showed a capacity of 2310-2390 mAh.  Excellent result! <br><br>  The capacity of batteries taken out of the package (production date 07.16, so that they were stored for less than a month) amounted to 1810-1860 mAh, that is, about 73% of the total capacity. <br><br><h4>  Accumulators IKEA LADDA AA 1000 mAh 203.038.74 </h4><br><br>  Discharge current 200 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37f/f56/c93/37ff56c933e5f8db4e97547de9ebbbe7.png"><br><br>  Real capacity - 1020-1040 mAh, which is higher than the declared by 2-4%.  The difference between the worst and the best instance is 2%. <br><br>  The capacity of the batteries taken out of the package (production date 04.16, storage time - 4 months) was 790-820 mAh, that is, 77-79% of full capacity. <br><br><h4>  Accumulators IKEA LADDA AAA 900 mAh 903.038.80 </h4><br><br>  Discharge current 200 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/822/b61/295/822b61295e513491dd5a71c318609432.png"><br><br>  Real capacity - 930 mAh, which is higher than the declared 3%.  Copies are almost identical. <br><br>  The capacity of the batteries taken out of the package (production date 06.16, storage time - 2 months) was 620-630 mAh, that is, 67% of the total capacity. <br><br><h4>  Accumulators IKEA LADDA AAA 500 mAh 303.038.83 </h4><br><br>  Discharge current 200 mA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a0/dfc/bd8/6a0dfcbd82521da9079e7abcda65ecc5.png"><br><br>  Real capacity - 510-520 mAh, which is higher than the declared by 2-4%.  The difference between the worst and the best instance is 2%. <br><br>  The capacity of batteries taken out of the package (production date 04.16, storage time - 4 months) was 390-400 mAh, that is, 76% of the total capacity. <br><br>  Great batteries!  All of them have even a little more capacity than stated.  Large capacity batteries are suitable for devices that consume a lot of energy (cameras, toys with motors, joysticks), and smaller capacity batteries for devices that consume little (watches, consoles, mice and keyboards).  When choosing, it is worth remembering that smaller batteries have three times more charge-discharge cycles and that means they will ‚Äúlive‚Äù much longer. <br><br><h4>  Winning and Storhogen Chargers </h4><br><br>  Both chargers use a low current charge mode.  Such charging takes more time, but it is believed that the charge of a small current can prolong the life of the battery. <br><br>  The WINNINGE charger 403.036.32 charges one or two AA / AAA batteries, connecting to any charging for smartphones or tablets with USB output. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4bd/90e/2be/4bd90e2be0fff2a13c146ce2ea3ccc22.jpg"><br><br>  The device is cheap, compact and lightweight (only 39 grams).  It can even be used to charge AA / AAA batteries on the road from a mobile battery (power bank).  The only white LED is on when charging, goes out when charging is finished and flashes if something went wrong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d18/a52/4d4/d18a524d44159a8b43c71f31a2df3803.jpg"><br><br>  AA batteries the device charges with a current of 220 mA, batteries AAA with a current of 110 mA.  This means that charging for four types of batteries will take the following time: <br><br>  AA 2450 mAh - 12 hours; <br>  AA 1000 mAh - 5 hours; <br>  AAA 900 mAh - 9 hours; <br>  AAA 500 mAh - 5 hours. <br><br>  The STORHOGEN 603.036.50 charger can charge from 1 to 12 batteries.  It is designed so that charged batteries can be stored directly in it.  The device can be hung on the wall.  It has a door that closes the battery compartments.  A device with a closed door resembles a key locker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/492/b49/7b2/492b497b2e1eb53e62c1102b327104ec.jpg"><br><br>  The top row of batteries is installed ‚Äúupside down‚Äù - with the positive contact down.  On the liquid crystal display device shows the level of charge.  Four levels of charge are shown for each battery - from full charge (empty battery symbol is shown) to full charge (three risks inside the battery symbol).  If the battery is not installed, the battery symbol for the corresponding slot is not shown. <br>  Animation of the image when there is no charge.  The blue indicator light works for a minute after installing or removing any battery or after opening the cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb8/13b/57d/cb813b57da78b277b8d57db919257028.jpg"><br><br>  AA batteries the device charges with a current of 250 mA, AAA batteries with a current of 110 mA.  This means that charging for four types of batteries will take the following time: <br><br>  AA 2450 mAh - 10.5 hours; <br>  AA 1000 mAh - 4.5 hours; <br>  AAA 900 mAh - 9 hours; <br>  AAA 500 mAh - 5 hours. <br><br>  The charger is ‚Äúsmart‚Äù - it analyzes the charge level of the batteries inserted into it and displays it correctly.  When all the batteries are charged, the charger first consumes 0.2 W, and then goes to sleep, while consuming less than 0.01 W from the network. <br><br>  IKEA stores now sell the best batteries on the market at the lowest price.  Two new chargers are also unique in many ways. <br><br>  ps My tests of all batteries and accumulators look in the posts of my blog that have separate addresses <a href="http://batterytest.ru/">batterytest.ru</a> and <a href="http://accutest.ru/">accutest.ru</a> . <br><br>  ¬© 2016, Alexey Nadyozhin </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396627/</a></p>
