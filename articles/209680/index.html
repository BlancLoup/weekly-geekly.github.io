  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Videophone D900 based on Android 4.2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Back in March 2013, at the CeBit exhibition, Fanvil announced a new IP videophone D900, designed to replace the D800 model over time.  And so the first samples came to us for the tests.  Let's see what has changed in the new model compared to its predecessor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/b43/c8a/b76b43c8a87c3e25f0d5f72a47678b42.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fig.1 Appearance of the D900 <br>  <b>Appearance, equipment</b> <br>  Videophone D900 inherited the original and elegant design of the D800, but the main color is now black.  Unfortunately, there is still no possibility of wall mounting, which, in my opinion, would be far from superfluous for a 7-inch videophone.  It remains to hope that in the future the manufacturer will correct this constructive moment. <br>  Like its predecessor, the D900 has 2 Ethernet ports with the ability to work in Bridge mode and configure separate VLANs for voice and data, a port for connecting a handset, a 3.5 mm port for connecting a headset, a USB port, a connector for installing an SD card and HDMI port.  The phone can be powered both from the AC network through a 12V 1A power adapter, and by PoE technology, by connecting a PoE switch or a PoE injector to the phone's LAN port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15e/385/330/15e3853303f5dc17c1035a008d2a5aae.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.2 Connectors on the right side of the phone <br>  The 5-megapixel camera is located to the right of the screen, the camera control lever is on the rear panel. <br><br>  <b>First start</b> <br>  Improvements are immediately apparent when you first turn on.  First of all - this is a new display with high image quality.  The screen resolution is 800 by 480 pixels, the display is replaced by capacitive with multi-touch technology.  The display responds well to touch, there are no stickings when working with applications and flipping through the desktop screens, the phone handles all commands quickly and smoothly.  If you look at the menu ‚Äúinformation about the phone,‚Äù you can note the good hardware characteristics of the videophone - 1 GB of RAM and 4 GB of built-in Flash. <br>  Unlike the D800, the D900 comes with a more modern version of Android - 4.2.  Since  Google Play is not installed on the phone, if you need to install additional applications, you will need to first download the apk files to the USB stick and then connect it to the phone.  As in the previous model, the D900 provides a file manager.  USB flash drives and SD cards are identified without problems.  And although the lack of Google Play makes it difficult to operate the phone at home, it can nevertheless be useful when used in a corporate environment - it‚Äôs less likely that users will run out of phone memory with additional applications. <br>  In the D900, some of the flaws of the previous model were also fixed - now the standard keyboard comes with support for the Russian language, and the hardware dialing keys respond better to touch.

      <br>
      <b>Customization</b> <br>  Setting up the D900 is similar to its predecessor, adjusted for the new operating system.  Some options, such as network settings, can be configured via the phone menu; for some, such as VoIP options, there is also a configuration option through the WEB interface. <br>  At the bottom of the screen are the familiar Android shortcut keys, as well as some additional ones, for example, the access key to the shortcut panel or subscriber status monitoring with a total of 96 soft keys. <br><br>  WEB is almost unchanged from the D800.  The VoIP part is still represented by the 4th SIP accounts, G.722, G.711A / u, G.723.1, G.729AB, iLBC, AMR codecs.  The changes affected the video settings, now the resolution is 720P. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ca/e33/d4d/6cae33d4d636a2528ad953460258e0e8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.3 Settings parameters of audio and video. <br><br>  <b>Additional functionality</b> <br>  The D900 model has a number of pre-installed applications - WEB browser, calendar, email client, media file player.  The remaining necessary applications, as mentioned above, can be installed separately using USB.  Compatibility with third-party applications has become much better, for example, video calls began to work in Skype.  While the truth is only through the speakerphone, the manufacturer promises to improve Skype work through the handset in the next software releases ... A more powerful hardware platform and better compatibility with various applications opens up wide opportunities for using the D900 not only as a videophone, but also for solving various integrator tasks. <br>  Like the D800, the D900 can be synchronized with a Google account or with an account on the corporate network.  After adding an account, you can synchronize contacts, mail, calendar, etc. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  In the D900 model, Fanvil was able to eliminate most of the disadvantages of the previous model, while reducing the price ... Given the excellent performance, the ability to use additional applications to solve various problems and an attractive price, the D900 has practically no competitors in the segment of low-cost IP video phones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209680/</a></p>
