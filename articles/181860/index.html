      Baseline, a loved one on vacation needed an apparatus that would not be a pity to ruin on the beach.  Hesitated between the Huawei U8666E Ascend Y201 Pro and MegaFon Login.  As a result, after reading a lot of laudatory reviews, I decided to purchase Megafon Login, since he was everywhere presented as an acceptable budget phone for 1999 rubles. <br><br>  The price turned out to be the first disappointment, the device indicated above costs only if you purchase it for the promotion and connect the mobile Internet XS to any megaphone phone number (seriously, with a certain amount of luck, you can pay 570 rubles in Megafon‚Äôs office and make almost anyone happy Pleasantly, by connecting an unexpected non-predictable service), the second disappointment turned out to be that the devices, according to the words of the managers, ‚Äúdisassembled like hot cakes‚Äù and failed to get the phone right away. <br><br>  But, somehow becoming the happy owner of the phone, I began to prepare him for the trip on vacation.  Opening the box, I found the instruction, charging at 0.5A and very crappy headphones, the factory protective film was also pasted on the display with small bubbles on the sides, in principle, this kit was quite expected. <br><br>  The unexpected was that in order to open the back cover of the phone, after a pair of broken nails, I had to arm myself with a time screwdriver.  <b>The lid is very tight</b> and most likely the younger generation, pensioners and many beautiful ladies will have difficulty opening it if necessary.  The advantage of such a tight attachment may be that at first glance everything closes tightly and tightly. <br>  Immediately I will say that the phone MegaFon Login with the words of the seller <b>will only work with the Sim card - "Megaphone".</b>  Having installed Sim and Micro-SD cards, I found that Micro SD is not readable by me (looking ahead, I will say that I did not have time to deal with this). <br>  The phone case is strangely less pleasant to the touch, at least it does not cause a desire to throw it against the wall.  The back surface does not slip.  The only thing I can not say 100%, but the edging of the case looks more like plastic than metal, most likely it is stylization. <br>  Turning on the device, we hear and see a vigorous screensaver of the cellular operator and immediately understand that the <b>speaker on the phone is weak.</b>  But one thing pleases, the phone is loaded quite an acceptable time.  But immediately after downloading it becomes clear that the reviews on the Internet do not lie, and the phone has a <b>disgusting quality display with an uncalibrated touchscreen</b> .  And if you can still get used to a very bad viewing angle and constant care in the ‚Äúmilk‚Äù, then the touchscreen is a separate song. <br>  Type a search query or SMS message using the built-in android keyboard (other keyboards were not initially installed), it is almost impossible. <br>  By pressing your finger directly into the center of the letter, you can easily get any of the neighbors surrounding it, but not the one you need.  Thus, typing a password from the mail becomes a very exciting activity. <br>  According to my subjective feelings, after installing the official update (you can over the air), the keyboard starts to work a little better (although this may be the effect of auto-suggestion). <br>  The firmware update is downloaded from a separate application (I was somewhat surprised, I got used to the fact that updates are checked in the settings of the phone). <br>  Phone operating system, if memory serves me - naked <b>android 4.0.4</b> <br>  The pre-installed software is not very much, the <b>software of domestic suppliers of various information services is pre-installed</b> with the phone <b>: Mail.ru, Championat.ru, etc., it‚Äôs</b> good or bad to say. <br>  But what I really didn‚Äôt like was the top pull-down menu, in which you can usually quickly turn off Wifi, GPS, open settings and so on.  After my Asus, it was very unusual to see <b>unsigned pictographs</b> , but in principle you can understand by typing and logic that what‚Äôs the point and the pictograms there, in my opinion, of all 6. <br>  Also, the design of the desktop is not pleased, it certainly heals quickly, even some widgets and live wallpapers come bundled with the phone, but this is the first Android phone in my memory, where the desktop is so nauseating at the factory settings. <br><br>  Since I didn‚Äôt have time to use the phone for a long time, I don‚Äôt try to assess the hardware objectively, I can say that the phone didn‚Äôt hang, the network catches normally, there is no reason to complain about Wifi either, while actively using Wifi and installing voluminous applications from Play market, the back cover heats up noticeably.  Of the applications, only translators and maps managed to try out, due to the disgusting quality of the touchscreen, typing words in the translator was very difficult, by the way, the multitouch naturally also does not work perfectly, when <b>trying to scale the image in the browser, sometimes the result was unpredictable</b> .  The phone has a joystick or something like that.  I didn‚Äôt have time to evaluate it because I didn‚Äôt understand what it is and where it works, I can only say from memory that, by default, when I press the joystick while the main screen is open, it causes the opening of applications assigned to buttons, but the information content of this joystick again, not perfect and something like a backlash steering wheel on the VAZ 2107. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have time to look at the camera in detail, let's say it exists and photographs something, in my opinion even with flash. <br><br>  The attentive reader in the text could already guess that I didn‚Äôt have much time to do with this phone.  The reason for this was the <b>band of broken pixels</b> that appeared from nowhere <b>across the entire display</b> .  The phone did not fall, did not get wet, did not overheat so as to fry eggs on it, almost no third-party software was installed on the phone (nothing that would not have been tested on other phones earlier). <br><br>  Resetting the settings to the factory ones did not help, taking out the battery too, honestly did not want to reflash, in the end it was the last straw and I asked my friends to drop in to hand over the phone. <br><br>  Money returned 1999 rubles, naturally 570 rubles to the mobile Internet (which was not needed in this case), nobody will return.  It even seems to me that this is a tricky marketing ploy, as in any case, companies will stay in the black, but this is certainly only a guess. <br><br>  As a result, Huawei U8666E Ascend Y201 Pro purchased today, it turned out to be 1,100 rubles more expensive, but the device is much nicer, the display is noticeably better, the SD card was found immediately and without problems, the pre-installed software is nicer, and for the same 6 hours of operation it has not yet covered itself copper basin. <br><br>  It is clear that it is difficult to expect miracles from the phone for 2000 rubles, but he didn‚Äôt even work for a day, which is very surprising. <br>  With this post, I do not pretend to anything, I just express my opinion and I hope that this post will help someone to weigh all the pros and cons of acquiring a megaphone login. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181860/</a></p>
