Let's try to understand who, why, and how much the ERP, whether it is necessary to regulate something at all, and where, for all that, the very flexibility that ERP supposedly does not have. <br><br>  When SAP, as Wikipedia informs us, took the first steps in 1972 ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... what was the first functional?  Accounting.  And so far, SAP is often beginning to be introduced precisely from accounting - everything is relatively clear there, and ‚Äúcompletely outsiders, not from our district,‚Äù have taken care of the regulations.

      What does any firm do?  The company makes money.  That is, everything that happens is reflected in financial status.  The money came - we paid the bill.  Raw materials arrived - finished products left the warehouse.  Scratched on the bottom of the barrel - baked a bun (i.e., they produced something) ... well, in general, led accountants!  You know what I mean.  It is still Italians in the XIII century came up with, to SAP. <br><br>  After SAP sneaked into accounting, and data entry began to be performed not from punched cards, but from the keyboard, <s>lazy</s> smart heads thought of using the same approach for purchasing, production, quality control, etc.  And that's what came out of it. <br><br>  ERP systems - a huge amount.  Large, small, for different industries ... I had a chance to work with three <s>and a half</s> , and all three were very different.  And yes, dear lovers to write something of their own, with ERP, you also will not be bored. <br><br>  Almost everything that (from the point of view of the manufacturer) is designed to make life easier for a manufacturing enterprise has an ERP tag.  God be their judge ... I don‚Äôt want to polish topics like ‚ÄúERP has a warehouse accounting system‚Äù in this article - firstly, it‚Äôs not always there, (but in some places there is a reservation system for hotel rooms) and secondly it‚Äôs not which does not oblige.  If you don‚Äôt want it - let your storekeeper bring the warehouse list every month to the accounting department, there are no problems. <br><br>  I would like to dwell on the fact that, according to one colleague, we are ‚Äúgiven‚Äù by such a system. <br><br>  Eternal developer problem: what stack to use;  how to lead the development;  where to take the developers;  who know this stack;  who to contact if everything is bad;  how to control the quality of development ... <br><br>  Specificity of business applications (in addition to the above): how to make your program work in 10 - 20 - 30 years, please with all the historical data;  HOW TO PRINT (for those who were surprised: printing is a separate topic at all, in SAP there are three engines in parallel);  how to guarantee data consistency. <br><br>  Good ERP will solve these problems for you.  In the heat of battle, we forgot that SAP is a development system (in which ERP functionality is performed and a lot more).  Do not believe it - download a mini SAP.  It is ‚Äúnaked‚Äù - it contains only this very development system, server, database and client.  You will not find any ERP functionality there.  But you will find graphic designers of database tables, your own programming language, a packaging system for transporting programs between systems, a window designer, user management, access rights, etc.  (Now I am showered with rotten tomatoes, because a lot has changed in the "new" SAP. I repent, I confess ...) <br><br>  If for ERP they invented their own language, then it is also imprisoned for this class of tasks.  And this is all - to speed up the development process!  (laughter) <br><br>  Yes, and SAP specialists you will always find - only have to pay.  And so - the place of bread ... Another thing is if the only programmer at YOUR company, which over the past 10 years has been rewritten in Java, well, really all the programs from the button to open the door to the warehouse automation system, fell under the rink.  It's all bad, and no one to help.  But the cost of IT all these years have been ridiculous.  Well, yes, he laughs well ... you know. <br><br>  Years passed, SAP acquired customers, and each customer had their own cockroaches in their heads.  Someone loads oranges in barrels, someone gives loans, and someone provides services.  And so it came out (1) multi-level logic, which is configured for a specific client;  (2) entry points for programming in a project;  (3) a huge ecosystem of modules - maintenance, for example, or import-export. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And what's wrong?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Well, it‚Äôs no secret ... The code, which can be up to 30 years old, and which is written according to the canons of that time, is not very pleasant to maintain in the 21st century.  Therefore, three print engines.  Therefore, there are different options for working with memory, therefore object-oriented <abbr title="SAP application programming language">ABAP</abbr> and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  And in general, a lot of ‚Äúold‚Äù, ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúcompletely new‚Äù technologies.  And there are many more systems in which, in parallel with the new programs, work thirty years ago? <br></div></div><br>  On top of this layer, programs are written in the project that automate frequently repeated situations even more.  Much can be done manually, but few users know the system so well. <br><br>  As for me, most projects fail because <br><br><ul><li>  chose the wrong ERP </li><li>  out of luck with consultants </li><li>  failed to systematize what is happening in the company </li><li>  it was impossible to systematize what we managed to systematize in ERP, but really want to (and mutilated ERP) </li><li>  the staff did the same anyway </li><li>  Immediately wanted to automate everything by 110% </li><li>  We decided that ERP is just another toy for IT people, let them implement and </li></ul><br>  So if we are talking about the implementation of ERP, and not about moving to another ERP - you go quieter, you will continue.  And it is very important to remember that ERP is <s>for centuries</s> to decades.  Implementation is just the beginning. <br><br>  At this, let me take my leave. <br><br>  Yours, m_OO_m </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456654/</a></p>
