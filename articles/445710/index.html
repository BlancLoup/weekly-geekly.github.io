      <b>And this is where we start.</b> <br>  We often start with questions about working environment management. <br>  The concept is simple: there are factors that interfere with work - they need to be gradually leveled, there are factors that contribute to work - they need to be turned on and gradually activated. <br>  The key word is gradually.  Step by step.  Systematically. <br><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, we know about Kanban, Dashboards, KPI, Project Management and SCRUM. <br>  But there are basic factors that will bring us closer to friendliness, creativity and efficiency of the team and company faster, easier and cheaper. <br>  Of course, without canceling the SCRUM. <br><br>  So, questions about the management of the working environment. <br><br>  <b>The first question.</b>  <b>What about the microclimate?</b> <br><br>  No, not in the team.  And with the physical and chemical characteristics of the air in the office? <br><br>  The problem is that in good and very good offices usually Moscow is warm, dry and little oxygen.  Why?  The cultural habit, or such are the typical settings of the ventilation and air conditioning system, or the climate, when either heating or air conditioning works for 9 months a year. <br><br>  Consider more.  <u>Air temperature.</u> <br>  Normal, stimulating active brain activity, temperature - up to + 21C. <br>  Typical office temperature - above + 23 ¬∞ C - ideal for falling asleep, but not for work. <br>  For comparison: in the offices of Shanghai, Singapore, the UAE, etc.  by our standards, pretty cool - less than + 20C. <br><br>  <u>Relative humidity.</u> <br>  Typical office humidity, especially when operating the air conditioner or heating - less than 50%. <br>  Normal for a healthy person: 50-70%. <br>  Why is it important?  With low humidity in the airways, the mucus rheology changes (it dries out), local immunity decreases and, consequently, susceptibility to respiratory infections increases. <br>  One humidifier in the office saves at least one working week spent in the fight against ARVI (in terms of a year). <br><br>  <u>About carbon dioxide.</u>  With increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, the central nervous system of a person is gradually inhibited and he seems to fall asleep.  Why is it a lot in offices?  Because airing and conditioning are different things.  And the first often does not work. <br><br>  <b>The second question.</b>  <b>Water.</b> <br><br>  Water-salt balance is a very significant factor in the functioning of the brain and the whole organism.  80% of droppers that are placed in hospitals around the world are water-salt solutions.  And helps. <br>  Most offices have drinking water, although not always. <br><br>  But there are nuances.  Psychological and cultural. <br>  Imagine: the cooler is in the next room, five meters away. <br>  This is problem?  Yes. <br>  People sitting near the cooler consider the water ‚Äútheir own‚Äù, due to the genetically determined habit of protecting their source from outsiders.  Therefore, walking five meters away is stressful for the thirsty, and an extra reason for aggression for the guardians.  And so begins the confrontation of divisions, genetically determined. <br><br>  Cultural nuance.  In Russia, it is not customary to drink water.  A person who drinks water causes keen interest: something is wrong with him.  Drinking tea, coffee is normal.  Water is not. <br><br>  However, coffee and tea have a clear diuretic effect - that is, they effectively remove water from the body.  The result: the more coffee without water - the worse the brain works.  Although the American and European habits of carrying water with you not only to fitness, but also to meetings, are gradually taking root. <br>  Conclusion: the water should be freely available to all and without the "keepers". <br><br>  <b>The third question.</b>  <b>Where can you eat?</b> <br><br>  The topic is so obvious how badly solved. <br><br>  I do not want to go into the features of a healthy diet, but the theses, with which most experts agree, are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  one must eat often and little by little; </li><li>  sweets are not the basis of healthy eating; </li><li>  thinking is an energy-consuming process. </li></ul><br><br>  A typical Moscow ‚Äúsolution‚Äù looks like this: in 15 minutes there is a cafe / dining room / restaurant, where there is a business lunch and queues.  The office has cookies and sweets, and what the staff brought with them.  But it is impossible to eat at the workplace, and there is no place to have breakfast and dinner. <br><br>  We compare the ‚Äútypical solution‚Äù with the theses above.  Not beating. <br><br>  Google‚Äôs research clearly says: access to healthy food within 150 feet of the workplace is a factor that significantly increases staff satisfaction and efficiency. <br><br>  Add from the Russian experience: ordering food for a couple of hundred rubles per employee per day (excluding corporate discounts) gives an increase in an hour and a half to their employees, active work. <br><br>  <u>Know-How.</u>  In a Russian IT company, breakfast stopped serving exactly at 9 am and midnight, and dinner began at exactly seven.  Obviously, how it affected the discipline. <br><br>  <b>The fourth question.</b>  <b>Do you see the sun?</b> <br><br>  Example: Skolkovo, Technopark. <br>  Sample and benchmark office and innovative design. <br>  However, in half of the offices, the windows face the covered atrium. <br>  And a quarter of a year, half of the workers in the Technopark do not see the sun in the morning (it has not yet risen), in the evening (it has already gone down) and in the afternoon (if they do not smoke). <br><br>  Why is it important?  Lack of sun is a lack of melatonin.  The most rapid manifestations: a decrease in activity, self-esteem, mood and the development of dysphoria. <br><br>  Conclusion: closed balconies, verandas and roofs - interfere with performance.  But walk in the afternoon - quite a raise it myself. <br><br>  <b>By the way, can you walk?</b> <br><br>  In the office, down the hall, down the street?  Can I get up at meetings? <br>  These are questions not only about physical form. <br>  For insights, insights, intuition and creativity are responsible "kinesthetic" areas of the brain, the same as for the movement. <br>  To put it bluntly: in the movement, ‚Äúcatching an idea‚Äù is much simpler, just like ‚Äúutilizing‚Äù extra stress hormones. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to move the desktop?</b> <br>  Swap places without leadership approval? <br>  To sit not at the table, but somewhere else? <br>  This phenomenon works here: changing the point of view on office space - often changes the point of view on the subject of thinking.  And the view of the horizon is better than the view of the wall: looking at the wall rarely leads to global thoughts. <br><br>  Is it possible to sit so that there is no one behind you? <br>  Someone behind the back - increases anxiety and closer burnout. <br>  And this does not go away - again, genetically determined. <br>  So it is important to see the employee monitor, if he has a mobile? <br><br>  Here we are approaching the concept of <u>‚Äúpersonification of the workplace‚Äù</u> . <br>  A personalized workplace (or office) decorated with toys, amulets, books, posters and three monitors is a sign of the involvement and development of a work-life balance.  A clean and tidy tables - on the contrary. <br><br>  In one line, mention the <b>noise</b> . <br>  Here are the standards: <a href="https://base.garant.ru/4174553/">https://base.garant.ru/4174553/</a> .  Watch it is necessary Table 2. <br><br>  <b>Last question.</b>  <b>And at work you can sleep?</b> <br><br>  It still sounds provocative.  But not always and not everywhere. <br>  On this topic there will be a separate article on the materials of our special study. <br><br>  So, <b>here are the 7 main factors</b> that determine the working environment: <br><br>  1. Air. <br>  2. Water. <br>  3. Food <br>  4. The sun. <br>  5. Mobility. <br>  6. Personification of jobs. <br>  7. The noise level. <br><br>  Solving these simple and ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù questions is often enough to increase the benevolence, responsiveness, development of the ‚Äúteam spirit‚Äù and a good basis for starting the introduction of something remarkable, for example, PRINCE2. <br><br>  <b>Management of the working environment as a system process.</b> <br><br>  The concept is simple: there are factors that interfere with work - they need to be gradually leveled, there are factors that contribute to work - they need to be turned on and gradually activated. <br>  And there is almost a universal and systemic mechanism: <br><br><ol><li>  regular (at least quarterly) staff surveys; </li><li>  choice (at least one) of what will make the life of employees better; </li><li>  implementation of the solution; </li><li>  improvement of the implemented solution. </li></ol><br><br>  <u>Pro economics costs.</u>  The solution to any of the problems described leads to an increase in labor productivity and returns, which is much more than the cost of implementation.  All these are extremely attractive projects from an investment point of view. <br>  And the leaders of the market and industry have fully proved it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445710/</a></p>
