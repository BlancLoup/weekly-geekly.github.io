  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The effect of overselling in modern hosting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am in the process of choosing between ‚Äúrenewing a contract with <a href="http://www.host.ru/">Zenon</a> on hosting <a href="http://www.niksite.ru/">my site</a> , probably at the same time switching to a more expensive tariff plan‚Äù and ‚Äúbuying overseas hosting on the cheap‚Äù.  In this connection, he made a small study of the current state of this market. <br><br>  However, the current offer in the market of hosting services is striking a clear geo-dependency.  If <a href="http://www.host.ru/prices/hosting/">we</a> can get only a hundred-other megabytes of disk space for a dozen other conditional units, then <a href="http://dreamhost.com/hosting.html">for them</a> the same (or even smaller) money goes for hundreds of gigabytes.  And if you search for the keyword COUPON in the vicinity of the host name, the cost may drop by another 10-50%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhat is the catch?‚Äù - the modern man thinks first.  Where are without him, there is a trick.  Even two: <a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  The so-called overselling.  Sold more resources than it is possible to provide.  Accordingly, if a significant percentage of users try to use these resources, the hoster will fall.  Since usually a noticeable percentage of users are not trying hard to get paid for by the maximum (but they still get something), the hosting servers are in a certain average position - they don‚Äôt stand like a glove, but they don‚Äôt lie either.  So, sway.  Slow response and slow connection - these are the first pleasures of using overselling hosts. </li><li>  The fraud that follows from the first point is logical: if only a small percentage of users want to use resources to the maximum, and the rest simply fall for advertising and now do not know themselves, why would they have so many resources ... Why not just shoot them?  This is exactly what happens.  When someone, say, creates too much (albeit within specified limits) traffic, a claim is made for, for example, consumption of a processor resource above the norm and, at best, it is proposed to switch to a more expensive tariff plan.  At worst, the offender‚Äôs account is automatically blocked, and the person is often forced to change the host. </li></ol>

      Not that domestic hosters were deprived of such disadvantages.  But definitely they are less noticeable. <br><br>  For example, here is a couple of overselling overselling hosters who have (deservedly supposedly) a fairly good reputation on <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/">webhostingtalk.com</a> (it seems the largest forum on this topic): <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://hostgator.com/shared.shtml">HostGator</a> : pursuing a tough policy behind number two.  If you too actively use the resources provided on cheap tariff plans, then you are seriously at risk of being automatically blocked.  On the other hand, with the power of this policy, this hosting has the glory of quite nimble. </li><li>  <a href="http://dreamhost.com/hosting.html">DreamHost</a> : as a smaller hoster appreciates its customers and, accordingly, is much more tolerant to the consumption of resources.  Of course, at the same time, his work does not differ at special speed. </li></ul>  <a href="http://www.webhostingtalk.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D586582">Judging by the reviews</a> , in both cases it is quite possible to consume all of the declared disk space, but it is desirable not to approach the limit by traffic. <br><br>  How to calculate that this tariff plan is overselling?  Personally, I simply compare the proposed parameters with the VPS and / or Dedicated plans that the hoster has.  Dedicated is very difficult to do overselling.  Overselling VPS, in general, is found: <a href="http://www.vpslink.com/vps-hosting/">VPSLink</a> (from $ 5 per month per gig disk, hundred gig traffic and 64 megabytes of RAM), although judging by the reviews, some find some kind of pleasure using even such a cheap VPS, although of course notice a noticeable delay with the response. <br><br>  No matter how cool you are, the quality of hosting still correlates quite well with the money spent on it.  For orientation: the cheapest dedicated (dedicated server) nowadays costs about $ 100, a good unmanaged VPS (dedicated virtual server) about $ 40, tolerable shared-hosting (dedicated login on the server) about $ 20.  Per month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8446/</a></p>
