  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Next big thing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Whoever you are and whatever you do, the question is not how good you are or how good your songs, smiles, poems, door handles, interiors, paintings, services and buns are. <br><br>  Although, if we are talking about buns, then you are not benefited from the fact that not only your street and your district knows you.  Yes, your bakery can become a local landmark, and every tourist will definitely turn to you, and not just to the local art gallery.  But still this tourist will not be able to try your breakfast roll, being at home. <br><br>  If what you are doing is not so tightly tied to the place and time, and if in order to use your services it is not so necessary to go to you, say, at the hairdresser, then certainly you will not interfere with advertising.  Or, if not directly advertising, anyway, any efforts to ensure that not only your immediate clients and those whom they have time to tell know about you should be made. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Once it was enough to print your ad in each number of the only city newspaper, and everyone who needed would know about you.  Once it was necessary to cover, besides the newspaper, also a radio station, print a couple of leaflets and put them in the necessary metrics, and, what the hell is not joking, your city could be so big that it could be your own television channel. <br><br>  But now the question of communicating information about yourself may not be so trivial.  It is because there is too much information.  For example, in order to convey my message to me, it is absolutely useless to try using traditional advertising methods: I last saw a newspaper a year and a half ago, I listened to the radio for 15 minutes every 2 weeks in a random minibus, I don‚Äôt watch TV at all.  And not because I am such a non-interested snob.  I just do not have time to follow all sources of information at once.  Well, then, even if I watched TV, how to guess which of the dozens of channels I would tune in today.  When there were three TV channels, it still made sense to talk about some kind of information space.  When there were 33 of them, and there were many spaces and they practically ceased to intersect. <br><br>  Yes, some can afford to be present on television, on radio and in newspapers and on the Internet.  But it is about the Internet that will be discussed now.  A year ago, in order to convey information to me it was possible to make a website about your services, to spend a little on search engine optimization and contextual advertising, and I would not have passed your message.  But if you remember how I and many others are consuming information lately, it is clear that now this is also not enough.  No, seriously, I now use search engine much less frequently than before.  Yes, and I have not visited news sites for a long time.  And all because I have long understood what kind of information I need.  And I get my daily dose of some of the carefully selected RSS feeds, some of the well-tuned friends in a livejournal, and some other places that most Internet users still have a rather vague idea about.  And if I did not live where I live, and my main language would be English, then MySpace, Facebook, Digg and a whole bunch of all heresies would be added to the list of these strange words. <br><br>  So what am I talking about?  Now, in order to be available on the Internet, it is no longer enough to be only on the Internet.  It is necessary to flicker both in LiveJournal and in MySpace and even, I will not be afraid of this word, in Li.ru.  All these strange words have grown to such an extent that for many they have become synonymous with the Internet.  And besides the list of your favorite friends in LJ, a person may not see anything at all in the Internet.  And at the same time do not know about anything that does not fall into the Internet. <br><br>  Can you manage to be everywhere?  I'm not sure about something.  If only because I understand very well that the same Li.ru and LiveJournal are made for completely different people.  And the one who found the approach to the public in one of these systems is unlikely to be able to convey his message to people in the other.  Even if he spends a decent time trying to figure it out.  And time is natural, everything is not enough.  Even if you deal only with the dissemination of information and nothing else. <br><br>  So you need to either come to terms with the fact that your advertising conveys a message only to the ever-diminishing audience of traditional media, or look for professionals who work with new media.  With all the new media, not only with those that have already gathered millions of audiences for many years, but also with those media that have just appeared.  Because the picture of the interests and preferences of those who make the decisions you need can be unpredictable and drastically change in a matter of months.  And turn to those new media that today are virtually unknown to anyone except for a handful of professionals and enthusiasts. <br><br>  But how nice it is in 2007m to quit casually that you have been known in MySpace since 2003.  Or in the 2011m to know that a good half of your customers found out about you thanks to a page on one of the sites, which will be transferred to the stage of public testing only tomorrow. <br><br>  And we have already left a request to be in the forefront of those who test this site, yeah. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12936/</a></p>
