  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Recruitment by the method of "priority folders" in the format hrbox.ru</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The ‚ÄúPriority folders‚Äù method is a simple formalization of the most common process of searching and hiring people to work.  The method is simple, effective and proven in practice. <br><br>  The method is based on sorting resumes by folders depending on the current state (‚Äúnew‚Äù, ‚Äúinvited for an interview‚Äù, ‚Äúunder consideration by the customer‚Äù, etc.).  Folders are stacked so that the higher priorities are on top and the lower priorities are on the bottom.  Thus, coming to work, you can safely take the top folder and work with Candida in it.  Finished from the top, go to the folder below it, etc. <br><br>  The advantage of this approach is that you effectively spend your time, focusing primarily on the most interesting category of candidates.  Did not reach the bottom folders? .. Excellent!  This is a sign that you have developed a sufficient candidate base and are now working exclusively with those who, in your opinion, are most suitable for your job. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sounds simple enough, take it and do it.  In practice, things are not so smooth.  The table is cluttered with continuously thickening folders, the cleaning lady or the secretary ‚Äúcleaned up‚Äù on the table in your absence, the notes on the resume turn into a mess, etc.  And what to do with a stack of folders after closing a job?  In the urn?  And if in the company such vacancy will be open again, to begin an operating time of base of applicants all over again?  Now imagine your desktop laden with stacks of folders, if you work with ten vacancies at the same time ... Inconvenient, right?

      Faced with the inconvenience of paper resumes, recruiters often move to Excel.  Many shortcomings are corrected, now you can keep accurate notes on search engines, it is easy to sort virtual folders.  The entire database of applicants can be carried on a single small flash drive.  It became easier, but the inconvenience still remained.  Excel does not allow you to "attach" the file with the summary to the line with the applicant.  Besides, now you need to close the document every time your colleague needs to change something in it.  And in order to give the selected candidates to the customer for consideration, you still need to print summaries and notes on the candidate, or copy the selected resumes into a separate folder for sending by email. <br><br>  Ideal solutions are in principle, but they can be approached infinitely close.  The project team <a href="http://hrbox.ru/">hrbox.ru</a> offered the original online solution, giving it to the world for free.  After 30 seconds of registration, you get into your personal database of vacancies, candidates and their resumes.  By creating a profiler profile in <a href="http://hrbox.ru/">hrbox.ru,</a> you have the opportunity to enter into it all the information about the applicant, including the summary file and any notes in chronological order.  Candidate profiles are organized into virtual folders, implementing the ‚ÄúPriority Folders‚Äù strategy.  Sharing a profile of an already selected candidate with a customer is easier than ever ‚Äî you need to send him an invitation.  Entering the website <a href="http://hrbox.ru/">hrbox.ru</a> by invitation, the customer sees his vacancy and all candidates.  A huge plus of the service is that several people can work with the same vacancy at the same time and this can be done from any computer connected to the Internet. <br><br>  Separately, it is worth mentioning the novelty proposed by the developers of <a href="http://hrbox.ru/">hrbox.ru</a> - video tape.  Applicants have the opportunity to record a short videoequette using a webcam and microphone and answering questions you have defined.  Recorded video sheet becomes part of the profile of the applicant and is available for viewing directly to the customer.  This new product can easily replace the pre-interview process by phone, saving recruiter time and giving a more complete picture of the applicant before the first contact.  And how convenient it is to open the profile of the applicant and see the video questionnaire if a year later the same person again gets a job with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130131/</a></p>
