  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Educational trends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been reading Habr since half a year, and this time I managed to notice that there are a lot of students and teachers alike.  And since we all already smell the tangerines, and accordingly the approach of the new year.  THEN and the students session is not far off.  And with it, and not the first wave of posts about education. <br>  Since I also work in this structure, I want to share my view on the situation, to hear the views of colleagues. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In our university, as in many others, there are a large number of problems.  This is a lack of funding, and a contingent of students, and teachers.  I cannot influence our funding or what students are recruiting. <br>  But to develop myself as a teacher, I can, and I try, and I do it clearly not for salary, but probably more from the competitive moment, my mother is a teacher with great experience and she is from God.  And I want to prove to her that I‚Äôm certainly not worse than her, and maybe she‚Äôs already better off :-) <br>  I see one of the main problems of our teaching in the old methods and systems of knowledge delivery.  Taking as an example my department (Turbine), I can say that the youngest teacher is 60 years old, and the oldest is 83. One young assistant and one graduate student.  Teachers in the department with great experience, experience, and knowledge. <br>  Listening to their lectures is just fun.  A huge amount of material is supplied in a compressed form.  It is quite interesting.  But in my opinion they lack the requirements of the modern world.  Lecture in a technical college is needed.  But at the same time, it is necessary to build the rest of the educational process concluded in practical and seminar classes so that the student is simply forced to sit in the library for hours, doing self-study.  Since I do not read lectures, and I only have laboratory, practical, term papers, then I will judge them.  Working for the 4th year in the department, I had a number of ideas on what can be done.  And of course I would like to hear your opinion on this matter and your suggestions. <br>  The first thing I had to face was copy paste. <br>  <b>Note</b> We have the same calculation from year to year.  Formulas do not change.  Only the numbers change.  As a result, the fish already have.  And what a student does is correctly take a note from senior students, into which he simply drives in his numbers without going into the physics of the question, and often without even opening the training manual.  At the moment, I see only one solution - it is not to sign the note until the student answers a number of questions on how the calculation was carried out, why and from what considerations were chosen, certain parameters. <br>  <b>Drawings</b> .  I found 2 exits here.  or forcing to make 3-dimensional drawings of the base of 3d models yet, and the student will be forced to make the part himself.  or freehand drawings. <br>  The variant of handwritten drawings seems to me personally an atavism, from which it is time to get rid of, but to oblige everyone to make drawings with 3-dimensional models, I have no right, the training department does not allow for the following reasons: <br>  1st lack of licensed software. (In principle, compensated by the lack of checks and unprincipledness in these matters of students).  or using free analogs.  Or the conclusion of contracts for the free delivery of software for training purposes. <br>  The 2nd training department says, we have no right to oblige students to hand over drawings in the form of models, since we do not teach them, but to the question of why we couldn‚Äôt teach them to create models in the first courses.  The answer is simple or not the teachers or not in the State Educational Service about a word and we will not do it. <br>  There is simply no time to teach them this.  Although if a student comes up with a question I do not refuse, I always try to help. <br>  <b>Protection.</b>  Here, if a student knows how he considered everything, then he simply and dryly retells it, and answers standard questions.  If he didn‚Äôt count himself, he simply reads a speech written by someone before him and is silent when asking questions.  But after all, when he becomes an engineer, he will have to be able to substantiate his choice on his own, be able to defend his development, be able to submit the development in such a way that it is financed by his development.  (in my opinion, this should have been taught in philosophy, psychology, and sociology) and not what kind of philosophers wrote what kind of work, and what opinions who adhered to.  The main purpose of these subjects in a technical college is to teach a person to write speeches based on what kind of public will listen to them, and not only write them, but also be able to deliver them. <br>  <b>Laboratory</b> From year to year, laboratory tests are carried out according to the scheme, we read the training manual, we start the installation, we get the numbers, we consider, we pass.  In principle, there is nothing wrong with this scheme.  But This is an individual work, and they will often get tired of working in the collective.  Moreover, this work will often be in the nature of a dispute.  And here it is very difficult to come up with and set the task, on an already existing stand, so that discussion necessarily arises. <br>  <b>Practical</b> training.  It would seem easier here.  He set the topic, the student went to the library, picked up a journal, reviewed, came home, analyzed, realized that the material was not complete, returned to the library, found several more articles on interesting topics, reviewed them, analyzed more information and made his conclusions and reported back.  Oh yeah dreams dreams.  What really?  The student opens the browser gives a request to Yandex.  But he stubbornly silent.  Gives a request to Google.  Also there are no explanatory links.  And then you have to find out that there is a library, the student goes there, finds an article with a suitable title, comes in a couple and starts reading it, and often for the first time.  Total.  There is no sense for the student or for the audience listening to him.  The question, and who taught you to do so.  The answer is simple and ingenious.  And all the previous teachers of this were pleased.  They had enough of this.  And it was not necessary to imaging anything that you covered here with some incomprehensible reviewing and analyzing.  As a result, 2-3 lessons are killed, at least to explain why he should do it exactly as you said, and not as otherwise. <br>  For each problem, you can write a post.  But I tried to fit everything in one.  If it is interesting, I can dwell on something in more detail. <br>  And if you have encountered similar problems and found ways to solve them, share your experience.

      And the main problem with which I have so far that I face all the time, is the interest of the student.  Our students go to study at a university, not in order to gain knowledge, but because either the parents have sent or to get a higher education. <br>  For example, in the group I supervise, the question is that students who do not want to study and simply agree with the majority of teachers.  Why did you go to study on this specialty answer And it is the most prestigious.  And he doesn‚Äôt care what and why.  He is here because it's cool.  No turbines are needed. <br><br>  PS <br>  Post the first so that a big request to express opinions not only on the content, but also on the design, style, and so on.  Any constructive criticism is welcome. <br>  The pps at school was really bad with the Russian language, so many thanks to the modern spell-checking systems, it‚Äôs a pity that with punctuation, everything is not as smooth as yet.  So at once I apologize for the errors. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79368/</a></p>
