And since the ways of its achievement are not defined, they strive - ‚Äú <em>anyhow</em> ‚Äù.  Confused and jerky, jerky.  Very often from the outside it reminds an Olympic swim like a dog: noise, splashes, a lot of wasted energy, and ridiculous results.  The most important thing is that the popularity of " <em>in general</em> " is difficult to assess and measure.  Well, except that national love.  With autographs, salutes, obvious panties of fans and alleged sulfuric acid of ill-wishers ... <br><br>  But the blogger has all the necessary thermometer beakers in stock.  A lot of views - it means yeah, <strong>come</strong> .  Long sessions mean <strong>reading</strong> .  There are comments - it means <strong>they understand</strong> what <strong>they</strong> read (at least they <em>try</em> ).  And if the number of feedburning subscribers grows, it means that they read, <em>like</em> , <strong>wait for more</strong> .

      With this, everything is clear.  And with the ways of achievement - again, a snag.  Overseas <em>paulins</em> , <em>goddesses</em> , <em>katzy</em> and other zoo-gurus, <br>  told how to write headings, how and what to number, where to insert pictures.  And yet, inconspicuously, as if between the lines, they added: ‚Äúwrite in an original and interesting way‚Äù.  And the student blogger grabbed the pencil to trace the secret of originality.  But as usual in all Buddhism, the ‚Äú <em>gurus</em> ‚Äù dissolved into the air at the same moment, giving the desired and terrible freedom of action. <br><br>  Here everyone hit his (without links, as the images are collective): <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One - successfully copy-paste.  I emphasize - well!  This is not about the losers, dragging pictures of "Mokoloko" or "chips."  I came up to the matter more seriously, and you have a serious review resource.  After all, there are no complaints about the design collector, and to the pieces, and the same bugs?  Successfully found bins - the key to success, sometimes loud, and very much so. <br><br>  Another - pours out the " <em>philosophy of life</em> ."  And not such that it scares with the presence of ‚Äú-isms‚Äù, but more simply, ‚Äú <em>boy-top</em> ‚Äù.  Relevant mate, prosperous life experience, and again - please come to the ladies (or "in the folder" to " <em>kids</em> " do not offend). <br><br>  The third - manages to deftly write about anything (she is journalism, who did not know), while spitting towards those who write well about absolutely nothing.  A few tricks (‚Äú <em>come in, close soon</em> ‚Äù), a bit of Hitler's ‚Äú <em>crowd-woman</em> ‚Äù ... Goes with a bang. <br><br>  And after all, there is a solution for those who, it would seem, have a completely different train.  There is.  I myself did not think, I did not guess, until I ran into it. <br><br>  So, I was ordered design and development of an unusual blog widget.  Its essence is quite simple: the owner, or rather, the owner thereof, is going to show the world nudity for the interest in his blog.  Interest will be measured by subscribers to aresEC, of ‚Äã‚Äãwhom (still anonymous) blogger (blogger?) Wants to have five hundred (500). <br>  Each voice reveals a little complete picture.  I, as the one who saw the picture of duty, to be honest, the show is worthy of gourmets.  And this is not an advertisement at all - I do not give references, I will not give it when the widget is ready and shines on its sidebar.  I think it will come to you without my help. <br><br>  (Screenshots of the widget (still in work) - <a href="http://www.design-freak.com/2007/10/13/tema-sisek/">in my blog</a> .) <br><br>  And a little about sad things.  Not everything about boobs, right?  I read the blog of this mysterious acquaintance and I will (as the person is already feedburn-not-interested).  Interesting and hard writing.  And even lytdybr, fringed hanging on IT and related topics, does not interfere.  But all this stuff.  Because the content is nothing, and you can buy thirst for yourself, for seo-shmeo, money, boobs, you never know ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15009/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15009/</a></p>
