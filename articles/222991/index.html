The company employs 90 people.  At the moment, attracted about $ 40 million investment.  It has two full production in the Netherlands and in New York.  The number of products ordered has exceeded one <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/general-science-brief/64170-shapeways-hits-one-million-3d-printed-creations">million</a> . <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJuTM0Y7U1k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgIUKstu0BtxDMLmmK5WvrYtaYRDg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  <b>Konstantin:</b> ‚ÄúThe world leader and leader in the US market, the company Shapeways.  She successfully located her head office in Queens, NY, becoming Mecca among the creative people.  For a fairly decent history of its existence, Shapeways gathered a huge community of designers, at the end of 2013 - 300,000 people.  Of course, the number of active and prolific designers is much smaller, but the total number and products on the marketplace cannot fail to impress. <br><br>  With each of the active designers, managers of the Shapeways community (they are commonly called community managers, which is rather rare in Russia), work a lot, communicate, help solve any issues: high-quality photography of products, placement on the marketplace, and fixing 3d models.  In general, the community is the heart of Shapeways. <br><br>  The huge knowledge base collected from them on the forum and in the sections of the tutorials on the site allows you to find the answer to almost any question that arises when working with 3d models for printing.  A storehouse of knowledge. <br><br>  A part of immigrants from Shapeways (former community managers, production managers) are already creating their own separate businesses in the field of 3d printing.  Shapeways encourages and develops an entrepreneurial culture. <br><br>  However, competitors are very, very dislike Shapeways for dumping the market.  So it is, their prices for 3d-printing from a variety of different materials are almost always lower than competitors from Europe.  Can afford, with so many investments attracted) <br><br>  Shapeways have created and developed an excellent powerful API for developers of various online customizers of 3d models, which can also be made through them.  As a result, in addition to the marketplace, they work as a production and API, which is very convenient. <br><br>  They have completely stopped shipping to Russia since last year, citing problems at customs.  By the way, I must say that the experience of ordering 3d printing from them in NY is also not perfect: they threw off the delivery time of the samples, I had to write in support, but the issue was quickly resolved. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Some videos and articles in English for more in-depth review.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV38DXv7RW0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhsWcMeuoExDfnZZIwuCJh3Bn-1iA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Video about the company.

A small team, its small production (industrial 3d-printers) in Paris. <br><br>  Like many other players in the market, part of their production capacity is outsourced.  This is quite logical, as to keep under control a huge production, including from metals, ceramics, etc.  - pretty false story. <br><br>  Quite often you can meet them at exhibitions.  The last time, talking with them at 3DPrintShow in London and Inside3DPrinting in New York, the guys shared their opinions about the market development rates in Europe and the USA and a little more about competition in Europe, where Shapeways is also actively going. <br><br>  The main focus of Sculpteo's development is applications, their own online software for calculating, correcting and even preparing 3D models for printing.  This is very impressive, none of the competitors do this.  For comparison, Shapeways uses its software only half, the second part - software companies Netfabb. <br><br>  Sculpteo is great for those who are already in many ways professionally able to work with 3d-models and use 3d-printing for prototyping. <br><br>  The team also develops its API.

With such a plaster, the fracture can be transferred a little easier. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h4>  What awaits us in the future </h4><br>  <b>Me</b> : Konstantin, collecting materials for this post, I came across some skeptical remarks by highly respected people (for example, Epson director) about the future of 3d printing, and you, in turn, have been actively developing this industry in Russia for a year now, you are training seminars, developing a community, holding contests for designers, planning to launch an API for your project, what is the basis for your confidence in what it is worth doing? <br>  <b>Konstantin:</b> Glad you asked.  Let's clarify exactly what the Epson head said.  Something like this: ‚ÄúHome plastic 3D printing has no big future.  We will only make commercial 3d printers. ‚Äù  He talks about creating an industrial design printer.  Epson itself is going to develop industrial printers.  And I completely agree with them. <br><br>  My opinion is that it is industrial 3d-printing technologies that we use that can really bring 3d printing to a new consumer level.  Here it is necessary to immediately say that the head of Epson speaks about home printing, but only implies FDM technology (melting of plastic thread), as the most popular technology of home 3d printing.  At the same time, we should not forget that after the end of the patent for the SLA technology ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">stereolithography</a> ), for example, the Formlabs 1 ‚Äúhome‚Äù printer appeared quite to itself, which gives a very acceptable quality.  Yes, of course, it can not be compared with industrial. <br><br>  I'm talking about the fact that rather there is no future not for home 3d-printing, but for FDM-technology.  She will become obsolete.  It is suitable for too narrow application and the quality is very, very low. <br><br>  I am sure that what we are doing now will create (and is already creating it abroad) a new market and new opportunities for consumers and designers, speed up the solution of many tasks and, of course, will become more accessible.  Confidence is fully confirmed by the facts, the results of communication with colleagues from abroad and in Russia and, of course, numbers that are constantly growing. <br><br>  <b>I:</b> Konstantin, after talking with the CEO of world leading companies and ‚Äúhaving been in the future for a while‚Äù, share what the world is waiting for in the coming years? <br>  <b>Konstantin:</b> In the very near future, I can say with full confidence that we are waiting for the following: <br>  - the widespread integration of the "print on 3d-printer" button into all imaginable and inconceivable applications, programs, games, and so on.  We will print both in 3d-printing services and among enthusiasts on home 3d-printers. <br><br>  - the end of patents for the main industrial technologies of 3d printing (SLA (already), SLS, 3DP, DMLS) will lead to a more serious development of smaller and less expensive printers, respectively, the growth of industrial technologies and quality will also increase greatly <br><br>  - Google, which is actively introducing <a href="http://blog.3dprintus.ru/google-prezentuet-planshet-s-3d-skanerom/">3d-scanners</a> into its phones, will also contribute to the growth of the market, since many people will have the most important thing for the market - a model for printing.  And to create it you only need a phone. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/g_9ZMi8R8lo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUYEamB5ZhGTm0z0JymFHsFIk72A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  - Finally, the alliance of 3D Systems and Google in the Ara project will give a significant leap in the development of 3d printing speed and we will probably see how with the help of 3d printing a whole conveyor of custom goods production will be made.
