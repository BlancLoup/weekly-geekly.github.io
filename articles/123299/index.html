  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Playing torrents in your browser with Magic Player</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b><a href="http://magicplayer.torrentstream.org/">Torrent Stream Magic Player</a></b> is a completely new add-on that allows users to play streams of video and music, through torrents, directly in their browser.  Magic Player works with Chrome, Firefox, Opera and supports many popular sites, including The Pirate Bay, isoHunt, BTjunkie and EZTV (rutracker, etc.).  This is one of the first solutions for creating true on-demand video directly in the browser, using the BitTorrent protocol. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While millions of people still use BitTorrent every day to download videos, streaming online video sites are becoming increasingly dominant for online entertainment.  Almost every video file accessible via BitTorrent can be already found somewhere on the online video sites, as it is paid and completely free. <br><br>  Although BitTorrent was one of the first technologies to make it very easy to download very large video files, it must now catch up a bit.  Many people want the video and music to be on demand, and if BitTorrent wants to remain a major player, then today it should be able to do it. <br><br>  To this end, in recent years, many torrent clients have begun to add streaming playback to their functionality, and there are also several Internet services that offer similar features.  Torrent Stream Magic Player is a new streaming service that compares favorably with others by offering true video on demand (VoD) through a browser extension.

      <a href="http://magicplayer.torrentstream.org/index.php%3Flang%3Dru">This is a free add-</a> on developed by a team of Russian (generally - Ukrainian) developers, to be installed on Windows (Mac and Linux versions will be this autumn), adds the option ‚ÄúPlay torrent online‚Äù to the browser context menu.  As soon as the add-on and the plugin are installed, the user will have to right-click on the link leading to the torrent file (.torrent) and this unusual player will immediately appear. <br>  On most trackers, on the pages with releases, there is already a ‚ÄúMagic player‚Äù button, which is designed to launch the player, without using the context menu.  The list of trackers, where there is such a button is presented on the site of this add-on and on the pages of its installation.  The list of such sites will be constantly replenished, without updating the extension! .. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ae/d03/e69/5aed03e69beca5162148327ffc9adef8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If the user has a good network bandwidth, then with the right torrent file selected, the video and audio track starts playing in just a few seconds.  Additional controls also give the user the ability to manage the playlist and any other actions, with the ability to pause the stream from the torrent file when necessary. <br><br>  The add-on is in an early stage of development and the developer told TorrentFreak that many new features will be added soon.  In addition to the obvious fixes, users will also have the opportunity to choose a style for the player.  The team is also working on reducing the pre-buffering time to ensure an even faster start of playback. <br><br>  There is another upcoming opportunity, the function of which will be a bit controversial.  Developers are working on an update that will allow users to get the ability to play video and music on portals that do not offer their own content.  This ‚Äúmagic button‚Äù will appear when users browse sites such as IMDb, (kinopoisk), and it allows you to directly start streaming content based on the content of the page on which the user is located. <br><br>  We tried the add-on and can confirm that it works as promised.  Although the addition can be improved with respect to some small items, it doesn‚Äôt have that clumsiness, like any other browser-based streaming solution, via torrents.  It works well, both with video and with music, it is definitely worth trying. <br><br>  Interested readers should know that in addition to streaming, the data is also stored on the local computer and must be deleted by itself ...
