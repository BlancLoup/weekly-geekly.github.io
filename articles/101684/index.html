  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hulu VS Zipping: Who will have the last word?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.hulu.com/">Hulu</a> is a popular video hosting service where foreign viewers can watch their favorite television shows online for a small fee;  currently comes as a subscription for Samsung TVs and players, as well as for users of iPhones and iPads (at the end of the year they promise on SP3), an analogue of our <a href="http://turbofilm.tv/">Turbofilm</a> .  The service is certainly not universal, but it is definitely a step forward for the entire television industry. <br><br>  Zipping - once this word defined the scrolling in the accelerated mode of video cassettes, then - the scrolling of advertising on the same cassettes, and in the present century - the cyclical switching of a large number of channels on TVs.  In the yellow press, this phenomenon has already been baptized as a disease, while you and I, of course, understand that this is a banal non-optimized process of viewing and selecting channels. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So how to be?  The answer, like all ingenious, is simple - you need to create a company that will provide some kind of solution to help you navigate the variety of TV channels on the TV.

      And abroad, this dream of any housewife is already realized.  So, in the USA there is a certain company Rovi Corporation, which is engaged in this particular task.  The TV Guide button on the TV remote can invoke a kind of help menu, which, judging by the results of research, the average American spends about 10 minutes a day. <br><br>  In fact, this is of course an analogue of our paper programs with you.  But personally, at home, my television program has long served only as an auxiliary tool for targeting about 50 television channels, since it is almost impossible to find a newspaper that takes into account all the interests of the family at the same time, and buying publications that are completely dedicated to television broadcasting seems to me an unjustified step, if only because that at hand is almost always the Internet. <br><br>  Some of you will say: ‚ÄúHa, 50 channels!  You're a bourgeoisie! ‚ÄùBut no.  For example, BSkyB, the British satellite television company, offers 505 (!) Channels, not including radio stations and paid subscriptions.  Ponder this figure.  And this is not our television, it‚Äôs really possible to try to find something interesting for absolutely every taste. <br><br>  But problems exist here.  Companies that provide TV guides are gradually beginning to struggle not for a user audience, who has not known anything about them recently, but for the purity and clarity of their products.  In many guides over time it becomes difficult to navigate, as the number of menus and submenus is gradually increasing.  Search results are often long alphabetical lists that become difficult to browse.  All this takes a lot of time and distracts from what any user wants - after 8 hours at work, sit in your favorite chair and watch your favorite TV shows instead of ‚Äúplaying prefix‚Äù. <br><br>  Also, if you follow the news in the television industry, you may have noticed that many TV models have been able to access the Internet for a relatively long time, not to mention all kinds of set-top boxes for home DVD players and so on.  And this is where Hulu, well, or any other similar service can come to our aid.  After all, in it, for a small fee, you can no longer use various TV guides, designed primarily to help you choose the right time to watch TV, but to choose the TV show you are interested in, even if it came out of rotation ten years ago.  And this is a certain breakthrough in this area, because before this opportunity was available only to Internet users, and was associated with certain difficulties. <br><br>  In addition to the above, one should not forget about the possibility to watch a TV program from the screen of many TV models already, due to the possibility to view ordinary Internet.  Personally, the service <a href="http://tv.yandex.ru/">tv.yandex.ru</a> seems to me the most convenient in this regard.  What can we say about the ability to search for content through Google, or on youtube?  Imagine that your TV can practically become the media center in the house already now, and without all these downloads, individual locations (computer desk - who has not encountered the problem of choosing a place for it?), And other inconveniences that grow directly from the definition of a computer . <br><br>  Another new word is the connection of users through services similar to facebook.  With their help, it will be possible to recommend this or that series or TV show to one of their online friends.  You agree that if we may not be interested in this opportunity, it may be quite interesting for the mass consumer to discuss this or that episode of Doctor House, for example, directly on the wall of his profile on this or that social network. <br><br>  To summarize, I want to say this.  The Internet has definitely brought disunity to the television industry, and has also broken a lot of business structures tied to this business.  It cannot be said that it was ‚Äúmurder‚Äù, as it is fashionable to say now, but the foundations built up over the decades have definitely shaken.  However, three things can be said with certainty: firstly, almost certainly in the future, television sets will not disappear, secondly, the number of channels, and with it the importance of TV guides, will definitely increase, and thirdly, the population of planet Earth will conduct in front of the TV screen more and more time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101684/</a></p>
