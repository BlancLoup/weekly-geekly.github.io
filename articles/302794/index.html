Amateur are attacking from one front, who somehow managed to get a large-scale project despite the fact that they read out ‚ÄúProgramming for Dummies‚Äù just last night.  Then come the professional amateurs who succeeded after their first contract (read: they got the money, which they didn‚Äôt sue afterwards - despite the fact that they had developed a useless product).  And after this, they made themselves a career, simply repeating this ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù again and again.  Finally, there are those who complicate things.  The worst thing is that the best of us (at least for one or two projects) often adjoin them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For those who like to complicate things, something like the sixth sense appears, which helps them to find a meta-problem.  Essentially, they can find a meta-problem in everything.  We all have seen these barely working applications, which are created thanks to the efforts of these people and more likely resemble the Russian doll, where a succession of problems and their solutions follow one another.  I have always been interested in how these people behave outside of information technology.  Fortunately, Mike gave me the opportunity.

      In the corporate intranet, Mike manages a forum where software developers can ask for advice or share ideas with other developers within the company.  Recently, one of the software architects from their east coast office wrote the following: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>[off topic] <b>bike upgrade</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>While I was driving to work on a bicycle, the thought came to me - why would nobody invent a bicycle with heated handlebars?</i>  <i>We in New England sometimes get so cold in the morning that our fingers ache.</i>  <i>Has anyone seen, heard about something like that?</i> </blockquote><br>  The first answer was from another programmer from Mike‚Äôs department who, as it turned out, was responsible for one of the most ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù components of the application. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>I found nothing in Google, but I think this is just a fantastic idea.</i>  <i>Let's do this!</i>  <i>I already have an approximate scheme in my head: connect the current generator to the pedals, run several wires through the frame and add a steel mesh to the handlebars.</i> </blockquote><br>  The ice has broken!  Several programmers from different departments joined the discussion with their suggestions, starting with the need for a spare battery and ending with the need for an additional generator on the front wheel, which will only be used during descent.  After lunch, the discussion was ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>It's just amazing: we can use body temperature more efficiently!</i>  <i>In this case, our system can also be used during walking and running.</i> <br><br>  <i>We just need to use a thin inner jacket (like a storm jacket) and run a few flexible tubes from the edge of the sleeve to the diaphragm (which never seems to cool).</i>  <i>On these tubes, the water, heated by the diaphragm, will be delivered to the palms.</i> <br><br>  <i>Water will circulate through special valves and movements caused by walking or pedaling.</i>  <i>If necessary, we can add a battery / heater for additional water heating.</i>  <i>Of course, it will only work for cyclists.</i> </blockquote><br>  Fortunately, Mike‚Äôs company has at least one sane developer.  He joined the discussion anonymously: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>This is one of the most idiotic discussions I've ever read ... hmm ... since last week, when you were discussing the architecture for the UND component.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>A hand warmer does not exist, because most people have found a pair of gloves ideal for keeping hands cool.</i> </blockquote><br>  Unfortunately for us, this answer quickly concluded the discussion on the ‚Äúhand warmer‚Äù.  But I will leave you a little advice.  The next time you develop software, run away from those who complicate things.  Look strictly, very strictly, on your first version.  And then just say to yourself: "gloves." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302794/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302794/</a></p>
