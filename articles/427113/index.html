    <h2>  5G Network Problem </h2><br>  5G technology uses high frequencies - 28 GHz and higher - so the signal is poorly transmitted over long distances.  Plus the spread of its strongly interfere with the walls of houses.  In a city, this can lead to a decrease in the quality of the connection. <br><br>  Experts <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-5g/">say</a> that this will become an obstacle to the work of a large number of IoT devices, the active growth of which is <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/5g-iot-expert-intelligence/">predicted</a> from 2020 (just when full 5G networks will be deployed). <br><br>  Connected devices, such as cars or wearable medical gadgets, must exchange real-time data.  The instability of the connection may prevent them from adequately assessing the situation around them or transferring vital data (for example, about the state of human health) to the servers of the service organization.  Companies plan to solve this problem by arranging special distributed antenna systems, however, difficulties arise with this. <br><br>  For example, now in New York more than a thousand base stations are installed.  To cover the entire city with a 5G network, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2017/07/21/725072-5g-setei">you will need to install another half a million</a> .  The cost of the project will be much higher than in the case of the previous "G-standards". <br><br><h2>  How to solve these problems Versal </h2><br>  The Xilinx device will help solve problems with the stability of the Internet connection using AI systems, to work with which it is ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù.  The Versal chip will handle machine learning algorithms in 5G networks that optimize <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">the</a> mobile antenna patterns.  This will avoid blind sectors and select the appropriate data broadcast mode. <br><br>  Also, AI systems will improve <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">handover</a> algorithms that are responsible for transferring sessions from one station to another.  Networks will also self-repair and adapt, automatically redirecting data if any node fails.  So, 5G users will be able to freely move around the building or city without connection failures. <br><br>  Xilinx already has customers for 5G AI-chips.  Versal processors will be used for networking at the Olympics 2020. <br><br><h2>  Chip architecture features </h2><br>  The concept of Versal company Xilinx introduced in October.  The new microcircuit is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">heterogeneous</a> , that is, it uses several computational blocks at once.  These units can be processors, co-processors, integrated circuits ASIC and FPGA. <br><br>  The new Xilinx chip is based on an improved version of the FPGA - Adaptive Computer Accelerator Platform (ACAP) architecture.  It consists of four basic components: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">scalar</a> engine, adaptive engine, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">vector</a> accelerators (‚Äúsmart‚Äù engine), and a network on a chip (NoC - Network-on-Chip) for connecting system elements. <br><br>  The scalar engine is represented by dual-core processors ARM Cortex-A72 and Cortex-R5.  Programmable logic is based on configurable <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">logic elements</a> with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">lookup tables</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">triggers</a> , memory, and special blocks for connecting components.  All this allows you to build a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">hierarchy of memory</a> , sharpened for a specific computing task. <br><br>  The ‚Äúsmart‚Äù engine is based on the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLIW">VLIW-architecture</a> , which is needed for parallel execution of several operations in one instruction.  The <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD</a> calculation principle is also applied.  Such a structure helps to solve MO problems and process signals 5‚Äì10 times faster than classical systems.  As for NoC, its declared throughput is 1 Tbit / s. <br><br>  The scheme of the ACAP architecture looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xo/zn/dm/xozndmmmeowd--ylr8ac2qlibt0.png"><br><br>  Versal chips will be produced in TSMC using the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581_%25D0%25B2_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B%25D1%2588%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">7-nm</a> process technology.  Other features of the architecture can be found in official PDF documents - <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp505-versal-acap.pdf">the ASAP architecture</a> <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds950-versal-overview.pdf">overview</a> and <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/data_sheets/ds950-versal-overview.pdf">the Versal chip overview</a> . <br><br>  The system is programmed in C, C ++ and Python.  According to the developers, they chose these PLs, since according <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">to TIOBE</a> , C, C ++ and Python are the most popular after Java. <br><br>  In addition, these languages ‚Äã‚Äãcomplement each other.  C and C ++ are compiled, which means that the code can be run on bare metal (in particular, on FPGA).  Python is better <a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/poll-tools-analytics-data-science-machine-learning-results.html">suited</a> for data analysis and work with AI systems.  Other reasons for choosing Xilinx are given in a separate study on the topic ( <a href="https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/white_papers/wp502-python.pdf">PDF</a> ). <br><br><h2>  Similar solutions </h2><br>  FPGA-based chips are being developed by other companies, such as Intel.  From the latest products of the company can be distinguished <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/05/24/a-peek-inside-that-intel-xeon-fpga-hybrid-chip/">hybrid device Arria</a> .  The development is a platform of two chips: Xeon E5-2600 v4 and <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/programmable/fpga/arria-10.html">Altera Arria 10</a> . <br><br>  According to representatives of Intel, the device is suitable for servers, data centers and cloud services, where the load often increases abruptly.  The processor on the FPGA will help to process data in parallel, which will increase the overall performance of the system.  Fujitsu, for example, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/05/24/a-peek-inside-that-intel-xeon-fpga-hybrid-chip/">plans</a> to supply this chip with its Primergy line of servers by the end of the year. <br><br>  Other market players - AMD, ARM, Qualcomm, Samsung and others - in 2012 created the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.hsafoundation.com/">HSA Foundation</a> .  They promote heterogeneous computing: they develop industry standards, help developers enter the market and sponsor educational programs. <br><br>  Xilinx <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/29/system-and-chip-architecture-shifts-to-a-heterogeneous-world/">believes</a> that with the development of AI systems and the spread of 5G networks, the demand for FPGA platforms will increase.  Xilinx CEO Victor Peng (Victor Peng) <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/29/system-and-chip-architecture-shifts-to-a-heterogeneous-world/">notes</a> that the only obstacle to mass production of chips is competition from the CPU and GPU, which does not allow FPGA solutions to ‚Äúcapture‚Äù the market.  But, probably, a surge in demand (if it does happen) should not be expected <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/359352/">before 2020</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS Additional materials from the corporate blog VAS Experts:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/bezopasnost/ddos-i-5g-tolshhe-truba-bolshe-problem/">DDOS and 5G: thicker "pipe" - more problems</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/telekom/internet-v-derevnyu-stroim-radiorelejnuyu-wi-fi-set/">Internet to the village - we build radio-relay Wi-Fi-network</a> </li></ul><br>  PPS A couple of fresh articles from our blog on Habr√©: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/426263/">Wi-Fi 6 announced: what you need to know about the new standard</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vasexperts/blog/425135/">VoIP recognized information service in the United States - the implications for the telecom industry</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427113/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427113/</a></p>
