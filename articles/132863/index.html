With proper skill and desire, a regular board can save a lot of time and significantly improve the result of the team‚Äôs work - a fast and efficient way of communication has always been very critical and directly influenced the result of collective efforts. <br><br>  But is it possible to make the instrument more pleasant?  Add zest? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/18435e22/c900b4ed/2f83307c/424e6bf9.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The author has repeatedly had the opportunity to see how quickly people understand the ideas supported by a certain number of illustrative illustrations.  Curiously, even experienced developers do not always easily perceive information by ear.  It is likely that information flow is overloaded and experience gained in not very quiet rooms.  A pair of "squares", usually, perfectly helps to focus and tune in the desired fashion.  No wonder, by the way, because for many years, starting from the first grade of high school, blackboard is an obligatory part of the cognitive process. <br><br>  Moreover, the board (being, in fact, a large sheet of paper) is a primitive, but very effective "intelligence booster" ( <a href="http://lib.ru/LEM/summa/summgl4e.htm">Stanislav Lem, "The Sum of Technology"</a> ).  The author sincerely hopes the reader is deprived of acquired hatred of rectangular shapes and understands their usefulness. <br><br>  So, the market is replete with a variety of marker boards, but some people (to whom the author identifies himself) are actively looking for alternatives.  Admittedly, the initial motivating factor is the cost of the factory board. <br><br>  We formulate the basic requirements: <br><ul><li>  Adequate cost </li><li>  Durability </li><li>  The ability to create detailed schemes </li><li>  Contrast </li><li>  Not markost </li><li>  Subjective pleasure to use </li><li>  Original view (optional) </li></ul><br>  Many use the board to create extremely coarse and primitive schemes, but sometimes, if the project under discussion is complicated and it is intended to discuss it further, it is more efficient to accurately indicate the necessary details or leave room for them. <br><br>  It is for long-lived illustrations that the ability of the board to retain the pattern is important.  If something can be erased - it will be erased, soiling clothes and invalidating the illustration.  Agree, it is unpleasant to lose modules, subsystems or objects and find them on your clothes. <br><br>  The durability of the board is very important, since standard boards with fairly intensive use come to some disrepair quickly.  Formally, they are still new, but it really becomes not very pleasant to work with them. <br><br><h4>  Whiteboard v1.0 </h4><br>  This project was created for the house and pursued only one goal - to provide an easy way to visually store ideas, plans, intermediate results, etc.  The simplest method of implementation was chosen - a glass surface with a custom-made frame. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1d6e8f6b/34ac0e26/a4e3c742/a1236963.jpg"><br><br>  On the glass, by the way, it is very pleasant to draw, but this requires special markers (for example, on a spirit basis).  This approach has one huge plus - five minutes after the creation of the next ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù of technological, architectural, or any other thought, it‚Äôs somewhat difficult to erase this ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù. <br><br>  The minus, by the way, is again in this feature.  When the ‚Äúmasterpiece‚Äù needs to be removed - you need to use special tools: <br><ul><li>  Mr. Muscle or analogues (colleagues will not be happy, the room requires airing) </li><li>  alcohol solution or vodka (colleagues will not understand you, the authorities will catch the entire team of alcohol abuse) </li><li>  cologne (colleagues ozvereut, the authorities will try to calculate the local "macho") </li><li>  special napkins (presumably, everyone will be satisfied, but not your wallet) </li></ul><br>  The home board was installed in 2005 and is still there today.  No deterioration in its qualities is noticed.  The attempt of unauthorized cleaning, which was aimed at destroying no doubt the author‚Äôs valuable work, did not succeed - only ephemeral dust was washed off the board. <br><br><h4>  Whiteboard v2.0 </h4><br>  A little later, the author found the courage to admit some irritating effects of white.  Having a noticeable size, the whiteboard becomes an additional distraction, since peripheral vision is perceived as a fairly bright area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe surrounding space. <br><br>  While still a student, the author met detailed plans and drawings made on an unusual blue background.  By the way, Legend Destroyers use just such paper for preliminary quick sketches of their <br>  future experiences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dbda484b/e5b62edd/9a57aa1b/b2a834a9.jpg"><br><br>  The curious reader probably already knows the term <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueprint">blueprint</a> , applicable, in fact, to any detailed plan.  The author decided that an appropriate tool is needed for architecture design ( <a href="http://www.google.com.ua/search%3Fq%3Darchitecture%2Bblueprinting">architecture blueprinting</a> ), which was created using the already known technology. <br><br>  It took only a few sheets of colored cardboard (the color, by the way, was chosen very carefully with the assistance of an attentive and very thoughtful designer, thanks <a href="http://leo-dikiy.livejournal.com/">Leo</a> ) and a standard glass frame to get the desired result. <br><br>  Manufacturing technology "magic boards": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/299983f6/eda6979c/2e8b95ba/ef17fc54.png"><br>  Collective effort cardboard was glued and placed under glass.  The result of a brief effort was a wonderful tool that automatically turns any scheme into an adult blueprint.  All attributes are in place, do not undermine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/11d55d60/fc0afa0b/d0e63570/21469ebf.jpg"><br><br>  A shop selling wonderful white markers for glass was found in the city.  I admit, the board was very pleasant to use, it was pleasing to the eye and caused very positive emotions. <br><br>  The selected background color provides excellent contrast and does not strain the eyes.  A small added bonus to the glass board is the ‚Äúhardware‚Äù shadow effect.  Since the background is behind the glass, and the picture is applied to the glass - you can observe the cast shadow, which, subjectively, makes the picture more pleasant and more contrast. <br><br>  To whom, give the developer the squares, well, the designer just frolics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2434aae2/ec36f228/dd269789/6707b388.jpg"><br><br>  Many markers were inscribed, many things were designed, the board saw heated debates and discussions, surprised visitors and even a puzzled cleaning lady.  In a word - the tool came very out of place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7225604e/c0504498/c72dd454/175d7104.jpg"><br><br>  Intensive use of the board did not leave any traces.  A separate find was the glued frame, which allowed much more careless use of liquid detergents. <br><br>  Another problem is the glare, characteristic, by the way, and the usual marker boards.  Accordingly, the choice of location is not less important task. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/00f30860/cda2abc5/eb76177c/77b9c7cb.jpg"><br>  The events described took place at the end of 2006.  By the way, using this approach is easy to get: <br><ul><li>  corporate board </li><li>  board with the background of your favorite color </li><li>  forest or sky plank </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br>  Simply select the desired color: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c4859ec9/e215f96d/cfcf46d3/495e68d7.jpg"><br><br>  A rebranding or the arrival of a new ‚Äúpower‚Äù such a board will survive easily and naturally. <br><br><h4>  Whiteboard v3.0 </h4><br>  The author sometimes thinks of a third, even more pleasant and convenient, version of the whiteboard.  What will it be?  Fully transparent, mobile, with integrated lighting, with integrated hood?  Who knows, wait and see. <br><br>  Useful links: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/102956/">Low cost marker board</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/131730/">Whiteboard DIY</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/87021/">Low cost marker writing board</a> </li></ul><br>  Useful tips: <br><ul><li>  Tip number 1: if you want to check the approach, but are not ready to waste time - find the marker and the nearest window </li><li>  Tip number 2: pay attention to the <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/spot/colors1.html">psychology of color</a> (below in the comments you will find a small prank) </li><li>  Tip # 3: Before you use Tip # 1, find a detergent. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132863/</a></p>
