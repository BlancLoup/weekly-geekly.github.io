      2013 was significant for open-source - it experienced many ups and very few falls.  However, I believe that for Linux, which received a solid foundation in 2013, this year will be even better. <br><br>  Many of you may already be rubbing your hands, waiting for the next prediction about the universal dominance of Linux from his adept.  But I actually had a lot of reasons for such a loud prediction.  Below I will describe 10 reasons why I believe that 2014 will be a landmark for open-source software in general and for Linux in particular: <br><br>  <b>1. Open-source will dominate the corporate segment.</b> <br>  The catalyst for this will be the continued distribution of the powerful Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.5 OS, but the prospects lie much further.  Since large corporations have high demands on the security and flexibility of their data, they will move to open-source (especially Linux) to satisfy them.  Large companies are also more demanding in terms of presenting and sharing their data, so open-source, in fact, remains the only option that they can choose. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2. Valve will force OEM developers to become open</b> <br>  Game developer Valve has joined the Linux Foundation.  There is one big plus in this - they will be pioneers in the way of attracting resources of OEM developers and their vendors to support Linux.  Owners of Nvidia and ATI will be the first to see the results of this, as Valve will convince these 2 companies to do everything they can to support open-source platforms and software. <br><br>  <b>3. Finally, Linux tablets will see the light.</b> <br>  We may not see these tablets on the mass market in 2014, but by the end of the year there will be at least Ubuntu images that can be put on tablets.  I believe that they will expand the Nexus product line, as well as spread to Samsung and Motorola devices.  After these images find their way to the "glands", other vendors, figuratively speaking, will go to the docks and begin to unload the ship with Linux-tablets. <br><br>  <b>4. GNOME 3 will again be relevant</b> <br>  GNOME 3 was a big disappointment in 2013.  I‚Äôm sure something - see what - fix this situation.  Perhaps this will be the addition of a more user-friendly lancher (for example, Unity Launcher), or the release of new GNOME Core Apps (Maps, Music, Calendar, Soft, Photo).  In any case, the GNOME 3 desktop environment will return to its former glory in 2014, while maintaining the modern interface. <br><br>  <b>5. KDE will receive significant updates.</b> <br>  KDE has gone into the shadows for a while.  However, it continues to evolve, improving what it has and creating a working environment in the good old-fashioned way with the start menu.  I believe that 2014 will force KDE developers to add chips that will bring users back to this shell.  I put on a significant revision of the KDE Tasks tasks, which will make them super-efficient for use in the work environment.  Perhaps the modular branch of KDE 5 Plasma 2 is also waiting for significant progress. <br><br>  <b>6. MariaDB will begin to actively invade MySQL</b> <br>  It is a pity that Oracle buries all open-source community to which it touches.  This is true for MySQL.  However, this is not a problem, since the replacement is already here.  In 2014, it looks like we will see a significant migration to MariaDB, even for database-related websites built on WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!  and xoops.  I really would like to see a massive migration, so that it forces Oracle to rethink how they manage open-source solutions. <br><br>  <b>7. Open-source will increase the number of smart devices.</b> <br>  The ability to produce home appliances and other machines ‚Äúsmart‚Äù (thanks to tablets and smartphones) will make Linux / open-source a driving force along the way.  Why?  Because Linux and open-source is almost the ideal solution for embedded systems. <br><br>  <b>8. Open-source will change the management of "clouds"</b> <br>  With tools such as OpenStack and OpenShift, the cloud will become even easier to manage the platform.  As large companies turn to cloud technologies, many of them will use open-source cloud solutions. <br><br>  <b>9. The share of Linux PCs will exceed 10% of the PC market</b> <br>  Although in 2013 Linux occupied only 5% of the desktop market <i>(actually <a href="http://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx%3Fqprid%3D8%26qpcustomd%3D0">about 2%</a> )</i> , I believe that in 2014 we will finally see a breakthrough in the field of PC with open-source on board.  Under such predictions there is soil.  First, more corporations will see the benefit of Linux on PC.  Secondly, XP leaves, remains without support.  Many companies will be forced to look for an alternative working system in order to avoid having to order new equipment.  Installing Linux for low-cost workstations is the perfect solution. <br><br>  <b>10. The share of sales of devices with pre-installed Linux will increase significantly.</b> <br>  I discovered the preinstalled Linux for the first time last year.  This fact exceeded my wildest expectations.  Dell, HP, Alienware and other companies add a preinstalled Linux system as possible to the ordering operating system, which means there will be more sales - and this will be transferred to other corporations that will go in trend and offer a PC with Linux. <br><br>  If you think 2013 was a good year for Linux and open-source, just wait a moment when I‚Äôll sum up 2014!  I am confident that this year will be the best year for open source.  I also hope that 2014 will be a successful year for you, your family, your business and your creativity. <br><br>  <b>And what predictions on open-source for 2014 do you have?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209546/</a></p>
