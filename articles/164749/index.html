  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu Phone - what should we expect?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Today I read the news about the release of Ubuntu Phone on Habr√©.  Made for myself a pleasant discovery.  After reading the information there were some thoughts about this, with which I decided to share with you. </h5><br><br>  The first thing, of course, got on the official website of the developer, and I saw absolutely this wonderful title, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ad/34f/d98/3ad34fd98caae83f39737d2960ee56c3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  which tells us about the "excellent transformation" (probably of an adult Ubunt in mobile). <br>  The smaller font says about the presentation of the product at CES on January 8-13. <br>  Not resisting the temptation, I clicked on the red button and went to the page with preliminary information about the mobile OS. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  What follows, perhaps I will not describe.  I think that those to whom this news was (or is) interesting, have already done the same.  Well, for those who are too lazy, I will describe the situation at a glance.  A nice page opens with all sorts of descriptions of both mobile and adult system. <br><br>  By the way, Ubuntu has long ago promised to make a mobile version of its operating system.  Moreover, the ‚Äúmobility‚Äù of the system was interpreted several times.

    <h5>  In every dual-core phone, PC a to get out. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b3/b9e/b91/2b3b9eb916cefba836e4a85ed4004b62.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It all started with the fact that Ubuntu said that she was preparing something that would allow to carry the full version of the OS in her pocket.  Like, if your Android smartphone, having a dual-core 1 GHz processor, 1 GB of RAM and a micro-usb port, connects to a TV or monitor, it will work as a desktop system.  Everyone really liked the idea.  There were a lot of discussions on this issue, however, the work is still underway, and in the course it will be ready only by 2014 and will appear only on the top gland. <br><br><h5>  Ubuntu now fits your phone </h5><br>  But what is shown on the website and in the commercials right now?  Nice interface (not like Android or ios), support from the manufacturer and a rich ecosystem for developers.  Also the minimum system requirements are already stated. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/29d/0e8/78e/29d0e878e27ec539e9209bb012c05f4c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  They grieve.  As can be seen, there will be two systems.  One pass, requiring not too large system resources.  The second is in principle real, but disappoints the minimum possible amount of internal memory.  32 GB is expensive, which means part of the audience in the span. <br><br><h5>  So what's waiting for Ubuntu Phone? </h5><br><br>  Of course, the system has its pros and cons.  Yes, the interface is very nice, but it is not clear how things are with usability and customization.  Yes, the developer will not be able to write applications, but will there be enough developers and will the system support Wine?  Still these two versions of the system. <br>  As a result, we have that the system is somewhat contradictory.  But even with all this, there is a prospect.  All the dots of CES.  Well, we are waiting. <br><br>  And finally, I want to say that you can write your application for Ubi, right now.  To do this, just follow the <a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164749/</a></p>
