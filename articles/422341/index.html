And, quite possibly, tomorrow is someone's future business.  Kettle, vacuum cleaner, glasses and who knows what else is becoming more interactive.  In the 21st century, we are accustomed to living easier and mentally prepared to forget about life.  Forward to a comfortable life, we will go along with IoT.  IoT (Internet of Things) is when ordinary physical objects are upgraded to smart ones that are able to manage and control through a certain noosphere (the Internet will do so far). <br><br>  Things and engineering systems are now able to collect data, share them through various services.  In the future, it is a whole system that includes not only data collection and storage, but also security, analytics and other tools.  Existing technologies are scattered and chaotic.  And refined in different ways.  In fact, the consumer has two options at his disposal: <br><br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúAffordable Zoo‚Äù: Massive, but isolated decisions, island rationality </li><li>  Spetsnaz is a very expensive integrated system (a limited number of players in the market). </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/mo/hf/mamohfvhogzad6stj9fykvrsgog.jpeg">

    <h2>  "Affordable Zoo" </h2><br>  "Island" (integrated pieces) rationality.  Convenient, inexpensive solution for end users. <br><br>  Its features are: <br><br><ol><li>  Each item or "island" is managed independently of the other; </li><li>  Connecting the control of different systems or things is usually not possible or only by a person well immersed in the nuances of this technical field. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Each manufacturer develops its software for gadgets, which does not intersect.  If you want to live in a new comfortable world - the screen of your phone can turn into a collection of icons for managing a bunch of objects: from a kettle and a microwave to a heated floor and a video surveillance system. <br><br>  It turns out the house, which has a number of independent "intelligence", which or can not interact with each other.  Or interact very, very limited.  Because of this, there are various errors, sometimes funny, in the management of the system at the joints. <br><br><h2>  "Special Forces" </h2><br>  The category conditionally called "SWAT" is represented by expensive integrated systems.  Previously were represented by several players in the market, their number has been steadily expanding in recent months.  A rather old concept: one smart brain that controls everything.  Expensive, not without its problems.  Each component is worth its weight in gold.  Everything should be from a single manufacturer, that is, it does not really scale: how I bought it, so you use it. <br><br>  Its features are: <br><br><ul><li>  fairly closed system; </li><li>  several standards; </li><li>  very high price tag. </li></ul><br>  Difficult to develop and not cheap to scale.  If you want to add something, then for debugging and relatively reliable work, a professional team of specialists certified on this particular brand is required.  To reach the Messenger and connect for two clicks - it is impossible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4d/wj/ez/4dwjezhyecdt0qnjvztupg8a2ey.jpeg" align="left" width="200"><br><h2>  Possible near future </h2><br>  You look at the item and want to control it from the gadget. <br><br>  For this, you register at the IoT center on a special platform and any item that is ‚Äúnot from the village‚Äù in your connection.  The IoT Center provides infusion to one base and ensures the interaction of the entire kulak economy. <br><br>  In the corporate segment, it is possible to connect the sensor system to any systems and equipment that will monitor and control various parameters in real time, displaying them as intuitive widgets.  A smart city or just smart pipes is a reality that is already being introduced. <br><br><h2>  And who is the consumer? </h2><br>  Consumers of the special forces solution are conservative innovators.  These are those who are willing to pay an average check of 1 million rubles.  Their social level is noticeably higher than the middle class, so that researchers would not talk about its presence in Russia.  At the same time, the product is not yet luxury in terms of its type of convenience and services provided. <br><br>  The limited audience, both in psycho and in the percentage of the population, is given by the market of single project implementations. <br><br>  If we talk about marketing psycho-types, then in the case of the decision ‚ÄúAccessible Zoo‚Äù, the Innovators are the first to enter the embrasure.  The solvency of which is concentrated in the pre-middle segment. <br><br>  And this market ... ends.  Because kamikazes with engineering thinking are over. <br><br>  A good product in the IoT area implies a massive and international market.  And then in the new paradigm behind the Innovators go - the early followers and only then - the mass consumer.  The mass future consumer of IoT is a generation of Instagram, which already makes sense to consider by price segments as well as in the cellular market: someone is simpler and a penny, someone has a super popular new model.  But in general, everyone can afford. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7p/5g/ky/7p5gkyjrlf0oq_bzhhfl-hygb4a.jpeg" width="250"></div><br><br><h2>  Sell ‚Äã‚ÄãIoT to your grandmother </h2><br>  How to sell something that ordinary people have not heard?  An explosive growth of the connected devices is expected on the market as soon as the main thresholds have been passed, blocking the mass acceptance by users.  At the moment, the topic is heard overwhelmingly among corporate audiences. <br><br>  Roughly, the statistics are as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  59.4% - managers </li><li>  28.2% - technical specialists </li><li>  12.4% are not final users. </li></ul><br>  They block not only ‚Äúthresholds‚Äù that have not been passed through in technology, but also in marketing: the market is at the stage of formation and perception by early followers.  But this picture will change dramatically: the number of end users expects explosive growth, their level of technological awareness will fall sharply. <br><br><h2>  Earnings on additional and cross-sales </h2><br>  What will be the earnings in the world of IoT?  As you know, printer manufacturers do not earn anything on the printers themselves, but earn on cartridges.  Similarly, the IoT market model is likely to be profitable due to additional and cross-selling. <br><br>  Possible options: <br><br>  - functions; <br>  - options; <br>  - management from a mobile phone; <br>  - service; <br>  - advertising; <br>  - consumer data. <br><br>  Many of the listed options require scale (the same advertisement or user data).  The scale is possible with the implementation of available services in any place "where there is a Russian Post."  Here the bottleneck is the lack of a simple local hub, which will work even if you have not paid for the external network.  The development of a hub as a separate device is already being undertaken in various forms, but so far there is no leading model or technology. <br>  The distribution channels of the end devices themselves are quite traditional.  At the same time, the price of the goods will not differ from the market average (for the mass buyer) in a similar non-IoT line.  Penetration of end devices is expected in a traditional market takeover model.  Drivers of consumption are already becoming: utilities, new transport systems and infrastructure engineering systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422341/</a></p>
