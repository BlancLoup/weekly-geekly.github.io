Today we would like to tell you about Tony Kasurinen, a true master artist who has been combining tradition with digital methods for 4 years in a row with a smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d01/5e0/d10/d015e0d10fd740779d602c38778cf90f.png"><br><br>  But not only his excellent paintings forced us to turn his attention to him among the many truly talented artists of the <a href="http://creativetone.deviantart.com/">deviantART</a> creative community.  Smartphones, with the help of which he creates his creations - Nokia N900 and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/mobile/phone/lumia635/specifications">Lumia 635</a> .  That is why we decided to dedicate our today's post to this illustrator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Finnish artist Tony Kasurinen graduated from the University of Applied Sciences and is already working on new drawings on his smartphone, and more recently he has just started to study painting and art:

      ‚ÄúI graduated from Lahti University of Applied Sciences with a bachelor's degree in media technology and the development of visualization in 2012.  Now I work as a 3D artist, but more recently I‚Äôve started to pay more and more attention to 2D painting and illustrations. <br><br>  The formation of man as an artist occurs gradually.  I have always been interested in painting, artists, various techniques and the media field, as well as graphics applications.  I try to test all the available painting and drawing programs to see what unique features they can offer. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15b/e54/074/15be540747424c1598367a22bb95a4d6.jpg"><br><br>  He started drawing on a smartphone in 2010 when he bought himself a Nokia N900: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn 2010, I bought a Nokia N900 smartphone and seriously became interested in digital painting.  I delved into the maemo.org forum and found the MyPaint graphic application for digital artists freely available. <br><br>  So my habit began to draw something every day, which only warmed up my interest and made me draw more and more.  Now I even began to draw with pencils on paper, which I had never seriously engaged in before. ‚Äù <br><br>  Since then, Tony draws every day, not letting go of his smartphone.  Moreover, according to Tony himself, a new round in his digital creativity came after the acquisition of Lumia 635. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/220/8e7/042/2208e704278b47fcb458345bcccf38b1.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúInstead of scanning sheets from an album with sketches, I just take pictures of them on my Lumia 635. After that I can adjust colors, saturation and contrast, as well as add some special effects.  Sometimes I also take a picture of the initial sketch with a pencil and save it.  If something goes completely wrong, I use this photo later, both digitally and in the usual way, ‚Äùsays the artist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7b/4ab/bef/a7b4abbef56f4c3f953dc5816e71ab94.jpg"><br><br>  Now, having two smartphones at once, the creative way of Tony Kasurinen from a blank screen to a printed canvas looks like this: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI usually first frame my work created in <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/mypaint">MyPaint</a> on the Nokia N900, for which I use <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/adobe-photoshop-express/2ba43182-ba12-42c0-b503-158284f48bf8">Adobe Photoshop Express</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68b/492/da1/68b492da199046bdbd73b261949e1ef1.jpg"><br><br>  Adobe Photoshop Express has a convenient ‚Äúleveling slider‚Äù, which facilitates the process of experimenting and finding interesting compositions. <br><br>  After cropping the picture and setting up the composition, I start experimenting with various editing applications on my Lumia 635. This process involves testing various options to get the mood I want to see.  Usually, I leave my works with the N900 and MyPaint somewhat flat and pale, because I know well that I‚Äôm going to achieve the desired look much faster already after the treatment after the fact. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/671/4ab/3ac/6714ab3ac1766bb982c425765501084d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among other programs that are included in the traditional set of Tony: <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/lumia-%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F/a8ddc8f6-c12c-44e6-b22e-52e2f0905f3e">Lumia Photography Studio</a> , <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/fantasia-painter-free/bfb9c8f3-1c4e-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Fantasia Painter Free</a> , <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/lomogram/3990bda9-ab8a-48e9-998d-44cc6a04a0ae">Lomogram +</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the MyPaint mentioned above, Microsoft's <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/fresh-paint/1926e0a0-5e41-48e1-ba68-be35f2266a03">Fresh Paint</a> application deserves attention, as it transferred all types of brushes and paints (oil, watercolor) to the digital environment in as much detail as possible.  The thorough work of Fresh Paint developers on artistic tools is manifested, for example, in a feature such as ‚Äúdrying‚Äù, which, as the name implies, mimics the effect of drying paintings painted with real paints. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54c/159/e4f/54c159e4f09d4fe79e4b07766d21c8df.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the fact that Fresh Paint is a ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù application (ie, designed for both WP 8.1 and Windows 8.1), users can start working on their own illustration on a home computer or tablet, and continue on to Lumia.  All templates are synced via OneDrive cloud storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/116/de8/4fd/116de84fd065417185a2c0ac0bf393b2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And we write in: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/MicrosoftLumia">Habrahabr</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/LumiaRussia">Twitter</a> |</b>  <b><a href="http://vk.com/MicrosoftLumia">VKontakte</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftLumiaRU">Facebook</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://plus.google.com/112598323683416588312">Google+</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363079/</a></p>
