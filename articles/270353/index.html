Getting started. <br><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br><br>  ● ES6 (also known as Harmony, es-next, ES2015) is the latest and final language specification. <br>  ● The final specification of ES6 was approved in June 2015 (therefore, ES2015). <br>  ● Future versions of the language will be named according to the ES [YYYY] pattern, for example ES2016 for ES7. <br>  o Annual release cycle, irreversible changes begin to take effect from the next release. <br>  o Since ES6 appeared earlier than this solution, most of us still call it ES6. <br>  o Starting with ES2016 (ES7), we must use the ES [YYYY] template to refer to newer versions. <br>  o The main reason for using this naming pattern is to put pressure on browser manufacturers to implement the latest updates as quickly as possible. <br><br>  <b>Tools</b> <br><br>  ● To use ES6 today, you need a JavaScript-to-JavaScript transpiler. <br>  ● Transporters came and will remain, because: <br>  o they provide the ability to compile the code of the new language version into the code of the old version; <br>  o we will transfer ES2016 and ES2017 to ES6, etc., when browser support gets better; <br>  o we need improved source mapping; <br>  o today it is the most reliable way to run ES6 code in production (despite the fact that browsers support ES5). <br>  ● Babel (transpiler) has a killer feature: human-readable output. <br>  ● Use <a href="http://babeljs.io/">babel</a> to transfer ES6 to ES5 for static builds. <br>  ● Use <a href="https://github.com/babel/babelify">babelify</a> to embed a babel into your <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/gulp-grunt-whatever">grunt, gulp or npm run</a> build process. <br>  ● Use nodejs version 4.xx or higher - there is a very decent support for ES6 (thanks to v8). <br>  ● Use babel-node with any version of node.js - it will transfer modules to ES5. <br>  ● Babel has an expanding ecosystem that already supports ES2016 and some plugins. <br>  ● Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/a-brief-history-of-es6-tooling">A Brief History of ES6 Tooling.</a> <br><br>  <b>Assignment Destructuring</b> <br><br>  ● var {foo} = pony is the same as var foo = pony.foo. <br>  ● var {foo: baz} = pony is the same as var baz = pony.foo <br>  ● You can set default values, var {foo = 'bar'} = baz will return foo: 'bar' if baz.foo is undefined. <br>  ● You can drag as many properties as you like, with or without pseudonyms: <br>  o var {foo, bar: baz} = {foo: 0, bar: 1} will give foo: 0 and baz: 1. <br>  ● You can go further: var {foo: {bar}} = {foo: {bar: 'baz'}} will give bar: 'baz'. <br>  ● You can also assign an alias to this: var {foo: {bar: deep}} = {foo: {bar: 'baz'}} will give you deep: 'baz'. <br>  ● Properties that were not found still return undefined var {foo} = {}. <br>  ● Nested properties that were not found return the error var {foo: {bar}} = {}. <br>  ● This also works for arrays, [a, b] = [0, 1] returns a: 0 and b: 1. <br>  ● You can skip elements in the array, [a ,, b] = [0, 1, 2], we obtain a: 0 and b: 2. <br>  ● Variables can be swapped without resorting to the third “aux” variable, [a, b] = [b, a]. <br>  ● You can also use destructuring in the function parameters: <br>  o assignment of default values ​​function foo (bar = 2) {}; <br>  o these values ​​can also be function foo objects (bar = {a: 1, b: 2}) {}; <br>  o it is possible to destructurize bar completely: function foo ({a = 1, b = 2}) {}; <br>  o if nothing was transmitted, by default we get an empty array: function foo ({a = 1, b = 2} = {}) {}. <br><br>  Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-destructuring-in-depth">ES6 JavaScript Destructuring in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Spread Operator and Rest Parameters</b> <br><br>  ● Rest parameters are like arguments, only better. <br>  o method signature is declared as function foo (... everything) {}; <br>  o everything is an array with all the parameters passed to foo; <br>  o You can give a name to several parameters before ... everything, for example: function foo (bar, ... rest) {}; <br>  o these parameters will be excluded from ... rest; <br>  o ... rest should be the last parameter in the list. <br>  ● Spread operator is even better than magic, it is also denoted using ... syntax: <br>  o cancels the need to apply when calling methods, fn (... [1, 2, 3]) is the same as fn (1, 2, 3); <br>  o simplified concatenation: [1, 2, ... [3, 4, 5], 6, 7]; <br>  o allows you to cast a mass-like elements or collections into arrays [... document.querySelectorAll ('img')]; <br>  o is also useful when <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">destructing</a> [a ,, ... rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] returns a: 1 and rest: [3, 4, 5]; <br>  o makes new + .apply simple, new Date (... [2015, 31, 8]). <br>  ● Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-spread-and-butter-in-depth">ES6 Spread and Butter in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Arrow functions</b> <br><br>  ● A concise way to declare the function param =&gt; returnValue. <br>  ● Useful for functional programming, [1, 2] .map (x =&gt; x * 2). <br>  ● There are several different uses (it will take some time to develop a habit): <br>  ○ p1 =&gt; expr is great if the parameter is one; <br>  ○ p1 =&gt; expr has an implicit return statement for the expr expression; <br>  ○ To implicitly return an object, you need to wrap it in parentheses () =&gt; ({foo: 'bar'}), otherwise you will get an error; <br>  ○ Parentheses are necessary when you have 0, 2 or more parameters () =&gt; expr or (p1, p2) =&gt; expr; <br>  ○ The curly brackets in the right part represent a block of code that can contain several instructions () =&gt; {}; <br>  ○ when using such syntax there is no implicit return, you need to write it () =&gt; {return 'foo'}. <br>  ● You cannot statically give the arrow function a name, but performance tests are much better for most methods without a name. <br>  ● The switch functions are bound to the lexical environment: <br>  ○ this is the same this context as in the parent lexical environment; <br>  ○ this cannot be changed using .call, .apply, or similar “reflection” -type methods. <br>  ● Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-arrow-functions-in-depth">ES6 Arrow Functions in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Pattern lines</b> <br><br>  ● Strings can be declared using back quotes (`) in addition to single and double quotes. <br>  ● Strings with backquotes are pattern strings. <br>  ● Pattern lines can be multi-line. <br>  ● Pattern lines allow intermediate calculations to be `ponyfoo.com is $ {rating}`, where rating is a variable. <br>  ● You can use any valid js expression to evaluate, for example: `$ {2 * 3}` or `$ {foo ()}`. <br>  ● You can use labeled patterns to change the logic for calculating intermediate values: <br>  ○ add fn prefix to fn`foo, $ {bar} and $ {baz} `; <br>  ○ fn is called once with template, ... expressions; <br>  ○ template is ['foo,', 'and', ''], and expressions is [bar, baz]; <br>  ○ the result fn becomes the value of the template string; <br>  ○ Possible examples of use: clearing input expressions from unnecessary data, parsing parameters, etc. <br>  ● Pattern strings are almost everywhere better than strings wrapped in single or double quotes. <br>  ● Read the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-template-strings-in-depth">ES6 Template Literals in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Object Literals</b> <br><br>  ● Instead of {foo: foo}, you can simply write {foo} - the abbreviated form of the property-value pair. <br>  ● Calculated property names: {[prefix + 'Foo']: 'bar'}, where prefix: 'moz' returns {mozFoo: 'bar'}. <br>  ● It is impossible to simultaneously try to use the two previous features, the {[foo]} entry is invalid. <br>  ● Method definitions can be made more concise with the following syntax: {foo () {}}. <br>  ● See also the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">Object</a> section <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">.</a> <br>  ● Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-object-literal-features-in-depth">ES6 Object Literal Features in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Classes</b> <br><br>  ● Not “traditional” classes, but syntactic sugar on top of the prototype inheritance mechanism. <br>  ● Syntax is similar to the declaration of class Foo {} objects. <br>  ● The instance methods new Foo (). Bar are declared using the simplified <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">syntax of the</a> class object <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6">literals</a> Foo {bar () {}}. <br>  ● Static methods - Foo.isPonyFoo () - need the prefix, the keyword static class Foo {staticisPonyFoo () {}}. <br>  ● Class Foo {constructor () {/ * initialize instance * /} constructor method. <br>  ● Prototype inheritance with simplified syntax class PonyFoo extends Foo {}. <br>  ● Read <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-classes-in-depth">ES6 Classes in Depth.</a> <br><br>  <b>Let and Const</b> <br><br>  ● let and const are alternatives to var when declaring variables. <br>  ● let has a block scope, rather than lexical, with respect to the parent function. <br>  ● let <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/javascript-variable-hoisting">rises</a> to the top of the block, while var rises to the top of the function. <br>  ● “Temporary dead zone” or simply VSW: <br>  ○ starts at the beginning of the block where let foo is declared; <br>  ○ ends at the place of the code where the let foo declaration occurs (here, “lifting” does not matter); <br>  ○ attempts to access or define foo inside the VMP (before the let foo instruction is executed) will result in an error; <br>  ○ It helps to reduce the number of mysterious bugs in which the value of a variable undergoes changes before it is announced. <br>  ● const also has a block scope, “elevation,” and follows the VLM semantics. <br>  ● Const variables must be declared using the initializer const foo = 'bar'. <br>  ● The definition of const after initialization causes a silent error (or not a quiet one - in strict mode). <br>  ● The const variables do not make the variable unchangeable: <br>  ○ const foo = {bar: 'baz'} means that foo will always refer to the object in the right side of the expression; <br>  ○ const foo = {bar: 'baz'};  foo.bar = 'boo' will not throw an exception. <br>  ● Defining a variable with the same name will throw. <br>  ● Designed to correct errors when you override a variable and lose the reference to the original object. <br>  ● In ES6, functions have a block scope: <br>  ○ prevent data leakage through the ascent mechanism {let _foo = 'secret', bar = () =&gt; _foo;  }; <br>  ○ Do not break user code in most situations and, as a rule, are what you need. <br>  ● Read the <a href="https://ponyfoo.com/articles/es6-let-const-and-temporal-dead-zone-in-depth">ES6 Let, Const and the “Temporal Dead Zone” (TDZ) in Depth.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270353/</a></p>
