It was organized by Microsoft together with the Skolkovo Mobile Technology Center.  235 participants fought for victory in three categories: the best VR game, the best educational VR project and the best corporate VR project. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/TechDays-Russia/VR-hackathon-how-it-was/player&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhZqwLNB1fdzPvtLNcY0lad2SwlYw" width="640" height="360"></iframe><br><br>  Even before the hackathon, its participants proposed 26 ideas for the implementation of virtual reality technologies.  45 more ideas were put forward during the event - this made him one of the most productive hackathons ever conducted by Microsoft in Russia.  The best virtual reality game project, Salochki, was proposed by the Touch-last VR team.  The winner in the nomination of educational projects was the project ‚ÄúDistance Learning in Virtual Reality‚Äù from the Rubik team, and among corporate projects, Sharp Glove won the Virtual Glove for VR team.

      In this article, we present to your attention the story of the Sharp Glove team, in which they share their impressions of the hackathon and tell about their project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b6/176/f0a/6b6176f0a4d2481587d7eaded488dcd6.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Virtual reality is easy.  And gently. </h2><br>  <i>The story of the winners of the virtual reality hackathon</i> <br><br>  It is no secret that 2016 is the year of virtual reality.  The graphics are practically indistinguishable from the present, the sound has reached its aesthetic limit.  From cardboard boxes with lenses, where you can insert a smartphone and go to conquer space distances, to cool helmets with a large viewing angle, eye tracking and other bells and whistles, there are models for every taste and wallet. <br><br>  But with all this choice - we can say that there is no choice.  Meanwhile, to be a disembodied doll, contemplating space, and being an active creator inside this virtuality.  And the snag is one.  Or rather six.  Six bodily senses not captured by the attention that, in addition to sight and hearing, fold our picture of tangible reality ... <br><br>  ‚Äú... These are receptor signals.  Electrical impulses perceived by the brain " <br><br>  Remember the dialogue between Neo and Morpheus from the Matrix? <br><blockquote>  - Is everything unreal? <br>  - What is reality?  And how to define it?  From a set of sensations: visual, tactile, olfactory ... These are receptor signals.  Electrical impulses perceived by the brain. <br></blockquote><br>  Morpheus knows.  From the institute workshops on physiology, I had to imitate different taste sensations with the help of a folding machine.  And over the past year, several devices have appeared, trying to imitate touches, warmth and even emotions in this way.  Our team is among them.  But we came to this steppe in our own way ... <br><br>  I am a biologist who, unfortunately, cut a nerve on his arm.  The limb hung emotionlessly and motionlessly, and one could forget about your favorite saxophone.  Soon, without the nerves inside, all the tissues would die out and smell bad.  But, as the years of laboratory practice taught me, it <i>is possible to organize a raid on any unlucky chance from happy nonrandomness, if you have a friend-engineer.</i> <br><br>  By making some iron and clinging to electrodes, we made a semblance of the nervous system that generates electrical impulses, exactly like what the brain sends when creating movement, or which are perceived by the skin receptors, like sensations - corrected by the need to pass through this very skin. <br><br>  Turning on the muscles of that kind of technogenic drive, we managed to recreate the movements and, for the sake of experiment, teach me to play the double bass.  Playing a musical instrument was not chosen by chance: something difficult was needed, which the muscles did not know before to prove the phenomenon of muscle memory.  I must say, this is a very phenomenal phenomenon! <br><br>  We read it with the help of the movement's myography from our cellist engineer and lost on me.  It was funny in two weeks with the acquired ability and insensible hand to sit in the symphony orchestra and play their first concert as a double bass player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a3e/ecc/51b/a3eecc51b3094151a94609f5602b5227.jpg"><br><br>  In other words, we do not just imitate any sensations, we have compiled an analogue of the nervous system, which can be dressed outside as clothes and program any movements or sensations, translating from the language of computer code to body language.  The essence is the same - that person, that the machine exchange information with the help of electrical impulses.  We just got a new non-invasive bionic interface that can be controlled through a computer.  And not the brain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/326/2ed/1a13262ed70f4f0ab05047bee3798df2.jpg"><br><br>  From January 19 to January 20, we went to Skolkovo, where in the hypercube, together with Microsoft, a VR hackathon was organized for people deeply immersed in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeep immersion.  The audience ‚Äî mostly programmers and game designers ‚Äî <a href="http://4pda.ru/2015/12/22/265736/">created a pretty VR game</a> on a pizza and coffee bar in two days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ca/67f/1bc/8ca67f1bc0a84d5abca8dfe016956264.jpg"><br>  VR Hackathon.  Skolkovo.  December 20.  6:06 am <br>  A biologist, engineer, and a couple of great Unity coders have collaborated around a global, all-human goal: to pet a virtual cat. <br><br>  Taking our device with us, two portfolios of glands, without sleep and rest, armed with a soldering iron, electrical tape, electrodes and a thread with a needle, we did this by making friends with cyberscience technology with a real virtual environment, making half of the participants scream with joy and causing genuine emotion on their faces Microsoft representatives.  And they can be understood. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b5/c15/624/6b5c156249e240ffb006db2ff87235ca.jpg"><br><br>  We programmed on the hackathone a sewn glove with tracking movements, so that it sends a feeling of warmth, tenderness, velvety fluffy surface, volume and rumbling to the hand.  Imagine, for example, HoloLens, where you can not only see holograms, but also feel, where you can get a virtual violin from behind your bosom and learn how to play it like a real violin! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/9ae/8cb/bdb9ae8cbeaa488fb6700fe0d04ce7f4.jpg"><br><br>  We called ourselves CyberSuit and settled on the website with the logical name <a href="http://doyoufeel.me/">doyoufeel.me</a> , where, with the support of <a href="http://bizspark.com/">Microsoft BizSpark, we</a> are creating a platform for the exchange of skills and sensations.  By type of social network.  Only instead of a selfie, people share their real or virtual sensory bodily experiences, and instead of songs and videos, they download the ability to "play the guitar" or "break dance", having considered it in advance from a professional performer. <br><br>  In my opinion, it would be great to live in such a world where virtual and real reality live side by side, where everyone can fully realize their ideas, expressing them in any art, where there is no concept of distance, and the world develops into a huge common mind.  I would like to live in such a world ... <br><br>  And you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275837/</a></p>
