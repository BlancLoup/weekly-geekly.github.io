This routine, it turns out, is much more important and more effective than one-time insights and a creative, but unsystematic approach to any work.  Using the example of the mistakes of Yandex and the highly respected Tina, let us see why the great strategist warned them thousands of years ago. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/774/b00/a77/774b00a776a9d6ab78cf3fc7c3c6bc96.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start from afar so that everything happening on the Internet is as clear as possible: the main difference between teen thinking and thinking of an adult human being wisely experienced is the unconditional belief of youth in its own uniqueness, chosenness, special talent power, magic of genius, and the unique role of personality in history. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the peak of teenage suicides from the first unhappy love or household quarrel with parents is due to the fact that every single child always thinks that his problem is unique, it is his personality that rejects all existing ordinary ways and standard ways of resolving a difficult situation, and so on. d.

      Simply put, an inexperienced child, seeing Jobs for the first time, immediately fervently believe that his presentation skill and masses manipulation skills were given to him from birth, sent over by intelligent reptilians, presented to adulthood by Santa Claus, etc.  Of course, every adult will appreciate the same situation differently and immediately realize that all the skills of a bright presentation of their product, the methods of easy PR of their products, the ability to keep the audience on a short leash are the result of many years of hard work and at least 10,000 hours of regular rehearsals. <br><br>  The mistake of the new Kinopoisk team, as well as the creators of the New Moscow brand, is not at all in that they have created a product that is frankly bad in all respects, namely, where did the faith in its own exclusivity come from, supposedly allowing them to ignore the generally accepted methods of designing information systems and running in new product.  There is nothing new under the sun, and every new product in the media space cannot and should not be a great secret or sudden surprise for the masses today.  A person is initially afraid of surprises, subconsciously, none of us need sudden surprises at all, and any gradual imperceptible changes are much better able to prepare each person for new deprivations or unusual product use scenarios.  This is physiology, it is necessary to know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/664/186/5e4/6641865e4fd6d873009f11611c39fd3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The design of information systems, and the design of logos today is not at all a place for ‚Äúsupreme deities‚Äù, gurus and other super-geniuses who think they are unique and exceptional, for which ordinary marketing laws are no longer written.  I am especially offended for Tina with her personal intsegram and LJ resources.  Yes, in a couple of weeks she could easily have gotten an entire army of Internet fans of absolutely any solution, if, throwing off her pride, she would seriously get down to business.  ‚ÄúHeraldry of the 21st Century‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew Image of the New Future‚Äù, ‚ÄúMoscow as an Ideal Mathematical Space‚Äù - she knew this very well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/759/451/7a3/7594517a3f3538670310a7417f818d85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why am I doing this?  Here, over the course of several days, I carefully analyzed the new version of Kinopo-search done by Yandex, and now I was finally convinced that if (for a moment) I imagined myself in the place of Yandex‚Äôs head of design department, or their art director, or signor-tomato, and anyone could be generally involved in the development of this project, then I would (hypothetically, of course) create a product quite similar in concept.  Not exactly such, of course, but the very train of thought of the developers, their ideas and attempts to bring their message - I personally close and understand, and do not cause any bestial rage.  Nevertheless, of course, it‚Äôs necessary to criticize Yandex, but for something else.  Purely visually and conceptually, this is not at all horror-horror, and not just another rider of the Apocalypse, as the prevailing public opinion convinces you of this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9dc/268/ad2/9dc268ad2462097a01f0cd0e12b8fb60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Leaving aside the technical shoals of the raw product, I want to lash out with deadly criticism only on that gang of pseudo-marketers, who all the previous six months or a year were required to do exactly two things before the bloody blisters on the fingers: <br>  1) To prepare the ground, convincing in advance the numerous respectable audience of the RuNet in what kind of functions they (it turns out) are needed and what cool features they lack very much in the current outdated Kinopoisk, <br>  2) To make "random" stuffing in the profile media of existing sketches and deliberate stirring up discussions, disputes, sraches, etc.  to collect the most important intelligence (feedback). <br><br>  Only a naive preschooler in the 21st century is still able to believe that all the prototypes of new iPhones, laptops and expensive cars accidentally caught in the network six months before the release are really the results of a secret special operation on their abduction with gunfights, false beards and fatal beauties hiding microfilms in most intimate places.  No, of course, it goes without saying that today any ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù hitting the network is far from accidental, and every comment of the indignant new design Vasya from Uryupins is watched by dozens of attentive eyes, while analyzing and correcting the development paths of his product.  And this is normal, only this is the way to work, if you consider yourself a professional. <br><br>  Never in my life I believe that the great and mighty Yandex (or Apostle) did not have enough money to hire a dozen copywriting students who half a year before the product came out would have filled the whole of Habr, the CPU, Vkontaktik with great reasoning about how cool I‚Äôd like to add an online preview to Kinopoisk, and how ingenious it would be to use the symbolic image of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">the Voronoi diagram</a> (the most talented domestic mathematician) for branding modern territories or municipalities.  And how wonderful, they say, it would fit into the feeling of national recovery, optimization of living spaces, ‚Äúrising from its knees‚Äù and others.  The price of all this hype is mere pennies, but instead of all these girls, marketers roll out only their insults into the network, children's demands to arrest all the trolls of the Internet, and in general, they say, ‚Äúoh all‚Äù.  But the salary received all these years, why, why, what were you doing?  Where does this ‚Äúmother help me‚Äù come from now? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/81b/02e/6c0/81b02e6c043e71de890975aaa1d51251.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the banal inability to work with the population, to manage the crowd, to conduct a point adjustment of public opinion with custom-made articles is able to bury any product today.  Absolutely anyone, no matter how genius a designer, designer, calligrapher and polygraph are.  All these professions in the modern world are deeply secondary, because the only profession that determines the future of any modern product by 146% is routine marketing, coupled with many hours of research, analysis and manipulation, and not the only brilliant inspiration of a three-time overpaid art director. <br><br>  In your innovative products, be Caesars, not Yandex. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/083/81c/ef3/08381cef3b569ba37a5a7e44dac926b2.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295450/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295450/</a></p>
