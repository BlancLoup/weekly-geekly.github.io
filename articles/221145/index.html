Hinek will talk about how SSL and TLS actually work and why there are a lot of pitfalls in their use, which the developer needs to know and remember if he really cares about application security. <br><br>  <b>Honza Kr√°l</b> , python developer at <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a> <br>  Honza will show what Elasticsearch can do for your applications.  From the simplest document search to faceted navigation and structured search.  And Elasticsearch is not only about searching.  Real-time analytics on terabytes of data, automatic classification of documents or even instant notifications - all this can be done with the same tool on the same data set. <br><br>  <b>Simone Soldateschi</b> , developer at <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/">Rackspace</a> <br>  Simone will talk about horizontal scaling in the clouds and how using Python and OpenStack can reduce the cost of IT infrastructure.  We will deal with the questions of why, what, when and how to scale, how to react to monitoring events, and what needs to be done so that scaling up and down is performed quickly and always correctly. <br><br><h6>  Reports in Russian: </h6><br>  Andrei Svetlov, Python Core Developer and committer in <a href="http://hg.python.org/">hg.python.org</a> .  Currently an architect in LevelUp <br>  <b>How not to do that your Open Source product began to enjoy success.</b> <br>  You have written down something very useful and even posted on github.  What will happen next?  In the report, Andrew will tell you why developers use or do not use Open Source products and how to make your product popular. <br><br>  Yuri Selivanov, Founder and CEO at <a href="http://sprymix.com/">Sprymix Inc.</a> , Python Core Developer from Toronto <br>  <b>Magic python</b> <br>  The talk will deal with python import tricks, approaches to instructing code for debugging and profiling without loss of performance (recompiling on the fly), etc.  etc. <br>  And for sweets - a discussion about declarative languages, and how to create and integrate them correctly. <br><br>  Alexander Koshelev, timlid in Yandex <br>  <b>Python-development in the Yandex universe</b> <br>  Alexander will tell you which questions on Yandex have found the answers to the following questions: <br>  What to choose - system packages or roll out via git pull?  Use virtualenv or not?  Is PyPI and pip convenient?  What to do when there is a lot of library in-house code?  How to cope with a large number of services in active development? <br><br>  Andrei Vlasov, IDE PyCharm developer at <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/">JetBrains</a> , author of the funcparserlib and iterpipes libraries. <br>  <b>Multitasking in Python and other languages</b> <br>  Python has a long tradition of borrowing multitasking mechanisms from other languages.  Initially, these were C and the POSIX environment, then Java and C #.  In the report, Andrew will talk about how the multitasking mechanisms in Python are built and what they can achieve, including the new Python 3 mechanisms concurrent.futures and asyncio.  Consider which mechanisms are suitable for tasks limited by CPU and IO, in particular, which advantages and disadvantages mechanisms have in Python.  And what approaches to multitasking are there in Erlang and Go languages ‚Äã‚Äãand how applicable they are to Python. <br><br>  Denis Chernilevsky, Head of advertising technology testing group at Yandex <br>  <b>Clear and extensible reports for Python + PyTest out of the box</b> <br>  In any project that has automated testing, people are faced with the problem of constructing convenient, understandable, easily expandable, and beautiful test reports.  After analyzing the requirements of a number of testing teams, Yandex developed a tool for building reports, Allure Framework, which is now an open source project.  This report will discuss its main features and how to implement Allure reports out of the box using a ready-made python adapter if you use Python + PyTest. <br><br>  Vitaly Glibin, lead frontend developer at <a href="http://hh.ru/">HeadHunter</a> <br>  <b>Using Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to build complex web projects</b> <br>  Vitaly will talk about what SOA is, what problems such architecture solves, and which ones it adds and how SOA is prepared in the most heavily loaded job portal of the RuNet.  And also tells about frontik and tortik - frontend-frameworks based on Python Tornado. <br><br>  Kirill Borisov, architect at <a href="http://bars-open.ru/">BARS Group</a> <br>  <b>Behavior Driven Development in Python</b> <br>  The report will reveal the essence of the behavior-driven approach to software development: the history of the emergence, the foundations of the methodology, examples of scenarios, differences from existing approaches, and the available tools for use in Python projects.  As well as the experience of its implementation, problems encountered and solutions. <br><br>  Alexey Malashkevich, Alexander Kozlovsky, the authors of <a href="http://ponyorm.com/">Pony ORM</a> <br>  <b>Pony ORM - mapper of a new generation</b> <br>  Pony ORM allows you to work with the database using the generator expressions of the Python language.  Using this approach, Pony allows you to formulate very compact and clear queries that are automatically translated into optimized SQL.  In the report, Alexey and Alexander will make a review, and for all of those who are interested, they will hold a master class in which everyone can touch Pony with their hands. <br><br>  Mikhail Korobov, works at <a href="http://scrapinghub.com/">ScrapingHub</a> , member of the <a href="http://www.nltk.org/team.html">NLTK Team</a> <br>  <b>Extracting information from web pages</b> <br>  Mikhail will talk about how to extract data from web pages using Python: <br>  - how to extract information from a single site; <br>  - how to do it without writing xpath, css selectors, etc .; <br>  - how to extract information if the structure of the site is unknown in advance; <br>  - when it is necessary to apply methods of machine learning and how to do it; <br>  - what tools are available in Python. <br><br>  Alexey Lavrenyuk, Yandex.  One of the participants of the open source project Yandex.Tank. <br>  <b>Load testing using Yandex.Tank</b> <br>  Alexey will tell about Yandex.Tank and how to sharpen it for his needs and automate the testing process using Python.  The report is designed for developers and system administrators who anticipate or have already encountered performance problems and want to get acquainted with the process of load testing and tools.  Listeners will learn about the load testing process, whether Yandex.Tank is suitable for identifying performance problems of their services and how to expand Yandex.Tank to automate and solve their specific tasks. <br><br>  Now the program still has room for a couple of reports and has not yet been answered for all the applications sent, but if you have a desire to speak, write to <a href="">pycon@it-people.ru</a> , there is still a possibility. <br><br>  And of course - come!  Until May 9, the discount price is 8000 rubles. <br><br>  The fact that it was at PyCon Russia 2013 is worth reading <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/170845/">here.</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://pycon.ru/2014/participation/price/">Sign up!</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f0/a37/110/3f0a371105936a911a78554c3675fd1d.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221145/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221145/</a></p>
