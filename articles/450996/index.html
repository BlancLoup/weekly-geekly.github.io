Not worse than the sensational TV series, these ‚Äúbattles‚Äù keep JavaScript fans in suspense, causing them to think: ‚ÄúWhat should we learn next?‚Äù Besides, the armies of users of each technology lead arguments that choosing a stack of technologies for further study becomes a very difficult task :) <br><br>  Our <a href="https://cvcompiler.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr">CV Resiler CV</a> Analyzer processes dozens of JS developers <a href="https://cvcompiler.com/%3Fref%3Dhabr">CVs</a> weekly.  Therefore, we also follow the "Framework Game" by regularly analyzing the requirements of employers.  This article is based on one of these analyzes, and is devoted to trends in the JavaScript language in 2019. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Trend skills for JS developers in 2019 </h2><br>  For analysis, we took 300 vacancies for JavaScript developers with AngelList, LinkedIn, StackOverflow, and similar sites.  Using the text analysis tool we wrote earlier, we highlighted the terms that were most often found in these vacancies.  Some of these terms are presented in this graph.  (Figures indicate the number of mentions). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8z/tv/lb/8ztvlboxvdyufwpj5ul_6rfetme.png">

      Please note: This is a general skill rating for positions that imply owning JavaScript as the primary language.  Of course, we do not believe that Back-End developers should know all the details of React, etc ... Moreover, this rating reflects the current demand in the labor market, which may differ from the preferences of the developers themselves (we will talk about them in the next section of this articles). <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Among those languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat were not included in the ranking, the most popular were <b>C #</b> (24) and <b>PHP</b> (16).  Among the DBMS, <b>MySQL</b> (23) and <b>MongoDB</b> (23) were in the lead.  Unexpectedly for ourselves, <b>Express.js</b> (24) was mentioned very rarely in vacancies, like <b>Flow</b> (23). <br><br>  We decided not to include the term <b>Agile</b> (150) in the rating, but it turned out to be even more popular than Git or Redux, which allows us to equate it with the ‚Äúhard‚Äù skills that every JS developer needs.  Same story with <b>UX</b> (101).  Of course, you don‚Äôt have to sign up for an advanced UX course (although it‚Äôs unlikely that he would disturb someone).  But, as a Front-End developer, you need to know how to improve the user experience with techniques not available to designers. <br><br>  The fact that we have met the terms <b>Scalability</b> (70), <b>Cloud Computing</b> (44), and <b>Security</b> (29) demonstrates that JavaScript trends are similar to those in the development industry as a whole. <br><br>  As you can see, <b>Vue.js</b> did not occupy high positions in our rating.  There may be several reasons for this.  Firstly, not every company is ready to transfer its projects to Vue.js, rejecting more generally accepted and stable front-end solutions.  Secondly, many employers expect the programmer to learn Vue already in the process, so do not include this framework in the list of initial requirements for candidates. <br><br>  However, global studies are talking about the increasing popularity of Vue.js.  28.8% of the respondents to the <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/overview/">State of JavaScript 2018</a> survey have already worked with this framework, and would like to repeat this experience.  An interesting observation: 34% of respondents from the same survey worked with Angular, but would not like to return to this technology again. <br><br>  This does not mean that at least one of the technologies (React, Vue.js or Angular) will soon raise the white flag.  The choice of the front-end framework depends on many factors, such as the scale of the project, as well as its architecture or geography. <br><br>  The same story repeats with <b>GraphQL</b> .  Although this term did not make it to the top of our rating, the popularity of technology is growing rapidly.  21% of survey respondents from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report/">2018 Node.js User Survey</a> already use GraphQL in their work.  For clarity, on April 30, 2018, 52 people downloaded Apollo (GraphQL client).  Exactly one year later, the client already downloaded 10,794 people. <br><br>  As for the tools for the assembly, the opposition of <b>Parcel</b> and <b>Webpack</b> deserves attention.  Review <a href="https://risingstars.js.org/2018/en/">2018 JavaScript Rising Stars</a> showed that Parcel is slowly adopting the popularity of the latter.  Despite the fact that Parcel has a lot of attractive built-in functions, such as automatic configuration, development server, or hot-swappable module, so far it has not been able to push back the good old Webpack.  Over 16,000 <a href="https://2018.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/overview/">State of JavaScript 2018</a> survey respondents use Webpack to build projects.  In the process of analysis, we did not meet Parcel in any of the 300 vacancies. <br><br><h2>  What does JavaScript expect in the near future?  Expert opinions </h2><br>  That's what experts think about the upcoming trends in JS development. <br><br><blockquote>  As for me, in the coming years, React will retain the right of precedence.  GraphQL will slowly push back the REST API, while TypeScript will overtake ECMAScript.  As for the new terms, I expect to see in the fresh rankings the top skills of ReasonML, Parcel, and the design system (perhaps not in 2020). <br><br>  Another observation - it seems to me, Redux will lose its position in the next 5 years, as the developers are discovering new approaches to the front-end, which is good news. </blockquote><br>  <i>South Vepsalainen,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/survivejs">SurviveJS</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactFinland">React Finland</a> ,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>winner of the Blue Arrow Awards.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/bebraw">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://survivejs.com/">Site</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  This ranking demonstrates the continued leadership of React, Angular, and Node.js in the JavaScript ecosystem.  I am inclined to believe that this trend will continue, and any developer should study in detail at least one of these frameworks.  TypeScript and GraphQL will also continue to grow. <br><br>  Among backend developers, the popularity of Node.js is increasing.  However, many companies expect JavaScript developers to work with other languages, such as Java or Python.  The rest of the ranking suggests that simply knowing JavaScript is not enough.  The use of common practices such as CI, Git and TDD is mandatory for current developers. </blockquote><br>  <i>Kevin Ball,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>consultant and trainer in the field of Web Front-End,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>founder of <a href="https://zendev.com/">ZenDev</a> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/kbal11">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://zendev.com/blog.html">Blog</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  I am surprised that Express.js does not occupy one of the top positions in this ranking, since it is the main framework for writing backend applications on Node.js.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that the lion‚Äôs share of JavaScript jobs is designed for frontend developers, but the technology itself cannot be considered unpopular. <br><br>  I am inclined to believe that React will continue to lead the frontend industry.  The framework quickly responds to user requests and puts forward entirely new ideas.  Facebook support also means a lot.  TypeScript is also one of the major trends - I think that in 3 years we will not see a single large-scale project that does not use TS.  Since the combination of TypeScript and React is well developed, I think that both technologies will retain their leadership. <br><br>  What really needs to be changed is the complexity of the project building process.  Most likely, an effective solution to this problem will appear in the near future, such as codesandbox or Parcel. <br><br>  In general, JavaScript has already been formed as a fairly ‚Äúadult‚Äù and stable language, so I don‚Äôt think that we will soon see the inveterate battles of any technology. </blockquote><br>  <i>Denis Radin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Tech Lead in <a href="https://focusreactive.com/">FocusReactive</a> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://twitter.com/pixelscommander">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="http://github.com/pixelscommander">Github</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  JavaScript has a reputation for rapidly changing language, frameworks for which are released every week.  I think this process will slow down a bit, although we are seeing the emergence of ‚Äúframeworks for frameworks‚Äù such as Gatsby. <br><br>  Understanding the basic syntax of ES6 is crucial, along with an understanding of the interpretation process and the limitations of various browsers.  Finally, the growth of progressive web applications and service workers also deserves attention.  Potential markets for JavaScript applications are located around the world, and you should also understand what customers need in one place or another on the planet. </blockquote><br>  <i>Lori Bart,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>speaker, blogger, teacher,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>consultant at Ten Mile Square Technologies.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/laurieontech">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://dev.to/laurieontech">Blog</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://laurieontech.com/">Site</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  Based on the needs of Cypress.io, I see that GraphQL and TypeScript will lead the list of the most required skills in 2020. You can also predict that hybrid frameworks (Next.js, Nuxt.js, Gatsby.js) will be used in the lion‚Äôs share of projects , therefore JavaScript developers will have to understand these technologies. </blockquote><br>  <i>Gleb Bakhmutov,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>VP of Engineering in <a href="https://www.cypress.io/">Cypress.io</a> .</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/bahmutov">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://gleb.dev/">Site</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  The JavaScript ecosystem is constantly growing, and this can be confusing.  At the same time, it testifies to the evolution of the language, and gives developers a great chance to learn and develop.  Possession of React and Next.js is a huge plus for both your resume and job search in general. </blockquote><br>  <i>Tanya Butenko,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Software Engineer in Hireup (Australia),</i> <i><br></i>  <i>founder and CEO of Muses Code JS Inc.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://twitter.com/ButenkoMe">Twitter</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://musescodejs.org/">Site</a></i> <br><br>  In general, I believe that modern JavaScript developers are lucky.  JS and its frameworks <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">lead the rankings of the</a> most used technologies in the world.  Despite the separate confrontations of frameworks, the generally accepted technology stack is quite stable, which allows you to concentrate on using technologies rather than selecting them.  I hope this article will help you identify a list of technologies for further study! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450996/</a></p>
