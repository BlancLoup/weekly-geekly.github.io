  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Optimization of data center operation at no extra cost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most companies are forced to constantly increase resources in accordance with growing business needs, and in a limited budget.  Thus, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãlimited funds, data centers (data centers - data processing centers) have the greatest potential for savings. <br>  Data centers consume 50-100 times more electricity than conventional office space.  For every 100 kW consumed only 40 kW is used directly by IT equipment.  The remaining power is spent on cooling systems, uninterrupted power, etc.  Of the 40 kW consumed by the equipment, often less than 25% are used for computing and communication needs. <br>  Nevertheless, there are ways to extract maximum opportunities from the data center with minimal expenditure of funds.  There are a number of measures to improve data center infrastructure at key points such as saving space, extracting maximum power and optimizing the performance of cooling systems: <br>  -Installation of raised floor in the data center; <br>  - shutting down old and unused equipment; <br>  -cleaning and straightening hidden cables to improve the raised floor ventilation; <br>  -investing funds in the monitoring of cooling systems, as a way to optimize the management of air flow in server rooms. <br>  Let's go more in detail on the marked points. <br><br>  With decreasing free space in the racks, there is a growing need for more powerful server hardware.  But with a limited budget, any improvements in the data center should be fully justified.  Therefore, first of all, you should explore all the possibilities to get the most out of the existing equipment, and then acquire something more. <br><br>  <b>Space - the last frontier</b> <br>  Square meters in the data center - something unchanged, so you need to tune in to productive work in a limited space.  We'll have to get rid of everything that is not used.  Most data centers have servers whose service life is nearing its end, if it has not already ended.  Most of these servers are in a kind of coma and no one knows about the functions they perform, but they are afraid to turn off.  But it's worth a try!  And if after a ‚Äútest‚Äù shutdown, nothing screams (which is most likely), then everything is fine.  If something is useful on this zombie server, then it will successfully spill over to more healthy devices.  It is much easier for workloads to overflow with virtualization, which may just be the main cost item for new expensive equipment. <br>  Most data centers eventually become part-time stores.  Dirt, dust, boxes, boxes - one should get rid of all this rubbish, which, for all the evidence, few people understand. <br>  In the data center, as in the major capitals of the world, square meters are worth their weight in gold, therefore, counting squares, it is advantageous to use the third dimension, which allows you to make a raised floor. <a name="habracut"></a>

Its feature is easy and quick access to all underlying communications.  Therefore, it is very important to carry out the prevention of seals in the holes so that the air is not wasted during cooling.  But we will discuss this further in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Feel more power</b> <br>  Power is expensive.  The de-energizing of old servers is definitely beneficial, but new high-performance equipment may require more energy than is saved on disabling junk.  New uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) in the future will help to save a lot.  When rearranging IT equipment, the highest priority is placed on reliable power service.  It is necessary to accurately graded and mark cabinets, depending on the devices serving them. <br>  Depending on the number of supply phases, for example, three-phase circuits, you should determine all possible load imbalances with the help of specialists and redistribute the equipment on the circuits in case of skewing to achieve approximately identical loads on all phases. <br>  Invest in monitoring devices such as smart power distribution.  These devices help maintain phase balance without incurring significant data center improvements. <br><br>  <b>Work with the wind</b> <br>  The most complex data center system requiring optimization is the cooling system.  Air running away through the openings between the cabinets is the most common problem.  Make an effort to seal these holes and will be more than rewarded. <br>  If you use raised floors or patch holes, there is a need to improve cooling by restoring air flow uniformity.  The best investment here can be a good data processing system for aerodynamic processes (CFD).  This system serves to visualize the processes of air flow and its impact on objects.  CFD modeling can identify hot spots and establish zones of inefficient circulation of air flow or mixing cold and hot flows.  A 3D mathematical model is created on a grid, which can be viewed from different points of view.  Simply changing the variables, the administrator can imagine how the cold air will pass through the data center in accordance with various circumstances. <cut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/001/2a1/18d/0012a118d25c472a9bdad038a362fd8f.jpg"><br><br>  Installing an additional air conditioner (CRAC) can be a waste of money if you install it in the wrong place.  Moreover, this plant may impair the cooling process.  The CFD model can help correct the use of excess cooling capacity. <br>  Under the floor, cables degrade air flow.  That is why you should straighten and update cables, which in turn is much cheaper than a serious upgrade of cooling systems. <br><br>  But the basis of all of course is the equipment.  The course to increase efficiency, coupled with a decrease in footprint and moderate power consumption, prevails.  The best way out in this situation is <a href="http://westcomp.ru/catalog/servery_hp_hp_blade_gotovye_komplekty/">Blade systems</a> .  But that's another story. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265017/</a></p>
