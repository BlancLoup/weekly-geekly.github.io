  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to recharge your Payoneer card</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Among the most popular questions that we are asked, of course, leads: "How to add money to the card?".  What is the peculiarity of Payoneer MasterCard prepaid cards and why is it worth knowing about them in advance, so that it would not be painfully painful for an aimlessly ordered card?  In this post we will explain how you can and how you can not load funds on the Payoneer card. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/120/09b/55c/12009b55c6a4569c52beec597d65b7c6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main purpose of Payoneer MasterCard cards is to receive payments from foreign employers, Payoneer partner companies.  When you register on the <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/ru">Payoneer</a> website using the link received from such a partner, your account in the partner company is automatically attached to your Payoneer account.  In most cases, you can add as many other companies as you like to the same card.  The size of the minimum or maximum payment, commission and cost of service, as well as the speed of loading funds depend on the partner through whom you received the card. <br><br>  You can transfer money to the card using the <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/USPService.aspx">US Payment Service</a> , a special service that allows you to receive payments to a Payoneer card from a number of US companies.  The list of companies from which you can receive transfers is regularly increased, and includes PayPal, Skrill (Moneybookers), Amazon, Apple, ClickBank and many others.  We talked about connecting US Payment Service in our last post ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/payoneer/blog/166119/">How to withdraw money from the App Store to Payoneer card</a> ‚Äù.  Transfer using the US Payment Service takes up to 7 business days, the commission is 1% of the amount of the incoming payment.  There are no restrictions on such payments; you can transfer any amount that your chosen company allows.

      <br>
      Getting money from partners and / or using the US Payment Service is one of the main ways to use a Payoneer MasterCard prepaid card. The methods described below are additional services, the provision of which depends on several factors. <br><br>  Private download from a Visa / MasterCard credit or debit card through <a href="https://load.payoneer.com/">our website</a> is an optional service.  Such payments are made at our discretion.  Payoneer may request additional information or documents from both the sender and the payee, limit the amount of the payment or reject it.  The cost of the service is 3.75% of the transfer amount, while the sender of the payment can choose which of the parties will pay this commission.  The monthly limit on the number of transfers and their amount depends on the amount of payments received from partner companies. <br><br>  Another additional service, called Card-to-card, is the transfer of money from one Payoneer card to another.  Transfers within our system are not available to everyone; many partner companies do not allow such payments.  For transfer within the system in both accounts (both the recipient and the sender), this service must be supported.  Transfer is carried out through "My account", in the menu "Withdrawal" you need to select "Transfer to Another Card".  There are various restrictions on the number and amount of payments for both the recipient and the sender of the money. <br><br>  At the moment, Payoneer MasterCard prepaid cards cannot be recharged in cash, by bank transfer (for citizens or residents of Russia and the CIS countries) or by direct transfer from electronic wallets.  We are currently working with several e-wallets and hope to increase their number in the future. <br><br>  If you have any questions or suggestions, you can contact our support service in Russian by mail at support (a) payoneer.ru;  with the department for working with Russian partners - partners (a) payoneer.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166817/</a></p>
