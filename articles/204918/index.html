  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The study of charity in RuNet: the most popular way to transfer money - SMS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you already know, in August of this year <a href="http://dobro.mail.ru/">we launched Welcome Mail.Ru.</a>  This is the first mass Internet service for charity in RuNet, where the user can easily help different audiences: children, adults, the elderly, animals, nature.  And to help not only with money, but also with business - for example, providing free professional services. <br><br>  We always wanted to know how Runet does charity.  What prevents users from doing this more often?  Who do they want to help?  How to motivate them?  On December 3, 2013, together with VTsIOM, we told about the results of a study conducted among 1,500 users of the RuNet.  The age of respondents ranged from 18 to 59 years, they live in cities with a population of 100,000 people <br><br><h4>  Who! </h4><br>  First of all, we learned that ¬æ respondents were ever engaged in charity.  Women are a little more involved in this process, among them 79% helped others, for men the proportion is 72%.  Most often, users with money help runet aged 25 to 44 years.  Business most of all help young people 18-24 years old, since the majority is just getting back on its feet financially.

The total amount of donations is also small, 67% of respondents donated no more than 3% of their monthly income. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/996/91f/a1c99691f56751fd5839870e6e94e87a.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to television and other media, sending an SMS ‚Äî58% was the most popular way of giving.  In second place with a large margin personal transfer of money - 29%.  Donations via bank transfers and payment systems occupy similar shares - 26% and 23%, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e6/521/178/7e652117862c0d5a346c59b5de24ca1b.jpg"><br><br>  Among those who help with deeds or affairs and money, only 15% do it once a month or more often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/301/366/249/301366249713371aaa5b64d1fa196783.jpg"><br><br>  To whom? <br>  Most often, people are ready to help children and the elderly, this was noted by 83% and 53% of the respondents.  Less than half of runet users are ready to help animals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c75/4e5/d9f/c754e5d9ffc79393a7c250bed207910f.jpg"><br><br>  It also turned out that age noticeably influences preferences in choosing those whom people are willing to help: young people are more likely to help animals, the most economically active people between the ages of 25 and 44 are more often willing to help children.  Older people, on the other hand, are more likely to help the elderly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd4/030/5c3/cd40305c3b4e60039415054c092c9b3a.jpg"><br><br>  Also quite understandable patterns emerged: women are more compassionate and more often ready to help children, old people and animals, and men are more often ready to render professional help. <br><br><h4>  What prevents? </h4><br>  As you remember, about a quarter of surveyed users do not engage in charity.  What keeps them from this?  The most popular reasons were distrust and lack of money.  The main signs of our time, unfortunately ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/677/682/575/6776825758cfd7d8b4e60ed2fd66f736.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, in charity the issue of trust is very important.  Therefore, we paid special attention to this topic in the study: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aaf/49b/bc2/aaf49bbc23714d12b4cb24c6b4104f95.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, fear has big eyes: the level of trust is significantly higher for those who have already helped.  In general, men were more suspicious than women. <br><br>  Why don't people do charity more often?  What could help them?  It turned out that for men and women, motivating factors have slightly different priorities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f81/42a/988/f8142a9889ad697747e6c8c6bf8ba2c8.jpg"><br><br>  If we compare the motivation of all those who have already made charitable donations and those who have not yet done so, the difference is not so great: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/993/925/d84993925da7b11aa2fd1b46230d32ad.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, in all four sections, the most important factor is the lack of information.  Many would be willing to help more often, but have difficulty finding reliable information. <br><br><h4>  A responsibility </h4><br>  We asked the respondents who, in their opinion, should be engaged in charity in Russia, and how do they generally assess the situation in our country with gratuitous help? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ff/8d5/58f/6ff8d558f7f741cf61ab2a35e3a3d688.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, most users of the Runet believe that rich people and large companies should be involved in charity. <br><br><h4>  Income </h4><br>  33% of respondents believe that doing charity does not depend on income.  25% are sure that for rendering gratuitous assistance it is necessary to earn from 35,000 to 65,000 rubles.  per month.  22% of respondents raise the bar for earnings above 65,000 rubles.  for charity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd9/c5d/53f/dd9c5d53f5b58e5f9041c7d8078932b2.jpg"><br><br>  Among those who noted that earnings should be above 65,000, much more than those who had never before engaged in charity.  On the contrary, users of the RuNet, who have already had experience in providing free aid, noticeably more often than others note that the level of income does not affect the practice of charity. <br><br><h4>  Initiative </h4><br>  Nearly two thirds of the respondents (70%) believe that people themselves should take the charitable initiative.  In second and third place are charitable foundations and the state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20b/5cc/242/20b5cc2424366b737b238a0cac54b089.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The role of employers </h4><br>  Since the overwhelming majority of the population are hired workers, we were also interested in the users ‚Äôassessment of the role of their employers on Runet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ac/64f/812/9ac64f812fb7c2bb5bf96c1eac0626e3.jpg"><br><br>  It turned out that most employers do not support the participation of employees in charity.  At the same time, among those who have ever engaged in charity, the proportion of those whose employer supports employees in good deeds is significantly higher. <br><br>  More than half of the users who never helped would become more actively involved in charity if the employer supported them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cb/6ce/1ce/7cb6ce1ce191af0c40ff1fa108675e38.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The ideal is achievable </h4><br>  As you remember, for users of the RuNet one of the main problems in the way of rendering charity is the lack of reliable information.  And what should be the ideal resource with information about charity? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b07/af3/fe0/b07af3fe01366bea3715bf7f6f64f93a.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the above general statistics, it is worth noting that for those who have already helped with money, the most important factor is the convenience and speed of remittances - 73%.  Those who helped with business, in the first place put the availability of charitable projects in their city - 66%.  For those who have never helped, it is more important to have access to reports on the activities of charitable organizations - 62%. <br><br><h4>  Volunteers </h4><br>  Volunteer movement is not yet so active in Russia.  We asked our respondents how they relate to volunteers and what features they consider characteristic of these people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fc/435/51e/2fc43551ebd6a28c886c238e7cc04296.jpg"><br><br>  Only 3% of those polled by us are volunteers.  These people are respected by the vast majority of RuNet users.  It turned out that men and women paint themselves in a slightly different way the image of a volunteer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed1/246/fe8/ed1246fe8b022908035eedac9cab15f6.jpg"><br><br>  Men are much more likely than women to believe that a volunteer should be financially secure and have plenty of free time. <br><br><h4>  Information </h4><br>  85% of women and 78% of men would like to receive information about new charitable projects and promotions.  One third of users who did not participate in charity earlier do not want to receive such information. <br><br>  According to the degree of popularity, information sources are located as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2a/08a/575/f2a08a575008816c9af32a7bd1709f9e.jpg"><br><br>  However, the level of trust in information obtained from different sources often does not at all coincide with its popularity: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34e/cd6/a2f/34ecd6a2f835668d850ea509d07a086d.png"><br><br>  The most popular way to get information, users called email.  Almost half of the respondents are ready to receive monthly information about new charitable projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe1/fac/c44/fe1facc444e0fa0c70d08739d40a0670.jpg"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  So let's summarize the research: <br><br><ul><li>  Most users of the Runet ever engaged in charity - 76%. </li><li>  About 20% consider charity an important part of their lives. </li><li>  Young people help them more often, older people prefer to help with money. </li><li>  Most users donate no more than 3% of their monthly income. </li><li>  Usually people make charitable donations no more than once every 2-3 months. </li><li>  The most popular way to transfer money is SMS. </li><li>  The credibility of information on charity projects and promotions posted on social networks is not large. </li><li>  The main incentives for participation in charity are openness and accuracy of information, support from family and friends, as well as the state and employers. </li><li>  Those who have never engaged in charity, believe that this requires a high level of income.  Those who have already provided free assistance, do not bind this activity to their earnings. </li></ul><br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204918/</a></p>
