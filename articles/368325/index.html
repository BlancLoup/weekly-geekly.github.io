  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of mobile payment terminals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year ago, I opened an online store and decided that I would immediately need a mobile terminal to accept card payments when a customer received my order (talking about courier delivery to my hometown, of course).  Leaving beyond the scope of this article the very fact of the prematureness of such a decision, I want to share with you the experience of using terminals of various types. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Bank terminal </h4><br>  At the very beginning of the money, the store had very little and even did not want to spend several thousand rubles to buy a terminal.  The search for free options for acquiring the device led me to one not very recent Russian bank (one of the twenty largest in the Russian Federation), which provided the device without advance payment and with quite reasonable transaction processing fees. <br><br>  Making a contract with a bank is a topic for a separate conversation, not everything is simple there, but there is nothing supernatural, except that the bank only requires documents confirming the ownership or lease of the premises where the terminal will be registered (for an online store without an office, this is especially impressive).  They managed to get documents for an apartment where they are registered ... From my point of view, one of the documents received from the bank was important - the rules of payment systems for working with their cards.  There it was described in detail which parameters need to be paid attention to in order to make sure that the card is not fake and what to do if one is found, and a lot of other useful things.

      As a result, I got my hands on an Ingenico iWL220 device with a charger and a battery of a spare receipt tape, and a bank employee gave a briefing on how the device worked.  It remains only to insert the SIM card and you can work.  The terminal accepts cards with a magnetic strip and with a chip, prints checks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/799/362/a6a/799362a6aaa64493beac0a06f1445c63.jpg"><br><br>  Actually the most important thing starts next.  This terminal works like a Kalashnikov.  It is convenient, simple and reliable.  For the year of operation, no problems were identified.  At all.  The terminal works on the principle of the assistant-wizard (I don‚Äôt know how in Russian) - each action is accompanied by a short instruction on the screen and all you need is to press the button: green or red.  Everything is extremely simple and understandable even to an unprepared user, which in principle eliminates the need to train personnel in handling the device - just show it once.  One battery charge is enough for me for half a year of work. <br><br>  In general, the advantages of this terminal: <br><ul><li>  free; </li><li>  easy to learn; </li><li>  easy to use; </li><li>  reliable; </li><li>  economical. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  registration of the contract with the bank; </li><li>  heavy; </li><li>  separate SIM card. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Mobile terminal </h4><br>  The store developed, the number of orders grew and at some point there was a need for each courier to have the opportunity to accept payment by card.  By this time, one of the payment systems installed on the website of the online store began to offer a partner mobile terminal, and it was decided to take it in pair with the first one - banking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/261/a48/4ef/261a484efca94da688a57e8186953ce7.png"><br><br>  There were no problems with documents, it was necessary only.  agreement to the contract to sign and pay for the terminal.  A few days later I arrived at the PS office and got the terminal in my hands.  It is small, lightweight, accepts cards with a magnetic strip and with a chip ... but that‚Äôs all the advantages of it and ended, as it turned out later. <br><br>  First of all, well, I can‚Äôt call the device reliable, because it is not clear whether it will work at this particular time or not.  The device is included in the audio jack of the phone and simply hangs in it.  To be honest, every time I'm afraid to break off something. <br><br>  After each switch-on, the terminal needs to be initialized - go to the settings, click the "Initialize" button, wait ... and, perhaps, press again or reconnect the terminal and try again ... It is clear that the bank terminal is also somehow initialized, it only does it automatically , without participation of the operator and without problems. <br><br>  Secondly, it turns out this terminal is also equipped with a battery and it must also be charged.  That's just not known when, because there is no indication of the level of charge.  That is, in order to avoid a situation that you came to the client, and the battery was at the terminal, you need to charge it every time before leaving.  Very comfortable, yes ... <br><br>  Thirdly, when trying to read data from a client‚Äôs card, the result is not guaranteed, since initialization could fall off, but you won‚Äôt find out until several times you try to make a payment. <br><br>  Fourth, in order for a client to receive at least some kind of ‚Äúcheck‚Äù, you need to enter a phone number and an email address.  Still, none of the clients agreed. <br><br>  Fifthly, unlike the bank terminal, which will make a payment with any card, the mobile terminal works only with cards that have online payments enabled.  Again, I came to the client, but the payment does not pass ... I am not ready to spoil my reputation because of some piece of iron. <br><br>  And sixthly, hell hell - the client's signature on the phone screen.  To say that it is inconvenient (even using a stylus), to say nothing, and if you remember ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù - the terminal on the snot is held on the phone - it becomes quite sad. <br><br>  Well, in the appendage - tech support for vendor sowing does not respond fundamentally.  They seem to have the opportunity to enter payment data using a QR code, but how to do it is not written anywhere. <br><br>  As for me, there are more minuses than pluses. <br><br>  Pros of the mobile terminal: <br><ul><li>  simpler design; </li><li>  device weight; </li><li>  No need for a separate SIM card. </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  the cost of the device is 1950 rubles; </li><li>  reliability; </li><li>  difficult to use; </li><li>  you need to carry a stylus with you (not to sign a client with your finger is generally a gesture); </li><li>  no indication of battery charge; </li><li>  the application does not display the status of the device; </li><li>  does not accept card payments with the ‚Äúonline payments‚Äù option disabled; </li><li>  To send a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù to the client, additional data is required. </li></ul><br><br>  And what happens in the end.  Marketers and PR vendors of mobile card readers everywhere assure us that bank terminals are expensive and complex, and their mobile terminals are cheap and easy to use, and in practice for a single small online store, this is exactly the opposite. <br><br>  And about a separate SIM-card, which I wrote down for the banking terminal.  With modern tariffs for the mobile Internet, it is better to buy a separate SIM-card, on which there will always be money and for which you do not need to follow than to depend on the state of your phone‚Äôs account.  I use the tariff of one of the Big Three operators, specially designed for all sorts of sensors with the alert function, and out of 50 rubles, about 2 rubles were spent on the account for the year of use.  Of course, we will have to spend time buying an additional SIM card, but then there will be only advantages, since it is cheap and convenient. <br><br><h4>  Ny </h4><br>  If I had the opportunity, I would return the mobile terminal, since even those 2000 rubles that had to be paid for it could be spent more profitably for the business.  But maybe I‚Äôm doing something wrong or my hands are not growing from that place, share your experience using devices from various vendors? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368325/</a></p>
