Meetings have already been held in Kiev, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov, Lviv, Odessa, Zaporozhye.  The first international breakfast in Almaty is currently scheduled. <br><br>  We have defined several event objectives: <br><ul><li>  Increase awareness of call tracking technology and its business opportunities; </li><li>  Interested participants to test our service during the free two-week trial period. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/644/13c/f62/64413cf6218355008a8ff2f136af82df.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Selection of target contacts using a modified algorithm Prodvigator </h1><br>  We, as a partner of the <a href="https://prodvigator.ru/">Prodvigator</a> service, used its search algorithm as a basis, having previously made the necessary modifications. <br><br>  This allowed us to form a list of potential participants-users of PPC advertising in the city where we have lunch or breakfast.  The screenshot shows a typical search card that we received for each potential participant.

We received a high conversion due to deep preliminary research and the collection of contacts on target criteria. <br><br><h1>  Performance measurements using registration landings </h1><br>  An important role in the selection of participants was played by the PPC campaign, which led to landing pages based on the <a href="http://q-page.ru/">Q-page</a> designer. <br><br>  In the screenshot of the admin panel, you can see the impact of visits and applications through landing pages.  The biggest stir was caused by events in Dnepropetrovsk (929 views and 52 applications), Almaty (725 views and 80 applications), Kiev (637 views and 53 applications) and Kharkov (768 views and 79 applications).  We observed the highest conversion in Lviv when registering for a business breakfast of applications through landing pages from unique visitors - 57.3%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1ce/d52/588/1ced525883ccfe25cc390ce9365d796a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Traffic sources for pages:</b> inviting direct advertisers in the region by phone, advertising on Google adwords, facebook ads, affiliate and own email-mailing. <br><br>  <b>Average page conversion</b> (from viewing to registration for an event): <br><ul><li>  Landing business breakfast - 26%; </li><li>  Landing business lunch for agencies-24%. </li></ul><br>  The screenshots below show the typical design of the landings that were used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a75/8f7/e29/a758f7e299ff44980588ec4b558ce47e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ada/a2a/fec/adaa2afecd7e3906720b04a57431a73b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  How did the seminars go? </h1><br>  Our partners from Google, Yandex, OWOX prepared general information about their products, which directly intersected using call tracking.  Considering that <a href="https://ringostat.com/">Ringostat</a> supports full or partial integration with software solutions of these companies, the discussion at the meetings turned out to be informative.  Lecturers talked about telephone marketing, Google Analytics, Google Sheets, Google BigQuery, Yandex.Metrica and Yandex.Direct. <br><br>  Our commercial director Konstantin Chervyakov and head of the sales department Sergey Pyatnitsky, using the example of Ringostat cases, showed visitors the principle of operation of the call tracking technology. <br><br><h1>  What have we achieved using such an event strategy? </h1><br>  During the campaign, seminars brought about 20 applications for testing and negotiation, of which 3 companies have already become our clients.  Considering that we are selling a comprehensive B2B solution, we have a long sales funnel cycle, and participants still need some time to conduct internal discussions and enter the negotiation process. <br><br>  Thanks to a well thought out selection process, we were able to reduce the likelihood of failures and low attendance at our seminars.  An important factor was the work with our partners Google, Yandex and OWOX, who agreed to hold joint events.  Their participation created the necessary resonance around our events in each city where they were held. <br><br>  The only thing we have refused is broad advertising, since we were interested in targeted attraction of the target audience.  Therefore, we deliberately did not make an admission fee, which would have been necessary if it were promoted through mass media and other mass advertising tools. <br><br>  Learn more about call tracking on the <a href="http://blog.ringostat.com/">Ringostat blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299386/</a></p>
