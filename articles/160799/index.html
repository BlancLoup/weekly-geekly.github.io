She began to penetrate into our lives since the time of the first mobile games on smartphones, and maybe earlier.  Perhaps the starting point is a long-time video from Nokia, an advertisement for a phone and a game called snake 2, the main character of which played a snake at the same time and avoided real urban obstacles.  At that time, people did not even think about such a concept as ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù, but already represented it in advertising. <br><br>  Recently, a lot of impressive mobile devices and applications have appeared that make us think about whether objects, things and phenomena that we see will always look like we see them today?  For example, while little-known <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9c6W4CCU9M4">Google Glass</a> allows a person to see data that is beyond the control of the ordinary human eye.  Different applications for iOS and Android (and possibly also WP soon) allow people to gamify many life processes.  An example of gamification can serve as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUPn3jVGQw68">this cool movie</a> . <br><br>  Your attention to the free translation of the article with techcrunch, which presents the opinions of experts about the future of augmented reality: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Vikas Reddy</b> , co-founder of <a href="http://occipital.com/">Occipital</a> , in an interview stated that DR, clearly, has not reached its maximum due to the undeveloped system of tracking the terrestrial landscape.  However, with the development of computer vision and software, the camera becomes the most important sensor and "cog" not only in the DR mechanism, but also in the entire computer infrastructure.

      <i>‚ÄúThink about how much information a person processes in his head every day of his life.</i>  <i>Almost all of this information is not available for "digitization", but this is only for now!</i>  <i>Today, our smartphones have the ability to perceive the entire surrounding world through its surface.</i>  <i>For devices, at this stage, the real world is not the outline of the interactive world.</i>  <i>Soon, however, computer vision will allow us to transform the surrounding reality into digital and fan, thus increasing the ‚Äúdigital‚Äù possibilities of the space around you. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  During the <a href="http://www.blurcon.com/2012/">Blur</a> conference, Paul Barberian, CEO of <a href="http://sphero.com/">Sphero</a> , presented the demo version of the new game ‚Äú <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/16/spheros-new-augmented-reality-app-allows-you-to-walk-a-beaver-around-your-home/">Sharky the Beaver</a> ‚Äù.  Sharky is a robotic ball that acts as a rotating marker.  The user controls the ball through a Bluetooth device.  While the ball rolls on the floor, on the screen, the user sees, instead of the usual ball, the animal Sharky, which walks around the room and eats cakes.  Through 2 data streams, the creators balance on the verge of the virtual and real worlds at the same time!  Sharky is available for developers like the software development kit.  Thanks to him, we are seeing the emergence of the possibility of creating a whole library of images that people control with the help of a small robot.  For example, furniture companies can use this technology and give their users a chance to try on a virtual, wardrobe, table or bed in one or another part of a new room. <br><br>  It is also interesting that the opinion of Ariel Gartern, co-founder of InteraXon, on the development of her company is a sensory bandage on her head that allows brain waves to control surrounding objects in the house (for example, curtains or chandeliers).  Another development in this area allows a person to develop his memory, concentration, develop a positive attitude and retain motivation: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThere are many opportunities for combining the functions of augmented reality and waves of brain activity.</i>  <i>Basically, there are two types of DR that people use - these are glasses with DR that complement the world around and display the image on the glass, and a smartphone camera with DR when the user receives additions to the world through the application in the phone.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Google-enabled glasses with augmented reality allow you to read the signals of your brain, because you constantly wear these glasses on yourself.</i>  <i>The use of these signals in technology makes it possible to regularly demonstrate your activity in real time.</i>  <i>For example, for a certain period of time, such a system could record your level of stress for a full-time job.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In addition, augmented reality can occur in a person in the context of his activities and the places he visits, as well as his general physical and emotional state.</i>  <i>Just imagine: you are on the road, you begin to feel sleepy, and the DR system immediately offers you options for the nearest hotels!</i>  <i>The development of the system allows for more fine-tuning the appearance of information, increasing its value.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Brain waves and DR systems also make it possible to get neuro-feedback.</i>  <i>What does this mean?</i>  <i>This means that at any time you can get information about the state of your brain, as well as ways to optimize its work. "</i> <br><br>  The main question is: where will the technology of augmented reality develop further? <br><br>  The co-founder of <a href="http://geoloqi.com/">Geoloqi</a> argues that augmented reality will move to a new level when users can create various objects, animations and applications themselves.  In the near future, augmented reality should become available not only to developers, but also ordinary users, which means that such content will rapidly spread throughout the network. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúGames and 3D animations will accurately shoot in the context of DR.</i>  <i>However, the value of augmented reality will be understood when the technology begins to solve real, pressing problems of the surrounding world, as well as to bring diversity into everyday routine.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Most of the developments in the field of DR have a ‚Äúwow‚Äù effect only in the first 15 seconds, so developers should come up with not only an impressive, but also a user-friendly interface.</i>  <i>Such, for example, as at Google - nothing superfluous.</i>  <i>The search engine never distracts you - it only gives you data, and then you start interacting with the information yourself. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And how do you see the future of augmented reality? <br>  If you have experience creating applications with the use of augmented reality, then comments are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160799/</a></p>
