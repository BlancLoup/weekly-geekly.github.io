SMS mailing is a fairly powerful marketing tool that, if used improperly, can have the opposite of the expected, literally destructive effect.  How to avoid it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a09/222/ac6/a09222ac63b7406597502aafed363603.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have repeatedly raised <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infobip/">here the</a> topic of SMS notifications, push, omnichannel communications and have seen very different reactions in the comments and ratings.  And if a business is immersed in this topic, because it is looking for effective channels, then an ordinary user can ‚Äúimpose‚Äù a minus, because he has a negative experience of misusing technology against him. <br><br>  And this is clearly manifested at the level of discussion of technology and on a site where people, in general, understand the lines between adequate and improper use of tools.  What to say about the situation ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù, where this line is even thinner?  SMS distribution can really be a unique tool, and can assign a spammer's reputation to a company.  To avoid this, it is important to be responsible at every stage.

      From time to time we come across (fortunately, less often) with a widespread view that it is enough just to acquire a database of telephone numbers somewhere, and you can immediately send out a newsletter and get a ton of new customers.  In fact, a poorly compiled base will only cause business losses. <br><br>  Firstly, it is not known what percentage of the target audience will be in it, and how many messages will go idle or even irritate the recipient.  Secondly, the base must necessarily be up to date, without invalid numbers or numbers that change the owner.  Finally, the potential client should be disposed to contact you as soon as possible, otherwise he will quickly forget about your offer. <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying a database compiled by someone else may sound tempting.  But we categorically do not recommend resorting to this method.  The most effective will give the base, your own with your own hands, although it may not be so quickly and simply. <br><br>  There are several ways to build a really high-quality base for promotional mailings, where the audience will approve their receipt, and you will have the possibility of its segmentation.  Although none of them is a secret, for some reason, companies often forget about them.  Let's try to remind. <br><br>  <b>The first</b> , and most common, method is questionnaires that customers fill out, and in which they not only leave contact details, but actually represent themselves to the company, talk about what interests them.  In addition, they confirm that they are already familiar with you and your product, which means that your advertising will not be something unexpected and incomprehensible to them.  To motivate customers to complete a questionnaire, offer them a one-time discount or some other bonus. <br><br>  <b>The second</b> way is to register on the company's website.  If the client is ready to leave you personal data, it means that he is already interested in working with you.  It remains only to find an offer that he does not want to refuse.  Many use the so-called.  Lead Magnet is a valuable and free offer for a potential client that he can receive in exchange for committing a targeted action.  It can be books, reports, delivery ... There are a huge number of manuals on the network on this subject and we will not focus on them. <br><br>  <b>The third</b> way is to place in the advertisement of your company numbers for receiving SMS from customers, in response to which you send more detailed information.  It is very convenient for him and you.  He will not have to search for information himself, and you will get contact with a person who is interested in your product and can become your client. <br><br>  Finally, try to motivate people to leave you their details, inviting them to participate in a variety of contests.  If you think out the conditions of the competition well, then your target audience will surely respond to it.  Your task will not let her go. <br><br>  Thinking through ways to replenish the base of your potential customers, remember the most important thing: it should correspond to your target audience.  Your target audience is people who have shown interest in your product, perhaps even already bought it, and who have the opportunity to purchase it in the future.  And these people should provide you with personal contacts consciously and voluntarily.  Only then communication via SMS will be fair, justified and mutually beneficial. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332604/</a></p>
