In our sphere, there is now observed, if not panic, then a stressful situation for sure.  Increasingly, journalists began to turn to us for comments, and friends for advice, which is why we decided to express our point of view on the changes around us all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/791/50b/f5b79150b7944cabb345326554874b65.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The dollar exchange rate by mid-December several times rewrote historic highs.  By the beginning of October, it grew by 15-20% (up to 40 rubles) in relation to the summer indicators, and in December it increased by 50% in relation to the September values.  Undoubtedly, the events taking place now will greatly influence the Russian economy, the Russian market and consumer behavior. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e6/0f9/ba4/0e60f9ba45a349e28dcd40b5d71a754d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the moment, Apple has closed its online store in Russia for the second in the last two weeks of reassessing the cost of products.  A similar situation is observed in the automotive industry: almost all dealers have suspended the sale of cars.  In large chain stores, customers stand in line for hours, buying appliances and furniture, as they fear a sharp increase in prices.  How justified are their fears and is it worth it to panic? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff3/ffd/5cc/ff3ffd5ccc9a4fc08b7e92cfcbd05dfb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you know, the price of the equipment is usually set by manufacturers or distributors.  They usually do not respond to rate fluctuations within 10-15%, because, firstly, smoothing price fluctuations is their main duty, and secondly, the total margin of the wholesale supplier and retail store for most goods is 20-25% .  With a large growth rate, this tactic is changing - prices begin to increase smoothly, by 5-7%, so that it does not hit the buyers psyche a lot! <br><br>  If the ruble weakened gradually, then most likely, large vendors would not raise the price of models that are already on sale, but would increase with the release of a new generation of phone or tablet.  For example, the iPhone 5S cost 29990, and the iPhone 6 is already 31990 at the start of sales. <br>  If the dollar will grow stronger, as is happening now, prices will increase even on older models, this will negatively affect sales in the long term.  B-brands are particularly affected.  For example, the Chinese flagships have risen in price first, and the top Samsung and Sony models have not yet experienced a significant increase in prices.  Thus, at a similar price, the buyer will prefer the well-known brand.  This may lead to the fact that the supply of B-brands will be significantly reduced, companies will adjust their plans for the Russian market. <br><br>  As for the A-brands, we should expect a gradual increase in the price, which will be at odds with diminishing demand. <br><br>  Thus, if you plan any purchases, it is better to make them in the very near future, because now you can definitely say that prices will rise significantly even for those electronics models that have been on sale for a long time. <br><br>  Moreover, even if the ruble is now beginning to grow rapidly, the prices for the current range of mobile electronics (except Apple technology) - smartphones, tablets, laptops and the rest are based on the dollar value of 35-40 rubles per dollar.  Therefore, it is definitely not worth expecting that prices in 2015 will be cheaper than the current level! <br><br>  This situation promises a downturn in the market.  However, we hope that the oil price will grow and our national currency will change its direction from falling to growth, and then the situation will stabilize. <br><br>  Ilya Makarov <br>  Head of Advertising and PR Up-House.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364545/</a></p>
