      So, ‚Äúwelcome to the Veeam Software technical support department.  How can I help you?" <br><br>  Our department is divided into 3 offices located in different parts of the world (Columbus, Sydney, St. Petersburg).  They are united by one simple task - to provide uninterrupted service in the 24/7 format, accessible to customers from anywhere in the world. <br><br>  Officially, the company provides support in English, French and German.  It so happens that we have few Russian-speaking clients, so knowledge of a foreign language is a prerequisite for hiring.  Unofficially, there is support in Italian, Spanish, Greek, and any other language that one of my colleagues knows.  A person who understands IT and virtualization, and also speaks a foreign language is a potential candidate for our team. <br><br>  The technical support department in the usual sense is the place where the load is distributed between the call center operators processing the application and the engineers actually working on this application.  But we are working in the B2B sector, and therefore our average client is not a <s>hysterical online player,</s> an individual, but a system administrator who is at least responsible for backing up the virtual environment, and in most cases completely serving this virtual infrastructure.  Of course, the level of communicative and technical competence of an employee of our department must correspond to the level of the client, so the requirements for candidates are quite high. <br><br>  The team has a clear hierarchy.  Customer requests can be transferred, if required, from the first level to the second, and possibly to the third.  Levels are called T1, T2 and T3 (T = tier).  At the same time, the 3rd level is a kind of QA department, where bugs are finally reportable and are considered together by developers. <br><br>  Inside each of the teams there are experienced team leaders who themselves were similar specialists a year or so ago.  That is, they themselves have gone all the way and will not allow their subordinates to be offended, they can, if necessary, <s>stand by the machine</s> to communicate with a difficult client.  In some places, the work presents extremely interesting moments, such as the opportunity to participate in a ‚Äúremote session‚Äù, where the client infrastructure is very developed and works on the latest iron models or, say, in a very short period of time to familiarize yourself with almost all the shades of English accent found in nature . <br><br>  We also almost introduced gamification into the workflow (now the system is in beta testing).  It will be possible to get virtual points and <s>swing up to level 80 to</s> get bonuses by executing the usual working tasks, and then exchange points accumulated for a bonus, time off, or a top-end video card.  Actually, the pool of gifts is still not fully determined yet, but we are in the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/326/c44/27a/326c4427a3f479f3937f4594a3f04d3e.png"><br><br>  Well, now more about the guys from the office in St. Petersburg. <br>  To begin with, it is worth noting that the office is located in the business center ‚ÄúFernand L√©ger‚Äù, at Kondratievsky 15. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/002/5a3/0e9/0025a30e9dda4409d1d492dafe4fade1.jpg"><br><br>  The BC has an Italian restaurant with tasty pizza ‚Äútakeaway‚Äù, healthy and healthy business lunches and a fitness center.  By adding the presence of the gym right in the office building with an individual work schedule, which is not deprived of any employee of the department, we will get a great opportunity to go to the gym, at any time convenient for the engineer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/576/fdf/6c9576fdf7560278a742a7296e77d075.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the BC there is always a lot of light, and we are not deprived of various greenery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ae/ff3/f55/0aeff3f55a70e2c05cdc9585f9c22898.jpg"><br><br>  Look in the room to the English-speaking team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3a/802/265/b3a802265f542b2bc986919163b6748d.jpg"><br><br>  We should also mention our working atmosphere.  "Old" help "new", one has only to ask.  By the way, the team is international in the literal sense, not so long ago Iyed from Tunisia, Christ from Greece and Patrick from Ivory Coast joined the guys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/094/4be/62f/0944be62fd48fd9be69bb4dc73dc6d3d.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that each workplace decorates as he wants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f52/1f6/627/f521f6627c6ee132a950de29c7dced30.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúHelp me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/417/eeb/397/417eeb397984398e313485ffaa1da742.jpg"><br><br>  And maybe so <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/1fd/608/bfc1fd6081aa1b79dde1626824606a30.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a4/461/7b8/1a44617b8d4fc3adc452ca63d9604642.jpg"><br><br>  Also on the wall is a dashboard, which displays the current status of the queue of calls and free / busy employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c0/142/e54/1c0142e548d74e6251847e30324e5ab7.png"><br><br>  The second half of the English-speaking team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42a/973/cc6/42a973cc695b26fdf0753001b50ee791.jpg"><br><br>  And this is the French-Spanish-Italian team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a0/4ae/578/7a04ae578f7ae84bc3e5e2f7f0a5828f.png"><br><br>  Corner of france <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9af/c4f/da9/9afc4fda92e64d08b01f913cb7012c35.jpg"><br><br>  And we have a well-functioning training system.  We understand that people with knowledge of specific languages ‚Äã‚Äãmay be completely unaware of virtualization and vice versa.  Therefore, everyone has the opportunity to undergo product trainings, analyze the most popular customer requests and learn how to make them happy. <br><br>  Also, more recently, a regular English language teacher works at the office.  And language classes are held during working hours and are completely free. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fed/3f7/157/fed3f715788c37a7bd811c053cefbf14.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to working things, our guys love to relax (and who does not love?). <br><br>  On the photo is a game room with table football.  Find Valera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c67/819/71c/c6781971ceba9bc8f4f8e1732f32bda2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72f/d6a/84c/72fd6a84c059e4cbd737ebe772415aec.jpg"><br><br>  Also, guys love to play board games and chess, and even arrange competitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3cc/7e3/aec/3cc7e3aec05486418a8ad77f7c553147.jpg"><br><br>  And here is our kitchen.  I think that you should not repeat about coffee and cookies.  Here you can warm up lunch brought with you, or destroy a pizza ordered collectively.  It is also here, on the last Friday of every month, that the birthdays of our colleagues born this month are celebrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f20/2ec/9f3/f202ec9f3587b9829995f9fbcfaad409.jpg"><br><br>  So it turns out that already the 3rd month in a row we, instead of kitchen celebrations, go on the nature.  We organize ourselves so that both the meat eater and the vegan / vegetarian find delicacies for themselves and everything is good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0b/15b/ac1/c0b15bac1199ad41cfea14bb3cd13617.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Hope you enjoyed it here. <br><br>  I also want to note that at the moment the opportunity to prepare such posts about the teams of developers, marketing and sales is being considered.  Therefore, please indicate in the comments what you would like to see in such posts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e47/fd6/86e/e47fd686eef504cd16f5d00000cf232c.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Resources </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.veeam.com/ru/">Veeam Company Website</a> <br>  <a href="http://careers.veeam.com/">Career portal</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/187388/">How to start a billionth company</a> (Habr) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228725/</a></p>
