The market for this product is not too saturated with high-quality, well-thought-out offers at an affordable price and is limited to offers from one or two manufacturers.  Yes, and they have their drawbacks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa5/124/35d/aa512435ddb8247072b37fb0e4ecb1ed.png"><br><br>  Installers are always actively responding to new products in this segment, especially when world-famous manufacturers enter the field. <a name="habracut"></a>

      We will try to satisfy the hunger for information and throw bread and circuses!  The article focuses on switching hatches from <a href="http://www.muk.ua/company/vendors/schneider/">Schneider Electric,</a> which are part of the new Optiline 45 product line for commercial buildings. <br><br>  The hatches are presented in three versions: under 4, 6 and 8 mechanisms of the popular standard size 45x45mm (Fig. 1), (Fig. 2).  Rosette supports are compatible with any products from other manufacturers of this format.  But there is no need to look for them separately.  within the same Optiline 45 line, <a href="http://www.muk.ua/company/vendors/schneider/">Schneider Electric</a> offers a wide selection of affordable power and low-current outlets, combined in the Altira series (Fig. 3). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65f/062/e62/65f062e62ceaa74f4b717a840ce6f3ac.png"><br>  Fig.  1 Plastic hatches <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/179/01d/6e1/17901d6e188a1dc25e98426d66e16cf2.png"><br>  Fig.  2 Stainless steel hatches <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67c/230/bd8/67c230bd83db9e6a459413d351144e01.png"><br>  Fig.  3 <br><br>  As for sockets, they differ from analogs of other manufacturers in an acceptable price, in an ultra-fast and safe way of installation due to the use of self-tightening cleats.  The connection speed of one outlet is no more than 10 seconds; a block of 2 sockets with jumpers prepared in advance is 15 seconds. <br><br>  And so, back to the overview of the hatches.  A distinctive feature of the hatches (I have not seen anything like it from other manufacturers) is that the same models are made of both plastic and stainless steel and have almost identical dimensions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/c7a/b39/798c7ab396b47f242a42b698bec60f0b.png"><br>  Fig.  four <br><br>  Plastic models have high quality materials from which they are made, as well as precise fit of all parts of the body.  The design is simple and convenient.  Nothing superfluous, everything is thought out, carefully what is expected (Fig. 5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa5/124/35d/aa512435ddb8247072b37fb0e4ecb1ed.png"><br>  Fig.  five <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d5/4e5/237/2d54e52375d30f3d2c7772f83b5838ea.png"><br>  Fig.  6 <br><br>  Stainless steel hatches (Fig. 7) have become a discovery.  Similar solutions from other manufacturers are 2-3 times more expensive. <br>  Because of this, they can compete with plastic solutions. <br><br>  For those who have never encountered the operation of such products, I will share my experience.  The life cycle of plastic hatches with active use and constant physical impact is relatively small.  Over time, they are subject to deformation, they can fall apart, take on a non-representative form.  Although the manufacturer claims the permissible load on the models of plastic and stainless steel is the same and equal to 300kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3a/e5d/35c/c3ae5d35c4e76a0529b28e2145067585.png"><br>  Fig.  7 <br><br>  At the same time, hatches made of metal in ‚Äúoffice‚Äù conditions have an almost unlimited resource.  And if you do not want to pay twice, this is the only correct solution for areas with increased intensity of movement of people. <br><br>  I would point out the following advantages of stainless steel hatches: <br>  - almost unlimited resource; <br>  - sufficiently large thickness of the coating to be inserted into the cover. <br><br>  Separately, it should be noted that the depth of the lid allows you to install in it not only the carpet, but also tiles up to 15 mm thick. <br><br>  To fix the frame itself, the flap serves as a spring-loaded lock, which allows the frame to snap into place without a tool in the floor with a thickness of 10 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/574/185/d35/574185d351c971bef3bd21fbeea39569.png"><br>  Fig.  eight <br><br>  Separately, you can purchase so-called access hatches (Fig. 8).  They are a manhole housing with a lid without a socket calipers.  Low cost justifies the meaning of their use. <br>  Permissible load of 300 kg. <br><br><h4>  Dimensions and content </h4><br><br>  The dimensions of the hatches in the horizontal plane are 199x199 (for hatches for 4 mechanisms 45x45) and 199x276mm (for hatches for 6 and 8 mechanisms 45x45). <br><br>  Rosette supports can be placed at a depth of 70 to 100 mm in plastic hatches and from 80 to 110 in steel, the depth adjustment step is 5 mm.  A special adapter allows to place circuit breakers and RCDs in the enclosure. <br><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br><br>  OptiLine 45 floor hatches are suitable for installation in all types of floors, both raised floors (outlet hatches and access hatches are installed directly into the prepared hole of the raised floor panel) and concrete floors. <br>  For the raised floor there is a special mounting kit in the form of two screw clamps.  For filler floors, you can use two types of installation boxes (Fig. 9).  Cheap plastic with adjustable depth of 75-95 mm and galvanized with a fixed depth of 250 or 350mm.  The latter are delivered as part of a single solution for the organization of underground cable channels for flood floors.  Both types of boxes are equipped with protective caps made of chipboard, to protect against the ingress of cement mortar. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/2f5/243/e112f52433480577e898d59078eb9f9d.png"><br>  Fig.  9 <br><br>  On the relevance of the use of boxes made of galvanized steel for laying cables in the concrete floor can be a long time to talk.  Prices for these boxes are often forced to use something cheaper.  But in any case, in the assortment of the OptiLine 45 line such boxes are included (Fig. 10).  I‚Äôll clarify that they are compatible with OptiLine45 hatches and installation boxes, otherwise it can‚Äôt be. <br><br>  Boxes are supplied in 2 meter lengths and are presented in eight sizes: <br>  - two-section boxes: 150x28mm, 150x38mm, 200x28mm, 200x38mm; <br>  - three-section boxes: 250x28mm, 250x38mm, 350x28mm, 350x38mm. <br><br>  The duct system consists of the tray itself, the lid, mounting brackets, and transitions for moving the duct from a horizontal plane to a wall plane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/079/12e/158/07912e1588e25eaa0f940c7e78216760.png"><br>  Fig.  ten <br><br><h4>  Package and nuances </h4><br><br>  The kit includes: <br>  - hatch frame with cover; <br>  - mounting supports for direct snapping of mechanisms 45x45 (adjustable in height); <br>  - cable holder / organizer (located next to the cable outlet in the hatch); <br>  - two partitions; <br>  - six cable clips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78e/817/b55/78e817b556d84d3dd75538c3f6526427.png"><br>  Fig.  eleven <br><br>  Among the necessary accessories you need to note the caliper cover (shown in Fig. 11).  One can argue about the need to use it, but as an electrical safety is the necessary protection. <br><br><h4>  Summing up </h4><br>  The new product line from the global manufacturer <a href="http://www.muk.ua/company/vendors/schneider/">Schneider Electric</a> will still have to prove in practice its undeniable advantages over third-party counterparts.  But now, taking into account the presence of all the necessary accessories in this line, practicality and quality, we can confidently say about the "freshness" of this product on the market. <br><br>  UPD: where this can be installed <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/452/a1d/645/452a1d645d7c221094b31cbd3616a82c.jpg"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Contact info</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Questions about products / prices for products can be written to: ss@muk.ua </div></div><br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213695/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213695/</a></p>
