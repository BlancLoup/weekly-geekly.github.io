Still fighting an army of unfamiliar words?  In today's article we will share ammunition, namely: memorization techniques that you did not know about;  how not to miss the important;  how to make learning fun and how to create a context for words. <br><br>  You already wrote the words on the cards, pasted them on the furniture, and put reminders on the phone, but did they? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the article <a href="https://habr.com/company/englishdom/blog/328112/">‚ÄúHow to learn 100 English words a day,‚Äù</a> we have already revealed the main secrets and memorization methods.  But if you have tried everything and want something new, then today we have prepared a few more tricks and techniques. <br><br><h2>  For lovers of lists </h2><br>  The accordion is a great way for visuals and lovers of organization and order.

    <ul><li>  Take a piece of paper on which, at the left edge, write the words in English in a column. </li><li>  Draw a line and sign the transfer. </li><li>  Along the line bend the sheet and near the translation make another column with English words (but from memory). </li><li>  Bend and write the translation again. </li><li>  Alternate these steps until the sheet is complete. </li></ul><br>  After finishing, be sure to check yourself.  By the end of the task you will remember 90% of the list. <br><br>  What to do next with this list, hovering aimlessly in your memory?  There are such options: constantly remind yourself, use it in context and expand it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v2/-r/vl/v2-rvlsbm5cq7koztzwuekhhkhs.jpeg"><br><br>  To remind: <br><br><ul><li>  Record the words with the transfer to the recorder and listen to every day. </li><li>  Ask someone from your family to "drive" and check the list.  Since school, we have an installation in which external control instills more responsibility, and consequently, the effectiveness of learning. </li><li>  Hang the list above the desktop and periodically review. </li></ul><br>  <b>Context</b> is your best companion.  If you make friends with the lists, do not drop them halfway.  When everyone has already remembered, make up with each word some funny or interesting sentence. <br><br>  Personalize this process ‚Äî create phrases about yourself or your friends.  Do not be afraid to make a mistake in grammar (now it is not the main goal). <br><br>  For example, we have words for memorizing and life situations: <br><br>  <b>swimsuit</b> - swimsuit; <br><br><blockquote>  Once I lost my swimsuit in the sea.  - Once I lost a swimsuit in the sea. </blockquote><br>  <b>move</b> - move; <br><br><blockquote>  I moved to my country.  - I moved to another country because I saw a spider in my bed. </blockquote><br>  <b>retire</b> - retire; <br><blockquote>  When I retire, I will drink scotch and have fun.  - When I retire, I will drink whiskey and have fun. </blockquote><br>  Expand lists can be <b>synonyms</b> or <b>antonyms</b> .  When writing out a word, immediately try to memorize words that are similar or opposite in meaning to it. <br><br>  Learned the word "good" (good), find out how to be "bad" (bad).  And if you still remember ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and ‚Äúterrible‚Äù with them, then you will greatly enrich your vocabulary. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yAsli3WxOg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Another way to expand the list and memorize 3-5 words at once is word formation.  Check what prefixes and suffixes can be added to the word. <br><br>  For example: <br><blockquote>  differ - differ; <br>  different - different; <br>  indifferent - indifferent; <br>  differentiate - to distinguish; </blockquote><br><blockquote>  depend - to depend; <br>  dependent - dependent; <br>  independent - independent; <br>  independently - independently; <br>  independence - independence. </blockquote><br>  Making friends with suffixes is a useful skill.  Half of the long scary words in English are derived from simpler ones. <br><br><h2>  For those who are tired of all these techniques of memorizing words </h2><br>  Well, if everything has already become boring and uninteresting, we offer you some creative and slightly crazy methods that will excite your imagination. <br><br><h3>  Cards for memorizing English words </h3><br>  One of the most popular methods were and remain English vocabulary cards.  With them you can learn and words, and phrases, and irregular verbs, and even grammar.  They can be both paper and electronic. <br><br>  If you are kinesthetic and like to physically interact with what you are learning, then create them yourself: on the one hand we write the word on the card, on the other - the translation.  We advise those who are no longer new to add a <b>sentence with an example of using this word</b> . <br><br>  The advantage of cards is that you can put them off, and after a while, just spend a few minutes repeating. <br><br>  What are these perfect cards for memorizing words? <br><br><ul><li>  Short (2-3 words and an example) </li><li>  Simple (both translation and example should not contain incomprehensible words and constructions) </li><li>  With context (relevant and simple context cements the word in your memory) </li><li>  With associations (small images on cards are effective for visuals) </li></ul><br>  If you are not a fan of handmade, use <b>applications</b> with ready-made cards and examples.  Some of the most popular: <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> , <a href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise</a> , <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a> . <br><br>  Electronic cards are good because the application regularly reminds you of them on the principle of <b>interval repetition</b> .  If the repetition is successful, the time until the next increases.  If the word is forgotten, the application will remind you about it early. <br><br><h3>  Poems with English words </h3><br>  For those who teach children (or he wants to learn and have fun) there are various funny poems in Russian, but with the replacement of some words with English. <br><br>  It seems that this is not serious, but it is rhythm-melodic and funny plots that will help you quickly remember the word. <br><blockquote>  Plum here and plum there, <br>  Plum in English plum. <br>  A fairy told me in a dream: <br>  Pear in English pear. <br>  Near the river is an old house. <br>  It lives grandmother mouse. <br>  Mouse gives delicious cheese. <br>  - Give me a cup, grandmother, please. <br>  - Thank you, very tasty tea. <br>  Five o'clock - time to go. </blockquote><br>  With the help of rhymes it is much easier to remember <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/blog/kak-uchit-nepravilnye-glagoly/">irregular verbs</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  Sleeps a lazy fat cat, <br>  He mice are not catch, caught, caught (catch). <br>  Stewardess tea carries - <br>  In English: bring, brought, brought (to bring). <br>  In life, choice is often difficult, <br>  How do we still choose, chose, chosen? <br>  There will be a waist at the ladies, <br>  Kohl charging do, did, done (do). <br>  Which year <br>  I am english learn, learnt, learnt. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oz/hv/tj/ozhvtj7imscxq5dji-ahgdy-uyw.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  We make history </h3><br>  If there are words that are difficult for you to remember, then combine them into a short story.  There are 2 options for how to do this. <br><br>  For example, we have 10 words: intelligent (smart), coat (coat), boots (boots), put (put), watch (watch), purse (wallet), drawer (drawer), lock (close), gift (gift ), owl (owl). <br><br><ul><li>  We can come up with some funny hero and talk about his habits and the things he has. </li></ul><br><blockquote>  A coat and boots.  He also has a beautiful watch.  He always puts it in his purse.  He locks the purse <br>  A very smart rabbit who lives in a hole under a tree, wears a coat and boots.  He also has a beautiful watch.  He always puts them in his wallet.  He closes the wallet in the dresser, where he keeps small gifts from his girlfriend, owls. </blockquote><br><ul><li>  But if you find it difficult to invent ordinary stories, make a crazy chain of images out of these words (the more fantastic and slurred it is, the merrier and more effective it is). </li></ul><br><blockquote>  I have an intelligent coat, it speaks and wears boots.  I locked my owl.  Gives you a gift for your mom.  I think I will buy her a watch this time. <br><br>  I have a smart coat, it can talk and wears boots.  I put it in the dresser, where I closed my owl.  This owl has a wallet, and she gives me money so that I can buy gifts for my mother.  I think I'll buy her a watch this time. </blockquote><br>  Try at least once to write a story out of words that you need to learn, and you will not be stopped. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/at/q1/ku/atq1ku8ohrrz3fea-scrntw-q4k.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Aivazovsky method </h3><br>  Aivazovsky did not draw the sea "from life".  He peered for a long time, memorized the details, and began to work at home. <br><br>  In this method, we will also memorize details and features, but in order to use learned words or find new ones. <br><br>  To begin, select a topic that is of interest to you (cities, cars, people).  Find any image from this subject on the Internet or in life (for example, while driving in transport) and take a good look at it. <br><br>  Close your eyes and try to describe what you see in detail in English words, clearly imagining this object in front of you. <br><br>  For example: <br><blockquote>  A bed: <br><br>  black brown; <br>  double; <br>  modern; <br>  cozy. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  A man at the station: <br><br>  angry; <br>  gray hair; <br>  blue eyes; <br>  big nose; <br>  brown coat; <br>  suitcase; <br>  to wait for a train. </blockquote><br>  Such a technique will teach your thinking to reinforce the words learned with specific images and combine them into thematic blocks that will be invented by you personally.  And also make you constantly use words from different topics and do not forget them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JuoqE2lpRUM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  So, the memorization technique is already so much that it is difficult to remember them all!  Try and find your one and only favorite.  And stick to it!  And also do not forget: <br><br><ul><li>  learn words that suit you level; </li><li>  repeat the learned; </li><li>  put words into context; </li><li>  Do not torture yourself with techniques that do not suit you. </li></ul><br>  Try to find or invent your own fun and creative method.
