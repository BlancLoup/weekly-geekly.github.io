  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competition for display design of the news feed Habr</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the next three months, the next stage of reformatting the Habr site into a more readable form will be implemented, taking into account all current requirements for working with content.  The first stage was and is - experiments with ZenComment styles and <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1970-habrajax">HabrAjax</a> scripts.  (Attention, the project is <u>NOT associated</u> with the administration of Habr or any of its programs.) Experience has shown that under the conditions of frequent change of layout and the inability to influence the initial layout of the site, the results will be tied to the original layout, the efforts will be depreciate frequent innovations. <br><br>  In the next version of the scripts, the approach will be more flexible.  It is already partially implemented in existing scripts.  It will allow users to take content from the pages in the user's browser and transfer it to a completely different, own layout.  We will no longer be so attached to the layout of the site, we can build ourselves any page of news, and even a few of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of these pages will be implemented by me (others are at the discretion of enthusiasts).  I imagine some design that can be implemented if there are no alternatives.  If there are options, there are many chances that one of them will be executed as the main one.  After all, only 10% of readers liked the design of ZenComment.  And this is not surprising, because you have to compromise on the ‚Äúsite design - the number of alterations‚Äù.  If there is a lot of rework, they will be destroyed by a volatile site design. <br><br>  Layout can not be an exact copy of the site, because it is a product of the company, and the script can handle not only the materials of the company.

      The term of the competition is about a month before any work begins on the layout engine.  The reward is the use of the site on the pages of its design.  Even if the site ceases to exist, there will remain a page display engine on which pages of other sites can and will be displayed. <br><br><h3>  Principles that will be laid in the layout of pages of new design </h3><br>  The concept of ‚Äúdesign‚Äù is closely related to usability in this case, when designing a news feed.  Therefore, it is necessary that he obeyed a number of requirements of behavior that are not fixed rules and can be supplemented by the wishes of the project participants.  Now the list of requirements looks like this. <br><br>  * The site is monitored through a computer or mobile device browser in the form of a message feed, which is transformed from single lines - message headers to annotated headers, then to view the full article or message (while other messages can be minimized) and to the article with comments to it.  Almost all of this, except for the first item, can be seen in the working HabrAjax script.  He shows the tape, loads the article without reloading the page, expands and collapses the comments.  What it cannot do is to minimize the line to the line (although there is a function of folding articles by keywords and authors while loading the tape), cannot mark the article as read and present the tape in a different form than the one provided by the site.  For example, there is a desire to remove an article from a tape as read (or obscene) - there are no options.  It is planned to add folding to the existing options to a level similar to the ‚ÄúLive broadcast‚Äù list on the right. <br><br>  * the tape is sorted and transformed by second-generation scripts that grow on the basis of HabrAjax and help the user get more accurately selected articles and give a more flexible assessment (there is no first without the second). <br><br>  * tapes can be from one to several, and where they will be located - the discretion of the user.  For example, on a tight smartphone screen, one tape is placed, and the rest (best, questions, favorites) are rolled up to the buttons lying at the ready.  On a spacious computer screen, there may be a traditional layout with a right column, in which there are 1-2 tapes, or there may be a one-page option.  Everything is controlled by the user.  The development of the engine is our concern, the developers, you are required to design the main element (tape), the current prototype of which can be seen as described above, and Habr√© with <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/1970-habrajax">HabrAjax</a> + <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/36690">ZenComment</a> .  (You can get acquainted with the functions of scripts, screenshots of styles, according to the links, but the main function related to the task is the folding-expanding of loaded articles in the ribbon.) <br><br>  I hope I was able to convey the main ideas of the required design and interface in these 3 points.  We are waiting for proposals from developers, designers and usabilityists.  You can post them on sheets in PNG on any hosting in order to submit your ideas for discussion and evaluation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143759/</a></p>
