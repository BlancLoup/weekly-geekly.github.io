The exact number of records is 10 thousand 200 pieces (!), One can only imagine what kind of work it is.  By the way, the number of bird species that played the role of "voice acting" is 3190 - a very extensive base. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I remember that in my childhood I had a vinyl record with recordings of birds singing in the middle zone of Russia.  It was very interesting to listen to the sounds made by the woodfowl, or the song of the goldfinder, or there is a pichugi pike, the name of which I don‚Äôt remember already.  There were about 20 different voices on the record, and it made an incredible impression.  And here - as many as 10 thousand records, there is something to listen to.

      It is worth noting that scientists did not just add records, indicating the name of the species issuing recorded sounds.  The encyclopedia contains various facts that are important for ornithologists and simply for all curious.  Such parameters as the distance to the bird, the weather, the type of sound emitted by the feathered singer (just an alarm or really singing), plus some other details are indicated. <br><br>  By the way, the author of the development is a woman, a professor of zoology at this university, the name of our professor Pamela Rasmussen.  Many of the records that can be found on the resource are written to her, since the professor traveled a lot around the world.  In addition, there are records received by students or other bird watchers who wish to make their contribution.  The professor explains the difference in the number of recorded sounds and species of birds by the fact that each species has several types of signals and singing - someone just ‚Äúsnares‚Äù when anxious, and at a safe time publishes very melodic singing. <br><br>  In principle, the discrepancy in the number of records and species of birds is clear, there is no need for special explanations here.  Interestingly, however, the fact that the same type of bird, depending on the region of residence, can change the type of signal, a special ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù appears.  This has also been known for a long time (the same roosters in different countries shout not a ‚Äúcrow‚Äù, but they may also be something like a ‚ÄúKikirik‚Äù), but for the first time an uninitiated person can hear all this himself, and not just read in a smart book. <br><br>  Scientists who created this resource, hope that their website will help both professional and ornithologists, as well as all avid fans, and just curious ones. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://avocet.zoology.msu.edu/">msu</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109642/</a></p>
