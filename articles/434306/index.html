No budget</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post is about how, in anticipation of the allocation of money to a new corporate portal, you can pump the current version to a decent state with minimal cost. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/e-/am/pce-amp0r1x60ft12dm-gkqaz9u.jpeg"><br>  Under the cut a bit of personal experience and useful tips.  I will tell about the improvement of usability, the measurement of user experience and what result we got. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  First, a little introductory </h2><br>  It will be about the corporate portal of the Russian industrial concern.  It was developed in 2016 on the Bitrix24 version 2015.  Since then, the platform has not been updated, nothing is known about serious modifications.  There is no documentation from the word at all, the ex-project manager is unavailable.  I have been involved in the project since May 2018. <br><br>  The most popular functions: news feed, contact directory, service desk, file sharing, a page with birthdays, information about the appointments of managers.  Next in the ranking are information pages, a service for automatic filling in documents on forms and another car of all.  There is no mobile version. <br><br>  The project is supported by a new manager (that is, I) and an admin.  There is also an IT company outsourcing, which sometimes helps and does not take money for it, since it works with us on other, larger projects.  But even if they took, we would have definitely met the amount of 50K rubles, because they rarely gave them tasks.

    <h2>  Statistics </h2><br>  I started by analyzing the statistics.  The built-in statistics of the Beatrix sample of 2015 is not very informative and convenient, for some reason we did not approve Google Analytics, but we managed to deliver Yandex.Metrica. <br><br>  Next, I selected for myself the key indicators: visitors, views, visits, refusals, viewing depth, time on the site and attendance of some priority sections.  Elsewhere, the target action of pushing certain buttons was announced.  For more news, look like likes and comments.  This simple set allows in numbers to measure the response to almost any change.  Hurray, now you can not act at random. <br><br><h2>  Menu structure </h2><br>  Previously, it looked like this: there was a starting page, one for several separate divisions.  There were some sections common to all of them and links to mini-portals of divisions.  In this mini-portal there were three more levels of nesting in the menu.  Total up to 4 levels and confusion with what is common, and what to look for in a mini-portal. <br><br>  We decided that it would be better to divide the content between separate divisions at the level of access rights.  Thus, all content was collected on one portal, and mini-portals were removed as unnecessary.  In parallel, the nesting of the menu was reduced to two levels. <br><br>  After that, the percentage of failures rose as expected, by about 2 percentage points relative to the base 6. At the same time, the number of portal users also increased.  People noticed, learned from the newsletter or heard from colleagues that something is changing and began to be interested in the portal.  When everyone got a little used, the percentage of failures returned to previous values ‚Äã‚Äãand headed for a further reduction. <br><br><h2>  <s>This page is under construction.</s> </h2><br>  This was done in parallel with the optimization of the menu. <br><br>  To begin with, blank, irrelevant and unvisited pages have been deleted.  Moreover, this was done without declaring war, secretly (otherwise people would lay down their bones to protect their native pages-corpses).  Some of the remaining obscure pages pooled.  Then, by request of those in need, one page was still returned, nobody even remembered about the others.  The remaining pages are grouped by sense: news and blogs in one section, interactive services in another, info about the company in the third, and so on. <br><br>  Then they asked people who lacked something.  So we had a schedule of corporate buses, a dictionary of abbreviations, a medical center page and much more.  This process should never stop.  I will tell you how I encourage people to share ideas. <br><br>  Further it was necessary only to tell in detail, as where now it is possible to find.  To do this, we prepared an intelligible email-newsletter for all employees on the day of the update. <br><br><h2>  Traffic management </h2><br>  There is always content that needs to be conveyed to everyone, and it‚Äôs not viral.  For example, a new concept of development. <br><br>  We have identified three tools: email-mailing, a banner or a text link in a special block on the main page and news on the portal itself.  By combining these tools depending on the situation, we manage to direct up to 15% of the daily audience to the desired page in a couple of hours.  Then a couple more days on the page there is increased traffic, then attendance is reduced to normal. <br><br>  Unexpectedly, the most effective tool was email-mailing.  True, you need to comply with a couple of conditions: do it no more than once a week, write only on business and in plain language. <br><br>  Of course, we can not forget about the design of the "landing" page.  Graphics pictures and good text written by a professional journalist must have.  Fortunately, we have our own newspaper and the guys from the editorial board are actively helping. <br><br><h2>  On style </h2><br>  All titles, links, images, tables and texts led to a single view.  In the process, checked with the brand book of the company.  As a result, at a glance at the page you can snatch the main points. <br><br>  Still remember that we only have eight seconds to get the attention of the audience? <br><br><h2>  And then it hit me </h2><br>  And what if not all people know how to enter the portal?  Once upon a time, the portal was the start page, then it was abandoned in favor of browser quick access pages.  Now, to enter the portal, you need to type the address or click on the shortcut icon, if you have one. <br><br>  And here we are doing a newsletter in which we talk about a couple of new buns in the form of useful content and how to enter the portal.  We suggested three ways: a shortcut on the desktop, a Home button in the browser and a bookmark, again in the browser.  And suddenly they got + 15% (!) Of traffic, having updated the attendance record. <br><br>  Then, in the course of private conversations, it turned out that many people went to the portal using links in email newsletters.  And when it was necessary to go in and the distribution was not at hand, there was a problem.  A desktop shortcut for many has become a salvation. <br><br><h2>  Feedback </h2><br>  As I said, we are doing emails.  We do it as gently and unobtrusively as possible.  Besides the fact that I talk about new content or functionality, sometimes I do motivational newsletters. <br><br>  For example, I recently talked about a girl who posted her rules and forms on the portal and freed up a lot of time for herself and for those who fill out these forms. <br><br>  One day I collected content that appeared at someone‚Äôs request and sent a newsletter with thanks to these people. <br><br>  So the colleagues were able to see that the portal can really be useful and that if you offer to improve something on the portal, your proposal will be considered.  And everyone sees that the portal is developing, the content on it is relevant and can be trusted. <br><br><h2>  What's this all about </h2><br>  Below is a dry statistic: current values ‚Äã‚Äãof key indicators and in brackets deviations from the starting values. <br><ul><li>  Failure percentage: 4% (-2%); </li><li>  View depth: 6 (not formally changed, but the nesting was reduced by half); </li><li>  Time Online: 8'20 ‚Äù(+ 1 '); </li><li>  Visitors: 2300 unique per day (+ 800); </li><li>  Views: 30,000 per day (+ 8000); </li><li>  Visits: 5200 per day (+1200). </li></ul><br>  Considering that we have practically no entertainment content, it can be assumed that people began to turn to their colleagues less often and more often turn to the portal for help in working questions.  This means that we have saved the employer a certain number of labor hours, and, consequently, money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434306/">https://habr.com/ru/post/434306/</a></p>
