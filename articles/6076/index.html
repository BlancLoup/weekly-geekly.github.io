It's enough.  Electronic brains have already managed to determine at what point of the planet your ass is, they have managed to remember what you usually used to do on the Internet, which pictures and texts you best respond to, and also what you bought from the online store.  With a familiar movement, the machine launches its fiber-optic tentacles into databases - one millisecond stretches like an eternity - and now you have a specially assembled, perfectly personalized page in front of you.  It is only what you may be interested.  Nothing extra.  Your favorite colors, texts on your favorite topics, offers to buy only those products that you need. <br><br>  There is no mysticism.  The monitor is still opaque and myelofon has nothing to do with it.  The Internet is still a show behind the glass, only the audience is now there, and the participants are here.  Just on both sides are robots.  And those on the other side are well able to memorize and analyze everything. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  You say a unique human person?  Forget these tales.  Each robot on the other side, daily watches as tens of millions of visitors buy goods ‚ÄúA‚Äù, prefer texts ‚ÄúB‚Äù and listen to music ‚ÄúC‚Äù.  It is ‚ÄúB‚Äù, not ‚ÄúD‚Äù or ‚ÄúG‚Äù.  Those that listen to "D" and "F" buy completely different products and read completely different literature.  If you are logged in and are interested in the text "B", the robot does not need to think long to offer you the product "A".

      How wise these cars!  Oh yeah.  Only, wisdom has nothing to do with it.  This is an experience.  Look carefully at how ten million people behave and try to find ten differences.  It is unlikely to succeed.  Are you not robots?  That's it!  However, only a car can follow this crowd. <br><br>  You just opened the browser.  So, without a clear goal, for sugrevu sake.  And they already remind you: did you accidentally remember to buy ‚ÄúA‚Äù, read ‚ÄúB‚Äù and listen to ‚ÄúC‚Äù?  And then you realize that yes ... But, damn it, Homs ... Well, it's elementary, Watson.  You are from city N?  Age 25, education 500, and salary 1000?  Every day, millions of your countrymen with the same parameters consume it according to the AB-B scheme. <br><br>  So they now all about us know!  Exactly.  But someone else is fighting for some kind of privacy.  ‚ÄúWe promise not to transfer your personal data to third parties under any circumstances!‚Äù  Baby talk.  You can not say anything.  We already know everything.  Have you heard the word "psycho-targeting"?  Not heard ?!  So much the better - the less you know, the stronger you sleep. <br><br>  The classic cyberpunk plot - the hero suddenly discovers that he is not a man, but a robot.  Nightmare!  Uzhosnakh!  These horror stories of humanity today will not even laugh the baby.  Well, the robot - then what?  This is even for the better.  Do not think, strain.  I came to the store, and you once - and all the goods have already been issued in a package with a red ribbon.  And my wife does not need to bother to write a list of products.  And in general, you can not go to the store - they themselves will bring.  And they may not even bring - everything will come by itself.  By pipeline, right in the fridge.  Only open the door, and there everything is already on the shelves.  You take a jar, calmly, open it, swallow it.  Channels switch is also not necessary.  Lyapota ... Only with horror you remember how the people used to suffer.  Stop stop stop!  You can not be sad, otherwise there may be unpredictable consequences for behavior.  Urgent antidepressant pill.  About "Mood Management" heard?  All the better‚Ä¶ <br><br>  What is the "Matrix" ?!  Who the hell do we need, my God ?!  Long live the brave new world!  The main thing - do not make me think.  Let there be one big red button with the words "PRESS ME!".  Here, if only to read it is not unlearned ... And don't want to force either, please.  You already decide there what your needs will be.  No wonder you are, in fact, taught to marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6076/</a></p>
