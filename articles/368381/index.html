Together with their partner Eric Brilling, they believe that sexbots are harmful and reinforce the inequality that exists in society.  Dr. Richardson calls himself a specialist in roboetics. <br><br>  The movement‚Äôs manifesto states that, according to the protesters, such robots objectify women and children.  Buying sexbot is akin to buying the services of prostitutes, and this phenomenon is just as bad for public relations.  In their opinion, the appearance of such robots will have an even greater effect on reducing the presence of empathy and empathy in a staying society.

      <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34118482">In an interview with the BBC, Richardson reported</a> that such use of new technologies is optional and even undesirable.  At the moment, manufacturers of sex toys approached the creation of dolls with artificial intelligence.  ‚ÄúThe sex bots in the industry are now showing increased attention, and how they are trying to do them - what appearance they are given, what roles they will play - all this is very disturbing.  We think that these robots will have a detrimental effect on relations between men and women, adults and children, men and men, women and women. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to Richardson, such dolls will reinforce stereotypes towards women, which, she believes, are firmly entrenched in society, and look at the relationship between the sexes as meeting purely physical needs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Matt McMullen, the founder of the company for the production of sex dolls <a href="https://www.realdoll.com/">Abyss Creations</a> , considers himself an artist.  He explains that he always admired the beauty of the female body, and this hobby has logically developed into what he does.  His company has long been producing high-quality dolls under the RealDoll brand (the cost of which averages $ 6,000), and now they are just working on a head stuffed with intelligence. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ReMvmC8OXc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgciGDeyYRLqzg2A3WDoZmoaQpaAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://secure.realdoll.com/wp-content/uploads/gallery/boy-toy-doll-star-config-2/bt3_star_config2_6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Abyss Creations Products</i> <br><br>  The director of True Companion, Douglas Heins, advertises his sex-robot <a href="http://www.truecompanion.com/shop/roxxxy-truecompanion-sex-robot/roxxxy/">Roxxxy</a> , who already knows how to keep up the conversation.  Its cost is $ 7,000.  He is confident that such a product is highly in demand.  ‚ÄúWe are not trying to oust the wife or replace a girlfriend,‚Äù he explains.  - Our product is useful to those who may be in the ‚Äúbetween‚Äù relationship at the moment, or have recently lost a spouse.  People can find happiness without communicating with each other. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the future, True Companion want to create a self-learning model that can more meaningfully talk with the owner and learn his wishes and preferences.  ‚ÄúIn this case, physical closeness with the robot will take less time than communication,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Dr. Kevin Curran of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, an international non-profit association of experts in the field of technology, is confident that it would be naive to ignore the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/robohunter/blog/259922/">existence of a mass market for "sex robots</a> ."  He says that making such robots is pretty simple.  At the same time, we should expect public condemnation, and perhaps no less hot, than speeches against military robots capable of killing people. <br><br>  David Levy, author of the book ‚Äú <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Love-Sex-Robots-Human-Robot-Relationships/dp/0061359807/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1442421731%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3DLove%2Band%2BSex%2Bwith%2BRobots">Love and Sex with Robots</a> ‚Äù, is sure that the onset of times when intimate relationships between people and robots will become commonplace is inevitable.  He gives on it years 30-35.  ‚ÄúThe number of people who find it difficult to build relationships is constantly increasing.  This will fill the resulting void.  And it humiliates women no more than vibrators. ‚Äù  He believes that as technology becomes more complex, relationships with robots can become richer. <br><br>  However, he is confident that modern society is not ready to accept advanced robots.  How will robots be perceived that cannot be distinguished from humans at first glance?  Will they be able to marry or to raise children?  Such questions will have to be answered sooner or later. <br><br>  In the UK, there is traditionally a negative attitude towards pornography on the Internet, mainly because of the fact that it can be accessed by children.  For a long time, the public has been demanding that the government take prohibitive measures in this regard.  The government promises to <a href="http://www.medikforum.ru/news/health/healthy_child/23022-britaniya-vvodit-zapret-na-porno-v-internete.html">ban porn</a> altogether, it wants to make sites <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/248628/">check the age of users</a> , but it hasn‚Äôt finally decided on this issue yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368381/</a></p>
