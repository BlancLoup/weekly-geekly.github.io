    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. The Death Star - mega joke collected ¬£ 243,940 and continues.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58b/721/f65/58b721f658070bd12c69c05392d3a1bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is clear that the goal of 20 million pounds will not be achieved, but this news spread all over the media.  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461687407/kickstarter-open-source-death-star%3Fref%3Dlive">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>2. The answer of the Alliance - collected $ 248,014 and continues.</b>  But not as honest as the Death Star - the guys were training at the school of Jedi-moneybags.  Those.  a Jedi needs 10,000 dollars to become a Jedi.  There are already 20 of them.  And there will be more - because  money is written off only when the project is successful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/157/67b/52f/15767b52fcdfa1a53c55ca91d1791bc5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Their target of $ 11 million is also very far away.  <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simonkwan/crowdfunding-rebel-alliance-x-wing-squadron%3Fref%3Dlive">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  I don‚Äôt even want to set aside separately a miserable attempt to collect $ 20 million from <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1337941715/x-wing-clone">X-Wing Clone</a> - some 6 unknowns (statistics on backers are visible when there are more than 10) donated $ 8,385 to the original project. <br><br>  Do not participate in star wars ... <br><br>  <b>3. Oyster Pillow - collected $ 195,094 with the support of 1,846 people.</b>  Yes, it can not be considered foolish, but you will look foolish in this pillow.  But who cares when you want to sleep?  Like it or not, but something slightly, a little bit, a little bit wacky is there ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af0/7d0/395/af07d0395de0c3c4fc96da3576abd9e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I very much doubt or you can relax in such a pillow in the workplace, but at the airport - completely.  <a href="http://kck.st/OaaYAu">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>4. Robocop Statue in Detroit - collected $ 67,436 with the support of 2,718 people.</b>  Detroit is such a place that only a statue of Robocop can regain its former glory.  The film, however, was awesome and you can dive into it for 10 minutes under a completely decent replica of the plot, watching the video of the project.  He looked through to the end (he could not tear himself away), he remembered his childhood, ex, would have passed 10 bucks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c4/bac/32e/4c4bac32e2521b0cde7429de3b158266.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The guys collected the required 50.000 dollars and the creation of the statue is in full swing!  <a href="http://kck.st/eABFrd">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>5. Grizzly Cloak - collected $ 29,015 with the support of 180 people in need of this non-trivial thing.</b>  Absolutely practical outfit combines a warm hat, warm gloves and a soft warm, fluffy raincoat.  This miracle could be born only in New York :) You can have it for 250 bucks.  White limited edition collection (Polar Bear Edition) comes from $ 300 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f41/385/d87/f41385d87292266b571bf8a36ca5760a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the author of the project: This is not a costume.  This is a lifestyle. <br>  Stirs  I think at the airport it is even more fun to sleep in it than in an oyster pillow. <br>  <a href="http://kck.st/HVW86G">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>6. The newest, most fascinating game, originally from the Stone Age - collected $ 5,145 from $ 2,407 needed.</b>  <b>69 lovers have played to play.</b>  As you can see, the author of the project has everything counted and $ 2,400 would not be enough for him, but $ 2,450 is clearly too much.  A character named Buck invites you to have fun by placing a pebble on a pebble. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f8e/0fe/4d3/f8e0fe4d390491676d9bf4eae92a2693.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/ky4iMA">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>7. The Death Star - monster-mobile - collected $ 4,550 out of $ 2,450 needed.</b>  <b>93 people skipped.</b>  Here people are not wise $ 2450 - a normal amount.  The car was built and this is what happened: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1b/ec5/c67/a1bec5c67a98292e23d8d1e5f6b6a95f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/dmrMQj">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>8. The world's largest SUSPENZORIA - collected $ 854.</b>  <b>It needed 11 people.</b>  Yes, suspensor - Jockstrap is a special support bandage for the scrotum organs (c). A popular medical encyclopedia.  It is difficult to comment on something here, but it is worth expecting that soon someone will try to break the record and make an even bigger suspension ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3e/12c/df2/d3e12cdf2ac44ff0f2b077984153c20a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/sW3L4U">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  <b>9. Battle of the Hipsters - card game.</b>  <b>Money donated $ 195.</b>  <b>12 people ordered the game itself and another 1 gave 5 bucks for trying.</b>  It is difficult to beat one card with tight jeans with another such card only if you have black plastic glasses.  The winner is determined by seven rounds of card exchange.  Links to profiles supported by you can be found in the tab "backers" of this project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e7/9e8/681/8e79e868177bce0081b1d1d2bedfa776.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/Ht2Ghh">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  The theme of board games will not be fully disclosed without mention of the chic realistic board game ‚ÄúAGAIN ALONE (A)‚Äù.  Project author Ken Kupnik announces the creation of the world's first truly realistic date game.  That only cost game characters called "KATIE THE ALCOHOLIC STRIPPER" and game trick "COCK-BLOCK".  Yes - the project has a video and everything is explained there.  <a href="http://kck.st/c848Wc">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  2 people bought one game each and one bought two at once!  120 bucks collected from the required 15 thousand.  The world will not see this miracle. <br><br>  In principle, this Ken is another project created <a href="http://kck.st/dLwiLP">COCK-BLOCK</a> which also did not go. <br><br>  <b>10. TAILTUX ... Stylish men's shirt ... In general, "bodykit" for uncles.</b>  <b>Two uncles surrendered 28 bucks.</b> <br>  This project has collected little money, but by originality it is worthy of the 1st place.  All the best - for dessert. <br><br>  Here you play golf and your t-shirt constantly gets out of shorts, pants or whatever is on you.  Well, you need to solve this problem fundamentally, to create a new market - to make T-shirts immediately made with shorts.  I did not appreciate the genius of the market Robert ... <br><br>  And Robert is an ordinary guy, a golf instructor, invested in money, made prototypes, made a video ... The website did! <br><br>  Dear site need to say.  His wife is definitely not - she would have killed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/494/639/700/49463970012d91f484d9358c4743723f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/WMLKWn">Link to the project.</a> <br><br>  What else awaits us when Kick Starter becomes international! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169313/</a></p>
