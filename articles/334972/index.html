In other words, having found out ‚ÄúWHAT TO DO‚Äù, now we will define ‚ÄúHOW TO DO‚Äù and thus we will come one step closer to our goal. <br><br>  To determine the composition of these works, let us take as a basis the theses that we identified and recorded in the final of each section.  Since I am a specialist in system analysis, I will consider the methods that I use in my professional activities.  Perhaps experts in the field of psychology, psychoanalysis, management, ethics, etc.  can supplement this section with techniques from their practices.

    <h3>  1. Detailing complex phenomena and events </h3><br>  This technique is called Decomposition.  Well, to be precise, there is also the reverse Abstraction method.  That is, the Decomposition decomposes complex things into simpler components, while Abstraction, on the contrary, discards all unnecessary details and leaves only the most important for consideration. <br><br>  Detailing can be carried out multi-level - layer by layer, step by step, decomposing the elements into components, which in turn can themselves be dissected into parts.  Therefore, it is necessary to restrain oneself, being aware of the level below which it does not make sense to fall into decomposition, and sometimes even harmful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, if you are considering the option of changing jobs, then just looking at a dozen ads, it‚Äôs hard to say at once which choice will connect you to an interesting occupation in all respects, and which one will doom to torture a disgruntled job.  In order not to make a fatal mistake, let's specify the concept of "New Work", putting it in your expectations.  For example, as shown in the figure below.  At the first level, we have identified 3 main areas that can influence the choice: Remuneration, Communication, and Comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7ca/d3f/4dd/7cad3f4dd43748859d4efa003178d90f.jpg">  <i>Figure 1 - Example of detail</i> <br><br>  Then each of them laid out into even smaller parts.  And then them into even smaller ones ... We could also put our wishes for ‚ÄúNutrition‚Äù into more detailed whims, for example: ‚ÄúFree lunches‚Äù, ‚ÄúCoffee, cookies‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiscount in a restaurant‚Äù.  But such details most likely will only interfere with the decision-making on the choice of work - the eyes will run, and the most important thing is not to fill the stomach at work.  Here, as if by chance, we touched upon a very important clarification ‚Äúthe most (not the most) main thing‚Äù, that is, the weight of the assessment.  Being in different situations, a person can assess the importance of each component in different ways when choosing.  For example, when I'm in a crisis of 2008-2009.  I sat for several months in a strange and very expensive city in a rental housing without income, I was ready to go to any job where they would pay at least some money to cover my expenses.  But when I worked for several years in a very tense schedule and saved some money to relax, the quality level of communication began to play a big role for me in my job search ‚Äî that is, how professional, rational, and interesting was the teamwork in the enterprise. <br><br>  Naturally there are professional techniques that provide the ability to build models step by step, decomposing complex elements into its component parts.  Moreover, they allow us not to invent components at random, as we did in the example above, but to identify them on the basis of information about the processes taking place.  But acquaintance with these tools is not included in our plans now. <br><br><h3>  2. Identify points of view </h3><br>  When a person solves only his own problems, which are not related at all to other people (if that is possible at all), he can calmly evaluate them right on the spot, without departing from his point of view.  Of course, it is better to use someone else's experience, to know solutions to a problem, but a verdict must be made solely on the basis of your own interests.  But if other people, groups of people, huge groups or even the whole of humanity are involved in the case, then a much larger number of opinions and views should be taken into account.  It also happens that you have to solve problems not of your own, but of completely different people and, accordingly, you have to mentally abstract away from yourself and pretend for a while - by that other person.  Let's see how best to do this in practice. <br><br>  The paradigm of world perception often overlaps with the laws of geometry.  For example, in the fact that: "The wider the angle of view, the dumber it is."  Continuing such comparisons, it can be argued that the more points of view, the more accurate the contours of the problem can be outlined. <br><br>  The ordinary man in the street often considers only one point of view - his own.  We set ourselves the goal of learning to interact effectively with people, so we need to be able to put ourselves in ‚Äúsomeone else's place‚Äù and look at the problem from the outside.  The easiest way to do this is to simply collect the opinions of different respondents on the issue at hand.  For example, find the right group in social networks and discuss an exciting topic there.  You can also search online articles, abstracts, etc. <br><br>  For example, I opened the first page that appeared in the ‚Äúsearch engine‚Äù for the query ‚Äúselection of work criteria‚Äù and found an article: ‚ÄúA dream job and how to get it‚Äù <a href="http://rabota-of-dream.livejournal.com/28957.html">rabota-of-dream.livejournal.com/28957.html</a> .  It presents the results of a survey of opinions.  The fact that it was possible to emphasize from it was listed in the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c6a/20b/f3f/c6a20bf3f91349b4a49aea6a0869c726.jpg"><br><br>  We collected some opinions, but what next?  How to divide them into points of view. <br><br>  Remember that during the initial collection of information, we paid special attention to social filters that refract the worldview of people.  So this is the point of view and the main feature that we can use at our discretion.  That is, first of all, it is necessary to divide the collected opinions on points of view (the formed opinions of various social groups).  Secondly, choose the ones that we can use in this situation.  But more about that further. <br><br><h3>  3. Analysis of objectivity of points of view </h3><br>  Having gathered a sufficient number of subjective opinions, we will try according to the recipe of a well-known super agent: mix them up without shaking, thus obtaining an objective opinion. <br><br>  Since we have chosen a benchmark for determining the point of view - social filters, we will use them again, but this time to select those opinions that will become suitable for our use.  For example, to preach ideas in a team that are completely rejected by them is not a thankful matter, in most cases, a failure and even unsafe. <br><br>  These plans immediately otkilin from consideration, going on about the crowd and guided by the instinct of self-preservation.  But those opinions that have a certain percentage of support or sympathy, you can operate.  They will be objective for this electorate. <br><br>  The ratio of the level of support of a particular point of view in a community may change under the influence of interested parties.  But it requires some effort and cost.  Considering all the above, we will add additional columns to our table: ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù - a definite point of view and ‚ÄúWeight for me‚Äù - the importance of this indicator from my point of view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ab5/f73/423/ab5f73423cd244fb8b55c742845e2db1.jpg"><br><br>  Once again I want to draw attention to the importance of ascertaining the reasons why people accepted precisely this or that point of view.  After all, it depends on the degree of motivation whether a person can change his point of view for another and, if so, how difficult it is to do.  And perhaps this motivation will even be enough for you to change your own, different from this point of view.  These little things can save a lot of your time and nerves. <br><br><h3>  4. Develop a compelling case for communication </h3><br>  In this section, we will NOT touch the talent of persuasion close to suggestion, but talk about the ability to prepare convincing arguments and detailed explanations to provide the necessary information that pushes people to make a conscious choice, and sometimes just useful for you.  In other words, now we are not looking at the influence of someone else‚Äôs world view on us, but on the contrary imposing on others our point of view or the one we are promoting. <br><br>  The main techniques we discussed above.  The first important method is the division of complex phenomena and events into clusters of simpler components.  The second point is the determination of the weight of each part, which has an important influence on the choice of a common solution.  The third means is the selection and adjustment or formation of the necessary point of view. <br><br>  This technique, in continuation of our job search example, can be used when a potential employer has finally become interested in you and invited you for an interview.  You must provide him with so strong arguments that it is you, and not the guy who was selected along with you for the interview, should take the vacant place. <br>  To pick up these very arguments, think as a potential employer, become them for a while. <br><br>  How to do it?  Well, firstly, analyze the text of the vacancy itself, and secondly, all the same well of information - the Internet.  So, we will become an employer for a while and fix what we may be interested in? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/140/de8/fbc/140de8fbce154a66b2f389108403d4f6.jpg"><br><br>  This table is filled with values, depending on the specific vacancy: Organization, position, immediate supervisor, etc.  You can collect the necessary information again via the Internet by reading reviews about the organization of its employees - existing or failed.  If possible, it is better to communicate with them personally.  For example, find out information from an employee who invited you for an interview.  Based on this insider information, you can add a table. <br><br>  In this way, we get the organization‚Äôs point of view about the ideal employee it is looking for.  Next thing is a technique: just (or not) prepare your answers to questions that will most closely correspond to this point of view. <br><br>  In accordance with this, you can adjust your own resume.  Remove all the excess and pull out what the employer expects to get. <br><br><h3>  5. Analysis of events and phenomena in dynamics </h3><br>  So far, we have considered only static characteristics of phenomena: Importance, Composition, Expectations, etc., that is, as if snapshots of what is happening around.  But the realities, more often than not, have one very inconvenient property for analysis - to change all the time, like frames in newsreels.  And, moreover, depending on the order of change of competing actions, the option of further developments and the composition of phenomena may depend.  ‚ÄúAs soon as you have all the cards in your hands, life begins to play chess with you.‚Äù  When the object of analysis is complex and consists of many changing parts, it is difficult to remember in the memory the possible options for their mutual influence, unless of course you are not a grandmaster.  But to deal with this complexity is also possible.  And for this, too, there are professional modeling tools.  We are in this article will consider a relatively simple way - the preparation of special tables. <br><br>  The first thing we need to fix for ourselves is the significant events that may result in changes that are important to us.  For example, in the case of choosing a job: ‚Äúsent a resume‚Äù, ‚Äúreceived an invitation‚Äù, ‚Äúcame to an interview‚Äù, etc. <br>  The next essential link for analysis is the state preceding the event that caused the changes.  This is important to take into account, because depending on this pre-state, different reactions to the event itself are possible.  For example, after receiving an invitation for an interview, the condition of the applicant will be very important - whether his knowledge and skills match the vacancy or not. <br><br>  And finally, let's add another column to the table - ‚ÄúTransition condition‚Äù to a new state, that is, we will determine under what conditions this event will lead to different results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/464/5f7/833/4645f7833aca48c7a7371be402fa84b9.jpg"><br><br>  Drawing up such tables can be a great help, for example, for the process of obtaining any permission or approval in the bureaucratic apparatus.  When the further chain of the fascinating quest depends on the status of the collected documents and the conditions of their sighting. <br><br><h3>  6. Relationship Design Techniques </h3><br>  In human relationships, many aspects are predetermined in advance.  For example: character, habits, the difference in social status of communicating, etc.  It is the inevitability that exists and which must be reckoned with.  This is manifested, for example, in the concealment of information or its distortion.  In order to resist the negative influence of the subjective qualities of people, and even better to use them for their own purposes, it is advisable to understand the reasons that impede fruitful communication.  Here are some of the common motives: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ impact on the worldview of stereotypes of thinking; <br>  ‚Ä¢ compliance with real or imaginary pressure of the opponent; <br>  ‚Ä¢ inclination to support socially approved opinions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the inability to clearly understand their own opinions, attitudes and attitudes; <br>  ‚Ä¢ antipathy to the opponent; <br>  ‚Ä¢ doubts about maintaining the confidentiality of communication: <br>  ‚Ä¢ involuntary memory errors. <br><br>  For example, sometimes it happens that when discussing a problem, you feel that the interlocutor had an indelible impression of a peep from him somewhere before.  It is so deeply deposited in his mind that in a conversation with you, a person does not tell about what he really needs and cares about in a given situation, but fantasizes about "the subject of what he saw."  In such situations you should not clash or put pressure on the person, most often this leads to the opposite effect.  In such cases, you can effectively apply one of the techniques described below. <br><br>  For the interlocutor with "abstract fantasies", you can use the "Ladders" method.  The purpose of this method is to establish a causal relationship between the desires of the interlocutor and the benefits that he really wants to receive in its implementation.  You must formulate the questions in such a way that the chain is built up from the specific desire of the person, to the promising benefits of his realization.  The main questions are: ‚ÄúWhy it matters to you‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat it means to you.‚Äù  Of the leading questions is built "ladder" to the really necessary solution. <br><br>  Another effective technique is Projective Techniques.  They are used when it is necessary to answer the questions: why certain solutions are important to a person.  By asking questions to a negatively-minded interlocutor directly, there is a greater likelihood of receiving false information.  And it also happens that the real state of things is not realized by man, since it is hidden from his consciousness with the help of psychological defense.  Projective techniques allow you to "deceive" the human mind and circumvent psychological barriers.  Thus - we can find out the real attitude of the interlocutor to the problem under discussion. <br><br>  In practice, you can use the following basic types of projective techniques: <br>  Associative.  The interlocutor is encouraged to say, write, or select from the previously prepared options what he associates with the problem being discussed.  For this method, it is convenient to use the technique of comparing the proposed solution to problems with similar solutions successfully applied in practice. <br><br>  At the end of the job.  The interlocutor is asked to complete unfinished ‚Äúincentives‚Äù, for example, add a sentence or choose from several options. <br><br>  Constructive  The interlocutor is provided with scenarios of actions in which any situations are displayed and asked to tell about what the participants of these scenarios can think and feel, as well as what could have happened to them before and after the end of the situations in question. <br><br>  Another option is to put the interlocutor in "someone else's place."  To do this, you can prepare questions that begin with some statement, allegedly expressed by another person.  Next, the interlocutor is asked to explain the reasons why the ‚Äúsubstitutable‚Äù has expressed such a point of view and to formulate his own vision of the issue. <br><br>  Ranging.  The technique has many modifications.  For example, the interlocutor is given lists of aspects of the problem under discussion and is asked to select those of them that most appeal to him.  Or they are asked to rank the characteristics by some attribute (for example, by the degree of importance). <br><br>  In projective techniques, the most important thing is to understand the difference between what a person said and what he had in mind.  To do this, you need to constantly ask the interlocutor to explain their actions or words.  The main question in this case is ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, one should pay particular attention to the subjective qualities of a person, as potential causes of all kinds of distortions in the information provided to them.  In this case, you will be greatly helped by the development of your own insight and communication skills.  Of particular importance when using such techniques is: the level of your moral and ethical qualities, restraint and patience, general erudition, disposing manners and appearance. <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  It so happened that this (third part) was published later than the previous ones and I have the opportunity in it to answer questions and comments from readers, and also to make some explanations regarding the article as a whole. <br><br>  This article is written in this style in order to popularize systems thinking in everyday life, in everyday life.  It deliberately does not provide definitions and references to sources of information in order to give the written style of narration, and not the scientific manuals. <br><br>  I tried to simplify the presentation of the material as much as possible in order to expand the circle of readers.  Perhaps in some places it looked vulgar, excuse me please. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334972/</a></p>
