Practice shows that money always seems to be little, and the beginning of ‚Äúliving for pleasure‚Äù is constantly being postponed.  Boring dull work and remains the main occupation until the end of life. <br><br>  At the same time, people forget that the opportunity to go to the heat, work on interesting projects, do what they love is at their fingertips.  And you just need to pull yourself together and allow yourself to do it.  I'll tell you how it turns out with us. <br><br>  For the second year, my friends and I travel around South-East Asia (SEA).  Unlike most tourists, we not only lie on the beach and watch local sights, but also work productively every day.  Thus, our "vacation" turns into a constant journey to the places where we want to live and work. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5c04297e/5bd445e3/5945cde9/efbfd0fe.jpg" align="right">  My work day is as follows.  I wake up at 11 in the morning, check my mail.  Half an hour later, on a bike, I reached the local Vietnamese cafe.  Freshly squeezed pineapple juice, crab soup, rice with seafood - in the amount of about 110-130 rubles.  The next item is kitesurfing, which I got hooked this year.  We call home for the search and after 15 minutes we are on the beach with a great wind.  We ride for 2-3 hours until we get tired or until the sun sets.  Come home, make some coffee and sit down for laptops.  We have already 5 pm, and in Moscow only 12 am - the working day is in full swing! <br><br>  Every month we change our country of residence, as in most of them without any problems to get a visa for 1 month.  We already lived in India (Goa), Indonesia (Bali), Vietnam (Mui Ne), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Singapore and Thailand (Hua Hin). <br><br><h4>  If you live in Asia, how to make money? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/04b61b92/e7e6237a/0181e42c/6f0ac117.jpg" align="right">  <b>1. Remote work in Russia.</b>  This is the easiest way for most Habr's readers.  Find a remote in the amount of 30 thousand / month does not seem to be a problem for any web specialist.  If you have problems with this - go to Moscow and work for a year in a company that will be ready to let you go to distant work after a certain time. <br><br>  <b>2. Own business in Russia.</b>  This is a more complicated path that can also be realized.  We opened our <a href="http://hanuman.ru/">yoga shop goods Hanuman.ru</a> .  The company was initially created as autonomously working remotely as possible; all employees are located in different cities; there was no office and no plans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/06e93aae/61a42325/73530dcf/4e648d69.jpg" align="right">  <b>3. Work in Asia.</b>  An unlikely scenario for a simple reason.  Remuneration in Asia is significantly lower than Russian standards, because you simply do not want to work for that kind of money.  It is because of the difference in the cost of living that it is so profitable to ‚Äúwork there and spend it here.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>4. Own business in Asia.</b>  For the traveler, this option is not suitable, but many settle for a long time, opening their restaurants, kite schools, travel agencies, hotels.  The Russian tourist for the most part does not speak English at all, demanding service in Russian, Russian dishes in restaurants, etc.  Most recently, we were offered a ‚Äújob‚Äù in the SPA-salon: meet-see off Russian tourists in exchange for accommodation and food.  There are plenty of options, and if you have brains and start-up capital, you will find an opportunity to make money in Asia. <br><br>  <b>5. Worked, saved, went to travel.</b>  Quite a common scenario among those who are a good specialist, but because of the specifics of their work, is not able to work remotely.  The year is divided into two parts - in the first you work a lot and earn a lot, putting it on your trip.  The second part of the year goes on a journey, you just forget about work.  Depending on the ability to make money and the needs for their spending, the amount of rest per year is determined (I met 2-6 months). <br><br><h4>  Like in Asia with the internet? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e1f60ac2/6a1502ae/95700aae/ac973757.jpg" align="right">  To get started, check out the excellent <a href="http://www.sansara.net.ua/travels/advices/internet.html">tablet from oxanna</a> , which blog is recommended for all travelers in Southeast Asia.  We found fast internet in all the places where we were.  By fast internet, I mean ADSL at 512+ kbps.  Somewhere it was very difficult to find (Bali), somewhere very simple (Thailand). <br><br><h4>  Diseases / robberies / other fawn </h4><br>  For reasons unknown to me, the countries of Southeast Asia are presented to the Russian people as the source of all ills.  This is not true.  Life here is full of pleasure and adventure.  People are friendly, benevolent and respectful, on the street you will not find a single "brick face", so popular in Russia.  From serious diseases can be protected by vaccinations, also helps medical insurance.  Food here is an order of magnitude better than the Russian, since most of the products are very fresh, grown not far from the place of residence.  Fresh air, fruits, juices will make you a ruddy youngster, this is especially noticeable against the background of the "newly arrived" green and blue people from Russia. <br><br><h4>  How much money do you need per month? </h4><br>  In the last trip, our budget per person was as follows: <br>  - 10.000 rubles for accommodation (rent a house / guesthouse) <br>  - 10.000 rubles for food (we prepare ourselves or cheap local cafes) <br>  - 10,000 rubles for flights (you can save money if you stick in one place for a long time) <br><br>  You can live on a significantly smaller budget of 15-20 thousand per month, but for this you will have to deny yourself certain pleasures.  All that is higher than the budget of 30 thousand per month you will spend on entertainment and pleasure like a jeep safari on the dunes, lobsters in restaurants and paragliding. <br><br><h4>  How to get cheap? </h4><br>  This time we got to Vietnam for $ 350 per person one way, but you can and even cheaper.  The region of Southeast Asia is a favorite place for Russian tourists (warm and cheap).  Therefore, many regular flights and charters fly here.  Travel companies buy ‚Äúblocks of places‚Äù in advance, and tourists often refuse tours.  So there are various "last minute".  2 sites will help you: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tourdom.ru/birga/go2/">Exchange Turdom</a> .  Tour operators here merge their ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù.  We choose the direction (for example, "Phuket") and ring up the company.  A day or two before departure, you can buy a one-way ticket to Thailand for a ridiculous $ 150-200. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.allcharter.ru/">All charters</a> .  Here you can find information on all the companies that carry charters.  In case there are no offers on the Stock Exchange Turdom, you can call this list. <br><br><h4>  What fun? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/76e9bd3f/9bcca815/6c272927/08aed534.jpg" align="right">  <b>1. Water sports: kitesurfing, windsurfing, surfing.</b>  We ride every day when the wind blows, and it blows here often.  This is the most accessible form of water sports, you can learn to drive for a few weeks, a set of new equipment costs $ 2000, takes up little space, weighs about 20 kg, fits on a bike (you can carry yourself). <br><br>  <b>2. New countries, cities, new cultures.</b>  Life in Asia is very different from life in Russia, so even a simple lunch in a cafe with unknown dishes can give you emotions for the whole day ahead. <br><br>  <b>3. Interesting people.</b>  Not everyone can afford to travel.  As a rule, they are successful independent people from various countries.  Someone winters in the warmth and "sick" surfing, someone spends his many months of vacation in search of new impressions, someone lives on a permanent basis, gradually turning into an aborigine.  Each new acquaintance will tell about his world, in which you will be interested to look. <br><br>  Hello from Vietnam!  See you in Asia!
