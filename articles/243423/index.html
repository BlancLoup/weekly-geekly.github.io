    <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúThe IBM Global Entrepreneur Program for Cloud Startups offers the most comprehensive set of resources for innovative cloud computing,‚Äù commented Promod Haq, managing partner of Norwest Ventures.  ‚ÄúBy providing access to a growing portfolio of third-party solutions and cloud services based on open APIs, IBM provides startups with the ability to deploy and monetize solutions as soon as possible.  And, most importantly, this program can help entrepreneurs accelerate the process of bringing cloud applications to the market. ‚Äù <br><br>  Thanks to participation in the program, startups that meet the selection criteria will be able to use the resources of the IBM Cloud platform in the amount of up to $ 120,000.  The IBM Cloud will provide entrepreneurs with infrastructure opportunities to rapidly deploy a business and allocate resources to further develop, scale, and bring solutions to market.  The program will also provide entrepreneurs with access to IBM's global customer base, many of which are working with the startup community to find new approaches to solving industry problems. <br><br>  As part of the program, entrepreneurs will have access to the IBM Cloud integrated portfolio built on the basis of the IBM SoftLayer cloud infrastructure.  The comprehensive portfolio includes the Bluemix cloud platform for building applications, which offers more than 75 application and service execution environments.  These services will help startups handle the growing volumes of big data generated by mobile and social networks, as well as user devices, sensors and sensors.  Bluemix also includes a wide range of services for developing innovative cloud applications: <br><ul><li>  Integration with Twitter to collect and analyze data from social networks; </li><li>  Aspera tooling for high-speed data transfer; </li><li>  Services monitoring the current status and performance of applications; </li><li>  High-performance and flexible database as a service from Cloudant. </li></ul><br><br>  Startups can apply for participation in the program <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/info/ecod/cloudoffer/startup.html">on the IBM website</a> . <br>  ‚ÄúNow we are starting to select a new generation of start-ups for the further development of these projects.  Programs such as the IBM Global Entrepreneur Program for Cloud Startups are very important because they help in the process of creating a strong community of promising innovators, ‚Äùsaid Gabriella Draeny, co-founder and CEO of Tech Wildcatters, a seed pool and technology incubator for young entrepreneurs in the B2B segment.  ‚ÄúIBM provides startups with the necessary solutions, as well as helping to build business connections, and we are pleased with our cooperation, which helps develop the best ideas for further transformation of industries and entire markets.‚Äù <br><br>  IBM will provide technology start-ups with the opportunity to establish the necessary connections and partnerships that are critical in the early stages of enterprise development by holding individual and informal meetings with entrepreneurs.  In parallel with the development and scaling of solutions, startups will also receive technical and consulting support through a global network of 40 IBM innovation centers, a new incubator located in Silicon Alley, New York, and the Bluemix Garage in San Francisco. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIBM is the only major technology firm that offers personal contact and direct cooperation with other enterprises, as well as various mentor programs.  These factors are especially important for companies that are at an early stage of development, says Robin Hrasnig, CEO of Diabetizer, a European startup and IBM partner.  The company has received recognition from WHO for its innovative healthcare application.  ‚ÄúSimultaneously with the application development process, which, with the help of cognitive computing and cloud technologies, allows diabetics to perform treatment with maximum accuracy and flexibility, we are increasingly turning to such partnerships in order to promote our approach to working with big data in various industries.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Startups are turning to IBM in search of cloud innovation. </h3><br><br>  The cloud, as one of the key transformative technologies of the decade, is transforming ways to use big data, mobile and other technologies to develop a wide range of products, ranging from interactive mobile applications to biomedical devices.  By 2016, more than a quarter of all applications, which is about 48 million, will be available in the cloud, and today 85% of new software can function in a cloud environment (source: Global Technology Outlook and IDC). <br><br>  "The IBM Bluemix platform offer is an important first step in integrating startups into cloud infrastructure," said Brad Hanstable, CEO and founder of Ustream, a San Francisco-based startup that offers video hosting services for more than 80 million users.  ‚ÄúThanks to Bluemix, Ustream allows developers to easily upload large video streams to their applications.  We look forward to working with IBM, and we are eager to start working together in the field of innovation with new leaders in the technology sector, which will emerge as a result of partnership with the IBM Cloud. <br><br>  Startup Grid Mobile, a mobile software developer based in Grand Central Tech in New York, is collaborating with IBM to introduce new technology tools and to find new contacts for business development.  Using IBM's resources, the founders of Grid Mobile plan to turn the mobile service into a secure and fully integrated communication platform. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWith the expansion of the range of services and opportunities, as well as an increase in the number of partners using the IBM Cloud, our cloud is becoming more accessible to startups around the world.  This is crucial to accelerating the innovation process in many industries, from health to banking, ‚Äùsaid Sandy Carter, general director of ecosystem development at IBM.  ‚ÄúWith cloud technology, the technology sector‚Äôs ability to work with big data, analytics, and cognitive computing is endless, and helping to bring such ideas to the forefront will solve some of the most difficult problems facing businesses today.‚Äù <br><br>  For more information about the IBM Global Entrepreneur Program for Cloud Startups, as well as the application form, please <a href="http://ibm.biz/CloudStartup">click here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243423/</a></p>
