To answer them, we have prepared a detailed preview on the basis of a test instance of Z2, which we invite you to familiarize yourself with immediately! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a6/a31/4a2/7a6a314a26b48d2e61c320f634d2a0e0.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Appearance</b> <br><br>  At first glance, this is all the same Z1, they are striking the eye, except that the markedly reduced frames around the screen and the increased diagonal of him.  The side panels are now covered with soft touch dusting, and the connectors for the SIM and USB cable connections are now hidden by one common plug.  Well, the hole for hanging the jewelry has moved to the lower right corner.  The factory film has disappeared from the glasses, since the glass itself is now more resistant to scratches.  However, no one forbids to stick the film yourself. <br>  Compared to the Z1, the phone is a little longer, but thinner and lighter.  It fits very well in the hand, fits in an average pocket and does not cause any inconvenience there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/409/849/23040984948022a8d7d3215ac5089e82.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/b81/b32/cfdb81b32deb737b77769c3af1ed719e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a7/094/718/7a709471886fe310cf2f53ff344353d7.jpg"><br><br>  Together with Z2, transformer covers made of eco-leather returned to production, one of which you can see in the photos.  In the unfolded form, it allows you to conveniently place the phone on a table or any horizontal surface, for example, when watching a movie on an airplane. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01c/7cf/f41/01c7cff41494f52fb1b7b9168c46ab4e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7df/75a/97c/7df75a97cae71936757dbf1a3350ca31.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The camera module itself remains the same, but the increased performance has allowed certain improvements to be made in its software part.  The image compression algorithm has been changed, so now they weigh a little more, but they become clearer.  The number of graphic effects has grown, the most interesting of which can be called a very reliable imitation of the background blur, characteristic of DSLRs.  In this mode, two frames are made that are superimposed on each other, after which you can choose the degree and type of blur, for example - to simulate shooting in motion (motion blur). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/917/3d5/e04/9173d5e04562f57eff6cadea2bdd5d2a.png"><br><br>  There was an option that allows you to shoot video with a resolution of 4K, it can also be played on the corresponding TV directly from your smartphone.  In Slow Motion mode, you can shoot videos with a frequency of 120 frames, after selecting an unlimited number of sections that you want to slow down in the final clip.  In addition, you can now use real-time filters and the effect of augmented reality, both with animation and without brakes, during video recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/b78/a11/df4b78a116160f254bcebf24a6f3c8a3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/767/31a/bc6/76731abc6e2e587a9b1cc88b966d2567.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  Here we have a long-awaited IPS-matrix with Live Color LED technology, which consists in adding phosphorus to the red and green LEDs (but the blue ones, in order to avoid overexposure, characteristic of many displays, are made in the traditional way).  In practice, this gives an extremely bright and rich picture with coverage of 132% of the RGB spectrum.  The Xperia Z1 Compact has decided all the complaints about viewing angles, and the Z2 reinforces this success - the image doesn‚Äôt lose its contrast and saturation at almost any incline, well, maybe around 80 degrees, but the associated glare plays a role here.  Among other things, the screen has grown a couple of millimeters by reducing the side frames. <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br><br>  One of the most notable innovations was the digital noise reduction system, which, however, only works with a special headset, but the results are absolutely amazing.  Headphones are equipped with small external microphones that capture external noise and transmit it to the smartphone, where similar noise is generated, which is in antiphase with the surrounding.  The effect exceeds all expectations - for example, the low hum of air conditioners is completely neutralized and only the quiet high-frequency noise inherent in any audio devices is heard in the headphones.  At the same time, the listener is not completely isolated from the surrounding sounds - such critical things as a car horn will be completely heard.  During a call, a microphone located in the left earpiece is used for talking.  It is worth noting that Russian users will receive this headset as standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9a/290/814/b9a2908141964aab3694f099dea36b4a.jpg"><br><br>  The five-pin connector, which appeared in Z2, is not only necessary for the ‚Äúshumodava‚Äù operation, but also allows you to connect a stereo microphone (it is supplied separately), with which you can record a high-quality sound track during video recording. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/015/2c6/b830152c6f1584486896843ab6f53ec5.jpg"><br><br>  The speaker finally became stereo, more precisely - the speakers became two and they are really very loud, which can be exacerbated with the help of traditional functions in a standard player (but now mono-compatibility is not required). <br><br>  <b>Iron and software</b> <br><br>  The newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset and as many as 3 gigabytes of RAM (I don‚Äôt always use so much on the computer) provide very serious performance - at the last MWC 2014 in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe AnTuTu team tested the key innovations and Xperia Z2 scored maximum points, surpassing even the harshest competitors.  In practice, this is to increase multi-tasking, new options for working with video and the absence of problems with playing even the heaviest commercials, and, of course, there is a large power reserve for the most voracious games. <br><br>  As for the software part, the Xperia Z2 will be the first Sony smartphone to be delivered with Android 4.4.2 preinstalled. The test copy has a temporary firmware installed, so it‚Äôs early to judge changes in the shell, but all the innovations, including noise reduction and grandiose innovations in video mode work fine. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 5.2-inch, 1920x1080 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon quad-core 2.3 GHz <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 3 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 1 / 2.3 ", 20.7 megapixel <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3200 mAh <br>  <b>Protection</b> : IP58 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215327/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215327/</a></p>
