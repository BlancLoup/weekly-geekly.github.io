      <i><b>Diplo, DJ</b></i> <br><br>  <i>Most effectively, I work on creating music while on the road, on a plane or in hotels.</i>  <i>The fact is that at such moments nothing distracts me.</i>  <i>Not that my family was a distraction, but being at home, I feel like a complete egoist, if I don't spend time with my son.</i>  <i>If I work on a project somewhere else, away from home, I can <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/ne-davayte-sebya-otvlech-2/">fully concentrate</a> .</i>  <i>I will spend the next week with my son, but then we won't see each other for a while.</i>  <i>I will not be three weeks.</i>  <i>You must be able to allocate your time.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  Depends on the circumstances.  It depends‚Ä¶ </blockquote><br>  FIRST CASE MORNING: <br><blockquote>  As a rule, I tend to go somewhere faster.  If time permits, I go to the gym or work out at home - I do squats, pushups and stuff like that.  I can go to yoga or do a jog. </blockquote><br>  DINNER: <br><blockquote>  I usually do not eat until one o'clock - I just do not want.  I am interrupted by what is at hand.  Recently, I generally do not eat very well.  Although, when we are on tour, I try to try all sorts of culinary masterpieces.  We went to Greece to take part in the show program, and there we were fed very tasty food, probably the best in my life. </blockquote><br>  DO YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DAY? <br><blockquote>  Not.  Although yesterday I fell asleep right in the studio and slept for about an hour. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE BEFORE YOU SLEEP: <br><blockquote>  Sometimes I play Simpsons.  This is a video game in which you need to buy houses and other property.  In real life, I don‚Äôt spend a lot of money, but in the game I‚Äôll drop at least $ 300 a time. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  The night before last, I lay down at 6 in the morning despite the fact that I needed to board the plane at 9 o'clock.  The next day I went to bed at midnight. </blockquote><br>  - Interview taken by Benjamin Svetka (Benjamin Svetkey). <br>  ________________________________________ <br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. "I always know what needs to be done"</font> </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Kirsten Gillibrand (Kirsten Gillibrand)</b></i> <br>  United States Senator from New York and author of the book Off the Sidelines: Raise Your Voice (Leave the bench: express your opinion and change the world). <br><br>  <i>Of course, I want to have a million cases in a day, but I always remember that I have to take my children between 17 and 18 hours.</i>  <i>This is a priority.</i>  <i>Around this, I line up the rest of the schedule.</i>  <i>I know what I have to do, but I also know what else I want to be in time.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  Between 6:30 and 7 am / <br>  At this time, my six-year-old daughter is waking up. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  I make breakfast for children.  They eat breakfast and watch cartoons, and I'm going at this time. </blockquote><br>  MOST PRODUCTIVE TIME: <br><blockquote>  I think over issues that need to be resolved (as a rule, they concern my legislative activity) usually late at night, when I am already in bed, in peace and quiet. </blockquote><br>  HOW IS A QUESTION WITH THE MAIL SOLVED: <br><blockquote>  I used to write letters or text messages only on certain topics, for example, to understand where and when I should attend: my husband can clarify by mail which of us will take the children.  If the question concerns work, and the staff ask me for a briefing, then I insist that it be held verbally.  Briefing by e-mail is not acceptable to me.  I generally sit at the computer a little - it's true.  I can't even tell you the password for it now.  If I use something, then only my iPhone. </blockquote><br>  DO YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DAY? <br><blockquote>  Over the years of work, I realized that I am becoming much more effective and happier if I devote time to physical activity.  I try to play sports at least three times a week.  I spend 45 minutes playing squash. <br>  I can play with everyone who agrees.  But in the Senate it is difficult to find lovers of squash, although I played with Al Franken [Democratic Senator from Minnesota] more than once.  In general, this game is not the most popular among members of both parties.  Softball, on the contrary, is a game uniting games.  Kelly Ayotte [member of the Republican Party, Senator from New Hampshire] is the second captain, Shelley Moore Capito [member of the Republican Party, congressman from West Virginia] is the third field player.  In the spring, we train twice a week from 7:00 am, but I try to come early to work on the feed. </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  One of the tools we use to maintain motivation and concentration is the phrase: "the whole armor of God" (armor of God).  My chief of staff pronounces her every time I have a difficult meeting.  He knows that I love this part of Scripture.  These words, in my opinion, carry great significance.  Although I am not sure that he shares my point of view. </blockquote><br>  BEST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I always keep a positive mood.  I imagine success and action. </blockquote><br>  WORST HABIT: <br><blockquote>  I stop doing sports when I feel depressed. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  I kiss my husband. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  Between 21.00 and 22.00.  I need a lot of sleep. </blockquote><br>  - The interview was taken by Jeff Chu. <br>  ________________________________________ <br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. ‚ÄúWe argue very often‚Äù</font> </h2><br><br>  <i><b>Glynn Washington (Glynn Washington)</b></i> <br>  The owner and one of the founders of the company Snap Judgment NPR (National Public Radio, National Public Radio). <br><br>  <i>Most often, a writer who needs to know a third-party opinion about his work distributes manuscripts to his friends, but often faces misunderstanding.</i>  <i>I have a partner - Mark Ristich.</i>  <i>He is the second executive producer of my show and a man who can say to me: ‚ÄúComplete nonsense, better destroy it." I met Mark 15 years ago at a party, and we didn‚Äôt immediately like each other, but after a while he became almost a brother to me, with whom I often argue and argue.</i> <br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  6 a.m. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  Often I go to bed with some question in my head - I think about what I had unsuccessfully worked on.  And when I wake up, I take a computer and start writing to see if a dream has helped find a solution. </blockquote><br>  APPLICATIONS AND ACCESSORIES: <br><blockquote>  Audiobooks.  For the year I listen to about 50 books.  I usually listen to them, doing routine work, for example, when I keep records, look at spreadsheets and stuff like that.  Such <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/ezhednevnye-ritualy-chteniya-kotorye-povysyat-vashu-produktivnost/">reading rituals</a> help me to maintain concentration, and without them I quickly lose interest and turn off work. </blockquote><br>  PHILOSOPHY: <br><blockquote>  Go somewhere.  Do something.  If you do not feel that you live, then you can hardly tell about the lives of other people. </blockquote><br>  DINNER: <br><blockquote>  I miss it once.  This is stupid, I do not advise anyone to do so. </blockquote><br>  DO YOU MAKE A BREAK FOR THE DAY? <br><blockquote>  This is what I should do.  If the US president finds time to play basketball four or five times a week, then I should be able to organize the work so <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/vy-delaete-neobkhodimyy-pereryv-ili-prosto-lenites/">that there are breaks</a> . </blockquote><br>  WHAT IS YOU MOTIVATED? <br><blockquote>  I have some cool old Accidentally Extra Earphones.  I installed the ‚ÄúBose‚Äù soundproofing system on them and now, putting them on, I find myself in my own closed space.  I call them a small virtual office.  While working, I really need silence. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  I am doing something that can lead me to a certain mental state.  I like to draw using digital programs, for example, Corel Painter and listen to an audiobook. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  1:30 AM </blockquote><br><br>  ‚ÄîThe interview was taken by Jason Feifer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. ‚ÄúIn the last few hours I sent 300-400 emails‚Äù</font> </h2><br><br>  <b><b>John Legere</b></b> <br>  President and CEO of T-Mobile. <br><br>  <i>I communicate with people every day, every minute.</i>  <i>I consider it my duty.</i>  <i>Only this morning, in the last few hours, have I sent 300 or 400 emails.</i>  <i>I gave my email address to the staff of all 3000 T-Mobile stores.</i>  <i>If there are serious problems with clients, it always comes directly to me.</i>  <i>I also go to my Twitter account for more information.</i>  <i>Clients are satisfied that I answer them personally, and the employees too.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  6 a.m. </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  First of all, I go for a double espresso, holding the phone in my hand.  Turning on CNBC and viewing email.  I check text messages, Twitter and browse several newspapers.  I often think that I should devote five minutes of meditation or prayer.  But no, I persist in doing the same thing day after day. </blockquote><br>  APPLICATIONS AND ACCESSORIES: <br><blockquote>  Twitter, Instagram and Outluk.  I also use Jawbone Up.  It's incredible how this damn thing on my wrist tells me that I didn't get enough sleep or just got tired. </blockquote><br>  PHILOSOPHY: <br><blockquote>  Listen to customers and employees and do what they say, closing their mouths.  In fact, it is not so difficult. </blockquote><br>  DINNER: <br><blockquote>  Ninety-nine days out of a hundred I eat the same thing: chicken soup and vegetables with spicy seasoning from a Chinese restaurant.  As for the breaks, I try to go for a run, especially when I am in a new city. </blockquote><br>  WHAT YOU CAN DO IN 15 MINUTES OF FREE TIME: <br><blockquote>  I call my daughters who are 25 and 29 years old.  It is very important for me. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  I listen to customer calls.  Often at night, before I go to bed, I make calls to clarify this or that controversial situation. </blockquote><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  Between 10:30 pm and 1:30 am </blockquote><br>  - Interview took DD  McCorvey (JJ McCorvey). <br>  ________________________________________ <br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. ‚ÄúI make time for myself‚Äù</font> </h2><br>  <i><b>Bobby Brown</b></i> <br>  Creative director of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics and chief editor of Yahoo Beauty. <br><br>  <i>My day - sheer insanity - the concept of a 'typical' day for me does not exist.</i>  <i>Of the five working days of the week, I spend one at Yahoo, two or three days at Bobbi, and one works remotely ‚Äî I can be anywhere that day.</i>  <i>This is the secret of my success: I make time for myself.</i>  <i>I can play sports or go to the grocery store for food for my family.</i>  <i>It can also go about traveling.</i>  <i>All this is very useful for me.</i>  <i>So I <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/21-sovet-pozvolyayushchiy-prevratitsya-v-samogo-produktivnogo-cheloveka/">recharge and rethink a lot</a> : I think about how best to act in this or that situation.</i>  <i>I try not to do several things at once.</i>  <i>Although last night, while taking a relaxation bath, I realized that I had not taken anything with me to read.</i>  <i>I was bored.</i> <br><br>  TIME OF AWAKENING: <br><blockquote>  6 a.m. <br>  I have two dogs that successfully replace the alarm clock ... </blockquote><br>  FIRST MORNING ACTION: <br><blockquote>  I drink two glasses of water and double espresso. </blockquote><br>  APPLICATIONS AND ACCESSORIES: <br><blockquote>  I use the Notes application, which was originally installed on the iPhone for everything from drawing up lists of products for the house to fixing the birthdays of people and product ideas for those with whom I will meet.  I'm also a big fan of voicemail.  I like the fact that I can call someone and say, ‚ÄúOh God, I had a great idea.  You may think that this is complete crazy, but .. ".  I often need to speak out and clear my head.  The idea may be good and not very good, but I have to voice it, otherwise I will forget. </blockquote><br>  PHILOSOPHY: <br><blockquote>  Passion, health, team. </blockquote><br>  HOW ARE CASE OF E-MAIL: <br><blockquote>  People who know me are aware of the fact that I cannot make speeches, as well as write them.  I used to be uncomfortable because of this.  Now I just say: "My God!";  "Perfectly!";  "Not an option";  "Call me".  I always try to answer right away. </blockquote><br>  WHAT YOU CAN DO IN 15 MINUTES OF FREE TIME: <br><blockquote>  I feel uneasy because I have to ask people to buy something for me when I myself am very busy.  So when I have free time, I go shopping.  I do not have a stylist who helps with the selection of outfits for the occasion of various events - I dress myself, which, in my opinion, is obvious.  But it gives me some freedom. </blockquote><br>  LAST ACTION BEFORE WASTING TO SNU: <br><blockquote>  I turn off the TV! </blockquote><br><br>  BEDTIME: <br><blockquote>  22:30 </blockquote><br><br>  ‚ÄîThe interview was taken by Jeff Chu. <br>  ________________________________________ <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/6-stressogennykh-mysley-i-kak-s-nimi-borotsya/">6 stressful thoughts, and how to deal with them</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303890/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303890/</a></p>
