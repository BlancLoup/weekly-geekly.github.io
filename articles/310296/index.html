Implementation, if not talk about it, too.  Popularly talking about the platform for developers is not very easy, especially if you are doing magic with telephone and video calls.  But we are trying!  And we invite you on October 6 to the <a href="https://intercomconf.com/">INTERCOM</a> real-time communication conference.  In the center of ENEA, hackspace " <a href="http://steelup.ru/">STEEL</a> ".  What for?  Now the topic of real-time communication is broken into pieces, which we discuss at separate conferences.  Somewhere about bots and instant messengers, somewhere about working with voice calls, somewhere about video calling.  At INTERCOM, we gathered together for the first time in Russia pieces and invited interesting speakers who will tell us how it all works <b>together</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br clear="all"><h1>  INTERCOM Conference October 6 </h1><br>  Telecom is a separate world.  With tsiska, SIP, bearded admins and the ritual setting Asterisk.  If the developer and intersects with this world, it is usually due to the need for work or from the article on Habr√© ‚ÄúHow a cell tower works, or why you don‚Äôt receive SMS‚Äù.  But voice and video calls along with SMS are the few remaining reliable and high-priority channels of communication with users.  We continue to use them by inertia for two-factor authentication.  Although the possibilities of the ‚Äútraditional‚Äù telecom channels are much wider, the answer to the question ‚Äúwhen will the messengers finally kill the SMS‚Äù is not as simple as it seems. <br><br>  We want to show you the telecom industry as part of a modern technology stack.  A stack that allows you to chat in real time.  Communicate voice, video, messages, API calls. <br><br>  Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have adapted our brain to social intercourse.  Twenty years of development of IT technologies have changed the very essence of this communication.  On the development of communication technologies, we spend more effort than even on promising technologies in the field of porn.  I don‚Äôt even talk about throwing birds at pigs.

      The INTERCOM conference is a story about real-time communication.  About calls, SMS, messaging, chat rooms, bots, video conferencing, browsers and phones.  About all that placer of technologies that are now changing our society and our lives. <br><br><h1>  Who is this conference for? </h1><br>  For anyone who wants to talk about communication technologies.  For web developers.  For developers of mobile applications.  For telecom providers.  For startups and established businesses that want to work with a sales funnel by engaging customers in communication.  For all Internet entrepreneurs who are looking for new ways to make their business better. <br><br>  The first conference is always hard, but I tried very hard to gather really interesting speakers at the venue.  To not only listen, but also to communicate.  Pauses with an endless supply of coffee and cookies are provided for a lot.  We will have something to discuss: <br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/213/05c/18b21305c4c9477ea11bcf1d6bff643a.jpg" align="left">  <b>Zviad Kardava</b> , <b>Google</b> Developer Developer, will talk about backends for messaging.  What we have in 2016 to process millions of messages in real time, which slows down, what falls, what to choose.  Zviad will tell more than that: for the past few months, he, together with the team, has created just such a backend.  So the information is as fresh as possible, and the map of the decomposed rakes is the most relevant. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/888/df4/de2/888df4de23e1446c95cb84a2dc5f84d9.jpg" align="right">  <b>Elizaveta Lavrova</b> , a technology evangelist at <b>Microsoft</b> , will talk about chat bots that one of the largest IT companies knows.  The Cortana chat bot built into Windows 10 is one of the most advanced on the market.  What pitfalls did the company encounter when creating this digital assistant and how does it see the future of chat bots?  Ask Elizabeth! <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/758/f3d/1a1758f3d3204b4190aa7595e91d70e8.jpg" align="left">  <b>Oleg Dronov</b> , who has been involved in billing and <b>SMS for</b> many years, will talk about the current state of this technology.  What are the problems with SMS, what can replace this technology, push notifications and much more from a person who really understands this? <br><br clear="all"><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d24/af7/d4c/d24af7d4c1fd489a9a6b4622938c2638.jpg" align="right"><br>  <b>Alexander Serbul</b> leads the quality control of integration and implementation of <b>1C-Bitrix</b> .  He has vast experience in managing the development and creation of truly complex systems.  At the conference, Alexander will tell two stories at once!  In the first about the pitfalls of video communication and sharing of the screen on mobile devices.  And in the second about creating a ‚Äúlive map‚Äù that displays a huge number of events. <br><br clear="all"><h1>  Hackspace "STEEL" </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dda/958/e4c/dda958e4c8594c119a80fea08bfe84cd.png" align="left">  New space for IT-events in the center of ENEA.  Three floors, good Wi-Fi, a huge 3D printer, a disassembled Ferris wheel and Europe's largest aquarium in five minutes walk!  This is not the first event that we hold in the "Steel", and each time the site is getting better.  Here we will hold a conference (the large hall can easily accommodate 200 guests), and the 24-hour <a href="https://tadhack.voximplant.ru/">TADHack</a> hackathon. <br><br clear="all"><h1>  Hobrazhiteli </h1><br>  Habr is a good, specialized community, where for many years I have learned many new things, found new customers for Voximplant and regularly read really interesting materials.
