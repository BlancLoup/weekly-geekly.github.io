    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  0. Authorized Apple Service Center in Kiev.  Welcome to iLand </h4><br><br>  A brief telephone call to the repair services showed that the new display would either cost me an enormous amount comparable to the cost of the new MacBook, or we would have to wait up to three months. <br><br>  An alternative was the independent order and delivery of the display. <br>  For example, from here: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.powerbookmedic.com/15-Inch-MacBook-Unibody-Display-LCD-Screen-NEW-p-17295.html">www.powerbookmedic.com/15-Inch-MacBook-Unibody-Display-LCD-Screen-NEW-p-17295.html</a> <br>  HI RES MATTE ($ 199.95) - very well. <br>  $ 200 is the maximum that comes to customs without problems.  But even if something would have to pay, then it is quite possible to accept it. <br>  + shipping <br>  USPS Priority Mail International - 7-15 days ($ 43.25) <br>  UPS Worldwide SaverSM ($ 99.75) <br><br>  Well.  No problem.  Right now ... but then the manager from <a href="http://iland.ua/support.html">iLand</a> called back to me <a href="http://iland.ua/support.html">(http://iland.ua/support.html)</a> and cheerfully informed that they had found the display I needed, in 2-3 days they will do everything and it will cost me everything just 500 $. <br><br>  - And no questions with delivery, customs, installation.  We will take over and do it in the best possible way.  Or maybe even faster, because iLand is an authorized Apple service center!  - so the manager told me.  And I believed it.  Not such a large overpayment for reliability and quality work, which, as you know, should be appreciated.  Yes, and break away from work for 2 weeks was extremely undesirable for me.  MacBook Pro is my work machine and I need it.  The faster the better. <br><br><h4>  1. Replacing the display </h4><br><br>  And now the laptop is in service.  It took 3 days, I came and took the machine, as I promised.  However, as soon as I was at home and sat down to work, I found that everything was not so simple. <br>  <b>The iLand not only put the wrong display, which promised (Low Res), but did not even bother to notify me about it.</b> <br>  After calling iLand with the question "what is happening ?!"  The manager in an equally cheerful voice told me that they probably confused and did not have the required display, but for now I can work on this, and within two weeks they will bring me a new one that I need. <br>  Okay, I thought, for two weeks it certainly is already unpleasant, but since I can use a laptop, then somehow I will survive.  Although I ordered the HI RES when I bought it for a reason.  I need him.  Okay, wait. <br>  At the same time I discovered that after sidir was filled in, I got into the habit of swallowing discs and there are a couple of minor faults. <br><br><h4>  2. The laptop is back in service, waiting for the display, diagnosing, repairing the CDROM </h4><br><br>  I took it to iLand with a request to fully diagnose it and repair the cdrom (I paid extra for that), I received confirmation that the display was already on the road and is about to be with them.  The laptop was returned to me, it was reported that everything that was needed was repaired, and the rest was in perfect condition.  That's just the display did not come.  Will be next week. <br><br>  But he did not come.  And in a week too.  And then. <br>  Money will not be returned to me.  But the display is about to be, so there's nothing to worry about. <br>  But I was still worried.  And for this there were quite objective reasons: <br><br>  - cdrom started swallowing discs again <br>  - the frame that covers the display began to peel off and eventually fell off <br>  - the port into which the headphones are inserted has started to work incorrectly.  (Which, incidentally, is probably not related to flooding or the operation of iLand <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa%3FthreadID%3D1367226">link1</a> <a href="http://discussions.info.apple.com/message.jspa%3FmessageID%3D10831000">link2</a> <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D573822">link3</a> and, in principle, was solved by rotating the headphone plug in the connector. But the poppy is not the machine that I would like to sit and twist the headphones for a couple of minutes while working with than take them out) <br><br>  I could not give the car to the service.  Work began on several projects and a delay of a couple of days could result in trouble. <br><br>  So <b>a month and a half</b> has passed. <br>  After another call to the question "- what is happening ?!"  the manager is still flawlessly politely explained that there are problems with supplies and everything will be there, but <b>within three months</b> .  But I can get a refund <b>if I am not satisfied with something</b> . <br>  Looking at ebay, <a href="http://www.powerbookmedic.com/">www.powerbookmedic.com</a> and a couple more top three sites, I found that the displays really disappeared from sale.  A quick rivaling of competitors showed the same for the first time: the exorbitant cost or the same three months.  And I have a job.  She needs to work.  Two weeks of downtime would cost me the loss of two clients and a solid amount of money. <br><br><h4>  3. And let's wait three months. </h4><br><br>  And I agreed.  Let it be three months. <br>  When asked how they could compensate me for the loss of time and the current situation itself, which goes beyond all possible limits, the manager sincerely wondered what was there, what to compensate for and asked what I wanted to do. <br><br>  - On a unibody laptop near the keyboard a small dent.  The cat tipped the drum.  Trifle, but unpleasant.  You can fix me a dent or replace unibody.  Used and scratched bottom, I was quite satisfied if the front side is in order.  I can pay some adequate amount and the current unibody will get you. <br>  - I think yes, I know.  Call back tomorrow. <br><br>  The chime the next day and the day after and after that gave only vague answers and requests to wait until tomorrow.  This went on until I was tired of calling the manager and I did not concentrate on the work. <br>  On average, I called once a week and wondered if the display came and when to wait.  I was regularly informed of the upcoming date.  True to catch the manager was not easy.  <b>I was told that they would find out and call back in 15 minutes.</b>  <b>And did not call back.</b>  <b>Stable.</b>  So, in order to get a sensible ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúin a week can be in the delivery, call on Thursday‚Äù it was necessary to make a small scandal.  And to the question "- Why did not you call back? You promised ?!"  I was simply answered "- I did not receive the necessary information and did not want to disturb you once again."  Explanations that a negative answer is also an answer, and even information about what could not be learned ‚Äî also information, was simply ignored. <br><br>  And three months came to an end. <br><br><h4>  4. Or maybe you do something yourself? </h4><br>  To the next question, "What is happening? Where is my display? !!"  Instead of the postponement of the deadlines for the week, <b>I was offered to order and bring the display myself</b> , and after that they would install it for me and pick up my own.  And then something they can not find the right one. <br>  I have to admit that I exploded.  In the face of the manager.  Like a lavatory that got dynamite saber.  Anyone who played in Fallout 2 will be able to very vividly present this picture. <br>  Though, probably, it was necessary to agree. <br>  But it‚Äôs somehow strange to order and bring the display yourself ($ 300), but to pay iLand ($ 500) after they have ‚Äúrepaired‚Äù my laptop for three months. <br><br><h4>  5. Display arrived </h4><br>  <b>It's been 6 months.</b> <br>  They still brought the display. <br>  When asked about the ‚Äúcompensation‚Äù I was told that they can only supply me with a new unibody, but for only $ 360.  This is the lowest price, as they are an authorized Apple service center, they have discounts.  And, of course, they will not take money for work.  Only one thing confused me.  On powerbookmedic.com, the top-case and keyboard assembly costs $ 250, and I need a keyboard without a keyboard and can be used, so you can most likely find it much cheaper. <br>  I decided to add up to 8Gb of memory.  I called and asked how much it would cost me.  The manager replied that $ 120 for the 4Gb bar.  What kind?  Good ones!  Kingston!  More specifically?  More specifically, write a letter and our technicians will respond.  The letter was naturally ignored.  It seems to me that if I pay $ 120 for the memory bar, then I have the right to know what they put.  Well.  Another call.  The answer comes: <br><br>  Kingston KVR1066D3S7 / 4G <br>  4GB 1066MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL7 SODIMM <br>  <a href="http://hotline.ua/pr/193-3-1273-317/%3Fq%3DKingston%2BKVR1066D3S7%252F4G%2B4GB%26w%3D0">hotline.ua/pr/193-3-1273-317/?q=Kingston+KVR1066D3S7%2F4G+4GB&amp;w=0</a> ($ 60) <br><br>  Maybe I'm wrong, but the margin of 100% of the cost of the bar (not wholesale, average retail) for installing the bar in a laptop is too much.  To replace the bar qualification is not needed.  Enough screwdriver. <br>  I bought a pair of slats from a local dealer and carried a laptop to the service. <br><br>  Asked: <br>  - Repair the cdrom, which after their repair worked for a couple of days <br>  - Screw the frame, which after their repair fell off <br>  - Tighten the bolts on the bottom, which hang out <br>  - Put in order the audio input <br>  - Put 8Gb <br>  - Replace finally the display <br>  - Make it qualitatively, so that we would forget about each other forever <br><br>  The question ‚ÄúHow much will it cost me?‚Äù I was told that they would do everything for free as a compensation. <br>  I offered to pay what I needed, but that everything would be done <b>qualitatively, and not as usual</b> , but the manager assured that everything would be done in the best possible way and completely free. <br><br>  Oh well. <br>  It took a couple of days. <br>  Came for a laptop. <br>  On the display there was a new background image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f46e5144/551e70d1/b1ca3df6/7e0fb42c.jpg"><br><br>  Read the text.  These are not hieroglyphs.  This is quite meaningful English inscription. <br>  Funny, yes? <br><br>  Naturally, the manager said that their technology did not touch anything and it was. <br>  Check: cdrom did not work, and does not work.  Audio input is both bazhil and bazhit. <br>  Sacramental "- what is happening ?!". <br>  The technician resorts.  He conjures somewhere in the back 10 minutes and returns the laptop. <br>  Wow.  It worked. <br><br><h4>  6. Epilogue </h4><br>  The cdrom worked for an hour. <br>  Clock audio input 5. <br>  When I called with the question ‚Äúhow do we live next?‚Äù They said, come.  Spent time arrived.  Refined polite manager replied that the <b>CD curtains in which the problem is changing with UNIBODY ($ 360?), And that would have earned the audio input (!) It is necessary to replace the motherboard (!!!)</b> . <br><br>  I turned around and left. <br>  There was nothing more to talk about. <br><br><h4>  7. Conclusions </h4><br>  Draw your own conclusions. <br>  It is better to learn from the mistakes of others, but I made them enough. <br>  Experience shows that this is the norm.  A couple of days ago my friend replaced the iPhone display with a Chinese copy instead of the original, although they promised to deliver the original.  To the question "‚Äîhow so?"  he was told that he would not notice the difference anyway, and since he accepted the work, now he can only sell the phone on slando. <br><br>  I would be interested to know: <br>  - Is there a service in Kiev with the best quality of work?  (I still need to put in order the CD curtains and the audio input and I don‚Äôt know who to turn to. I myself can‚Äôt, and I don‚Äôt want to.) <br>  - and what is your experience with such services? <br><br>  I hope that I chose the blog correctly. <br>  This post covers the quality of the work of Apple authorized services in Ukraine. <br>  I thought I might publish it in ‚ÄúI resent,‚Äù but it is closed.  And I would like the employees of iLand to also get acquainted with this post. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> requested a Case ID or Repair ID letter, since they are an authorized service center.  Let's see what happens. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Answered: <br><blockquote>  Anton, <br><br>  ask someone for a warranty card that goes into all boxes with Apple equipment and go to the list of service centers, there is an answer to your question. <br><br>  Repair ID for non-warranty cases is not created but I will clarify. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <a href="http://blog.iland.ua/nas-rugayut">http://blog.iland.ua/nas-rugayut</a> - comments service center workers in their blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115325/</a></p>
