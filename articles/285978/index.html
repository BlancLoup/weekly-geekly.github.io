This is the fastest way to get a diploma of international standard, opening career opportunities throughout the world.  Master programs for Russian students in English are open in the EU, USA and Asia and last from one to two years.

      In addition, a system of grants is provided for the full or partial payment of the cost of tuition and accommodation.  Of course, for each country and different specializations of their own requirements and conditions that should be taken into account when making a decision on admission to the magistracy abroad. <br><br>  A master's degree is issued in three main profiles, if you take the US <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/magistratura/">master's degree</a> , which is similar to the global: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Arts (Master of Arts); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Science (Master of Science); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Master of Business Administration (MBA). <br><br>  All university specialties are divided into these groups, each has its own conditions for admission and scholarships.  For example, American universities often sponsor talented students in the field of IT, as this is an investment in the development of a university. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">The cost of the master's program: from Europe to Asia</font> </h2><br>  Quality education is always expensive, especially if the training takes place in a prestigious university.  Master's degree is not as popular as undergraduate education, so the competition for it is somewhat less, and the possibilities for foreign students to study are much more.  In the USA, where the cost of education is measured in credits, the price for a magistracy is higher, but since the period of study is 2 times shorter, it turns out more profitable. <br><br>  Prices for graduate studies at various universities in the world vary in tens of thousands of dollars a year.  It depends on the state policy on supporting education and attracting foreigners, as well as on the degree of fame of the educational institution.  It is clear that studying at the world-famous <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> will cost several times more expensive than a Malaysian or Czech college. <br><br>  In the EU countries, such as France and Germany, there is a program of support for foreign students, according to which the cost of graduate programs is relatively low.  There is a so-called English-speaking group of states, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, New Zealand and Australia, where education is financed through taxes paid by the parents of students. <br><br>  Due to the fact that foreign students do not pay such taxes, they are forced to pay the full and very high cost of education.  At the same time, technical specialties have the highest value, competition is higher and the cost reaches 73 thousand dollars a year. <br><br>  The most profitable offers for graduate studies in all specialties, from technical to humanities and business administration from European countries, are provided by Germany, up to 1600 euros per year, and France - about 3000 euros per year.  Since the magistracy in Germany is considered to be ‚Äúfree‚Äù, about 600‚Äì800 euros per year are university fees.  But this is a relatively low cost in comparison with Canada, where the annual engineering education will cost 62 thousand dollars.  In the UK, where the master's program lasts only a year, the cost of education does not exceed 24 thousand pounds. <br><br>  Asian states such as China, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea with their rich culture and fast-growing technical capabilities are becoming increasingly popular among students.  There, the cost of training is much lower than in the USA or Canada, and varies between 8 and 20 thousand dollars. <br><br>  For example, in the United States at the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), the average annual expenditure per student in graduate programs is $ 40,733.  Education at <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/">Princeton University</a> in the specialty "International Relations" will cost 43 thousand dollars a year. <br><br>  For comparison, in the Malaysian <a href="http://www.apu.edu.my/">Asia Pacific University of Technology &amp; Innovation</a> (APU) training for 16 months in the specialty "information technology" is $ 11170.  Whereas in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), the specialty jurisprudence is $ 6,400 per year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba7/a81/fc9/ba7a81fc95d6448a9933290969b23e12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Additional expenses when studying abroad</font> </h2><br>  A foreign education was never completely free, even if a grant was received or a scholarship was won.  The use of the library, the sports field and other university fees is poured into considerable sums, which range from 50‚Äì400 euros per semester when it comes to European universities. <br><br>  If a student enters the magistracy independently without participation in exchange programs or grants, that is, without any additional third-party funding, then in order to study in the selected country, you will need to open an account in a bank.  There should be an amount of at least 660 euros per month for accommodation and meals for the entire period of study, without this, even a visa will not be issued. <br>  Master's programs in various fields are available at <a href="http://www.masterstudies.ru/Magistratura/">www.masterstudies.ru/Magistratura</a> <br><br>  If you apply for a scholarship, you do not need to start an account, all expenses are paid from monthly payments, which are, for example, about 900 euros in Media Informatics in the German <a href="http://www.rwth-aachen.de/">RWTH Aachen</a> .  You can <a href="http://www.daad.ru/stipendien">contact the</a> German Academic Exchange Service: <a href="http://www.daad.ru/stipendien">www.daad.ru/stipendien</a> or <a href="http://www.funding-guide.de/">www.funding-guide.de</a> (our blog has an interesting article about admission to the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-v-germanii%25E2%2580%2593delimsja-opytom/">magistracy in Germany</a> ). <br><br>  Living in the United States is quite expensive and costs about $ 1,000 per month, using the library, gym and other expenses amount to at least $ 230.  But grants and scholarships also allow you to recoup your training.  For example, the <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics-admissions/graduate-program/financial-support/research-assistantships">Research Assistantships</a> program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which involves research and teaching as part of training, involves a scholarship of up to $ 2,664. <br><br>  In addition, foreign students are allowed to work in US universities, but not more than 20 hours a week, and the first year only on campus. <br><br>  In Asian countries, living expenses, as well as tuition prices are slightly lower than American and European.  For example, in Korea, the cost of living will be $ 100-130 per month, transportation costs, the Internet, library and food are about 350. You can also work or get a scholarship for successful studies. <br><br>  <i>In the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/education/magistratura-za-rubezhom-granty-i-stipendialnye-programmy/">next publication</a> we will share all that we know about grants and scholarship programs for graduate programs abroad.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285978/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285978/</a></p>
