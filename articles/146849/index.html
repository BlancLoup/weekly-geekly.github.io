      Enough to have a friend with a pass. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A friend should be about the same person and sex as an intruder. <br>  I had one, he urgently needed to return to Moscow. <br>  Having spent the day on the forum, he casually mentioned the celebrities who shot his cigarettes. <br>  Dvorkovich, Kudrin, Kiriyenko, Chubais and other eco-pop stars. <br><br>  - Lying after all, scoundrel, - I thought, looking at the pass left to me. <br>  On the pass there were numbers, a name and a photo of my friend.  Also almost brunet, too long-nosed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI'll go,‚Äù I decided, and went.  Found a tie and a man who knows how to tie ties. <br><br><h4>  Vasilyevsky Island </h4><br>  Big Avenue.  Even vs Odd.  Shefner not read? <br>  Further Havana street did not break.  From here, walk 30 meters to the reception. <br><br>  The pass hung on his neck near the tie. <br><br>  Stopped girl strict as a teacher: <br>  - Attach the badge to the turnstile with the front side. <br><br>  Done <br><br>  On a large monitor (height = 1.2m, width = 0.9m - for a newspaper layout?), The brazen muzzle of a friend was highlighted. <br>  ‚ÄúPhoto 4 by 3,‚Äù I realized, and prepared for the arrest. <br>  - Come to Mercedes - smiled girl.  I entered the paradise where Putin walks without guards, Hvorostovsky without fans, and Gergiev without ensemble. <br><br><h4>  IEF inside </h4><br>  Like you, I once visited a large IT crowd. <br>  I remember lectures on new software development approaches, they revealed the secrets of algorithms and demonstrated new devices. <br>  At the stands of IT companies it was possible to beg for T-shirts, caps, mugs, pens, flash drives, mice and other useful souvenirs for relatives and colleagues. <br><br>  At the MEF, everything was different. <br>  A lot of food (up to alcoholic cocktails from Madonna) and men in jackets. <br>  A bit sleek dear women.  A lot of volunteers.  Highly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/806/b22/df0/806b22df034f39d5eac1073402735172.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Each participant was given two volunteers</i> <br><br>  My shorts were squinting. <br>  He saved the tie and 10 sandwiches in their hands - perhaps I was mistaken for the scientific secretary of the eccentric Brunei sultan. <br><br><h4>  The hunt for souvenirs </h4><br>  There were not even pens on the racks of SberBank, RosNeft, Beeline, GasProm, RosAtom mega-corporations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e05/6c1/37c/e056c137c135f8f1a52eee88351879e9.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  The only entertainment is a cocktail from Madonna and a big camera of the Security Council of the Russian Federation printing A3 pictures of me surrounded by sat-girls. <br><br>  <i>In the picture Sat Pe-Hae-Pe-Schnick.</i>  <i>Reprinted without permission.</i> <br><br>  Immediately big screen, which fly cubes.  On the sides of the cubes are stretched photos, including with my shorts. <br>  Handsomely.  By the way, the developer of all this canoe is a guy with Habr. <br><br><h4>  Skolkovo presentations </h4><br>  I went to the Skolkovo hall to hear about new technologies.  Four of the 12 projects were interesting. <br><br>  Helicopter automatic flying without ZHPS. <br>  Chemical-medical-mathematical project, fighting AIDS at the molecular level. <br>  And the miracle device, laser-poured into test tubes and bottles. <br>  Purely Habrovsky project, he interested me. <br><br><h4>  The essence of the method </h4><br>  Based on the effect of Raman light scattering. <br>  <a href="http://www.avantes.ru/articles/up1/50.php">Brief essence of the method.</a> <br>  Who is too lazy to follow the link, read me. <br>  Getting to the substance, the laser beam of the femto frequency oscillates molecular bonds. <br>  The reflected beam is caught, passed through the filters, brought to a boil and after 2 seconds the spectral graph of the desired substance is ready. <br><br>  Compare the resulting spectrum with samples from the database - and voila!  we know that in vitro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/204/130/031/20413003164cdaccf07fc3f0f8a57bda.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The author rubs the Prime Minister of Moscow Government.</i>  <i>region</i> <br><br>  At the demonstration, the application correctly recognized substances. <br>  The program said that this white powder is aspirin, and this one is cocaine. <br>  In addition, with an accuracy of 1 percent, it showed the content of ethyl alcohol in vodka. <br><br>  Judging by the figures, the vodka was almost real, but the program shows the weight or volume fraction of alcohol, the author did not explain to me. <br>  By the way, the author Alexey * has a unique biography.  He graduated from the <i>Shchukin School</i> , played in the <i>Moscow Virtuosi</i> and suddenly dropped everything and went to science engineering.  No, well, amazing! <br><br>  At the presentation of the device (the device has the size of a brick of red silicate), the corrosive journalists from the audience wanted to check the bottled water standing on all tables of the Forum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e8/4ab/54c/5e84ab54c11f5008aa1a258c70df34d5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The author and the device in two ways</i> <br><br>  The device recognized water, type 1002 (possible density?). <br>  The journalists did not calm down and forced the fight to pull the 20 liter bottle from the drinking column. <br>  The balloon shone with a fluorescent light and did not let itself be determined. <br>  It was the only puncture of the program - she diagnosed - too much light. <br><br>  I inquired about the details. <br>  Accuracy of determination of impurity fractions - 1%.  However, if a poison is mixed in water in a minute amount, it will determine the poison at the level of Yes / No. <br><br>  I thought about the useful applications of this device.  It is a lot of thoughts, up to tracking a condition of the health.  The device can monitor our skin every day, why not? <br><br>  Only in the eye itself do not shine a laser. <br><br><h4>  Angry birds </h4><br>  And celebrities and I did not pass.  Suddenly, Peter VesterBacka appeared, took me in his arms, gave me a souvenir and a business card and asked me to send him a link to my toy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f3/bc4/4b7/9f3bc44b7d512418e599fb564650e3c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then I woke up.  But the link to Peter sent. <br>  Pre-made the game paid.  For a week. <br>  Suddenly downloads, the dollar does not hurt me from the author of Angry Birds. <br><br>  By the way, about the dollar. <br>  Devouring cookies, I noticed Kudrin. <br><br>  - Alexey, what is the dollar exchange rate to be by January 1, 2013? <br>  Kudrin flashed his glasses: <br>  - 35 rubles. <br><br>  Have a good Sunday everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146849/</a></p>
