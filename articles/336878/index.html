And now, almost two months, as <b><a href="http://54-fz.ru/podrobnosti-54-fz">FZ-54</a></b> came into force. </p><br><p>  If with the transition to new conditions of work in offline retail, everything is more or less clear, how did the adoption of the new law affect the mobile employees of delivery services?  This will be discussed in this article. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Courier delivery including FZ.54" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/31d/1aa/48b/31d1aa48b37f441a8885cc2e8ee96735.png" alt=" "></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#fe8b06"><b>How did the couriers work before the release of FZ-54 and how now?</b></font> </h2><br><p>  So, what is the new algorithm for working with cash registers now waiting for couriers, as well as how to facilitate the work of already loaded employees? </p><br><p>  Let's see. </p><br><p>  Prior to the entry into force of the law, the courier could have arrived at the customer with a ready sum check without the name of the goods and delivered the goods.  The buyer could not be sure of the legality of the delivered goods and its subsequent warranty service.  There were cases when a courier could sell a ‚Äúhis‚Äù product to a client or render an unrecorded service, and the company lost not only its profit, but also its reputation. </p><br><blockquote>  Now the courier is obliged to punch a new sample receipt within 5 minutes after payment of the goods, which is transmitted to the cloud operator of fiscal data (CRF), which will contain all the necessary details of the seller‚Äôs company and the buyer will not have to keep a paper check to contact the warranty service, since  You can always print it from the CRF data. </blockquote><br><p>  If earlier it was enough just to drive in the amount at an autonomous cash desk, now, at the request of <b>Federal Law No. 54</b> , the check must contain a specification for each item with indication of the name and its value.  To do this, the courier must have <b><a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/">special software</a></b> for printing the receipt. </p><br><h3>  <b>Let us dwell on the main changes in the work:</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Buying online with payment via courier</b> </li></ul><br><p>  If the customer chooses the goods in the online store and plans to pay for the purchase with electronic or cash money upon receipt, the courier needs to have a portable CCP.  Depending on the preferences of the client, he should be provided with an electronic or paper check. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Buying online with payment via courier" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a21/3a8/101/a213a81013b74d21bf07c8d37df51935.png" alt=" "></div><br><ul><li>  <b>Payment of goods on the seller‚Äôs website</b> </li></ul><br><p>  If the goods are paid by credit card directly on the site, the situation changes.  The electronic check must be generated by the site and sent to the email or mobile number of the customer within 5 minutes.  The issuance of a printed check in this case is optional, so the courier delivers only the goods from the invoice. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Payment of goods on the seller‚Äôs website" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/cd9/e1f/144/cd9e1f1444614a98bc3254b063ecbf5a.png" alt="    "></div><br><ul><li>  <b>Refusal of the client from a part of the delivered goods</b> </li></ul><br><p>  According to the new law <b>FZ-54</b> , if the customer wants to abandon all or several items from the list of delivered goods before payment, the courier is obliged to correct the check on the spot and print out to reflect these changes.  If the client wants to return any items of the order after the settlement, the courier must print a new return check for these items and return the money for them.  Previously, the return receipt was printed only within one shift, according to the new requirements - at any time. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Return check" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/623/433/866/6234338660b4407fa17ae78789bd5858.png" alt=" "></div><br><h2>  <font color="#fe8b06"><b>We work in accordance with the Federal Law-54</b></font> </h2><br><p>  As developers of mobile business applications, we follow the requirements of the legislation and, naturally, by the entry into force of the law, we have developed software that allows us to work in accordance with <b>Federal Law-54</b> . </p><br><p>  Now you can find a lot of solutions that allow you to print an online check, but our task was also to automate the work of the courier in the complex.  This is how the product <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/"><b>DM</b></a> was born. <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/"><b>Delivery</b></a> </p><br><p></p><blockquote>  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/"><b>DM.Delivery</b></a> is a licensed product that consists of a server utility installed on a company‚Äôs server and an application that is equipped with an <b>ACT</b> or a mobile device on <b>Android</b> .  The software allows you to automate the entire workflow from receiving orders to generating reports on the work done. </blockquote><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="The interface of the software solution &quot;DM.Delivery&quot;" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9e9/23c/929/9e923c9298ac49d094ee512e42e06a7e.png" alt="   ¬´DM.¬ª"></div><br><h3>  <b>The principle of the software is as follows:</b> </h3><br><p>  The software fully automates the company's delivery, including work with orders, routes, orders, sales and printing checks for the requirements of <b>FZ-54</b> . </p><br><p>  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile-delivery/"><b>‚ÄúDM.Delivery‚Äù</b></a> optimally distributes tasks between couriers according to specified conditions, for example, in districts of the city assigned to specific couriers. </p><br><p>  A courier on his device sees a general list of orders in order of priority and in the form of points on a city map, can pave the route for delivery taking into account traffic jams using popular services (Yandex.Navigator, Google). </p><br><p>  If necessary, directly from the application, you can call the client, specify the address or time of delivery. <br></p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Routes laid in the software &quot;DM.Delivery&quot;" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c0d/27b/75b/c0d27b75bf60418bb3e94da4cef59fa1.png" alt="    ¬´DM.¬ª"></div><br><p>  The courier at the beginning of the shift can be given an advance for exchange, this function fixes the courier's funds at the beginning of the shift.  All orders can be sorted by delivery time or by priority. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Advance payment to the courier in the &quot;DM.Delivery&quot; software" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a39/a1c/25d/a39a1c25d90948c49c76bb3f62057925.png" alt="     ¬´DM.¬ª"></div><br><p></p><blockquote>  The check is generated and printed in accordance with the <b>Federal Law-54</b> , and data about it is received by the CRF in the background.  Unsent the receipt is stored in the cash register for a month, then the cash register will be blocked.  Even if there is no internet connection at the time of check formation, it will be sent later when the connection appears, for example, upon arrival at the office via Wi-Fi or within the mobile coverage area, via 3G / LTE.  All check data is automatically sent to the tax authority for control. </blockquote><br><p>  The software implements the function of cancellation and return of positions in the order, with clarification of the reasons for the refusal and possible photographic fixation of the goods by the device camera. </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Cancel a position in the software DM.Delivery" src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d86/512/a77/d86512a7722b4850a86cc0d9cc377a05.png" alt="    ¬´DM.¬ª"></div><br><p>  When calculating, you can choose a payment method - by card or cash, as well as mixed.
