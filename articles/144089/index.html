It is time to get acquainted with the device closer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  This is the first Xperia with an all-aluminum case.  This piece of iron.  It looks to my modest taste completely awesome - the most beautiful device in the class.  Strict forms of the case is very metal.  A large piece of scratch-resistant glass (traditionally also taped at the factory with a protective film) hides a four-inch display and a front-facing camera.  For the speaker in the glass cutout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad6/9a7/40b/ad69a740bdc2e34ef2d6a8924569d101.jpg">

      The back cover makes you happy with the symmetry of the forms - a flash, a camera's eye and the Sony Mobile logo, also known as Sony Ericsson, are located strictly along the vertical axis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/97b/84f/76697b84f93a7b25adbad8ef56ee5d29.jpg"><br><br>  At the top there is only a 3.5-mm headphone jack, from the bottom - only a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e87/7b8/943/e877b89438b01f16a0c2b22c9f0e1c4e.jpg"><br><br>  All buttons - power, camera and camera volume / zoom are located on the right. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00e/220/dbd/00e220dbdc1c736f23d0fab1c0ad335a.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a barred external speaker - a metal mesh with which it is closed, the detail is small but very stylish. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58f/947/29c/58f94729c2ab627f90f553deaf2647dd.jpg"><br><br>  On the left "side" - connectors HDMI, MicroUSB and microSIM.  "Technogenic" image of Xperia P emphasize two small bolt, deliberately brought out.  It's like a rivet on the body of the aircraft - no decorations, everything is serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/386/4da/ba8/3864daba822c4a284b5b0a32d86c2772.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, on the spot, the key detail of the exterior of the NXT series of smartphones is a transparent plastic strip that separates the main body from the chin.  In the dark, when pressed, it is merrily highlighted in blue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c3/807/cd3/7c3807cd3031610293acda3448322a9b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Ergonomics </h4><br>  Ergonomically, the Xperia P is probably the most successful Xperia model I've been holding in my hands lately.  Judge for yourself: <br><ol><li>  Audio jack - as expected, above, </li><li>  The power button - the location on the side is a bit unusual, but it fits perfectly under your thumb and it is certainly easier to ‚Äúclick‚Äù on it than, for comparison, on a small round on the top edge of the Xperia arc. </li><li>  Connectors - a separate reason for joy.  The fact is that I really do not like all kinds of plugs that constantly have to unfasten / put in place.  The main connectors, in my opinion, should always be available - as implemented here. </li><li>  Connector for microSIM, on the contrary, is closed with a lid - which is also logical and safe. </li><li>  The main keys - in contrast to the Xperia S, the click zone was added to the transparent strip itself under the screen (on the ‚Äúesque‚Äù icons are located UNDER the keys themselves), which looks more logical and besides, they are now easier to press by touch.  When pressed, the phone naturally gives feedback in the form of a small vibration vibration. </li></ol><br><br>  In general, the device in the hand is comfortable, which is facilitated by the curved back cover, including.  Weight Xperia P - 126 grams, dimensions - 122 mm in height, 59.5 mm in width and 10.5 mm in depth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/745/bee/0c0/745bee0c06dbb8fc86d97ce99c7d9004.jpg"><br><br>  The only operational flaw, perhaps all the same all-aluminum body - now you can not change, for example, the battery, and the method of hard cutting in which case - remove the battery - will not work. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c7f/c8f/42a/c7fc8f42a6ddb3b51d01375dda8aae31.jpg"><br><br>  The Sony Xperia P is already delivered in a flat black-and-white cardboard box that is familiar to other Sony smartphones, where the following contents are quite compactly packed: <br><br><ul><li>  Smartphone itself: </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/766/4d3/d23/7664d3d23419f49ddfbbb78e90070bbe.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  high-power power unit (full charge in just half an hour): </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad1/4e9/695/ad14e969553143c33a4af65d873f5e4c.jpg"><br><ul><li>  stereo headset; </li><li>  adapter cord to microUSB; </li><li>  HDMI cable; </li><li>  and 2 NFC tags (in the photo without them, because this is a test copy). </li></ul><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  Display Sony Xperia P deserves to stay on it separately.  He even has his own name - WhiteMagic.  Its uniqueness lies in the fourth added to the traditional three subpixels (red, green and blue) of the white.  Usually, the white color on the screen is obtained by mixing the three primary colors, and, depending on the settings, the color may ‚Äúfade‚Äù with another shade.  As a result, in Xperia P white is not achieved by mixing these three subpixels, but only by working white, which provides almost perfect color reproduction and at the same time saves battery consumption.  In addition, thanks to a new subpixel, the Xperia P's display is very bright - the maximum brightness is 935 candles versus the usual 500 candles for smartphones, which ensures comfortable work in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f1c/efc/032/f1cefc032cb5945862399b82f2e29379.jpg"><br><br>  In the settings of the screen operation mode, you can adjust the brightness automatically depending on the surrounding conditions - the screen works brighter in the sun and dims a little in the dark: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e59/4aa/802/e594aa802c60e9cc5b6252b90064bb8b.png"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/567/d64/6df/567d646dfe487b313d057663538518c2.jpg"><br><br>  The Xperia P camera is 8 megapixels, 16x digital zoom and, most importantly, fast capture technology.  By the way, in the video mode, the zoom also works - already 8-fold.  Depending on the settings, the camera can turn on in 1.5 seconds and immediately take a picture or just come to a working state.  I prefer to use the second option, because it allows you to better ‚Äúaim‚Äù for shooting. <br><br>  You can judge how the Xperia P camera shoots from the photos in an album on Yandex: <br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/636927/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11b/161/9a8/11b1619a89bcf4087b2f2aef855bf76b.jpg" width="800" height="176"></a> <br>  <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/egorkotkin/view/636927/">Look at Yandex. Photos</a> <br><br>  And of course on the Xperia P there is a front-facing camera - to post bows it was even easier to arrange video conferencing via Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29a/7c4/142/29a7c4142e557784b203cb0b57e3478e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  My copy of Xperia P works on Andorid 2.3.7.  An update to ICS is expected soon.  In the meantime, I can‚Äôt add anything new - the Xperia P interface is completely identical to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/140242/">recently watched Sony Xperia S</a> - unless corrected for a smaller screen resolution - 960x540 versus 1280x720 for the flagship respectively.  And this is good!  Dialer, music management, message menu and contact search - everything is up to par. <br><br><h4>  NFC </h4><br>  Well, I can not fail to mention the built-in NFC-module, of course.  Fortunately, NFC is now gaining momentum - MTS offers NFC payments, Beeline - use NFC to travel by metro, Yandex.Maps allow you to see the rest of the trips on your travel card.  Of course, an NFC chip can be purchased separately - but the embedded solutions out of the box have their own charm. <br><br><h4>  Filling </h4><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/gtv/blog/145489/">next post,</a> colleagues from the GTV channel disassembled the Xperia P. Video about how the device works from the inside: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Sv_m2E50RY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhQ1UJ--2m9pJleTMTwJPmRARyUSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  <b>Processor:</b> Dual-Core 1 GHz NovaThor U8500 <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 122 x 59.5 x 10.5 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 126 grams <br>  <b>Body colors:</b> silver, black, red <br>  <b>Display:</b> 4 ‚Äù, 960x540, scratch resistant <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 16 GB, 13 GB user available <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 8 MP with a quick launch function, the ability to shoot Full HD video + front camera <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1305 mAh <br>  <b>Talk time:</b> 6 hours <br>  <b>Standby time:</b> 470 hours <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  In the lineup of 2012, Sony Xperia P still looks like a happy medium - a bit smaller in size and diagonal of the screen than the flagship - Xperia S, Xperia P pleases with more verified ergonomics and cool design (after all, plastic cannot compete with aluminum) opportunities.  Smaller megapixels in the camera and gigahertz in the processor is an acceptable sacrifice, compensated by a more modest price tag.  On sale Sony Xperia P since the beginning of May, its price <a href="http://www.svyaznoy.ru/catalog/phone/224/1487851">in the "Connected" - 19 990 p.</a>  The difference in pixels and inches of the screen for everyday use is also invisible.  But the catchy and stylish look is always and immediately visible.  He has one undocumented option - charisma.  Xperia P will not be lost on the background of competing smartphones in any company - either externally or by its capabilities.  And this is a very strong argument. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144089/</a></p>
