Today I will touch on the software component and the communicator shell.  I will touch upon usability issues and present the data on battery life to your attention. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/01/12/3710132_400x334.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I would like to start with a good one.  HTC stuffed a large amount of RAM and ROM memory into Iolite, plus they put a stone at 528 MHz, which is undoubtedly felt when communicating with the device.  The main reason for buying a new device was the lack of system resources of my HTC Touch, so this time I tried to pick up a communicator with the stuffing to the maximum ... I found Iolite. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  On the face of a beautiful, kind inside ... Manila 2D </h4><br>  HTC's proprietary shell, Manila 2D (TouchFlo 3D), is installed on Iolite.  I will not talk much about the shell, <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/review/htc-touch-diamond-full-part2.shtml">more than enough</a> is written about Manila on the net.  Let me just say that it is very pleasant and multifunctional.  It is a bit strange that it is the first Manila, since the company already has in its arsenal the next version of the shell - TouchFlo 3D 2, which is used in the HTC Touch HD (Blackstone).  Given the fact that Blackstone was six months before Iolite, it is not entirely clear why the company refused to use its latest developments in the new device.  As if there was not, Manila 2D works great and is very responsive to the user's actions.  Everything just flies!  No delays and slowdowns.  Finally, you can understand what the Taiwanese wanted to show us, since the advent of the HTC Diamond. <br><br>  Since we are talking about the interface, it is worth mentioning the Start menu, which is increased under the control of your fingers.  The same is true for the task manager in the upper right corner.  Finally, the tasks can get a finger, and close them there, right from the box.  I was not surprised by the owners of HTC Diamond, Touch Pro and Co., they also had this by default.  But all the others will be useful to know. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/56/3709997_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/56/3709989_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709978_240x320.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But personally, I am not satisfied with the "launcher" of programs (it is too poor) and there is not enough file manager optimized for the fingers.  I understand that for such purposes there is Resco Explorer and SPB Plus, but since HTC has already taken on the mission of optimizing WM for people, why not make such a necessary part in the household.  However, today among all the devices on WM, HTC clearly wins against its competitors due to the TouchFLO 3D shell. <br><br>  The only difference between Aiolit Manila and previous versions is the presence of an additional tab <b>, Footprints</b> . <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6PpQKJB95o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjl-trHNgfp8_S35q9k8N3ToWARIg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As conceived by HTC, Footprints was supposed to become a certain business card of this model, optimized for navigation and travel.  If anyone does not know, the second name is Iolita HTC Touch Cruise 2009 or Touch Cruise II.  In fact, the function is absolutely useless and stupid.  The photographs obtained in this mode have minimal resolution and are no good.  In addition, geo-tags are saved only on the communicator itself, and as soon as you transfer photos to the BB, all geo-data is lost. <br>  Moreover, the ‚ÄúFootprints‚Äù function seems useless in light of the fact that there is a ‚ÄúGPS photo‚Äù mode in the camera, which records the coordinates in a photo file. <br><br>  I can not fail to mention Opera Mobile 9.5 built into the shell - it's just a song!  If on the HTC Touch it barely moved and anyway gave me a lot of pleasure, now I understood how it really should work.  And why the owner of iPhones piss boiling water from your browser. <br>  In the process of surfing on full-fledged Internet sites, double-tap is not only that increases the selected area, but also optimizes the text to the size of the device window.  See examples below.  What is important, even such a heavyweight for mobile surfing, like ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù, rose.  )) In general, it is a pleasure!  Slowly, I do not take it away from the ‚Äúmobile view‚Äù mode. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709974_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709975_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709972_240x320.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For fine settings of the program shell, I recommend <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D427392">Manila 2D Customizer</a> and <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D418151">Advanced Configuration Tool</a> (for the second thank you go to the flaresun <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/flaresun/" class="user_link">comrade</a> ).  With their help, you can do almost everything.  Starting from the removal of unnecessary tabs in Manila, and ending with the drop-down menus in the Command Manager. <br><br><h4>  And love in our village has a battery ... </h4><br>  Although the battery supplied with Iolite is small (1100 mAh), it lasts for quite a long period.  The device carefully consumes battery energy.  One charge lasts on average for 2 days of use.  It goes without saying that if you don‚Äôt stick out from the communicator and run everything you can on it, the battery will not last a day.  After an hour of listening to online radio broadcasts via Wi-Fi, the battery heats up a bit.  However, compared to the stove that the HTC Touch turned into after half an hour of work with Wi-Fi turned on, it‚Äôs impossible to compare.  Noticeable changes for the better. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/54/3709965_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/56/3709995_240x320.png" alt="image"><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/21/12/55/3709967_240x320.png" alt="image"><br>  In the above images, under the concept of <b>"device was used,"</b> was usually quite active use.  Either surfing the Internet or installing programs with subsequent reboots and testing. <br><br>  And now some statistics on battery consumption: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 15% of the battery for 2 hours of using the device with Wi-Fi on. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 15% battery for 1 hour of telephone conversation <br>  ‚Ä¢ 25% of the battery for 2 hours of listening to music in headphones + 1 hour of listening through the hardware speaker <br>  ‚Ä¢ 7% battery for half an hour of GPS navigation via iGo in ‚Äúoverview mode‚Äù <br><br>  The place will also mention the function of auto-adjusting the backlight of the screen, which I turned off 2 days after use.  Maybe I have too high demands, but it is convenient for me when the screen is bright enough. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Look, the text turned out a bit too much.  I will leave part of it for later, so as not to overload the reader.  In general, be the third part!  )) <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> As a conclusion of the second part of the review I would like to summarize that I am satisfied with the battery!  The program shell, too ... With the advent of Iolit, I refused a large number of auxiliary software that I used for years.  The device is still satisfied, although the flaws mentioned in the first part of the review sometimes still do.  Thanks for attention!  To be continued. <br><br>  <b>PPPS</b> To all those who tried to convince me, in the first part, that there is a big difference between the concepts of ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù and ‚Äúcommunicator‚Äù, I went to a meeting.  Although, as such, I hardly see any difference.  )) <br><br>  <b>Links to other parts of the review: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/59194/">part 1</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/61554/">part 3</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60094/</a></p>
