  <section class="page js-page"><h1>EGE through the eyes of another admin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/62109/">post</a> describes the verification technology of the USE CROC, but our region has worked and continues to work on the FTT technology (Federal Testing Center).  The main wave of the USE is almost over, so there is time to write an article about how everything is happening now.  I have long wanted to write this article, but somehow I doubted whether it was possible or not, there is something secret about it or not.  There are no documents forbidding me to talk about technology, no, so I decided. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  There will be no comments on the quality of the software or the evaluation of the technical component, as this is simply not correct.  In fact, for the uninitiated person, everything looks amazing.  At least it impressed me at first. <br><br><h5>  Database collection and examination </h5><br>  Pre-collected data on current year graduates and people who want to take the exam (not enrolled past graduates, returned from the army and many others), the organizers of the exam in the PES (Examination point).  This is necessary in order to know how many people will pass exams, which exams, for the subsequent verification of forms, without it at all :)

      Data collection takes place with the help of DH programs, there is software at the regional level, and there is municipal software.  In the areas they collect data, they are stuffed into the software, transferred to us, we collect and send it to the CG. <br><br>  Next is the distribution of PES organizers and students.  Those who pass on the TED, later on in the TED will be distributed among the audiences so that the children will not know in advance where they will sit, the organizers are also distributed among the audiences for the same reason. <br><br>  Data collection - the song is still that ... During the period of data collection, children begin to change personal data with an incomprehensible madness, who lost their passport, who was adopted, someone had an error in the database, someone changed their name, etc.  And with what speed the set of exams is changing, which the child plans to take is worth guessing.  We generally have seven Fridays in the week :) Knowing the most accurate number of person-exams is important.  Since the CIMs themselves (test and measurement materials), the forms that the students fill out at the time of delivery come, naturally, from Moscow, we ourselves do not print anything (unlike CROC technology). <br><br>  According to the KROK technology in the RCIA (regional information processing center), i.e.  in our center, registration forms must be printed, with the student's data already printed and this form is attached to the IC itself (individual set).  According to the CT technology, the child fills in the registration form himself.  In total, we scan and recognize many more forms.  Due to the fact that the curves of the letters of graduates are not always correctly recognized, there is a problem of linking the results of processing to a specific student from the database.  In my opinion, KROK technology is more successful in this respect. <br><br>  On the day of the exam after the USE, all forms are returned to us, here they are accepted in certain forms and in a certain system are arranged in cabinets. <br><br><h5>  Treatment </h5><br>  Here is used ABBYY TestReader.  The forms are first scanned, then recognized, verified, printed by experts.  Part A and B are checked automatically, Part C is checked by experts. <br><br>  We scan on Fujitsu fi series scanners.  You can read about scanning speed and other information on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, I will not write about it.  Scanned images are received at the recognition station, by name it is clear what it does.  Forms C after verification go to print the work for the experts, and the registration forms and answers of the AB to be sent to the CG.  The work is carried out by experts and the results of their verification are also sent to DH.  All 3 forms form a single set.  AB and C answer forms are not personalized, i.e.  no one in the processing knows whose forms are being checked, the forms themselves are linked by barcodes. <br><br>  All data is transmitted to the ERBD (single distributed database) by replicating our local database through specially organized crypto channels.  So this year, previously formed XMLki and sent to manual, now this process is automated.  You do not need to receive and send anything manually, i.e.  races with flash drives in the center ended.  It was necessary to transfer all data from one network to another, since the network where the processing takes place must be completely isolated.  Now, through the crypto-tunnel, data can be received and sent without running around, and this makes me extremely happy, but there are also some minuses of course.  I think next year there will be no problems with this at all) <br><br>  In general, everything, processing 1 exam takes us 3-4 days, exams are quite a lot, so the work is almost around the clock for a month. <br><br>  After processing, we obtain the results from the FTT, which also need to be processed, to calculate all the necessary statistics for the methodologists.  Here CT no software is provided.  Therefore, we wrote our own and are still working successfully. <br><br>  In general, everything, ready to answer your questions) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62906/</a></p>
