  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We respect your time. Or how to kill one hour</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Habr! <br><br>  Today I want to tell you about one amazing place.  I will not explicitly call him, otherwise they will call him a malevolent and bad radish. <br><br>  In general, by the will of fate, I was in one of the most popular Belarusian banks.  The task was trivial - the validity of the plastic card came to an end and I needed to make a new one. <br>  I started by calling the Center for Banking Services (CBU).  On the phone, they listed what I needed to take with me: Card, passport;  warned that my card would be withdrawn (at least 2 more weeks before its end), well, it should be so.  Going and going. <br>  Upon arrival, I entered the CBU building and was pleasantly surprised - I did not see a single client in a huge and beautiful building.  ‚ÄúWell, I'll figure it out quickly‚Äù - a joyful thought came to me. <a name="habracut"></a>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Then began such a fierce horror that I almost got hysterical.  He went to the nearest employee, said hello.  He asked if I could update her card.  She replied that yes, you can do everything ... Only I'm busy right now, please come up to that window along the window to the left ... Well, I'm not proud.  Came up.  However, the employee who sat in that window was so busy with a telephone conversation (as I understand it with the client, of course) that she did not even pay attention to me.  Okay.  The worst thing is to run through the remaining 10+ windows, I discovered that in none of them I can do the operation I need ... <br>  During the time that I spent on bypassing the windows (minutes 4), none of the above staff could not distract from me.  At the same time, the first one and a half minutes called some Light and complained about the fact that her ‚Äúprinter does not appear‚Äù and she already ‚Äúneeds to work‚Äù.  Sveta (the same manager, not an engineer at all) approached, lamented (‚Äúoh, how so‚Äù) and left.  Of course, that such employees are not up to me with my shitty card.  They do not have a printer! <br><br>  While I was waiting (at the request of the same employee without a printer), I walked over to the nightstand that read "information."  There he took a booklet and read on it ‚ÄúTired of the queue?  We respect your time. ‚Äù  Well, yes, our people have always been a master on slogans ... <br><br>  In the end, I did get to the coveted third employee who could solve this non-trivial rebus with a card.  I myself called him "Megamind", because he was the most advanced of them all - he made the cards and the printer worked for him!  The first thing he did was punch my old card with a hole punch and took it.  And then he said that the new will be ready in 5 days, and since this is a Saturday, I can come in a week.  No, of course I understand everything, but why not do this operation at the time of the delivery of a new card?  Then, after filling out the questionnaire (and why, because they have all my data in the database), I was sent to the cashier (from the 2nd to the basement floor) to pay the fee for the card.  After standing in line at the cashier, having paid the required amount, I received a piece of paper (cashier's check) and an instruction to return to the Megamind and give him a piece of paper.  At the same time, everyone again asked for my passport ... <br>  Gentlemen, I myself am an IT person and I understand perfectly well that a payment can be withdrawn from the account, that you can accept it on the spot, you can even pay it on hand, but why the heck do you carry a piece of paper?  The XXI century, the third millennium, thin clients, virtualization ... Paper. <br><br>  Okay.  A piece of paper is like a piece of paper ... But the ways of getting Internet banking simply killed me ... I quote from the site: <br>  <i>Choose the most convenient way to connect:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>1st method</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>On the website -------.by go to the "Registration Center" -&gt; "Application for connection".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Fill out the application, following the instructions on the site.</i>  <i>In this step, create and enter a password and Authorization code that you will use to work in the Internet Bank.</i> <i><br></i>  <i><b>Contact the nearest Bank Banking Services Center (CBU) for registration in the system.</b></i>  <i><b>You must have a passport!</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the printed application you will find the login (user name).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>2nd method</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><b>To open the service, contact the nearest bank banking service center with a passport.</b></i>  <i>Be sure to include your mobile phone number of the Belarusian operator.</i>  <i>In the printed application you will find the login (user name).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>On the website ----------.by go to the "Registration Center" and find the item "Set passwords by login and M-code."</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Enter the login from the application.</i>  <i>From a registered mobile phone, request an M-code, following the instructions on the site.</i>  <i>Create and enter your password and Authorization code (A-code) to work in the Internet bank.</i> <br><br>  And if the city does not have a CBU?  Go to the nearest CBU?  Or can you still make Internet banking available from the Internet?  After all, the bank received all the data when registering a card?  Is it really that obvious that they are driving the bank into a stupor? <br>  It amazes me most of all that a bank is an institution that should be one step ahead of all its life in terms of servicing, fighting for a client - because they earn on our money ... <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, I have everything. <br><br>  UPD: Since the country must know its heroes: this is <a href="http://priorbank.by/">Priorbank</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136872/</a></p>
