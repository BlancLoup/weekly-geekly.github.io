  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 facts about CRM that will disappoint you</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What do most CRM system buyers do?  Almost every leader is preparing to meet with CRM vendors.  For this, he makes a list of his questions.  Often the buyer approaches with the utmost care to generate questions.  Tries to make them uncomfortable for the seller.  Such that the representative of CRM told all the pitfalls of their product.  At the meeting itself, the potential buyer asks questions and asks to demonstrate the answers using the example of the proposed CRM. <br><br>  Every day we serve about hundreds of incoming leads through our <a href="https://webproduction.ua/crm-sistema">CRM OneBox</a> - and now we are ready to share insanity, which 99% of all customers ask us.  And not only here. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Fact 1. 80% of all questions are repeated at each meeting.</b> <br>  Learn your: <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúIs there an opportunity to record calls in your CRM?‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúHow to track the completion of transactions?‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúWhat reports do you have?‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúIs your CRM connected to my 1C?‚Äù </li><li>  ‚ÄúAnd how are you better than competitors?‚Äù </li></ul>

      <b>Fact 2. 80% of all CRM vendors are almost flawlessly prepared for such issues.</b> <br>  Stuffed with scripts and prepared answers.  They are taught this before he picks up the phone from the first customer! <br><br>  <b>Fact 3. Buy from those who better entered in the picture of the buyer your answer.</b> <br>  When asking a question, the buyer is already holding a picture of how they see the answer.  The client even presents the task solution interface.  Those who are the most like, they buy from him.  Why do you think each vendor asks ‚ÄúWhat software did you use before?‚Äù ... <br><br>  <b>Fact 4. In 80% of cases, such a purchase does not give any financial result for the client.</b> <br>  Money is spent on maintaining the image of habitual thinking and perception.  Money is wasted! <br><br>  <b>Fact 5. The buyer does not stop there.</b>  <b>The script repeats.</b> <br><br><h5>  And how should you choose CRM? </h5><br>  Here is the most simplified algorithm for effective selection of CRM, which is not obvious and seems counterintuitive, but will lead to successful implementation. <br><br>  <b>Step 1. Write the goal of CRM implementation.</b> <br>  Express your goal in sales growth or other specific measurable indicators.  Any number, as long as it boosts your sales. <br><br>  <b>Step 2. Write 80% of all factors that influence the achievement of this goal.</b> <br>  Write thoughtfully.  Group your thoughts into logical blocks.  Write global directions, do not meddle in the nuances and particulars.  For example: <br><ul><li>  increasing the amount of incoming flow to the enterprise </li><li>  increase sales efficiency of cold sales </li><li>  increasing the efficiency of processing leads and turning them into orders </li><li>  increase the impact of re-acquisitions </li></ul><br><br>  This does not include such blocks as increasing the speed of delivery. <br><br>  <b>Step 3. Write the reasons that affect the achievement of the above tasks.</b> <br>  For example: <br><ul><li>  increase sales efficiency of cold sales </li><li>  Improving the incoming customer base for which do HZ </li><li>  increase in number of tasks / projects / orders per day </li><li>  improving the quality of tasks / projects / orders </li><li>  improving the quality of repeated calls after completing tasks / projects / orders </li><li>  correct work with the objectors, systematic passive informing them with the help of e-mail </li><li>  improving the quality of control and training of operators who perform such staff </li></ul><br>  So for each item!  Carefully, thoroughly, thoughtfully. <br><br>  <b>Step 4. Select the items you want to solve with CRM.</b> <br>  At a meeting with the CRM vendor, show your plan and ask: ‚ÄúHow can I solve my problem with your CRM?‚Äù.  Let you objectively, accurately, consistently show how your problem is solved in CRM. <br><br>  Now you can safely choose the CRM you need.  And it may not be at all like the one that you have already imagined.  And your implementation will be successful, because there is a goal and it is achieved. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296782/</a></p>
