In open chat rooms it is possible.  In the end, I, of course, again fantasize, but any instant messenger can change its ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù in order to comply with the legislation of the country in which it works, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.interfax.ru/russia/607579">said</a> Zharov. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Recall that on March 20, 2018, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299243/">notified Telegram</a> of the need to provide the FSB with keys to decrypt user messages within 15 days.  The deadline for provision of keys expired on April 4. <br><br>  On March 30, Telegram lawyers <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299589/">notified Roskomnadzor</a> that it was technically impossible to provide the FSB with keys to decrypt user correspondence.  ‚ÄúTelegram made the decision to condescend again and explain to the officials that these requirements are in principle impracticable,‚Äù <a href="https://t.me/pchikov/883">wrote the</a> head of the Agora human rights group representing the interests of the messenger, Pavel Chikov.

      In the published response of the messenger to the notice of Roskomnadzor, it is noted that Telegram has two types of messaging: cloud chat and secret chat.  ‚ÄúMessages transmitted via‚Äú secret chats ‚Äùare never stored on Telegram servers.  The correspondence of users of ‚Äúcloud chat‚Äù is stored in encrypted form, distributed between different subsystems and is never stored in one place, ‚Äùthe letter says. <br><br>  Zharov believes that Telegram is cunning when he talks about the impossibility of transferring encryption keys to the FSB.  In fact, it is technically possible. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to the statement of the lawyers who accompany them, they say they will not comply with the requirements of the law.  They say that it is impossible.  In fact, this is a certain amount of guile.  Because, as for unencrypted chats, experts in the public plane said that the provision of keys is possible, ‚Äùsaid Alexander Zharov and added that, in general, this issue requires technical expertise. <br><br>  <b>What are encryption keys</b> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Beesfhttpc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The head of Roskomandzor stressed that the main stumbling block in this story is the lack of ‚Äúgoodwill interaction‚Äù, which is why there is no dialogue: ‚ÄúThere is no dialogue and this is the saddest thing in this whole story,‚Äù he noted. <br><br>  On April 6, Roskomnadzor <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299725/">filed a lawsuit</a> with the Tagansky District Court of Moscow, demanding ‚Äúrestricting access to the information resources of the information dissemination organizer on the Internet Telegram in Russia.  ‚ÄúThe statement of claim was filed in connection with the detection by the FSB of Russia of the failure of Telegram Messenger Limited Liability Partnership to fulfill the obligations of the organizer of the dissemination of information established by clause 4.1 of art.  10.1 ", - said on the website of the regulator. <br><br>  Telegram lawyers promptly <a href="https://t.me/pchikov/904">published a response</a> that the Telegram position remains the same: the requirements of the FSB to provide access to private correspondence of users are unconstitutional, not based on law, technically and legally impracticable, therefore, the requirement to block is also unreasonable. <br><br>  Pavel Chikov also <a href="https://t.me/pchikov/906">explained</a> why Roskomnadzor again went to court instead of directly initiating the blocking procedure.  The fact is that from January 1, 2018, changes to the Federal Law on Information entered into force, namely, Article 15.4.  ‚ÄúThe procedure for restricting access to the information resource of the organizer of information dissemination on the Internet.‚Äù  Previously, blocking the organizer of the dissemination of information, for example, the Zello online radio, and the Blackberry Messenger, could have been made by a decision of Roskomnadzor or by a valid court decision.  But Telegram was not registered in the register of information dissemination organizers - Roskomnadzor independently entered it there.  And now Roskomnadzor interpreted changes in legislation as a duty to file a lawsuit on blocking in court. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLet's eat the elephant in parts.  Now we have filed a lawsuit and will wait for a court decision, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5acb28179a7947bea8eef7ae">said</a> Zharov.  ‚ÄúBye for now.‚Äù <br><br>  Information on the claim of Roskomnadzor has not yet <a href="https://mos-gorsud.ru/search%3FcourtAlias%3Dtaganskij%26caseNumber%3D%26instance%3D%26processType%3D%26codex%3D%26judge%3D%26publishingState%3D%26documentType%3D%26participant%3D%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%26year%3D2018%26caseDateFrom%3D%26caseDateTo%3D%26caseFinalDateFrom%3D%26caseFinalDateTo%3D%26caseLegalForceDateFrom%3D%26caseLegalForceDateTo%3D%26docsDateFrom%3D%26docsDateTo%3D%26documentStatus%3D%26page%3D1">been published</a> on the website of the Tagansky Court.  In general, Roskomnadzor is now involved in hundreds of lawsuits: only in Moscow in 2017, he acted as a plaintiff or defendant in 675 cases, in I quarter.  2018 - 233 cases). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358026/</a></p>
