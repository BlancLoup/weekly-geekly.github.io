Properly, the goal is to summarize from my bell tower everything that I knew and enjoyed in this beautiful Browser.  I repeat, I do not pretend to the fullness of the narration, because  Advanced users, I am sure and I hope, will be able to add and add. <br><br>  Opera is a ‚Äúcombine‚Äù capable of providing the user with the convenience of viewing Internet resources, using the mail, irc, rss (and sometimes icq) client in one interface.  In many ways, this decision is advantageous for me.  Mail M2 and rss are a great mail center.  irc is a good bonus when you need to enter the network, but the client is not at hand. <br>  Opera can do a lot.  And many tricks remain behind the scenes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So recently offered a cross-platform tool to transfer bookmarks in a crowd - the use of Sessions.  It was also very convenient to export rss-streams from the Opera and slip them painlessly into Google Reader.  The same Google borrowed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãworking with mail for a ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù Gmail with Opera M2.  Finds such as Contacts and Notes often help and save in emergency situations.  The address bar with the 'g phrase' (or 'y phrase' in the case of Runet for Yandex search) directs us directly to Google with search results already on the 'phrase' ... The interface, according to my observations, is configured much faster, more flexible and more convenient, than in competitive browsers. <br>  We have already talked about the manner of working with the program <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/17269.html">using the keyboard</a> and the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/23049.html">SpeedDial</a> element (a <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/23049.html">comment</a> about the possibility of adding such a function to FF).

      You can talk a lot, but here it is not interesting to read - you need to try, poke.  I recommend clicking in Opera F1 (in a new page) and starting to figure it out.  I intend to miss such convenient things as Mouse Gestrues, voice control, quick settings (such as: on / off proxy, reloading the current page from the cache, browser identification), Autofill fields from previously filled (meaning the user's personal information is offered by the browser itself while filling Web forms) and much more. <br>  And now to the particulars. <br><h4>  For starters, about the "old." </h4><br>  Since version 9.20, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/tools/">DevConsole has</a> appeared (here is a little about <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2650.0">setting up the Developer Console</a> ), which makes life easier for Web developers and makes it harder for FireFox devotees. <br><br>  ‚ÄúFile browser‚Äù, which often saved me in the classroom at the institute, to search for files, answers to tests, in an internet cafe, etc. <br>  just type " <strong>file: // localhost / c:</strong> " or " <strong>c: \</strong> ". <br><br>  For some reason, users sometimes make assemblies (their versions) of the browser.  <a href="http://www.filespace.ru/soft/Internet/opera/Opera9-NashaLife.rar.html">NashaLife</a> and <a href="http://opera-ac.com/">OperaAC</a> are available for download.  The latter is a kind of monster with an awkward design and a couple extra.  programs included, such as Proxymitron.  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D744.0">Discussion</a> (long and dull). <br>  I also plan to release either a separate pack with my version of the interface and generally browser customization or just ready and customized UserJS + UserCSS in the future. <br><br><h3>  Interface </h3><br>  It uses its own graphic interface.  That is why it is impossible to put, say Google Bar or Roboform on Opera.  However, nothing human is alien to Opera.  The panel for <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1612.0">Google</a> and <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1629.0">Yandex is</a> present. <br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/3034/7ml9.th.png"><img src="http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/6743/3vv8.th.png">  . <br><br>  Opera offers truly endless options for customizing the interface.  Moreover, a person is far from having to be a programmer, or at least know JavaScript.  Anyone can do this. <br>  There is <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1540.0">a whole section</a> in the most complete in the informative plan of the Runet site - <a href="http://operafan.net/">Operafan</a> , dedicated to Opera-buttons and interface.  There are whole sets of buttons that allow you to do truly great things.  Then bring their functionality for a long time and look for links too.  But the possibilities, say, for dividing the current page into 2 vertically for the subsequent copy-paste / editing, I saw only in the opera.  Or a button ‚Äúkilling‚Äù the content on the page (useful for printing)? .. Instant translator with the syntax 'eng ru' in the request ... Moving spam to the recycle bin and clearing it with one button? <br><br><h3>  individual plugins </h3><br>  Fortunately, Opera does not need a large number of third-party programs for comfortable operation.  In fact, it is possible without them at all.  However, for quite comfortable work 1-2 is enough: <br><br>  About OBook plugin [ <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D351.0">1</a> ], [ <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1270.0">2</a> ] recently <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/23575.html">told</a> recently.  A great tool to keep offline archive of resources and documents.  It also allows complex and painless transfer (export, import) from one computer to another. <br><br>  The Opera has a feature that I personally like - after clicking on the link leading to the file, the download starts immediately after the save dialog appears, contrary to the IE rule, to start the download only after specifying the recording location.  However, for owners of thick channels without an unlimited Internet, this feature is a bug, because  they sometimes do not want to start uploading an unknown amount of data (why and why should we miss).  There is a convenient plugin that <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1026.0">determines the size of the link</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2827.0">oGet 2</a> is an even easier and more convenient file <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2827.0">upload</a> in Opera.  Yes, there is a convenient and functional DownloadMaster, which, although not expertly, is built into Opera and allows you to upload files with one click.  This plugin also provides advanced integration capabilities, thereby allowing you to work with file storage directly. <br><br><h3>  UserJS and UserCSS </h3><br>  First of all, you need to know <a href="http://operafan.net/component/option,com_smf/Itemid,50/topic,740.msg5985/,">how to install UserCSS</a> and <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D97.0">what UserJS is</a> <br><br>  In Opera for the user, the power of CSS is manifested mainly in the ability to cut banners, advertisements, etc. ... They are particularly effective on Opera 9.x branches, since  use CSS2 (3) selectors. <br>  <strong>UserCSS</strong> : <br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D994.0">Hidecertainsizes.css</a> - filter, cutting banners by size. <br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1019.0">URL-block.css</a> is a filter that cuts URLs by masks. <br>  There are also filters for blocking Flash-content - no_flash.css and flashblocker ( <a href="">download</a> ). <br><br>  <strong>Userjs</strong> <br>  All the power of JS in Opera embodied in such scripts, greatly expanding the functionality.  Supplemented by bookmarklets, they are a cross-platform, functional and reliable solution for the Opera user.  Once written, the script works on most versions of Opera in any OS and on any platform (Opera for Devices). <br><br>  <strong>UserJS from Mikivanich</strong> : image_reloader <br>  So according to my distant idea, comrade Mikivanch, who primarily makes office toys like &lt;a href=" pas <a href="http://www.puzzleclub.ru/">www.puzzleclub.ru</a> ‚Äù&gt; PuzzleClub, a script was made that simply loads the pictures. Due to this, the mode ‚Äúshow only cached images "and too many actions provided by the developer to reload one specific image (by the way, Safari and FF seem to be impossible to do. For some reason, browsers only offer to open the image in the new Taba. The same trouble with Winmobile with Opera). <br><br>  The script is elegant and simple - we hold down the mouse button on the desired image and, after the interval set in milliseconds, the image is loaded.  The combination of Ctrl + click also works. <br><br>  <a href="">image_reloader.js</a> <br>  <a href="">simple_image_reloader.js</a> (does not load background images) <br>  For version 9.10 and later: <br>  <a href="">image_reloader_for_opera_9.1.js</a> <br>  <a href="">simple_image_reloader_for_opera_9.1.js</a> (does not load background images). <br>  For details and creation history <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D987.0">read the thread in the forum.</a> <br><br>  <strong>UserJS by Mikivanich</strong> : SEOBar. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a0a/fc1/6b5/a0afc16b5dc84be0eeec8543494046f3.gif" width="450" height="22" alt="seobar_yandex_bug.gif" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/content/view/191/2/">SEObar: manual</a> - detailed description of the script. <br>  This script has been hard earned.  Working need. <br>  Mikivanch Domestic Skrpitovatel designed a great interface and powerful functionality.  The script is able to check the availability of a new version and has several options for displaying information.  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1451.0">Discussion and version history of the script</a> . <br><br>  It was also a convenient lotion to AWStats, which patched the sins of the original functionality.  So she autosummated the result of the filter, saving up to 2 hours of work per week. <br>  Who needs it, find and post links with the permission of the author. <br><br>  <strong>UserJS by Mikivanich</strong> : Searcher <br>  <a href="http://www.puzzleclub.ru/files/searcher/">Searcher</a> .  Searches for the specified string in the text of the web page, in the addresses of links and pictures, in the contents of the select element.  If matches are found, the script displays their number and highlights them in color.  Searcher allows you to search for strings with whole words, case sensitive and using regular expressions.  When searching for relative addresses of links and images are not translated into absolute. <br>  Detailed information, help and latest version is always available at <a href="http://www.puzzleclub.ru/files/searcher/">http://www.puzzleclub.ru/files/searcher/</a> . <br><br>  <strong>UserJS by Mikivanich</strong> : Uploader <br>  The most popular script Mikivanch is a script for easy downloading of files from file sharing sites.  You can talk for a long time, but it's easier to <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2831.0">read the author himself</a> . <br>  Holds: <br>  rapidshare_com.js for Opera 8, 9 |  Version 1.23 of August 4, 2007 <br>  filefactory_com.js for Opera 8, 9 |  Version 1.11 of 08/04/2007 <br>  megaupload_com.js for Opera 8, 9 |  Version 1.20 of 08/20/2007 <br>  ifolder.js for Opera 8, 9 |  Version 1.14 of 07/07/2007 <br>  dump_ru.js for Opera 8, 9 |  Version 1.01 of 08/12/2007 <br><br>  <strong>UserJS</strong> : different scripts <br><br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D557.0">text-replacement.js</a> - text replacement script.  On the left - what we are looking for, on the right for what we replace. <br><br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D3496.0">zoom-image.user</a> - image scaling.  It allows you not to use the injectable KP_Plus / KP_Minus, but only to move the mouse to the picture and press + to increase the scale of it.  Other page elements do not change. <br><br>  For Gmail lovers, there is a <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D3360.0">Script for representing GMail tags in the form of a tree</a> .  Yes, FF has a lot more additions and improvements for Gmail, but for me personally, there is enough of what is. <br><br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D1517.0">Virtual Keyboard</a> . <br><br>  There is also <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D2737.0">a development</a> that allows you to save a page with additional options: convert2PHF.js.  For example, remove all external links from the page, delete graphics.  Folk sculptors: profiT, Mikivanch.  The script is especially useful when you need to save the html-page for viewing on the PDA (in my case, Palm, whose browser will create everything with each external link to get into the Internet). <br><br><h3>  Sidebar </h3><br>  Opera, like FireFox, has a sidebar or sidebar.  It allows you to shove the usual html-page into itself and make it part of the interface.  From useful: <br>  <a href="http://operafan.net/forum/index.php%3Ftopic%3D400.0">Uploader panel</a> - allows uploading an image to 8-10 imagehost servers in two (not more) clicks.  Thanks <a href="http://www.elv1s.ru/">ELV1S'u</a> .  (go directly <a href="http://uploader-panel.com/up.html">to the panel itself and add to bookmarks</a> ), <a href="http://pda.weather.yandex.ru/">Yandex forecast</a> . <br>  I have a lot of sidebar pages in my browser for work.  Conveniently, damn it. <br><br><h4>  Now about the new. </h4><br>  Today comes the new 9.50 version of the browser.  From the innovations promised: <br><ul><li>  The new ECMAscript core (also known as JavaScript) is faster and requires less resources to work. <br>  Thousands (and they say, thousands) of errors in the rendering kernel have been fixed, which will improve compatibility with many sites. <br>  Added support for CSS3 overflow-x and overflow-y properties.  Here, developers have gone on about Internet Explorer, in which these properties are processed (perhaps the only thing in IE from CSS3). <br>  Added support for getters and setters from javascript 1.5 <br>  Improved support for visual editing (Rich Text Editing). <br>  Resolved issues observed on a variety of Google resources. <br>  Added support for screen readers such as Window-Eyes, Jaws and VoiceOver under OS X. <br>  Improved intellectual navigation through the elements of the page (spatial navigation).  Newcomers will now be easier to use keyboard shortcuts. <br>  All keyboard shortcuts are disabled by default. <br>  Improved support for Windows Vista, incl.  integration into the system. <br>  In OS X, the browser now looks like a native OS X application: improved tabs, default fonts and flashing buttons. <br>  Opera will now be available in the 64-bit version (for FreeBSD and Linux). <br>  The new indexing algorithm and the format of the storage of letters in the built-in mail client Opera Mail, which now consume less resources, less appeal to the hard drive and run faster. <br>  New IMAP core in Opera Mail. <br>  Fixed Opera freezing while checking mail and news feeds. <br><br>  However, today it became known that the video has leaked to the network (already unavailable) and the description of those features of the new version, which until the last moment should have remained ‚Äúa terrible secret with nine and a half seals‚Äù and were not previously announced.  You can go and be curious <a href="http://operafan.net/content/view/261/2/">here</a> . <br><br>  I advise fans to stock megabytes of traffic for 10t and try to discuss a new product.  I would like to hope quality, as usual. <br><br>  <strong>update</strong> : Opera 9.50 alpha release is <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/opera/24543.html">out</a> . <br><br>  Cross-post on <a href="http://www.pudovkin.com/">your blog</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13790/</a></p>
