      The startup team was divided into three groups according to the nature of their activities: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ SMM (2 people); <br>  ‚Ä¢ SEO (5 people); <br>  ‚Ä¢ PR (4 people). <br><br>  Each group and member individually created their own unique link with tags for tracking conversion rates in Google Analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/345/288/26a/34528826a775083493afac31aebdd872.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The battle between the departments was decided from 07.07 to 03.08. <br><br>  In theory, everyone had to apply their traditional tools in the process of attracting traffic to the site, but in the course went a variety of techniques.  Each team had its own specific tactics, everything that was considered necessary was used: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1b9/9ba/73a/1b99ba73a2899ab33ff8f7fbcf4d4790.png" alt="image">  <b>Esemschiki</b> felt like a fish in water!  We posted daily on <i>Polyglot's</i> communities on social networks <i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/2polyglot">Facebook</a></i> , <i><a href="https://plus.google.com/%2B2polyglotservice/posts">Google+</a></i> , <i><a href="https://twitter.com/polyglotservice">Twitter</a></i> , <i><a href="https://vk.com/polyglot_service">Vkontakte</a></i> , <i><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/2polyglot/">Pinterest</a></i> , <i><a href="http://2polyglot.tumblr.com/">Tumbler</a></i> , participated in comments in the thematic communities, and also made their own records there, actively added to friends ‚Äî everywhere, respectively, each one substituted its own unique link.  The flow rate of visitors to the site has significantly increased; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/155/630/497/155630497bfbe1110b5ff76771b359f1.png" alt="image">  <b>Seoshniki</b> received a small budget for placing press releases through paid resources.  Free of course involved too.  Like other participants of the competition, the SEO team actively used the opportunity to comment and leave their unique links on social networks.  At the initial stage of the competition, paid advertising has not yet started, so the tools of SEOs were a bit limited, content with affordable ones; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/da0/f22/773/da0f22773654997db69cab624e7b0624.png" alt="image">  <b>The PR people,</b> like the sms of the budget, did not have a budget, therefore, they used to post their articles on various subjects for free, without fail, mentioning our resource.  But after all, the editors on many sites do not allow links to anything in the texts of articles, which means it wasn‚Äôt even necessary to talk about clicking on unique links.  And here, of course, the guys actively used social networks - what is called ‚Äúthrown a cry‚Äù at friends and necessary groups.  For the dates of the competition, the planned e-mail newsletter (which is under the jurisdiction of the PR department) fell to all officially provided addresses, which also gave a certain number of referrals. <br><br>  It is worth telling that on the part of some participants it was not without tricks.  Non-standard methods tried to apply each.  For example, at the request of the SEO team, one of the PR specialists wrote a press release in English and framed his link in the text.  They certainly did not notice this and sent a press release to the newsletter.  It turned out that one department "mutually" worked on the other - a certain number of transitions were distributed to "rivals".  What is called - to achieve the goal, all means are good.  An illustrative situation of the presence of not only healthy team rivalry, but also excitement in working on one common project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/fe5/799/1cc/fe57991cc5b31585a881c0e711eaf9f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now about the prize fund.  Initially, it was decided that after summarizing each loser would throw off a ‚Äúbank‚Äù for 100 UAH, and the ‚Äúbank‚Äù would be received by the winning team!  Everyone liked this decision, the loss of such a sum is not significant, and an approximate calculation of the total ‚Äúbank‚Äù painted prospects in the form of a pleasant little bonus bonus and inspired every team to win. <br><br>  So, on the fact of holding the team competition we received the following: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0b1/bf2/8a9/0b1bf28a9ce59ca679d7ad68a8816b94.png" alt="image">  <b>Traffic.</b>  During the period of our competition, in the active holiday season, the number of visitors to the site has increased more than 2.5 times!  Summing up showed the victory of the SMM team.  The number of people attracted by them to the site turned out to be more than the total number of both rival teams.  True, this effect is objective in a short period of time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c51/ba0/2ef/c51ba02efc5a3aebc035da2776fee68c.png" alt="image">  <b>Mechanism of attracting visitors.</b>  In the absence of any significant budget and in a short time, the dissemination of information through social networks turned out to be most effective.  If the SMM works correctly, then the user reach can be quite high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cc8/33c/e1a/cc833ce1abef4f70d3a22e3b726ee8a1.png" alt="image">  <b>Positive emotions.</b>  We state the fact that both winners and losers got good impressions, as the first ones treated everyone with cakes and juices.  The competition turned out to be interesting for all participants in the project, encouraging and rekindling the work excitement in the ‚Äúdead‚Äù summer season. <br><br>  In the end, everyone was pleased with the competition and the overall results for our <a href="http://2polyglot.com/ur/1781">freelance platform</a> .  Everyone agreed that in the future it is worth repeating this.  It really stimulates the team to work hard on the project and gives higher rates for attracting visitors to the site.  Ultimately, the main result is the higher popularity and recognition of the project you are working on. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294734/</a></p>
