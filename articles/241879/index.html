Of course, all the boys of that time still have memories of the series about Uncle Scrooge, ‚ÄúThe Black Cloak‚Äù and the prefix Dendy, which included almost everything that was on the TV screens of that time.  So hotly promoted to the masses by the ‚ÄúDendy: New Reality‚Äù program, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãstill alive today. <br><br>  The appearance of the "dandy" almost did not change, <a href="http://simbas.ru/">Simba's</a> company is now releasing it.  The console came to me a couple of months ago.  While strolling with his son at the supermarket, the child said: ‚ÄúDad, there is Sega!‚Äù - he is a little familiar with retro-moneymang, consoles and other things, but he is still small and sometimes confuses the names.  Having explained to the child that the games here are simpler and there is a light gun ... ‚ÄúA light gun?  Dad, buy this Segou! ‚ÄùSaid the son.  Small money for a couple of evenings is enough, I thought, but it was not there ...

The power supply does not heat up! <br>   Advantages and disadvantages. <br>  ‚ñåPrice and purchase. <br>  ‚ñåConclusion. <br><br>  The prefix surprisingly caught on and liked the wife (Duck Hunt), son (Bomberman), daughter (Super Mario), each of the household found in it its own piece of happiness. <br><br>  ‚ñå Packing and packaging. <br><br>  So, in a bright box that promises the best games of our childhood and hits of the gaming industry of those years you can find: <br><br>  1. The prefix itself, made surprisingly soundly and firmly, even the lever that needs to get the cartridge will not break at the first meeting one on one with the child. <br><br>  2. A pair of turbo joysticks.  As you can see in the photo, one of them has ‚Äústart‚Äù and ‚Äúselect‚Äù buttons, apparently this is done for authenticity, usually modern ‚ÄúDandy‚Äù are completed with the first two gamepads with a full set of buttons, or worse, ‚Äúsegovy‚Äù joysticks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c0/307/d4c/3c0307d4ce5343df9a4ec673c3f870ad.png"><br><br>  3. The light gun looks impressive, it will only shoot on TVs of the same age as the console.  On modern TVs does not work.  For many, this light gun was the first weapon capable of killing virtual ducks and breaking plates. <br><br>  4. The power supply is very light and small - DOES NOT WARM!  A miracle happened, the calculation of the load was clearly designed by a man of understanding.  I must say that earlier in my childhood the blocks burned one by one (1-2 per year at least). <br><br>  5. AV cable to connect the set-top box to the TV. <br><br>  6. Printed materials - a small leaflet with instructions and a flyer in which I found myself a couple of interesting gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb5/e31/7fe/fb5e317fe6324406a4ee2483ced73a43.png"><br>  <a href="http://vk.com/app4300837_-38061543">EXEQ ACE</a> and a set of consoles for children at ridiculous prices - <a href="http://vk.com/app4300837_-38061543">GURU</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/app4300837_-38061543">Rainbow</a> and <a href="http://www.exeq.ru/produkcija/pristavki/detskie/toy.html">TOY</a> <br><br>  <b>Cord length is an important moment!</b> <br>  Gamepad - 105 cm <br>  Light gun - 120 cm <br>  AV cable - 140 cm <br>  Power supply - 140 cm <br><br>  <b>Prefix</b> <br><br>  Well, what else can you say or show her insides: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Traffic caution</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eec/f64/e23/eecf64e23d9f48c8b3a89e491b11366e.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/749/459/bf8/749459bf846c48e9bb0636d0bf9f5a83.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24b/ead/a0d/24beada0df6d4c64bb788ffbe14069e7.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8d/fca/de5/d8dfcade58084aa6abb4902c94670177.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/668/063/1fd/6680631fd7804405adda1e6291fed9c7.JPG"><br><br></div></div><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/exeq/blog/238207/">Nostalgia for the 90th: Mega Drive Mortal Kombat</a> <br>  and <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/exeq/blog/240099/">Two in one!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/exeq/blog/240099/">Games on GameBoy and Dendy - pocket happiness for the knowledgeable gamer</a> <br><br>  ‚ñåGames. <br><br>  The menu looks like this <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/046/181/7f3/0461817f37034e498e75b824f3e434c9.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Battle City (Tanchiki) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Bomberman (Favorite son game ^^) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Duck Hunt (Duck Hunt, the dog must be killed!), <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Lode runner <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Tetris <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Pac-man <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Super Mario Bros. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Contra <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Dr.  Mario <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Galaxian <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Adventure island <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Excitebike <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Circus charlie <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Arkanoid <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  F-1 Race <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Gradius i <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Karateka <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Track &amp; Field <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/56f/b7d/45356fb7d3c44dbd8a6b8058efb3895d.png">  Soccer <br><br>  Here is a small video in which I test toys with my son: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVIeymG56Ao%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg3Irwj0fLMxAWnAAx2O8_wBoXaTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  An interesting moment, our family is big and the relatives of different generations are full, quite recently, we celebrated the Day of jam, and everyone, everything, everything was invited.  I can state that the prefix was not ignored: tanks for two, Mario, Tetris for two, Contra for two and other shelf life took the crowd from small (1.5 years) to large (68 years) for 40 minutes, the only person who did not take part, it is a monster called mother-in-law, it is necessary for someone to spoil the holiday. <br><br>  And a couple of cartridges, bought for the occasion, to play the classics - Turtles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e6/8eb/b60/6e68ebb6028f4e3ab800a31d9119a275.png"><br><br>  Design. <br><br>  <b>Appearance</b> <br>  With its appearance, the console accumulates Dendy junior. <br>  Of the benefits compartments for gamepads on the sides of the console. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/173/b69/cb8/173b69cb84db446393eb4308475d3edd.png"><br><br>  ‚ñå Management Bodies.  The power supply does not heat up! <br><br>  The controls are 2 gamepads and a light gun.  There are no complaints about gamepads, they work similarly to others from any retromagazinchik.  The light gun will only work on CRT / CRT TVs - this is sadness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da7/39c/e1a/da739ce1a0fb4286be7ffad7d6c8e7b6.png"><br><br>  The power supply, as well as in SEGA, is not heated, which is not surprising, because it is the same power supply.  Indeed, it's easier, one power supply for two devices.  On the characteristics can be found in the previous article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/exeq/blog/238207/">Nostalgia for the 90th</a> <br><br>   Advantages and disadvantages. <br><br>  I found several advantages for myself: <br>  Built-in games, despite a thousand and one night repeats of the first 19 games, they are enough and you can find interesting ones. <br>  The power supply is not heated.  An important point, my little boy often does not turn off the console from the network. <br>  The price is captivating, of course.  Here, or, as they say, 3 bottles of lemonade and fun, or with friends under the same lemonade to play it in the good old "dandy" - a double pleasure.  Many games for two are what is needed for the campaign. <br>  Easy to use. <br><br>  ‚ñåPrice and purchase. <br><br>  The prefix cost me 650P. <br>  And we found cartridges in the city from 59P, but these are usually pass-through games, Spider-Man will come out at 150 rubles, as well as The Second Turtles and other less popular projects, collections from 120 rubles. <br><br>  Cartridges can be ordered in DNS at 100 for one <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/fb3/be3/b02fb3be3dfe4e1faacd05a0d621189b.png"><br><br><br>  ‚ñåConclusion <br><br>  Modern replicas of Dandy are suitable, both for ponas, and for serious game. <br>  The prefix itself is made soundly, the joysticks look durable. <br>  In many respects noticeably cheaper board. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da3/d03/617/da3d0361795944efb4b78cd5b82d8c63.jpg" align="right"><br>  Having bypassed all the shops that I sell, selling retro consoles and games, I could not find rare toys, mostly selling hits and recognizable games.  But there are some sellers who are ready to send the whole price list to your email for choosing games and ordering from them. <br><br>  And I would also like to recall this guy who lives in my heart until now, somehow Dendy and Seryoga were for us something inseparable.  I want to believe that his favorite program was the very ‚ÄúDendy: New Reality‚Äù. <br>  His programs introduced us not only to this miracle of the gaming industry, but also to other game consoles of those years. <br><br>  Why did the person‚Äôs name and photo appear at the end of the review? <br>  The fact is that it is very important to remember the history and good people, those who made our childhood better in the difficult 90s.  In the end: ‚ÄúPlay the classics, love the classics, instill a love for the classics!‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241879/</a></p>
