  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Semiconductor Industry News of Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two years ago, Sitronics struck the world industry with an unexpected statement: we will make chips in Russia at 65-45 nm standards and with a 300 mm substrate size (at that time only the world's leading manufacturers: Intel, TSMC, Samsung, IBM) had this technology.  At this time, Sitronics were happy owners of the line with the standards of 180 nm (which, it was bought from STMicroelectroics, it is not clear whether it worked or not), so it was clear: they could not develop the technology from the available one.  According to the plans, by 2009 they should have reached 90 nm, but no more. <br><br>  It immediately became interesting to me, who is this and for how much is he ready to sell his line?  For an ambitious project, the company received money from the state - almost a billion dollars. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, modern FAB even then cost several billions, and this is in countries with infrastructure. <br>  So suspicions began to creep in that there was just a neat cut of a swelling oil budget. <br><br>  I have already forgotten about this story, although an acquaintance found out about their work and corresponded with the Turkish manager (sic!): They pay little, it is not clear exactly what to do, but the latter may be due to secrecy. <br>  Yesterday, news unexpectedly appeared: Sitronics SUDDENLY announced that it was going to acquire a line operating according to the standards of 90 nm.  That is, three to five years ago.  The development of its own technology, apparently, did not go - they have not officially submitted even a 130 nm device.

      Would you give money to people who for 2 years not only failed to fulfill an ambitious project, under which they received a lot of money, but could not fulfill their own development plan? <br><br>  But Anatoly Chubais is not like that, he believes in people and will give Sitronics 200 million (a crisis!) Dollars to create a joint venture with RusNano ... <br><br>  This time, however, it may work.  The Chinese are massively going out of business: competition squeezes out those who have outdated equipment.  Therefore, the posture of the day before yesterday technology can probably be bought cheaply from them.  Well, Lil, you can just wait a couple of years and buy a 130 nm line quite cheap (not without state support, of course) ... <br><br>  UPD: Of course, they will be given 200 million.  That, however, is also quite a lot for the payment for work, which already, in fact, should have been carried out ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64134/</a></p>
