We learn to bypass</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/">freelancing</a> advertising, they often say that it is cheap for a customer, because a freelancer does not have a lot of overhead, and a freelancer advertises that he is now his own director and this is a great opportunity to get rid of the yoke of all these managers and managers, to become free and independent .  This is partly true, but there is a small amendment - all the same, someone must fulfill the functions of all these leaders and managers.  But who? <br><br>  Often it turns out that no one.  And this is exactly what leads to problems both for the customer and the freelancer himself. <br><br>  What are the pitfalls and how can they be avoided? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Task statement </h3><br>  How you formulate the task depends on whether the experts that are needed will respond to it, whether the desired will be interpreted correctly.  A good freelancer can pass by, because he does not chase orders and can choose, and you can have stop words in the description like ‚Äúwork there for an hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúI would easily do it myself‚Äù.  The freelancer is shy and tries to minimize the risks.  Here our colleagues described well how to place the task correctly: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/freelansim/blog/431890/">How to place an order on the freelance market</a> .

    <h3>  Qualification </h3><br>  The performer may simply not be able to complete the task.  It is difficult to take a task, and often newcomers rush into the pool with their heads promising mountains of gold in the hope that they will choose him.  And there we will understand!  On the other hand, a person may not have sufficient qualifications in a particular technology or technology, and the order takes to develop their skills. <br><br>  How to understand that the performer will cope?  The surest way is to give him a job and see what happens.  But this, obviously, is not suitable for everyone. <br><br>  See the portfolio, ask for examples of work, reviews on similar orders.  The exchanges allow the performer to be assessed fairly fully, although this requires a certain amount of time. <br><br>  Anyway, to be 100% sure that the performer can still cope and it should be taken into account. <br><br><h3>  Communications </h3><br>  People are different, the style of communication is also different for everyone.  Someone more talkative, someone tries not to waste letters.  When opposites converge, it can cause discontent and tensions.  For example, the customer briefly described the task and believes that this is sufficient.  The contractor took and began in the process to ask 100500 clarifying questions.  On the one hand, this is good - it means it works and tries to do it well.  But what to do if the customer does not have the opportunity to answer so many questions, there is no possibility to be constantly online?  Or vice versa - the freelancer took the job and disappeared.  Answers questions once a day, at other times does not read messages, it distracts him from work.  This is the case when the performer must do the work for two - for himself and for the manager who is constantly in touch. <br><br>  There is no simple solution, you need to listen to your opponent, try to understand whether his style of communication suits you. <br><br><h3>  Timing </h3><br>  Terms that you call a freelancer need to multiply by two at least.  Trying to impress the customer in the competition, the performer can understate the time.  Sometimes it‚Äôs just wrong, in some cases it‚Äôs impossible to estimate the exact time.  Accuracy in this matter is good, but not all performers can withstand the time. <br><br>  In their further calculations on the timing should take stock. <br><br>  Also, one should not say things like ‚Äúdo it, so do it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in a hurry.‚Äù  So your order can go to a far corner, and the performer will be more urgent.  When, in your opinion, all reasonable terms come out, the performer will be genuinely surprised by your claims, because you said that you are ‚Äúnot burning‚Äù.  The deadline should be, even if for you it is not very important.  It disciplines. <br><br><h3>  Payment </h3><br>  Most performers take a prepayment.  So they try to insure themselves.  As a customer, this does not insure, moreover, in case of problems, it is almost impossible to return the prepayment.  The contractor believes that he worked and his work should be paid, and the project was disrupted due to the fault of the customer.  More details on the payment we considered here in this material: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/weblancer/blog/448296/">Freelance and Finance: 5 methods of calculation between the customer and the freelancer</a> . <br><br>  If you have the opportunity to use Secure Payments, then it is better not to neglect this tool.  Is that the size of the prepayment is small and you are ready to part with it in case of problems. <br><br><h3>  Motivation and control </h3><br>  Since the performer does not have a boss who hangs over him and in his interest to complete the task, the performer must motivate himself.  It is not always possible and not all, this is one of the aspects and difficulties of freelancing.  One way or another, without self-control and self-discipline, freelancing cannot be and therefore not everyone is suitable for freelancing.  Of course, a successful freelancer possesses such skills, otherwise he would not have been successful.  But this does not mean that there can be no punctures. <br><br>  The control of both the process and the final results lies with the customer.  To motivate the artist sometimes you also have to.  The project can be protracted, boring, burnout, autumn, and in general all ashes. <br><br>  Unfortunately, many customers deprive themselves of an effective tool in the form of negative feedback.  In order to be able to post a review, you must select a freelancer as a performer on the exchange.  Do not neglect this, otherwise there will be only gingerbread and a kind word.  And a kind word and a whip, as we know, is much more effective than a kind word alone. <br><br>  Intermediate control will not only allow you to keep abreast of the process, but also to identify problems at an early stage of occurrence and either try to solve problems, agree on new terms or stop cooperation.  Here it is important to take into account the features of communication that were described above. <br><br><h3>  Dispersal field </h3><br>  What if this singer fails?  We have already talked about deadlines, there should be a reserve.  And it is quite good if this stock is enough to order from another.  And the money should be enough to do this, since the payment from the first experience may return for some time or not return at all, depending on whether you have taken measures for this or not.  Plus time to search.  Keep one or two in mind, it is better to even discuss your order in advance so that the person is aware and in case of which it was easier to hire. <br><br>  Do not rely on improvements.  If you have done half the work, it does not mean that it will cost half the money and take half the time to finish the second half.  Most likely, it will be much more difficult to find a performer for such work, it will cost as a whole work and take time as a whole work.  Depending on the quality of the work already done and other factors, the percentage from which it is rational to refine is different, but usually the performers are reluctant to take on the refinement of someone else.  Too much risk.  Yes, and a customer who was left without an executor can potentially be the source of the problem itself and it is better to avoid it. <br><br><h3>  Conflicts </h3><br>  Where there is money, time, quality and scope of work, there is a great place for conflict.  Conflicts arise, this is natural, and then the big question is how and in what result they develop.  In a scandal, a break in cooperation, the loss of money, time and nerves from two sides or everything settles down and everyone remains in the black. <br><br>  It's great if you follow these recommendations: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/weblancer/blog/453934/">11 questions that need to be discussed before starting work</a> . <br><br>  This will help resolve a lot of disagreement, and parts to avoid at all. <br><br>  Often, an unsuitable performer can be identified even at the stage of assessing his profile, in the process of initial communication.  Look carefully at the reviews.  As for the reviews of the artist, and those reviews that leaves himself.  If the project is serious, it may not be superfluous to contact previous customers and ask for their opinion about the artist. <br><br>  In the event of a conflict, try to put yourself in the place of the performer and remain calm.  Often, not so much the essence of the claims, as the form of their filing leads to a sharp reaction in response and everything grows like a snowball. <br><br>  If you have not used Secure Payments, there is simply no party to help establish someone's rightness or to formalize the claims, you have to do everything yourself. <br><br><h3>  Scammers </h3><br>  Not those who took up the order, did, did half and refused to return the prepayment, but the real ones, whose sole purpose is to take money from you. <br><br>  The scheme is almost always the same and is used not only for freelancing. <br><br>  The fraudster entices the customer / buyer with a very attractive price, takes a prepayment and hides.  Do not stop and $ 10, because until the customer realizes that he was deceived, you can imitate the activity, take time, take a prepayment from others.  As a result, the loss is not only in money, but also in time. <br><br>  More often, these guys are operating in categories where it is difficult to find a performer, usually these are areas related to programming. <br><br><h4>  How not to get caught? </h4><br><ul><li>  Don't be tempted by the low price. </li><li>  Do not neglect the ratings and reviews.  Their goal is to protect you.  It is safer to work with proven performers.  But often more expensive </li><li>  Do not hurry.  The scammer has little time, we will calculate it and block </li><li>  Use Secure Payments.  The purpose of the fraudster - prepayment.  On the prepayment fraudsters insist very sharply and by any means trying to get money in advance. <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455944/</a></p>
