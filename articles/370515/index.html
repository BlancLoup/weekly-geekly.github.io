  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pokemon Go developers talked about how much sponsor locations cost</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f65/99a/781/f6599a7818e60d5aa666a857dee44ca8.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the game Pokemon Go lost some of the players who registered immediately after the release, it is still popular, now the monthly audience of the game is 65 million. Aware of this popularity, some companies agree to pay for placing any game bonuses or pokemon in buildings, offices, etc.  This may be, for example, a pizzeria, where visitors flock in search of rare trophies or a cinema. <br><br>  This model of work was proposed last year, and since then many companies have expressed a desire to participate in it.  Then, in 2016, it was reported that the advertisers will be charged on the basis of the cost of the visit.  A man came in, took advantage of the bonus - the money was withdrawn from the advertiser's account.  Earlier, by the way, it was not known how much exactly the partners of the game paid for participating in the program of sponsor locations.  But now it has ceased to be a secret - the data are made public by the developers themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A Niantic <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/pokemon-go-sponsorship-price/">spokesperson told Techrunch</a> that advertisers pay at least $ 0.50 for the arrival of a program member.  This is not so much, although it is difficult to assume that any Pok√©mon hunter who has entered a cafe participating in the program will agree to pay a rather sensitive amount for the right to catch a hiding Pok√©mon.

      The game also earns bonuses for players that can be bought without any problems in the application itself.  In the new version of advertising the player gets his bonus for free, and the company acquires a potential visitor.  As already mentioned, there is no guarantee that a lover of virtual Pokemon will buy or order something in a new place, but the chances of this are far from nil. <br><br>  One of the largest advertisers in Pokemon Go is McDonalds.  This fast food chain uses this kind of advertising to attract visitors to all its 3,000 locations in Japan.  If, on average, a point receives <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/299089/Pokemon_Go_dev_says_sponsored_locations_can_earn_it_nearly_050_per_visitor.php">2,000 visitors</a> per day (and it is), then McDonalds, it turns out, pays Niantic about $ 3 million per day for the right to receive a virtual bonus that attracts visitors.  This, of course, is true if the payment for the visit is really 50 cents.  Maybe McDonalds has a discount, because it is a wholesale advertiser.  But all the same, it becomes clear that Niantic gets good money for sponsor locations.  The idea paid off, so as long as there is interest in Pokemon Go, the developers of this game will earn. <br><br>  In total, according to the Niantic management, the game attracted about 500 million people to sponsor locations.  Partners of the game are both telecom operators, for example, Sprint, and companies from the catering industry, including the aforementioned McDonalds and Starbucks.  As for the latter, 7800 points participate in the program.  So far, Niantic does not disclose the total amount received from Pokemon Go, but it is clearly rather big. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370515/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370515/</a></p>
