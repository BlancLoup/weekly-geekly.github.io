Do you want to try it yourself?  - I answer him. <br>  - No, I do not know how, in JavaScript everything is very complicated. <br>  - Well, come as you learn.  In the meantime, you can play in our sudoku, there is no need to code. <br>  - What is it? <br><br>  And I'm already going to embark on a lengthy commenting on the rules, then smoothly go over to historical background, the impact of the game on mental health and the cultural code in general, but the winner emerged in Code Battle, and the boy only hears from me ‚Äú so that they do not have the same pictures. ‚Äù  Not the best explanation, but now we have a champion: one of the participants won five victories, having solved small tasks in JavaScript faster than his opponents, and it means that the time has come to present the prize.

Therefore, the theme of DevPRO is as wide as possible - it is necessary to reach as large an audience as possible and convey information to everyone: from the June to the product managers.  Nobody waited here for a superhardcore audience, and the reports were on a variety of topics: ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence in the Housing and Public Utilities‚Äù, ‚ÄúDevelopment on Android‚Äù, ‚ÄúDesign Trends‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to Start a Startup‚Äù and many others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ic/sh/lx/icshlxnsgcnevz1oj-xloaoqicu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the organizers, Rubius, set out to create a sustainable IT community in Tomsk.  I think 1000 conference participants may consider themselves to be a fully formed community, with which we were going to meet, interest, talk about business and, of course, moderately entertain. <br><br>  Many people want to compete in blitz programming.  Someone has already heard about this venture and immediately takes a seat in front of the laptop, someone asks the classic: ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù <br><br>  - And we have one task here, ten minutes and two laptops.  The one who writes the function in which all the tests of the task pass faster will win.  Prizes are attached. <br>  The voltage is appropriate.  In one of the visits to Java, a girl and a guy fought.  The girl seemed a bit fragile, although she was wearing camouflage pants.  It must have alerted me.  And when the time was at the end, I decided to note this fateful fact. <br>  - One and a half minutes left! <br>  - Shut up there, $ # &amp;!  The fragile girl in camouflage pants shouted. <br>  I was even taken aback.  No, I, of course, guessed that the military-style is not about the chirping of birds and the breeding of aquarium fish, but then I turned around in search of ways to escape.  You never know. <br><br>  There was no winner in this fight, but the same guys came on the second day, and we convinced them to try to solve the problems on Dart.  It turned out better than with Java: no one shouted at me and did not want to pounce.  The girl solved three problems, received her prize and was happy.  Make Dart, not Java. <br><br>  The annual DevPRO in 2019 is held for the seventh time, but we came here for the first time.  In addition to Wrike, over one hundred companies have flown here, including Avito, Skillbox, CFT (Center for Financial Technologies), Kaspersky and many others.  Our goal was to share technical expertise, talk about what tasks we are engaged in and what technologies we use and communicate with the Tomsk tusovka.  We often and many answered the question what is Wrike, passing along stickers and badges.  In addition to the information booth with razdatki, there was an interactive zone with the Code Battle, for which I was responsible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sb/oe/wv/sboewvjxf6qb-khddadgtgnweyk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the first day, different people came: someone sincerely did not understand why they were solving these problems by inventing a bicycle.  ‚ÄúBecause it's fun,‚Äù as the argument was not accepted.  Men in suits recalled their youth at our booth, the Jedi solved puzzles in a few seconds, and the pytonists lamented that we had no battle on the python yet. <br><br>  And, if Code Battle, even if it is for 10 minutes, makes people opponents of people, then the lunch break unites everyone.  As the saying goes, war is war ... <br><br>  DevPRO was held at the university building, and if I were a student, I would definitely come here for this very lunch.  I hope they came, otherwise I will lose faith in the students. <br><br>  Another significant event was the party at the end of the first day.  To be honest, I was expecting something a little calmer and more measured - a kind of club for those over thirty, but it turned out differently.  The party greeted us with the tracks Offspring, Green Day, System of a Down and other mid-zero hits.  We literally fell into a temporary anomaly, and as we adapted to the new time stream, my colleague and I suddenly became participants in a kicker tournament.  A small disclaimer: we went to a party to continue communicating with the conference participants so that they would have something to talk with their friends, colleagues, classmates, because it would be wasteful to lose our audience and restrict ourselves to just a stand.  And here ‚ÄúChop Sue‚Äù is in our ears.  In general, the voice communication did not work out for me, but the kicker went off with a bang.  These were my first serious table soccer games, and I consider our three victories to be personal success.  Handshakes and direct views through the gaming table benefit in some way before talking about what will happen to Flutter and why Dart, and not Typescript.  I hope that the Wrike Snowdrop team will be remembered with kind words.  My partner in kicker and I left the bar around 11 pm: he flew to St. Petersburg the next morning, and the second day of the conference was waiting for us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8a/oz/_f/8aoz_fuir3bfqg8a5it1iiarjpo.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second day was expected: the people came much less than the first.  Our colleagues were already playing with the might of the CFT stand in the game, where they had to type one text together on two keyboards, only with a different set of keys.  Unlike our competitive game, this game was cooperative, but the fun was no less. <br><br>  We decided to turn off at 15-00.  People came up less often, even tempted to solve puzzles on Dart became less and less.  Apart from the very girl in military, we had two or three more Dart-pairs.  It was already possible to sum up, and in general we were satisfied: hundreds of people learned about Wrike and our processes, we took a couple of Code Battle champions, made a plan to improve the booth and interactive.  There is only one point left - to see the city itself. <br><br>  Probably, Tomsk is similar to all Russian half-million cities.  Here, wooden houses of the beginning of the 20th century stand ten meters from glass business centers.  On the main street - Lenin Street - the whole Tomsk life is concentrated: shops, cafes, beauty salons.  And in five hundred meters the whole blocks of centuries-old buildings, some of which can boast double-glazed windows.  In Tomsk, a great many universities and commemorative tablets.  Now it is even difficult for me to say what is more. <br><br>  With the sunset we were at the hotel.  Morning flight, early breakfast, 4 hours of sleep.  Tomsk accompanied us with a temperature of about zero and snow.  But when we flew out of St. Petersburg, there was almost 20 degrees of heat.  True, by our return the weather decided to prepare a little surprise - at home we were waited for by a miserable 6 degrees and the wind.  But after Tomsk we were ready for this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451880/</a></p>
