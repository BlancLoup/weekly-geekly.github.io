  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ten startups from 1298: the story of the first global IKEA Bootcamp</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  IKEA regularly hosts various activities aimed at sharing ideas and experiences with the ‚Äúoutside world‚Äù.  Much attention is paid to feedback from customers, partner programs with universities are being conducted, and recently, interaction with start-ups has begun.  In Russia, for example, this year the second MEGA Accelerator has already passed.  Why not try to go global?  Introducing IKEA Bootcamp. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6r/z3/ol/6rz3olpfyfreabbskly2mns_rvi.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Selection of finalists </h2><br>  There was no 100% formula for getting into the program, but the main role was played by three criteria: Affordable, Accessible, Circular - accessibility from the point of view of the consumer and the manufacturer, as well as "cyclical", the presence of a long-term perspective.  In addition, startups had to comply with the five principles of "democratic design", according to which IKEA evaluates its own products - Sustainability, Quality, Function, Form, Low price.  Another criterion is shared vision and values ‚Äã‚Äãwith IKEA. <br><br>  Important was the stage of development of a startup.  At the stage of a bare idea, only the most "fiery" projects were considered.  There was no point in wasting energy on startups that were already fully able to realize themselves.  So they chose projects at an early stage of development, mostly already with some sales.

      Startups did not require any agreements to participate in the bootcamp, no cooperation agreements were entered into after the accelerator.  The fact of an invitation implied possible cooperation on conditions that will be discussed later.  An exception contract has already been signed with one of the companies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/jd/hl/otjdhlegxud7u24sfceokeiv7as.jpeg"></div><br><h2>  How it was </h2><br>  IKEA Bootcamp has been running for 12 weeks, starting in September.  At this time, ten selected start-up teams moved to the Swedish town of Almhult, where the first IKEA store opened.  For three months, together with partners from Rainmaking, 35 workshops were organized on various topics, ranging from supplying and ending with rapid prototyping. <br><br>  More than 100 mentors from IKEA, as well as 9 professional entrepreneurs from Rainmaking, worked with the participants of the bootcamp.  The teams were provided with all the necessary equipment for the development of the project and given the opportunity to work side by side with their own IKEA engineers.  In addition, each project had its own curator - an experienced manager from a close-knit IKEA business unit. <br><br>  So, here they are - those who were sad to let go to the airport on an overcast December day. <br><br><h2>  IKEA Bootcamp Finalists </h2><br><h3>  Bare Conductive - "electric" ink </h3><br>  Bare Conductive is a conductive ink for low voltage circuits and currents.  Applied with an ordinary brush, can be tucked into the printer.  The square drawn with ink, the resistance is 32 Ohms / cm <sup>2</sup> , then it grows linearly depending on the ratio of the length and width of the section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/kk/8a/zukk8ahrlzklriamndhp9m176l0.png"><br><br>  IKEA has already signed a cooperation agreement with Bare Conductive, although the product is still at the prototype stage.  With the help of ink, it is planned to expand the functionality of IKEA products, to make them even more convenient.  Bare Conductive themselves are developing the project "breadth" - create new scenarios for the use of their development.  And they sell not only ink in 10 and 50 ml capacities, but also ready-made kits.  For example, like this, with a customized Arduino board and other necessary components: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t0/tz/hf/t0tzhfrkdt_frvv9cpgzmhnfloi.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Anyware Solutions - smart home in one bulb </h3><br>  The creators of this startup were not on their own initiative into the accelerator - they were invited by representatives of IKEA, who were looking for startups around the world.  First, as part of the 20 pre-selected startups, Anyware Solutions arrived in Almhult for two days of intense pitching.  And only then, together with the lucky ones, hit the top ten of the bootcamp participants. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kb/ty/1e/kbty1etfs1729mpvydn2hi3jb4i.jpeg"></div><br>  Anyware Solutions is a smart home system based on a single device - an adapter for a lamp base.  It placed Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, light control, as well as sound, temperature and humidity sensors.  The main function of the system is to detect and prevent the invasion of thieves and robbers.  It can also be used to regulate the climate in the house. <br><br>  At CES 2018, Anyware Solutions received an award for innovation.  Now, more than 1500 devices have already been sold worldwide. <br><br><h3>  Matter - building materials from food waste </h3><br>  This startup is perhaps the closest to IKEA in the traditional sense of many buyers.  The purpose of the Matter - the creation of building materials from the waste of various food industries.  At the presentation, beer, coffee, wine and olive oil were mentioned. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wp/4g/w_/wp4gw_mrjrhhdwe7fut13o35ss4.jpeg"></div><br><h3>  Mimbly - water purifier for washing </h3><br>  On the bootcamp, Mimbly presented its main product, Mimbox.  This is a tank that connects to the washing machine.  He takes water after washing, filters it from microplastic and other contaminants and assesses its condition.  If water is recognized as recyclable, it is returned to the washing machine.  If not, it goes down the drain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/583/792/72f/58379272fbaa58c6108cf9b105fe496b.png"><br><br><h3>  Goodbag - discounts against plastic bags </h3><br>  At the core of Goodbag is not the product, but the infrastructure built around it.  First you buy Goodbag - a regular canvas bag.  Then come with her to the partner store and make purchases.  For purchases with Goodbag, you get various bonuses - small discounts, surprises, stickers for certificates, etc.  Thus, people are encouraged to reduce the consumption of plastic bags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p5/ox/jy/p5oxjyy5ufqqgoahkhx5c7pgmae.jpeg"><br><br>  Goodbag is a startup from Austria, and so far in its affiliate network only Austrian stores.  But the team, of course, has plans to go international. <br><br><h3>  Flying Spark - larvae flour </h3><br>  The creators of the Flying Spark thought about how to feed the rapidly growing population of the Earth in the future.  And found the answer in the larvae of fruit fruit flies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/tn/9b/qotn9bzwgop9ookm_fpxwg0wppi.jpeg"><br><br>  This raw material is rich in proteins, essential amino and high quality fatty acids.  It does not contain cholesterol and gluten.  At the moment, two types of flour and butter are prepared from the larvae.  In a press kit, journalists received one cookie from such flour.  No negative feedback. <br><br><h3>  How do i?  - NFC tags with video tutorials </h3><br>  This project targets people with learning disabilities.  How do i?  - a platform for short tutorial videos that are tied to NFC tags.  Tags are pasted in the right places: around the bed - instructions on how to fill it, on a vacuum cleaner - instructions on how to vacuum.  In this way, you can always be reminded of how to perform different actions, both at home and at work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/jm/os/zojmos-t9rvuorm849lz9b95np0.jpeg"><br><br>  Stickers and video instructions can be purchased at the app store. <br><br><h3>  Hubstairs - Virtual Interior Designer </h3><br>  Service Hubstairs is designed to create an interior room.  You photograph the room, indicate preferences and get recommendations on the situation.  Among the features of the service: the creation of a 3D layout of the updated room and paid services of professional designers - from ‚Ç¨ 99. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yu/9v/at/yu9vatydrh1djijtrj2zbmibgh4.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Niwa - greenhouse in the living room </h3><br>  At the heart of the startup Niwa - design hydroponic installation with control through a smartphone.  They can grow not only herbs, but also high-grade vegetables and fruits, while quietly placing the device in the living room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hv/qm/0h/hvqm0hctof6qkqa7wsnnaxhjst8.jpeg"><br><br>  The system is fully automated and, depending on what you grow, sets the necessary settings for the installation, gives instructions and generally expands the user's knowledge of botany. <br><br><h3>  N√ºwiel - bicycle trailers for delivery around the city </h3><br>  The tenth participant in IKEA Bootcamp is a logistics project.  The creators want to ensure the delivery of goods around the city within the "last mile" with the help of bicycles.  To do this, they created a universal trailer with its own electric motor, which can be installed on any ‚Äúiron horse‚Äù.  The advantages are obvious: the roads will be freer, and the cities will be cleaner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l6/mu/_i/l6mu_iwq_eby5o1sxp6s4dmjzoc.jpeg"><br><br>  Letting go of a start-up team home, IKEA does not say goodbye to them forever.  In the future, participants will be able at any time to seek advice from their curators from the company, and IKEA will try to maintain this connection and follow the progress.  Will IKEA Bootcamp be regular?  This question is still difficult to answer.  But it can be said for sure that interaction with different promising startups will only expand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/346920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/346920/</a></p>
