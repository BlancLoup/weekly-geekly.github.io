And they can only be programmed by those who know this language code.  Computer scientists from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) are currently working on software that can directly translate natural language (as a means of human communication) into machine-readable source text. <br><br>  If researchers can solve all the problems they face, users will be able to create their own computer applications using a set of phrases.  The main problem to be addressed is that people do not always describe the processes in a strictly chronological order.  A new analytical tool, developed by researchers from KIT, serves to automatically organize commands, after which they can be executed by a computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúWe want to get away from complex rules for users ‚Äî that‚Äôs what programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãreally are ‚Äî smart systems that communicate with us,‚Äù says Mathias Landh√§u√üer, a specialist from the Institute for Program Structures and Data Organization member of Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.  Today, programs can only be managed in natural language, if it was provided by the developer.  An example is sending short messages from a smartphone.

      Specialists from KIT are currently working on software that can serve as a language interface for any type of program.  Users will be able not only to launch applications, but also to control them using voice commands.  Researchers have already managed to successfully implement such an interface in an application that controls heating, lighting and windows in smart homes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt will take time for computers not only to be controlled, but also to be programmed through the natural human language,‚Äù Landhoiser believes.  But the main communication problem between man and machine - the problem of chronological order - has already received a solution.  English was used as a basis for research.  ‚ÄúLet's look at the phrase‚Äú Before the car starts, the garage door opens ‚Äù(English,‚Äú Before the car starts moving, the garage door opens ‚Äù), Landhoiser suggests.  - In our daily communication, this description is pretty standard.  If we are talking about the virtual world of computers, a problem arises: the computer executes commands sequentially, as commands arrive.  In the example above, the computer first receives the information ‚Äúthe car starts‚Äù (the car starts moving).  Then - ‚Äúthe garage door opens‚Äù (the garage door opens).  As a result, the car crashes into the gate ... If such a sequence of actions is not provided for by the program, then at best, nothing happens.  At worst, the computer freezes. ‚Äù <br><br>  The software being developed at KIT analyzes time-related signal words that indicate that the spoken text describes the process in a non-linear way.  Such signal words specify what should happen ‚Äúbefore‚Äù or ‚Äúafter‚Äù, ‚Äúfirst‚Äù or ‚Äúfinally‚Äù, regardless of the location of the information in the spoken phrase.  Specialists tied to these words logical algorithms in order to create the correct chronological order of action.  If we apply this approach to the example described above, then the algorithm for the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù signal word automatically moves the main sentence to the beginning.  The result is ‚ÄúThe garage door opens before the car starts‚Äù (the garage door opens before the car starts moving). <br><br>  According to the researchers, specially designed requirements for voice communication with computers are not a reliable alternative.  The very first tests showed that the subjects, both those with programming skills and those who did not own them, could not observe a strict chronology, even if they were specifically instructed.  Instead, they unknowingly continued to use signal words.  ‚ÄúOur goal is to adapt the computer to the user's language.  And nothing else, ‚Äùsays Landhoyser. <br><br>  In addition to the chronological problem, researchers have identified a number of other obstacles to programming with natural language.  Subjects replaced some words with synonyms or pronouns.  A computer cannot automatically understand that the word ‚Äúcar‚Äù means the same as ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äù in subsequent phrases.  ‚ÄúPeople understand such interconnections because they see the situation as a film that is spinning in their head.  We are working to give computers the same understanding, ‚Äùexplains Landhoiser. <br><br>  PS The following materials were used in the preparation of the article: <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/10/141013090227.htm">article 1</a> , <a href="http://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2014_15744.php">article 2</a> <br><br>  PPS Do not forget, the future is <a href="http://bit.ly/GTF_YouTube">in our hands</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362107/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362107/</a></p>
