So what can it be connected with? <br>  There are several reasons, but the most important barrier is the desire of a person to see a product live, to touch it, to try it on, compare it with its counterparts, and ask the consultant for help.

      Thus, marketers do not force users to overcome this barrier, but rather use it in their own interests.  The consumer comes to the store in order to purchase the desired item in the advertised store, uses the coupon that has been received on his phone and receives a discount on one item, while gaining access to additional impulsive actions. <br><br>  Anyone is prone to impulsiveness, and this is precisely the phenomenon of micro-moment in marketing.  And even the most experienced marketer may succumb to this temptation.  There are practically no exceptions.  And this is precisely the main reason for the popularity of offline stores and shockingly large monthly checks.  However, soon everything can change. <br>  Below is a table of the most effective methods that are actively used by overseas marketers in their market.  Thank you for this statistics Marchex and Digiday. <br> <b><br></b>  <b>Top 7 methods of attracting users by means of mobile advertising and purchasing goods by means of online user presence in the store, as of October 2015</b> <br>  % - interviewed marketers: <br><br>  <b>Mobile coupons - 31%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Mobile version of the site - 18%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>SMS delivery - 13.5%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Advertising in third-party applications - 13%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Offline Beacons * - 11.5%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Advertising in own applications - 11.5%</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Other - 1.5%</b> <br><br>  <i>Source: Marchex and Digiday * State of the Industry: How Mobile is Changing Marketing. ‚ÄùOct 27, 2015</i> <br><br>  * <i>Offline beacons (in-store beacons) is a small beacon that in real time with an accuracy of up to 10 cm determines whether a customer is in a radius</i> <i><br></i>  <i>up to 20 meters.</i>  <i>As soon as the user enters the zone of operation, the smartphone receives a Bluetooth signal from the beacon and shows promotions / offers / special discounts / photos, etc.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Mobile coupons are in the lead, and eMarketer portal predicts that mobile coupons will grow in popularity by 2017 by another 7%.</i> <br><br>  <b>According to various reports, of the 10 issued coupons that have reached the hot user, 8 are used either in offline stores, and if possible, online.</b>  <b>With such optimistic forecasts for 2017, it can be expected that only every 10 coupon will remain ‚Äúdusty‚Äù.</b> <br><br>  As for the so-called beacons.  In Russia, in contrast to America, this method of advertising is not popular, however, marketers from the United States have noted a sharp increase in popularity among stores, thanks to almost instantaneous efficiency.  The data from the above table is shocking.  And yet, the forecasts predict a bright future for companies that have implemented such an option as bikoins in their marketing. <br><br>  In February 2015, users spent on purchases of a total of more than 4 million dollars, thanks to the work of these beacons.  The forecast for 2016 remains inspiring - more than $ 44 million in total revenue from such an advertising channel is expected. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296522/</a></p>
