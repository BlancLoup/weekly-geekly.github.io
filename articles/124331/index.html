      According to one statistics, 4-5% of people have the talent of an entrepreneur (from the word "take").  I think not much more - talent to bring to the end. <br><br>  Bringing to the end of any business that is important to a positive result is an extremely rare quality.  It is this that is the basis of any business activity, the basis of project management.  To bring the project to the final point, to put pressure on the idea with hard work, to solve the problem with the help of numerous improvisations, to overcome competitors with the help of more and more new ones from the sleeve;  sell goods, making three times more calls than another person, use the maximum available opportunities. <br><br>  Fighting to the end is the credo of a real professional (the ability to switch sharply to the needs, of course, is also necessary :). <br><br>  Now an example of bringing things to the end within the whole project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I can say one thing from my own experience - to bring things to a point, to the bitter end requires work beyond normal, and serious investment of mental, spiritual and physical strength.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that big leaders and outstanding businessmen, serious scientists and great inventors work hard. <br><br>  This task, like many vital ones, does not have a clear statement and does not have an unambiguous solution. <br><br>  But let's get closer to the example.  So, a team of managers and programmers, designers, web designers takes on a website.  The prepayment was received, the layout of the main page for the first week was drawn, and the project manager was rubbing his hands - with the estimated speed the project will be closed for the month promised to the client, and he will be able to get a bonus.  However, contrary to expectations, things go differently: <br><ul><li>  The client leaves for two weeks on vacation </li><li>  Suddenly, the client gets the idea to remake the design, and it takes a week </li><li>  And another week the designer feeds you with breakfast, because he comes to work from a hangover and cannot draw a single whole layout for the whole day. </li><li>  The programmer suddenly fell ill for a week and did not program an important section of the administrative interface. </li><li>  Programmed the site, and the client delays the texts </li></ul><br>  And so on.  In general, this is a consequence of the inability to manage risks, an experienced person will say.  The way it is.  But how exactly to insure against unforeseen situations?  There are certain approaches.  So, how and on what principles to build the work on the project in order to meet the deadline and achieve the result? <br><br><ul><li>  Continious delivery.  In general, it is well known that one cannot immediately do a thing right - there is only a degree of approximation to what is needed.  That is, any thing made will be refined - it is a fact.  This time.  Secondly, the longer something is done, the harder it is, farther from the desired result, and the harder it is to part with it.  Thirdly, the longer a piece of a task is done, the fewer steps can be done per unit of time.  Therefore, a very simple approach was invented - the result every day (two or three days), in the form of working prototypes, with the aim of maximizing the number of iterations per unit of time for the closest approach to the goal. <br></li><li>  Based on the previous paragraph, as well as the fact that customers are not going to integrate, with rare exceptions, you will be slowed down in their business processes, all work must be done with a breakdown into the maximum number of stages with payment, and so that the transition between stages did not depend on the provision of something by the client. <br></li><li>  From a managerial point of view, it is reasonable to distinguish two stages in a project ‚Äî a start-up rush and a file. <br></li><li>  Result-oriented skills for start-up time - rush.  The goal at this stage is to meet the deadline, and for this it is very good to deliver results to the client every day and move in synchronization with him in thinking, to use feedback.  Yes, everything changes very much when the work of the performers (and payment) is focused on the result, and not on the mythical 40 hours a week.  Not yet shown the layout - not left work.  Program the module, then you will receive a bonus and a weekend to recover to the end.  On the other hand, I came and in an hour made a module that was calculated for the day - a walk.  During the day I drew layouts for three days ahead - take two days off, the main thing is to be in touch for a rare occasion.  Sometimes you need to be tough, but fair. <br></li><li>  Agile techniques for the project dopilka stage.  When the project is already working and has become self-sufficient, an active phase of its refinement begins, which can last a very long time.  It is good to work here with traditional flexible methodologies such as Scrum, determine for a week or two the amount of work that is most important for the client, record this list for the duration of the iteration and act on it. <br></li></ul><br><br>  When an example manager gains experience, he will be able to keep within a month if he tells the team that in two weeks the maximum is to pass the project.  Because an error of 100% is usually minimal at the stage of obscurity - that is, when a project exists only in some ideal world of ideas, and in the form of different projections in people in the imagination, and does not function in reality. <br><br>  Good luck to us in our difficult business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124331/</a></p>
