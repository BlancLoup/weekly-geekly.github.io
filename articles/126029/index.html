  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to go to an effective specialist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, as part of the program committee of the <a href="http://sqadays.it-conf.ru/">SQA Days</a> conference, we started a discussion on the topic ‚ÄúWhy many companies do not want to let people go to the conference and why they don‚Äôt want employees to become effective.‚Äù <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/leshal/" class="user_link">LeshaL</a> voiced the thought ‚ÄúMany companies do not see the point in having employees perform.  Why dont know".  After that, the main discussion went on. <br>  The question immediately arose: ‚ÄúWhat do companies have with this?‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But indeed, for an employer, employee participation in conferences creates additional risks: <br>  - Employees can get in trouble; <br>  - An effective employee will require additional funds to support his motivation; <br>  - an effective employee partly interferes with sales, because  in a week he can do what his less experienced colleagues in 2 months.  Here the <a href="http://d-zh.livejournal.com/24824.html">article was</a> cited as an example. <br>  - an effective employee with an active lifestyle is potentially dangerous, he creates a radical mood around him.  Not all offices are ready to change something for the better in order to support such moods. <br><br>  Where to go to an effective employee? <br><br>  First I would like to make out the risks.  Of course, in certain conditions that creates the management of companies, the risks may well be realized.

      But we will think, "an <b>employee can be shackled</b> ."  In my opinion it is difficult to get a person satisfied with a job in a company, motivated.  Communicating with such people, a common detail was noticed.  People were confused because of the internal problems of the company and, as a result, the growth of employee discontent.  Good reason, isn't it?  Who is responsible for creating the conditions is also understandable. <br><br>  "An <b>effective employee will require additional funds to support his motivation</b> ."  Many books / articles are written about motivation.  Often, material motivation is called evil, so we will not consider it.  Companies have enough tools to support the motivation of such employees and remain in profit themselves.  The main motivator of such an employee can be the creation of conditions for his work.  He will fly forward and will quickly, very quickly, perform tasks that are entrusted to him.  Yes, for this you need to try to change something in the traditional ways of the companies.  Who is responsible for creating the conditions is understandable again.  If you do not change anything, there is a risk of losing a person.  When it is sucked into a swamp in which nothing can be changed, or it is not allowed to change anything, then it seeks to escape, or is forever stuck in the swamp. <br><br>  Regarding the training of employees, as a factor of additional motivation, the opinion was expressed ‚Äúto large companies, even just sending to the conference may not be beneficial, not to mention the speakers.  Unless they have the goal of creating a positive image and attracting crowds of green recruits.  That is, the goal is not at all connected with the people who are actually sent to the conference. ‚Äù  It is a pity that this idea really sits firmly in the heads of the leaders of such companies. <br><br>  "An <b>effective employee partly interferes with sales</b> ."  I do not agree with this risk and the article cited in his confirmation.  If the management does not know how to increase sales and the company's turnover at the expense of effective employees, then this is the wrong manual :) <br><br>  "An <b>effective employee with an active lifestyle is potentially dangerous, he creates a radical mood around him</b> ."  Here you need to find a profit.  If a company strives to follow the path of innovation, introduces flexible approaches, quickly executes orders, it, by definition, has advantages over more ‚Äúfat‚Äù companies.  Unfortunately, only some small and medium-sized businesses are innovative here.  For large companies to lose money in the dull, in the order of things, momentum such that efficiency is not important. <br><br>  Quite often I come across such a position of leadership that nothing will change.  Business is well established, shareholders are satisfied - why change something? <br><br>  In such a position, as always, an important component of any business is not considered - people! <br><br>  As long as management does not realize the need for change, the only opportunity for an effective specialist is to change companies and gain experience for ... <br>  1) work in an innovative company.  Appear already such finally. <br>  2) work for yourself! <br><br>  I wish everyone who has become effective to truly realize themselves! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126029/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126029/</a></p>
