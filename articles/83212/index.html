For the sake of interest, I decided to read, and ... and spent a couple of weeks looking for any reliable information on this topic in the internet - before that she had interested me.  In the end, after reading reviews, I decided to buy myself a Chinese animal.  After studying dozens of models, I stopped at the t5355 model (or t5353, this is actually the same phone, only manufactured by different factories. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad0/5c8/5ac/ad05c85acb1021a2bafb58a19660b487.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  His characteristics were: <br><ul><li>  Processor: Hisilicon K3 460 MHz (in the description - Qualcomm MSM7200A, 533 MHz) </li><li>  Memory: 128 RAM, 256 ROM </li><li>  Screen: 3.2 inches, touch screen, 240 * 400. </li><li>  Operating system: Windows Mobile 6.1 </li><li>  Networks: GSM / GSM900 / DCS1800 / PCS1900 </li><li>  WI-FI: 802.11b / g </li><li>  GPS: built-in SIRF star? </li><li>  Memory card: microSD </li><li>  FM Radio </li><li>  Bluetooth 2.1+ EDR </li><li>  G-sensor </li><li>  Battery: 1650mAh Li-ion </li><li>  Dimensions: 107.85mm x 53.1mm x 13.7mm </li></ul><br><br>  That is, this is a full-featured communicator with a large touch screen, built-in GPS, while having a price of only $ 160-180.  I take it, I decided.

      For starters, I designed an ec @ rd card at VTB-24.  It is necessary in order to be able to pay for the purchase through paypal (he refused to accept the usual salary visa electron). <br>  Then, after reviewing reviews of various sellers, I stopped at allymobile.com.  There the phone cost $ 171, for this money I was offered the phone itself, free delivery by airmail, and service in the form of installing Russified firmware.  Having discussed with the seller all the details on Skype, made an order 12/29/09.  I was immediately warned that they would take the package immediately to the post office, but from there it would hardly fly out before January 8th.  However, already on the 4th, a message appeared on the Singapore Post website that the package had already flown to Moscow.  And now, thanks to the speed of our valiant postal workers, ‚Äúalready‚Äù on January 26, the package was in my hands.  So, we open: <br><br>  <b>Equipment:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/502/831/c5f/502831c5f482a73ab69effbbfa69d638.jpg"><br><br>  The box with the phone was packed in a paper bag with bubbles from the inside.  The box itself is very pleasant, small, like an iPhone, stylish and beautiful.  Inside were: <br>  - Actually the phone, enclosed in 5 (!) Bubble bags <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/efc/a20/117/efca20117c93a77137c56ff5b6989285.jpg"><br>  - The charger, to which they added the adapter to euro sockets (by the way, the most disgraceful adapter, the contact lobe inside was bent almost immediately, had to be disassembled and straightened, but nevertheless, this is a plus - I forgot to tell about the adapter when ordering, initiative).  The charger is unusual, with a glossy black surface, with folding power contacts (very convenient for carrying). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e47/cff/0d1/e47cff0d117fddc54021ee962df58e9e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/499/fcf/539/499fcf53904ff50d3d5aa88f74b0c815.jpg"><br><br>  - Two 1650 mAh battery <br>  - USB-miniUSB cable (and for communication with a computer, and for charging - is plugged into the charger) <br>  - instruction in Chinese <br>  - headset (in the photo it is not present, I forgot it at work. The headset is so-so, the sound is very quiet, and even the microphone button is fake. <br>  - a protective sticker on the screen with a cleaning cloth (glued immediately) <br><br>  In general, the package is not the richest, but quite standard <br><br>  <b>Appearance:</b> <br>  The quality of the case pleased me - pleasant to the touch plastic, the assembly is very good, no squeaks, no loose, no falling off.  Everything is in place and held tight.  Outside, the t5355 is very similar to the original TouchDiamond2, it differs only in the color of the front panel - here it is glossy black, with a slightly reddish tint.  It looks very stylish and strict, but the slightest trace of fingers is visible (at a certain angle).  The back cover is more practical, matte. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afd/604/ff4/afd604ff416b661fc59efb26ed425b2c.jpg"><br><br>  On the front side - on top of the speaker, covered with a metal grid, the inscription "htc" above the screen, under the screen - a zoom bar, which was initially inactive, but partially cured by installing a special patch (now on it 4 additional touch buttons) and 4 mechanical control buttons (from left to right - accept the call, ‚Äúwindows‚Äù, back, reject the call). <br>  On the bottom of the phone is a miniUSB port and microphone hole <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd9/16f/6d1/cd916f6d1cafd845b250a07096320ace.jpg"><br><br>  On the right is the speaker hole on top (under the metal grille) and on the bottom ‚Äî the stylus <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afb/efa/085/afbefa0859becd22d643d6f53548aaa7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28b/77f/240/28b77f240b34d9c23686872e0ce63431.jpg"><br><br>  Stylus - telescopic.  Not to say that it is ideally convenient (too thin for me), but in principle not bad, it is almost used to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f80/d50/669/f80d50669e3b0dc8a0d3eebb7fad50ce.jpg"><br><br>  On top - the power button <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a1/262/98b/4a126298bfebc36fa3895169f375422f.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side above is a paired volume control.  The location is not very convenient, when you turn off the screen with the power button, I constantly get to these buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7f/4e1/e0e/f7f4e1e0eabe2bb7eac99c01653948de.jpg"><br><br>  Remove the back cover <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa9/86c/335/aa986c33527618d36fc42a6a0c563fb2.jpg"><br><br>  Under the battery - slots for SIM card and microSD memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/278/597/cf9/278597cf9ba33e3f1ae2ccfb0a65cc05.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/993/8ab/f91/9938abf911caadabc0a0918aedb07ea7.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side there is a soft reset button (highlighted with a red circle). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e73/792/440/e7379244031f70e2f2d12437e3b45280.jpg"><br><br>  Putting it back and turning it on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e0/ed9/4a1/4e0ed94a170fb7865461838c5a84e123.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c0/bbf/391/4c0bbf3915cd31fa015aa3d74f9f210d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/701/0ed/6f1/7010ed6f15ad140519ea47fff62c70fa.jpg"><br><br>  <b>System</b> <br>  Initially, the standard winmobile theme was installed in the incoming phone (in the photo - not my phone, I have already changed this theme) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e8/137/548/0e813754805e1c97a880f3e8e5a8655f.jpg"><br><br>  But I really wanted to touchflo, as shown in the pictures of sellers, so I donated Russian and installed the English firmware firmware from touchflo2d.  Now it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b15/8ee/dba/b158eedba884b8fcd59fa929ba2ef2b1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/082/f6d/ce3/082f6dce3eca19792532f0f641a34aa8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/487/2f4/f49/4872f4f4987e7fb281a718440a3c68dd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c49/d17/9d9/c49d179d96b9d80da49841dde50c88c9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br>  I personally liked the screen.  very bright (everything is visible in the sun), juicy beautiful colors.  At first glance, it reacts a bit toughly at first glance, but I have already managed to get used to it, it's even convenient - you can‚Äôt make, say, a long-distance call with a random touch.  Although, if someone does not like it - there is a patch that, according to reviews, improves the sensitivity of the screen.  Permission to someone seems too small (240 * 400), but personally I am quite happy, it doesn‚Äôt bother working with the phone. <br><br>  <b>G-sensor</b> <br>  As for the G-sensor, I can only say what it is.  But the sense of it a little.  First, it is necessary to turn it on manually after reboot (settings-system-g-sensor) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6c/b56/9a4/c6cb569a4e55a9342a39c98b0b09d68e.jpg"><br><br>  And secondly, it does not work in programs.  How many programs installed - in no one there is no reaction to the tilt of the phone.  But he turns the screen, yeah) <br><br>  <b>GPS</b> <br>  With GPS, it's not a good story.  At first I tried for a long time to make it work, but he stubbornly caught no more than 2 satellites (and that only slightly).  Google didn‚Äôt suggest anything sensible (although I tried a lot to them), so I turned to the seller, who, having learned about my problem, was very surprised and said.  that such a claim is addressed for the first time, and for all the GPS works fine.  But he immediately offered to change the phone to the same new one, although for this it was necessary to send my phone back to them.  I didn‚Äôt want to wait another 2 months, so I disassembled the phone myself.  It turned out that the GPS antenna was slightly bent, because of which its leg did not reach the contact area on the board.  a couple of simple movements - and the contact is restored.  Turn on, check - and 8 satellites were caught by the window within 2 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6e/092/ea3/c6e092ea3ba2a4d69cd0bb38a07f27e1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e1/ad4/ed6/9e1ad4ed615635014744bc553579b973.jpg"><br><br>  Assuming comments about the ‚ÄúChinese quality‚Äù, I will say - this problem, as far as I can tell, is really a single one.  Nowhere, in any forum, I have not met similar complaints about this model. <br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br>  The camera - to be honest, just nonsense.  The quality of the photo is poor (more or less normal only with good lighting) Here are a couple of examples (clickable): <br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4013/alekseymakshakov.0/0_4423c_34948464_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/800/a09/6d6/800a096d685ed8cf94f7168df9ffa248.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3908/alekseymakshakov.0/0_4423d_e8f0928a_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09c/d83/af0/09cd83af00420841921205c370908944.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/3911/alekseymakshakov.0/0_44246_bd8b0214_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e2/8cc/fca/1e28ccfcaf41da715a231437504275fb.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4114/alekseymakshakov.0/0_44247_eab2af86_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e6/02c/055/0e602c0558f0d7322449d6d9d64a3f70.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The photography program itself is terribly inconvenient, all settings (even zoom) are made only from the menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3d/e45/e2c/f3de45e2cfb2ced212c3d6f4b8365e59.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5d/f18/ea0/c5df18ea00b590e7171974792f569491.jpg"><br><br>  But for me personally, the camera is almost not needed, so for me it‚Äôs not like a minus)) <br><br>  <b>Sound</b> <br>  The sound is not the loudest, But in general, quite decent.  The headphones seem to initially have a weak signal, so to use as a player you will have to put some alternative player with the ability to turn up the volume (say, lift up all the equalizer sliders).  Well, it is very desirable to use other headphones.  There is no adapter in the kit, you will have to purchase it separately (or even solder yourself, not the fact that the standard will work - who knows what kind of decoupling the Chinese have come up with))). <br><br>  <b>Receive signal</b> <br>  That's all right.  Where on my old phone only 1 strip was caught, on it stably 3 strips.  I am very pleased with this)) <br><br>  Well, common words) <br>  At the moment, all functions have been tested, everything is working properly (wi-fi, bluetooth, GPS, EDGE), the connection is clear, sure.  Productivity is absolutely satisfactory - for example, Dr. House at XViD, 1000 Kb / s, 620 * 350, goes subjectively without any brakes, the benchmark rate is 82.85%.  Well, and most importantly - style.  Someone, of course, likes every ‚Äúshow off‚Äù in the form of gilding, roundness, rhinestones, patterns, etc., but personally I have always liked solidity and severity, but not falling to primitivism.  The T5355 is just that - a stylish and austere, real man‚Äôs phone that looks at no cost, but at least 3 times more expensive. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  In general, the impressions are very positive.  For such a sum (with all fees, interest, etc., it was about 5.5 tr), it is hardly possible to find something not Chinese, and at least similar in function.  So if you need a stylish communicator with GPS, you do not want to overpay, and the words ‚ÄúChinese phone‚Äù do not scare you - then t5355 will be an excellent choice. <br><br>  <i>The author received an invite <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/riffkazan/" class="user_link">RiffKazan</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83212/</a></p>
