Patterns appeared as a result of the search by developers for ways to increase the flexibility and reuse of their programs.  The solutions found are summarized and easily applicable in practice.  The authors set out the principles for the use of design patterns and list their catalog.  The book demonstrates their role in creating the architecture of complex systems.  Using the patterns contained in the reference book, the designer can easily develop his own applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f8/f85/96b/0f8f8596bdd24e61affd6e3b856109a0.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>‚ÄúThe human factor.</b>  <b>Successful projects and teams ¬ª</b> <br>  Authors: <b>Tom DeMarco, Timothy Lister</b> <br><br>  DeMarco and Lister are heading the Atlantic Systems Guild consulting company with branches in New York and London.

Founder of ProQuo, a research and marketing company.  Engaged in the use of Agile-methodologies in large software development projects. <br><br>  Don Wiedrig - freelance writer, consultant.  Developed a training course for software developers.  He was vice president of research and development at RELA, a company engaged in the creation of real-time systems. <br><br>  The book is devoted to the formation of requirements and work with them in the development of complex software systems.  Lack of attention to this aspect of development can lead to cost overruns, delaying the implementation of the project or even its complete failure.  The authors propose well-proven methods for identifying, documenting, implementing, and testing requirements, using both precedents and more traditional methods to describe them.  Special attention is paid to understanding user needs, determining the scope of the project, and processing changes.  All steps are illustrated by a discussion of a full-scale working example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f3/10d/b5e/4f310db5e559423884ff70772f548b3a.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>Application of UML 2.0 and Design Patterns.</b>  <b>Introduction to object-oriented analysis, design and iterative development "</b> <br>  Posted by: <b>Craig Larman</b> <br><br>  Craig Larman is a specialist in computational sciences, he is involved in iterative and incremental development, using Agile methodology, object-oriented analysis and design. <br><br>  The book discusses the basic principles and techniques of object-oriented analysis and design (OOA / P).

He studied in detail the way of life of technological innovations in the production of various products and came to a disappointing conclusion: large companies always lose to small ones when it comes to something new.  His main works are devoted to the creation and implementation of "subversive" innovation. <br><br>  This book is about how industry leaders go bankrupt when they occupy a new niche in the market or when the latest technology begins to dominate the market.  The author, using convincing examples, proves that it was during the take-off period that the leadership should be most attentive to its company, since this period is fraught with financial losses and even complete collapse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/c49/b04/489c49b04c3449edb26b960eade4d0dd.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>Corporate Application Templates</b> <br>  Authors: <b>Martin Fowler, David Rice, Matthew Fommel, Edward Hyatt, Robert Mee, Randy Stafford</b> <br><br>  Martin Fowler is the author of several books and articles on software architecture, object-oriented analysis and development, the UML language, refactoring, extreme programming, subject-oriented programming languages. <br><br>  Creating computer systems is far from simple.  As their complexity increases, the process of designing the corresponding software becomes more and more labor-intensive, and labor costs grow exponentially.  As in any profession, progress in programming is achieved solely by learning, not only from mistakes, but also from the successes of both our own and others.  The book provides answers to difficult questions that all corporate systems developers have to face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d7/b12/17c/9d7b1217cbe94e4ab053636c36914dc1.jpg"><br><br>  Book: <b>"Analysis Patterns: Reusable Object Models"</b> <br>  Posted by: <b>Martin Fowler</b> <br><br>  Analytical templates are highly organized logic circuits that can be used in a variety of projects and computer systems.

Its main advantage lies in a brief and concise summary of the essence of UML and the features of using this language in the modern software development process.  The book describes all the main types of UML diagrams, explains what they are intended for and what notations are used to create and read them.  These are class diagrams, sequences, objects, packages, deployment, use cases, states, activities, composite structures, components, interaction overview, communication and time. <br><br>  Fowler not only describes the key aspects of UML in a clear and accessible manner, but also clearly shows the role of UML in the development process.  Remarkable examples of modeling are the result of many years of experience of the author in the field of design and modeling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/f84/d7b/4e9f84d7b3b14c0097ca65e36d2c64c9.jpg"><br><br> : <b>¬´Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives¬ª</b> <br> : <b>Nick Rozanski, E√≥in Woods <br></b> <br>   ‚Äî       IT-    .  30-     ‚Äî  . <br><br>   ‚Äî        . <br><br>            .  : <br><ul><li>   ,     ; </li><li>       ,       ,  ,   ; </li><li>        ; </li><li>        ,   . </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/801/2d2/b68/8012d2b68b2e449bb74cf4fa102a21c4.jpg"><br><br> : <b>¬´    ¬ª</b> <br> : <b> ,  ,  </b> <br><br>   ‚Äî    NICTA, .   25        .  50           ,    . <br><br>         ‚Äî  . <br><br>   ‚Äî    .    ,  ,  ,  .          .        . <br><br>     , ,   ,     ,    ,  ,     ,      . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/367/f92/4e5/367f924e5f714efdb7e2512972682262.jpg"><br><br> : <b>¬´  -.      ¬ª</b> <br> : <b> ,  </b> <br><br>   ‚Äî , , .   , , ,    . <br><br>     ,     .       ,         . <br><br> ,  -, ‚Äî     .   -  ,   ,   ,   .       ,    ,     . <br><br>       ,     ‚Äî   .   ,  ,      ,      ,   ,    ,    .         ,  ,   .
