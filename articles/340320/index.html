  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Free YouTube broadcast DevOps conference DevOops 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you have previously seen my posts, you know that we at the JUG.ru Group are doing great technical conferences for IT engineers (developers, researchers, testers, system administrators).  And so, a couple of weeks ago I appealed to one of the guys from the community with a request to support the conference with a blog post, for which I received a categorical refusal.  Like, once the tickets are paid, then you are on the axis of evil, do not support the community, do not help the industry, but only entertain rich corporations and help them even more to corporate. <br><br>  Then I replied that after several months we post all video recordings of reports on YouTube, make open JUGs, and in general, we take money only for what we do to make an interesting product for the industry, and not to pursue our goals (like most major corporations that collect bases for HR departments or sales departments): we select reports that people need and will buy, this is our trump card and our bread. <br><br>  But I completely forgot about something else: about free broadcasts of our conferences.  If you dig <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/">in our blog</a> , you will understand that throughout 2017 we did open broadcasts of the main tracks of our conferences.

      October 20, 2017 at 9:30 am (Moscow time) will begin a free online broadcast from the main hall of the <a href="https://devoops.ru/">DevOops 2017</a> conference!  And not just a broadcast, but a 2k broadcast, finally your Retina and 4k monitors will be needed for something useful! <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/p/340320/"><img width="1920" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/3e/59e83e0fb3f89285423859.jpeg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVHyMXDACXZw"><b>Link to broadcast</b></a> </h2><br><h3>  Broadcast will be from YouTube, will begin tomorrow at 9:30.  In the meantime, connect a reminder and subscribe to the channel (in a few months we'll post all the reports there). </h3><br><br><h2>  Broadcast Program </h2><br>  <b>9:30 - 10:30 // Opening, interview with the team of the JUG.ru Group, introductory words from the organizers and partners of the conference.</b> <br><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/6e/59e76e5a38e9d217520522.jpeg">  <b>10:30 - 11:20 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/hoiwxbkadyyciyckcmewe/">Comey away from me</a> , Corey Quinn, Editor, lastweekinaws.com</b> <br><br>  In his keynote, Corey will talk about why all the wonderful stories about the wonderful infrastructures from the reports at conferences are in fact bullshit.  Listening to such reports, you start thinking that your infrastructure is a shit, a shit, and in general, you had to go get a job as a sales manager.  Corey has seen quite a few of these systems from the inside and will talk about why ALL systems are in fact imperfect, and it's time for you to relax a bit and continue working on your project without throwing it into the trash to move to a new stack. <br><br>  Report in English.  If interested, we had a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/340074/">mini-interview</a> with Corey on the eve of the conference. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/6e/59e76e5a26feb339919984.jpeg">  <b>11:40 - 12:30 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/5hr645pli4makymgkeesiw/">for tracing and zipkin</a> ,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Adrian Cole, Pivotal</b> <br><br>  The analysis of response time is a search for the culprit: because of what component did a noticeable delay arise for the user?  With the flourishing of microservices, the circle of suspects has expanded, and it has become more difficult to be an ‚Äúinvestigator‚Äù, but Zipkin can help.  Adrian Cole will explain the theoretical part and show a small demo. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/76/59e77644dae75534044171.jpeg">  <b>12:50 - 13:40 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/7spirpymqkwc6aqmgwyime/">SmartMonitoring - monitoring business logic in Odnoklassniki</a> , Sergey Sharapov, Odnoklassniki</b> <br><br>  In Odnoklassniki, they face difficult situations - and often in such cases they are not content with known solutions, but create their own.  As a result, the social network has a great expertise in such matters, which are ready to share.  In this case, they will talk about creating their own monitoring system, which not only finds anomalies in the work of the portal, but also shows the links between them - making life easier for administrators and developers. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/6e/59e76e5b2d53b928630992.jpeg">  <b>14:25 - 15:15 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/4fhtckm5weee2u4s406qsy/">From sysadmin to man</a> , Alexander <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/osminog/" class="user_link">osminog</a> Titov, Express 42</b> <br><br>  Usually, when talking about DevOps, two conflicting parties are remembered - administrators and developers with their different tasks and approaches.  Alexander remembers that in general there is also a business side, and in general, in the end, everything should have a good effect on its tasks.  Therefore, his report will be ‚Äúabout DevOps as a system: how it helps a business, what competencies on the part of engineers should appear for DevOps, what business problems can be solved by the DevOps software production method, and what mistakes are possible on the way to DevOps production and how to avoid or stop them. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e7/6e/59e76e5ad37a0065774039.jpeg">  <b>15:35 - 16:25 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/2ifflpcjyemgokaqkqueci/">Continuously delivering infrastructure to the cloud</a> , Paul Stack, Joyent (ex Hashicorp)</b> <br><br>  Now Paul works at Joyent, but until recently he was an employee of HashiCorp - no wonder he knows the Packer and Terraform tools from this company.  And on DevOops, the topic ‚Äúcontinuously delivering infrastructure to the cloud‚Äù will be revealed using the example of their use.  Our preliminary survey showed that many are waiting for this report. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d4/db/59d4db24cb506690175364.jpeg"><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d4/db/59d4db253c5d8478872207.jpeg">  <b>16:45 - 17:35 // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/3cwl3mfticgaqquum2icg/">Troubleshooting &amp; debugging production applications in Kubernetes (aka The Failing Demo Talk)</a> , Ray Tsang, Google &amp; Baruch Sadogursky, JFrog</b> <br><br>  Baruch <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jbaruch/" class="user_link">jbaruch</a> - developer advocate in the company JFrog, and the company he will be a developer advocate Google Cloud Platform.  Not surprisingly, their debugging report on Kubernetes applications will consider situations in which the Google Cloud Platform and the JFrog Artifactory can be relevant.  But it is not only these projects that will be discussed: they will also talk about the built-in capabilities of Kubernetes itself. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d4/db/59d4db24cb506690175364.jpeg"><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d4/db/59d4db24c1c41696312171.jpeg">  <b>17:50 - ... // <a href="https://devoops.ru/2017/spb/talks/ezypljuyzygei6yeocsiq/">DevOps in scale: Greek tragedy in three acts</a> , Baruch Sadogursky, JFrog &amp; Leonid Igolnik, CA Technologies</b> <br><br>  Finally, the conference will be closed by Keynout Baruch and Leonid Igolnik about what DevOps-difficulties arise as the company grows at different stages.  There are three such stages - and the ‚ÄúGreek tragedy in three acts‚Äù turned out. <br><br>  There are two organizational details that give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow everything will be felt.  Firstly, the speakers requested togas and other entourage, which helps to recreate the atmosphere of the Greek tragedy.  Secondly, the audience was asked to have alcohol prepared for the party even during the break before this performance, and in a sense it opened the party.  In general, at the end of the day, when it becomes difficult to perceive figures and graphs, there will be a performance with which there will obviously be no such problems. <br><br>  According to the main program it turns out somehow.  But that is not all! <br><br><h2>  <b>Broadcast in the breaks</b> </h2><br><img title="What it looked like at the JPoint" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d0/d65/7e4/5d0d657e480744e691c8250018d154b1.jpg"><br><br>  The problem of many online broadcasts - empty breaks and coffee breaks.  While the participants at the conference are drinking coffee and talking to the speakers, viewers of the broadcast are forced to look at the stubs and wait for the next report to begin. <br><br>  We solved this problem in our own way - during the breaks events at the conference will be broadcast, as well as interviews with speakers.  The interview will be <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir/" class="user_link">olegchir</a> (you must have read his articles about Java or DevOps) along with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> - you will not be bored.  Questions, if any should arise, can be asked in the Telegram-channel of the conference: <a href="https://t.me/devoopsconf">t.me/devoopsconf</a> <br><br><h2>  <b>Restrictions</b> </h2><br><ul><li>  The broadcast is <b>provided on the principle of as is</b> : we are sure that everything will be fine, but if suddenly that - do not judge too much! </li><li>  There will be no video recordings.  That is, they, of course, will, but only for conference participants who have left feedback.  And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months. </li><li>  You cannot watch what happens in other halls.  And there will be <a href="https://devoops.ru/">many interesting things</a> .  Next time register and watch everything without restrictions. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340320/</a></p>
