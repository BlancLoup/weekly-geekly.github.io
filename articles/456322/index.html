  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get the most out of the conference. Instructions for the smallest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Conferences are not something unusual or special for established specialists.  But for those who are just trying to get on their feet, the hard-earned money that was laid out should bring maximum results, otherwise for what reason was it to sit on noodles for three months and live in a hostel?  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453146/">This</a> article is pretty good about how to attend the conference.  I suggest to expand the instruction a little. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Prior to the conference </h2><br><h3>  Decide whether to buy a ticket </h3><br>  There is always a chance to be disappointed in the time and money spent, so before the start of the whole mess you should understand whether you want to participate in it.  The simplest thing is to ask friends who have already participated.  They will describe the format, topics, pastime and many other nuances.  They can also say directly whether you should go there or maybe they will suggest a more suitable option. <br><br>  If with friends tugovato, conduct an independent study.  Watch videos from past conferences, maybe someone filmed the process?  Or reports?  You can also walk on hashtags in instagram and other social services.  networks, somewhere around will roll reviews.  Reviews on sites because everyone does not trust, right?  : D <br><br><h3>  Buy a ticket </h3><br>  If you liked everything and time does not seem wasted, get your ticket to the conference.  If the price still seems too heavy, you can try several options: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Buy a ticket in advance, conferences often offer a discount to those who purchase a ticket in advance. </li><li>  Ask your employer or study organization to sponsor your participation.  After participation, on the basis of the information you heard, you can independently prepare a report on what you heard or supplement the corporate knowledge base. </li><li>  Become a speaker.  Try yourself as a speaker, if you have something to say.  Personally, I have never been able to participate this way: ( </li><li>  Become a volunteer.  Volunteer offer fully or partially free participation.  You can become a photographer, videographer, assistant and many more.  Yes, participation is greatly reduced, but sometimes it is a suitable option. </li><li>  Consider the option of online participation.  Sometimes, acquiring a broadcast viewing, which is lower in price or free, you save on your tickets, your time and get a comfortable viewing on the topics of interest.  Although I confess, I have always been closer to the live format. </li></ul><br><h3>  Fill out the profile </h3><br>  Often on the conference site you can see a list of participants.  Check that everything is correct and, at a minimum, you could be found in social.  networks.  You have no idea who may want to meet you after the conference.  Suddenly is fate? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/da/qf/iudaqftzlttmyk5v2evkofbljyq.png"><br><br><h3>  Join chats and subscribe to the newsletter </h3><br>  The whole movement begins even before the conference itself began.  People offer to meet before or after, get together at the afte-afte-party, take part in the competition, meet and just chat.  Even more, this chat is useful during the event itself: You can find out the actual information about the events at the conference itself.  And then to discuss on the subject of reports. <br><br><h3>  Study the program of the event </h3><br>  I always think in advance about what reports I will go to and where I will go instead of them, what I want to do during the break and who I can go to at the expert session.  Most often the reports are not some kind of know-how and information can be found on this topic.  But if during the study of this information there was a question, you can ask the speaker.  Experience and competence - this is what we really want to know about the topic that interests us. <br><br><h3>  Take care of your power bank </h3><br>  This happens at the most unpleasant moment!  I just wanted to quickly sip a project on a laptop, and all the sockets are already stuck around the same as you.  During the reports have to google, this is normal.  You came for something new. <br><br><h3>  Choose clothes </h3><br>  This may seem like an unnecessary step, but it is often important.  If you go with colleagues, choose a corporate t-shirt.  If you are representing your company, consider placing your contacts on a T-shirt or badge.  Create a creative T-shirt to attract attention, for example, to a specific topic that interests you. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ps/cl/02/pscl023v79htbbohynz-f1udegs.png"></div><br><h3>  Get enough sleep </h3><br>  If the conference is not one day, and even in another city, then usually there is no time to sleep.  I also try to meet my friends if I am here.  It happens that I attend concerts.  In any case, it would be too insulting to fall asleep on the report :) <br><br><h2>  During the conference </h2><br><h3>  Listen </h3><br>  Well, about the reports, and so it is understandable.  Initially you came here to receive knowledge, and not to run around the stands.  Choose reports based on your interests, now multithreaded conferences are very popular and there is nothing to worry about if you run away from one report to another.  This may not be your speaker, not your topic or your level.  And instead of you can come another person. <br><br>  Do not chase the star.  Often it is these reports that can be heard later in the form of a video recording, and it will be very difficult to speak with an expert.  Be subjective! <br><br>  You can listen not only on reports, but also in the corridors!  You can just come up and stand next to, if you hesitate to express your opinion. <br><br><h3>  Appreciate expert knowledge </h3><br>  Everybody dreams to talk with the speaker, so the most incredible and amazing questions are encountered at expert sessions.  If you want to personally communicate or ask a question to the speaker, it makes sense to do it in advance or later, during the conference.  I'm pretty shy, so sometimes I ask questions after, in social networks or in the application, if such an opportunity is provided.  And while I had nothing for it;) <br><br><h3>  Catch the message </h3><br>  There is no point in trying to outline the report.  Make a couple of photo slides, if you then need to talk about the report and note the main points, but the most useful thing you will do is note the ideas that come to you.  These may be some topics that you would like to study in more detail, ideas of projects, organization of the day, research, social interactions and everything.  If before the conference you did not know what to do in your free time, then afterwards you will delete the superfluous from the to-do list. <br><br><h3>  Take a photo </h3><br>  If you can take a picture with an expert - do it.  Something interesting is happening on the report or outside of it - capture it.  You do not have to run around the conference with a selfie stick, but a few shots will come in handy.  Again, suddenly you need to speak and speak about the conference.  People want to watch pictures, not read the text!  :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/xp/nk/ntxpnkzs8ann4ihn0jdu2znkxaw.png"></div><br><h3>  Collect merch </h3><br>  Hunters for merch - is a separate category of participants, which few people love, but apparently, I sometimes break through on this.  The stock of sweets, clothes and office is enough for me until the next conference.  Seriously, I have a VK Tech scarf, Wrike socks, a 2gis T-shirt and an Intel cap.  Sometimes it seems to me that I am one big advertisement ... But my weakness is stickers!  While you are fighting for getting trophies, you can team up, help with tips and just chat with the same adventurer as you! <br><br><h3>  Meet </h3><br>  Of course, this advice applies to extroverts.  Introverts understand all the resentment from this advice.  I will share my ways.  If I saw the same person at several conferences, then I can come to him and say about it.  ‚ÄúHey, I saw you at the Conference. X and the Conference. Y, how do you like this conference?  What do you think about her?  What are you doing?  Where else to go?  Oh, drove together? ‚Äù.  This is certainly exaggerated, but I met a part of people in this way.  So I find myself a company to have fun. <br><br>  What I wrote about earlier - I ask questions to experts in social networks.  Often the answers to them are accompanied by links and screenshots, which is quite useful.  In addition, if the expert is actively conducting its social.  network and discusses there a topic that interests me, I subscribe. <br><br>  I also have a way of getting to know the experts at the events themselves.  I am going to the expert session, waiting for the participants to begin to disperse and then start asking their questions, maybe sharing experience (if I have something to say).  And at other conferences, the first method already operates ‚ÄúHey, we communicated there somewhere there.  Did you have a great report, has anything changed since then? ‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Visit the stands </h3><br>  This is a real opportunity to learn about the company's product, or to consider a number of vacancies.  It is no secret that such conferences are a tasty morsel for hr.  They also view young students and specialists, especially those who are active on their stands.  At the stands you can communicate not only directly with hr, but also with a specialist directly working in this company.  You can learn about the schedule, and about the working conditions and current projects. <br><br><h3>  Attend entertainment </h3><br>  Master classes, quizzes, quizzes, games, concerts, pre-party, after-party.  Even an introvert can find himself and realize.  The conference should be accompanied by bright emotions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nt/r7/1l/ntr71lagd6xhsaqiob2yqdifrkc.png"></div><br><h2>  After the conference </h2><br><h3>  Process your records </h3><br>  Here the conference is over, but everything goes on.  Take a good look at your notes.  If they are written in a rough, uneven hand under the stain of a glass of coffee, then it‚Äôs best to remember what you thought at that moment, now.  Structure all ideas, add something to your glider, calendar, list of books to read, subscribe and enter where you want to enter.  If you want to make a presentation on the conference, then draft a draft with a general structure, drawing on fresh emotions. <br><br><h3>  Thank the organizers </h3><br>  Everyone thanks the speakers for their presentation, but they forget to thank the organizers for their work.  Write an honest review - what you liked, what you didn‚Äôt like, what I would like to add, what idea sparked, and what, next time, I would like to avoid.  It is the feedback that makes these events better.  Even if you do not come to this particular conference, you will improve the industry as a whole! <br><br><h3>  Discuss what was heard </h3><br>  If you did not go alone, but with acquaintances, colleagues, or got friends at the conference, gather with them some time later to discuss the information received.  It is much more useful not only to digest information, but also to get different opinions on it.  In the same way, I advise you to present the conference report and add to the corporate knowledge base. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Attending conferences at the very start of your career is cool and useful, you should not miss such opportunities to experience the whole atmosphere of the IT world you want to join :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456322/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456322/</a></p>
