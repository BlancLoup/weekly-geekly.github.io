How many times, opening the lid of a two-year computer, a dear reader wanted to quickly close it back, if only the great wall of crushed dust did not fall?  You can, of course, return the unwanted contents of the casing with a pneumatic ballon back to the room, only the others present are usually opposed, the throat is very sore.  The vacuum cleaner, along with the cleaner, work strictly according to the schedule, they usually do not care about IT problems. </blockquote><br>  Once, in addition to the planned work, I decided to tidy up the technological cabinets with a hood at the same time.  I go to the car, behind my backpack, in one hand - a two-kilowatt vacuum cleaner, in the other - a box with tools.  I think: what will happen if we take a portable vacuum cleaner and compensate for its weak power with a pneumatic air bulb?  After all, I almost always have with me a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248004/">powerful AC / DC power supply</a> with a cigarette lighter socket to charge my laptop in the car, in the cafe, and in the office.  Eliminating the need to carry a heavy car with personal belongings seemed such a tempting prospect that I decided to explore the market for car vacuum cleaners, but without the intention to use them for their intended purpose.  However, I often do that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  DISCLAIMER </h4><br>  This is not a custom article, but according to the club‚Äôs rules, it is in this hub, although not paid for.  I love working with the audience, and she often pays me with valuable comments and comments.  Therefore, if you are reading this text somewhere outside the portal Geektimes, I recommend to go in a week or two <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/284024/">here</a> .  And if the link opens, it means that the residents of the club did not tear me to pieces, and in the article, interesting additions probably appeared.  And if it does not open, then do not read further :) <br><br><h4>  Crowd Marketing </h4><br>  Read reviews about car vacuum cleaners - a strange occupation: half of the reviews on the "five" (excellent), the other half on the "unit" (the most suck).  And this is about the same model.  Golden mean no.  The author of one review explained this polarization of opinions by the usual reluctance to admit one‚Äôs own stupidity when buying.  And this was then indirectly confirmed by the abundance of private ads for the sale of this model, containing the phrase "new, not used."  A useful criterion, by the way.

    <h4>  Theory </h4><br>  In my opinion, with the direct appointment of car vacuum cleaners everything is very clear.  To begin with, ask yourself: how much power can a vehicle‚Äôs on-board network produce?  Hardly more than 100W.  Now look at the power of the vacuum cleaner, which is used to clean the house, how many zeros are there?  Usually we are talking about one or two kilowatts, i.e.  10-20 times more.  What is the conclusion?  Clean the car with an industrial vacuum cleaner in the car wash ... <br><br>  No, I do not want to say that the entire market for car vacuum cleaners is a complete deception.  The division into classes can be traced: conditionally for $ 50..70 and conditionally for $ 10..20.  The latter are usually completely useless, they can ... I do not know what they can do at all.  Unless to present to the ill-wisher, let him first suffer through the harvest, and then suffer the sale. <br><br><h4>  Independent Testing </h4><br>  But the first class of products can be compared in terms of suction power and functions, and this work has already been <a href="http://www.autodela.ru/main/top/test/pilesos_test_berkut_smart_power_avs_black_decker_heyner_pininfarina_agressor">done by the</a> guys on the AutoDelo portal (prices are being removed, they are no longer relevant). <br><br>  <b>DISCLAIMER:</b> quality of cleaning the carpet and everything else I bring AS IS, for details, refer to the original source. <table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">  Suction force, mm of water.  pillar </td><td colspan="2">  Current, A </td><td rowspan="2">  Power, W </td><td rowspan="2">  Evaluation of the quality of cleaning the carpet, points from 1 to 5 </td></tr><tr><td>  When running </td><td>  While working </td></tr><tr><td>  BERKUT Smart Power SVC-800 </td><td>  631 with hose </td><td>  24.4 </td><td>  5.8 </td><td>  69,6 </td><td>  five </td></tr><tr><td>  AVS Turbo PA-1020 </td><td>  647 without hose </td><td>  17.4 </td><td>  6.3 </td><td>  75.6 </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Black &amp; Decker PAD1200 </td><td>  512 with hose </td><td>  12.9 </td><td>  5.0 </td><td>  60 </td><td>  3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Heyner CyclonicPower </td><td>  553 without hose </td><td>  24.0 </td><td>  8.6 </td><td>  103.2 </td><td>  3 </td></tr><tr><td>  Pininfarina PNF / VC-100 Turbo </td><td>  611 without hose, 593 with hose </td><td>  17 </td><td>  5.6 </td><td>  67.2 </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Aggressor AGR-100H Turbo </td><td>  637 without hose, 627 with hose </td><td>  22.9 </td><td>  7.1 </td><td>  85.2 </td><td>  four </td></tr><tr><td>  Autolux AL-6049 </td><td>  633 without hose </td><td>  20.3 </td><td>  7,6 </td><td>  91.2 </td><td>  3 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h4>  Requirements </h4><br><ul><li>  Compact size </li><li>  Maximum suction power </li><li>  Flexible hose - required </li><li>  Thin submersible nozzle for cleaning hard-to-reach places </li><li>  Wide nozzle for extracting a cloud raised by an air bag </li><li>  Easy filter cleaning or cyclone filter </li><li>  Low noise to less disturb others </li><li>  Power supply 12V, power consumption up to 100W;  either battery </li></ul><br>  Of those models that hit the review, only the Golden Eagle, Aggressor, Black &amp; Decker and Pininfarina hose.  Black &amp; Decker has a long nose on the hose, and almost all of them have a clearly ‚Äúcarpet‚Äù design, i.e.  sharpened by one-handed operation without a hose, it is rather auxiliary. <br><br>  But Berkut attracted my IT attention not so much with a recognizable ‚Äúbay‚Äù shape as with a clearly extended hose and a short ‚Äúnose‚Äù: this is much more convenient to work inside cabinets and enclosures.  When I bought and unpacked it, I was delighted, almost like a child to a puppy.  But when the flashlight was activated from putting on the nozzle, I myself came to the puppyish delight.  And nothing more.  The declared electrical power is 100W, the guys intended 70W. <br><br><h4>  Sensations </h4><br>  He cleaned the door mat: slowly but surely pulling.  Large particles, hair and pebbles remained in the receiving chamber, in front of the coarse filter.  Fine dust collected fine filter: I first just shook it in a bucket, then washed.  He climbed into the computer, a thin submersible nozzle on a long hose not only penetrates the most unexpected places, but also increases the local suction pressure.  Behind the ‚Äúthin‚Äù filter is the virginally clean womb of the air intake.  Works, but <i>very fine</i> dust Berkut expels into the room.  It is expected: the thinner the filter, the more pressure is needed to blow it, and you don‚Äôt accelerate at 100W of power. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Berkut filters</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/2f2/1b1/0e52f21b1e6a4e29b265ef2b9069b5da.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><blockquote><h4>  ATTENTION: TONER! </h4><br>  I suspect that in some places, if you try to even get close to a pneumatic tube to a toner press, the unlucky cleaner will be immediately disarmed, deprived of a bottle, pay and turned out outside the perimeter.  Cleaning of fine particles is a special discipline. <br><br>  The first drew attention to the problems of cleaning the toner user <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/cyberly/" class="user_link">cyberly</a> , he also pointed to the professional class of products such as "service vacuum cleaner."  For example, a 3M Service Vacuum product removes toner, but it costs like five Golden Eagles :) <br><br>  But then <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/etz/" class="user_link">etz</a> <i>et al</i> came <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/etz/" class="user_link">along</a> and reminded us that the main components for cleaning toner are a replaceable filter cartridge and an antistatic hose, and pressure can be obtained in a cheaper way.  Cartridge costs about $ 20.  By the way, as well as car vacuum cleaners of the lower range, but for toner they cannot be used even as disposable ones - only fine particles will be inflated around the room.  Black toners have a conditional particle size of more than 1 micron, colored toners - from 0.3 micron.  Accordingly, 3M offers two types of filters: Type 2 (cheaper) for black toner with dust and Type 1 (more expensive) for any toner, including color. <br><br>  In the era of 3D printing, the creation of nozzles, nozzles and adapters was easy, but I would choose conductive materials like <a href="http://rusabs.ru/product/abs-plastik-elektroprovodyaschiy-1-kg">conductive ABS</a> : dust does not stick to them, they are antistatic.  If it turns out to put this construction on the Berkut, and (most importantly!) <u>If</u> he has enough traction to blow the 3M filter, I will definitely share with dear readers.  While I doubt it. <br><br>  Once again I thank the residents of the club for the comments. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br><blockquote><h4>  findings </h4><br><ul><li>  Automobile generator will not give enough power to install a filter for fine dust and especially toner. </li><li>  Fine dust easily disappears from the car, but indoors is a problem. </li><li>  No need to try to clean the room itself with a car vacuum cleaner: the less it works, the less fine dust it raises into the air. </li><li>  Quickly clean one or two PC enclosures with Berkut is quite possible by helping yourself with a pneumocylinder. </li><li>  Allergy sufferers and asthmatics, who are in close proximity at this moment, are unlikely to be delighted with their sensations. </li><li>  Cleaning toner, as well as cleaning machinery on an industrial scale in terms of life safety, requires special equipment: a service vacuum cleaner. </li><li>  It is possible to assemble a toner (service) vacuum cleaner with your own hands, but factory components for a toner vacuum cleaner will be needed, first of all, filters and an antistatic hose. </li><li>  For advanced DIY adherents, I recommend using electrically conductive (conductive) ABS plastic, available including.  for 3D printing. </li></ul><br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  Links </h4><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://www.autodela.ru/main/top/test/pilesos_test_berkut_smart_power_avs_black_decker_heyner_pininfarina_agressor">We are testing portable car vacuum cleaners of the highest price segment</a> <br>  <a href="http://znay-i-umey.ru/kruzhok-umelye-ruki/samodelki/tonernyy-pylesos-svoimi-rukami.html">Do-it-yourself vacuum cleaner toner</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248004/">Several inexpensive ways to improve your digital lifestyle.</a> <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400167/</a></p>
