      Despite the fact that there are many master programs in Germany, in which the main (or even the only) language is English, in my opinion, knowledge of German will facilitate the solution of not only domestic issues, but also the problem of adaptation in the country and searching for a job / part-time job. and after training.  It is also worth noting that some universities (for example, the Technical University of Munich) require excellent knowledge of both languages, and some (for example, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) have only a small number of master's programs in English. <br>  Therefore, if you are determined to enter a German university, knowledge of German can make your life much easier. <br><br>  For admission to the specialty, where the language of instruction is German, it is enough to pass TestDaF on 4 in all four parts - reading, listening, writing and speaking.  Other language certificates are also accepted (DSH, Goethe Zertifikat, etc.), but, being in Russia, it is easiest to pass TestDaF.  Why is that?  First, you can take it in Russia (I took it at the Goethe Institute in St. Petersburg), while DSH should be taken at the University of Germany, and preferably in the one where you plan to study later.  Secondly, there are a lot of materials to prepare for TestDaF, the search for which is not difficult, various courses and programs.  Thirdly, TestDaF is indefinite, but it is worth noting that sometimes the result of the exam, passed earlier than two years ago, is not welcome. <br><br>  Preparation for TestDaF takes a different amount of time, depending on the initial level of the language, intensity, and so on.  I managed to get ready in about half a year.  The exam itself is held 6 times a year and it is necessary to enroll in popular delivery centers, for example, the Goethe Institute in Moscow and St. Petersburg, as soon as registration is opened.  Consider the time difference.  Registration begins at 0:00 CET, which is 1 or 2 hours behind Moscow time, depending on the time of year.  Approximately 14 people pass the exam, divided into two groups.  The exam itself lasts approximately 5 hours with breaks between parts and a long break after the first two parts.  Approximately 6 weeks after passing you will be notified of the results, then you can pick up the certificate in the place where you took the exam.  In addition to the certificate, you will be given a certified copy, however, you can make the required number of copies yourself and immediately certify them in the delivery center. <br><br>  <b>University</b> <br><br>  The choice of university is a purely individual matter.  When making a decision, you can rely on the following criteria: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ranking.zeit.de/che2014/en/">university ranking</a> ; </li><li>  university profile and program; </li><li>  partnerships; </li><li>  rating of land and city (especially if there is a desire to find a job after graduation); </li><li>  required documents for admission (for example, the Technical University of Munich requires, in addition to languages, a GMAT or GRE transfer). </li></ul><br>  All master programs can be divided into competitive (NC or Zulassungsbeschr√§nkt) and non-competitive.  Accordingly, it is enough to submit documents for non-competitive programs and to formally meet the requirements (as a rule, to have the necessary level of language), for competitive programs a pre-determined assessment process of candidates (Auswahlverfahren) is in place.  As a rule, special significance is attached to the motivational letter you wrote, as well as to the available grades and subjects that you studied. <br><br>  I entered the direction of Informationswirtschaft (Informatics in Economics) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Baden-W√ºrttemberg.  Before the start of training, all students hold meetings where they talk about the campus structure, how it is being taught, etc.  These meetings are undoubtedly especially useful for those who have little idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe organization of study in Germany in general and in a particular university in particular.  In addition, there is an opportunity to know their classmates. <br><br>  <b>Filing documents</b> <br><br>  Unlike undergraduate programs, master programs can start from the winter semester (from October) or from the summer (from April).  Accordingly, approximately 3 months before the beginning of the semester, the receipt of documents ends.  The list of required documents can be viewed on the website of the university, there are also dates of the beginning and end of the receipt of documents.  Documents in Russian must be translated and, as a rule, notarized and then sent by mail.  I used the services of Pony Express, sending a set of documents cost about 1,300 rubles, and delivery took about a week (from Voronezh).  In addition, universities have online registration, i.e.  Something like a personal account where you can see the current status of your application.  After the documents have been reviewed, and if you are eligible, the university will announce its readiness to receive you and will send you a confirmation by mail or online.  You need this confirmation to get a student visa. <br><br>  <b>Visa and accommodation</b> <br><br>  To study at a university you will need a national visa (type D), the period of consideration of documents may take quite a long time, so it is advisable to submit them in advance.  If you do not yet have a confirmation of enrollment, for a start, you can attach a confirmation that you are an applicant for a place in the university.  This could be, for example, a printout of your page on the university‚Äôs online portal or a questionnaire that you filled out when submitting documents.  The application takes place in the visa section of the German Embassy by appointment. <br><br>  We should also dwell on the financial side.  To obtain a visa, you need to show that you have sums for a year at the rate of 670 euros per month.  In my case, there was enough bank statement.  However, in some cases it may be necessary to open a blocked account (Sperrkonto) in one of the German banks.  To open such an account with Deutsche Bank, you need to send by mail a completed application form from the site, as well as a copy of your passport certified by the embassy.  More information about opening an account can be found <a href="https://www.deutsche-bank.de/pfb/content/privatkunden/konto_international-students.html">on the website of Deutsche Bank</a> . <br><br>  While you are studying, you have the opportunity to live in one of the student dormitories or rent a room in an apartment with other students (Wohngemeinschaft or WG).  Application for a room in a hostel can and should be submitted immediately, as soon as you have a confirmation of enrollment (if it is required to accept the application) or even earlier.  Still, the chances of getting a place in the hostel are very few.  Therefore, many students live in the aforementioned WG.  In terms of cost, a slight difference is possible, both in one way and the other. <br>  As for Karlsruhe, the room will cost about 320-350 euros per month with utility costs.  It is possible, however, to find both cheaper options and significantly more expensive.  In large cities, especially in the south and west of the country (Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart), rent will be even more expensive.  <a href="http://wg-gesucht.de/">This site</a> can help in finding a room.  You need to be prepared for the fact that landlords will not be ready to give you a room without a personal meeting.  On your part, too, it would not be very reasonable to negotiate a long-term lease without looking at the housing.  Therefore, it is possible that upon arrival the first time you will have to stay in a hostel or hotel until you sign the rental agreement. <br><br>  <b>the cost of living</b> <br><br>  Education in Germany is free, and more recently in all lands.  There is only a semester fee of approximately 140 euros.  The cost of living is different from city to city.  Life in the cities of the former GDR is cheaper, in large cities it is significantly more expensive. <br>  In addition to the monthly payment for housing, you also have to pay for medical insurance (about 80 euros per month).  For transportation for students there are special travel cards.  For example, in Karlsruhe, a ticket for transport per semester costs about 145 euros, while a monthly ticket costs 56 to 160 euros, depending on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãoperation.  For students there are also discounts on telephone, hairdressing, dining, etc.  About 150 to 200 euros are spent on food per month.  Therefore, in general, for 670 euros per month live quite real. <br><br>  Scholarships in the understanding of the Russian student in Germany, unfortunately, no.  There are grants from various foundations (DAAD, Deutschlandstipendium, etc.), but they are received by a very limited number of students.  In addition to winning in the competition for the grand are important not only evaluation, but also motivation, pursued goals and a little luck.  Their size significantly exceeds the Russian scholarships and ranges from 300 to 700 euros per month. <br>  Being in Germany on a student visa, you can work 120 days a year full-time or 240 days - half a day.  This rule does not apply to part-time work at a university, where you can find a place as an assistant in a department, laboratory or library. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  I hope this information will help those who are going or have already gathered to continue their studies in Germany.  Soon my studies will begin, and then I will be able to write about student life in Germany, as well as about the learning process. <br>  Ready to answer all your questions. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289064/</a></p>
