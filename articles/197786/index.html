      All games, except Android versions, are also offered in versions for PCs running Windows, MacOS and Linux. <br>  Presented games belong to a variety of genres, and, IMHO, everyone can find something interesting for themselves. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.team17.com/games/worms/worms-2-armageddon">Worms Reloaded</a> - Classic is back!  A duel between teams of worms, a bunch of weapons and gadgets for pushing, kicking, blowing up and destroying enemies, both old and new (for example, Sentry gun, shooting the enemy in automatic mode, or magnets, deflecting flying missiles).  Well, for dessert - the most excellent animated videos from the life of worms between battles (I'm not sure that they are present in the version for Android, but in the version for PC there is exactly). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.thebardstale.com/">Bard's Tale</a> is another classic return.  The original game of 1985 was a typical dungeon crawler, in which a party of heroes led by a bard cleaned dungeons from monsters, swayed, hung around with uberzatzkami and in the end saved the country from an evil magician.  The remake of 2004 was made ‚Äúbased on‚Äù - now the hero is one, and his goal is ‚Äúmoney and pleasure,‚Äù and not the salvation of the world.  The result was a great parody of role-playing games, with a lot of humor, interesting dialogues, various references to well-known and not-so-great works. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/">Ticket to Ride</a> is a turn-based logic card game based on the same name popular in the United States.  The kit also includes the addition of ‚ÄúUSA 1910 DLC‚Äù. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.vanguardgames.net/games/greed-corp/">Greed Corp</a> - turn-based strategy on a hexagonal field.  In the game, the original approach to the collection of resources - resources can be collected on any cell of the field, but at the end of the collection, the cell is destroyed (falls into pieces).  Because of this feature, the player must try to strike a balance between mining and construction (he has gained a lot of resources, and there is no place to build, or a lot of territory, but nothing to protect), but he also has new strategies for the game (for example, the strategy of burnt land - to recycle in the resources of their cells, so as not to get the enemy and complicate his offensive). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.incredipede.com/about.html">Incredipede</a> is a logic game with a roof-looking main character (an eye with a set of articulated legs and muscles).  The game is made fairly honest mechanics of the joints and the movement of the hero using the "legs".  The rest is just the case when it is better to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXlugVr53R1g">see</a> once. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9yJRvC-FOVs">Anodyne</a> is an adventure game in the style of classic role-playing games with SNES - with the same graphics and twisted plot.  IMHO, the game is similar to the early Zelda, only the hero is armed with a broom instead of a sword :) <br><br>  The first two games are available only to those who paid more than the average price (now it is $ 6.27).  Also, traditionally, in the middle of the sale, a couple of games will be added to the package, but, unlike earlier sales, the added games will be available only to those users who paid more than the average price. <br><br>  PS By the way, Humble Bundle recently transferred to Google Play its application of the same name, which greatly simplifies the installation and update of games from its sets on the Android platform.  You no longer need to download the .apk file, check for updates on the manufacturer's website - everything is done from a single console, literally in a couple of clicks.  Now they would still have to resolve the issue of transferring purchased games to a Google account - and in general everything will be fine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197786/</a></p>
