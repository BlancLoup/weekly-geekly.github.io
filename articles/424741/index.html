A little cry from the heart about how not to make a password field when registering on sites. <br><br>  Under the cat gathered a few thoughts, examples and conclusions on this topic. <br>  The problem, by the way, is as old as the world.  And yes ... this has been said too much, but for some reason they continue to do wrong, and I don‚Äôt observe significant progress in the right direction.  Until.  Therefore, a repetition ... then you know. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If now I am not mistaken in numbers, then, according to research, we work not 8 hours stated per TC per day, but somewhere 6. We can think productively and intensively for 3 hours. But we can not work at all, but only make it appear.

      What do we spend working time for?  Social networks beat all attendance records, then come the news, followed by online shopping.  And all this at the computer, bought for the blood of the employer, and not on the phone.  Because what?  That's right, because when you sit at a computer with a smart look, you work, you sit on the phone - a slacker. <br><br>  What am I all about?  The fact that the main time when we buy goods and consume content is very often working.  And it also means that the path to this content should be as simple and easy as we act in conditions of heightened danger and secrecy.  Joke, of course.  But still, let's not forget the context of use and user scenarios. <br><br>  And the scenario could be like this: I sat reading the comments on the article - I decided that I did not agree with Shurik958 - a clever idea arose, I wanted to voice it ‚ÄúLet me know!‚Äù - you cannot leave a comment without registration - I decided to register, anticipating the applause of other users and the disgrace of the alleged opponent - clicked the "Register" button - it began ... E-mail, password, confirm the password.  No, not right - too simple.  Again an error - passwords do not match.  And all this in the conditions of the strictest secrecy, often without the opportunity to see where you made a mistake.  Everything.  The thought has passed, the moment is lost, the mood goes to hell.  User is lost. <br><br>  All this to the fact that I made the most unpleasant discovery: in contrast to mobile applications, forms for registering web versions are not so convenient and even crooked. <br><br>  And what percentage of potential users and buyers fall off during registration, I think, it‚Äôs written enough without me.  And even such arguments as ‚ÄúFavorite sites are stored in bookmarks with saved passwords and do not require any registration for a long time‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho needs that pass,‚Äù ‚ÄúEveryone has this way‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnd registration through social.  why do you need nets?  Use this ‚Äùand‚Äú But in the application everything is convenient for us ‚Äùwill not convince me that the registration form e-mail + password should also be made convenient.  Such as a mobile application of the same resource. <br><br><h2>  Why do so? </h2><br>  If back in 2009 (!) Year, Jakob Nielsen in <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/stop-password-masking/">his article ‚ÄúStop Password Masking‚Äù</a> adds the idea to refuse double confirmation fields and give an opportunity to see what we have written there. <br><br>  In 2010, <a href="https://habr.com/post/94548/">an article-opinion</a> on this topic was written on Habr√©.  Emotionally very written. <br><br>  But in 2010, the trees were big, and the Internet was not as advanced.  What to say about 2018, when you simply do not have time to follow the flow of information and the user is lazy so that he will not read the extra line, he will not write the extra letter.  But on the websites they continue to ask for confirmation of the password, carefully hiding it ‚ÄúWhile our spaceships plow the expanses of the universe ...‚Äù (c), i.e., we almost talk about teapots telling, at the same time we force to perform absolutely unnecessary actions, remnants of past years, I would say.  And these are not sites that schoolboy Vasya did for a chocolate bar on his knee, but quite well-known representatives of this world with a million audience. <br><br>  Having rummaged on open spaces, I <b>found several reasons:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  everyone does this (classics of the genre!); </li><li>  prevents mistakes when entering and saves the psyche of particularly suspicious citizens; </li><li>  So does Google! </li><li><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zh/ad/6l/zhad6lsypxwwrfibedfy8o1rb_w.png"></li><li>  Our priority is mobile app (version). </li></ul><br>  This is how Jakob Nielsen answers this question in his article: ‚ÄúThe masking of passwords has become common without any reason <br><br>  a) it is easy to make <br>  b) she defaulted in the early days of the Internet ... ‚Äù <br><br>  Everything. <br><br><h2>  Why not do so </h2><br>  Because double repetition of the password without the ability to view the content puts unnecessary obstacles and increases the number of errors.  And it does not protect the user from evil uncles who decide to steal his password. <br><br>  <b>Jakob Nielsen recommends</b> ‚ÄúDo what users expect, and they will be able to focus their mental abilities on understanding your products and offers instead of struggling with the user interface.  Password masking is not what users are actively looking for.  Losing this function will not cause confusion ... Let's clean the web from the web and remove things that are only because they have always been there. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  So how should it be? </h2><br>  Leave one password field with the option to hide or show.  We kill two birds with one stone: we prevent the mistake and calm the alert citizens.  Many companies in their mobile applications have done just that, forgetting to transfer this remarkable opportunity to the site. <br><br><h2>  Examples </h2><br>  A few examples where the correct field to enter a password (or close to the right) in a mobile application and the wrong site. <br><br>  I really want that the correct thoughts from the applications moved to the web. <br><br>  <b>Yandex.Den</b> <br><br>  the site also confuses icons of meaning <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/jj/8q/sgjj8qdkglzyvkiefm1_ofd7n_c.png"><br><br>  <b>Fishki.net</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sc/ar/pu/scarpu8zye6yqrncyp-hymgvly8.png"><br><br>  <b>Aliexpress</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_k/qy/wx/_kqywxsffmit_y4ysxkaxotgjqk.png"><br><br>  <b>Wildberries</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/se/uz/b-/seuzb-k3npdosfndvd0bz21yeog.png"><br><br>  <b>Facebook</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/f2/y3/5hf2y3yyn17exrrygzccg2b7lfg.png"><br><br>  <b>An example to follow CIAN</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0g/xy/sh/0gxyshhwotiazjvpihlkiswc7wg.png"><br><br>  Colleagues designers, friends, let's make the life of users better!  Do well and correctly not only in mobile applications.  Recall the beautiful word "context of use" and think that it can be different and its convenience is our task. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424741/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424741/</a></p>
