  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT outsourcing for the segment of small and medium enterprises - why is it needed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>IT outsourcing for the segment of small and medium enterprises - why is it needed?</b> <br>  <i>Introduction</i> <br><br>  Dear readers, to begin with, let's look at the very concept of “outsourcing”: <br>  Outsourcing (from English outsourcing: external source) is the transfer by an organization of certain business processes or production functions to serve another company specializing in the relevant field. <br>  The definition is very large and capacious, but I would like to note that we often use the benefits of outsourcing without knowing it ourselves. <br>  We give the most striking example of "IT outsourcing" - this is the hosting of the company's website.  Now that you have understood that outsourcing has already firmly entered our daily life, let's take a closer look at what goals we are pursuing when using the services of “ausorsers”. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>The goals of outsourcing.</i> <br>  The first and most obvious goal is to make financial profit.  How can it arise?  Imagine for a moment what would happen if there were no “hosters” companies?  You would have to lay a dedicated channel to the server one, to purchase a WEB server (hardware), install the necessary software, take care of protection, backup and a lot of “related” factors (attendants, traffic, etc.).  How much would your ownership of such infrastructure cost?  In fact, the transfer of the WEB-server to outsourcing gives us a significant reduction in financial costs, which means profit.  The cost reduction of the “second goal” of outsourcing follows: “Change in the cost structure itself”. <br>  The second goal of outsourcing is to change the cost structure.  According to the current tax legislation, outsourcing costs go before “taxation” (in order to avoid double payment of VAT and income tax).  Depreciation expenses and taxes on fixed assets will be reduced, since  the equipment belongs to the "outsourcer".  In fact, we get a “service”, and we are not at all worried about what was done for this by the outsourcing company.  From this statement we get the "third goal" - "Reducing risks." <br>  The third goal of outsourcing is risk reduction.  In fact, when outsourcing a business process, there is a separation and partial transfer to another company of the risks associated with the implementation of activities. <br><br>  Now that we have defined the goals of outsourcing, let's try to figure out what can be outsourced to IT infrastructure. <br>  IT infrastructure is: <br>  • servers <br>  • automated workplaces <br>  • networks (communication channels, switches, routers, cable networks), <br>  • PBX and telephone systems, <br>  • data storage systems (SAN, NAS, etc.), <br>  • backup and recovery systems, <br>  • Software (system, application and integrated). 
      <br>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In fact, the entire IT infrastructure can be divided into 3 groups: “Iron”, “Networks” and “Software”.  Each of these groups can be outsourced in full or in part.  Assuming maximum IT infrastructure outsourcing, we get a company that does not have one: servers, “heavy” storage and backup systems are rented, jobs are replaced by thin clients, a complex network switching system is reduced to the level of 1-2 routers, PBXs and telephone numbers we are used to devices are replaced by IP-telephony, all software including the “notorious” licenses for “Office” and “Windows” is now the headache of the “outsourcer”, even the incoming “student-administrator” changing cartridges in printers can be replaced  In a fair moment, there are companies that are ready to take care of your fleet of printers / faxes and you will only pay for each print, and the price will be slightly different).  By outsourcing your IT infrastructure, you automatically become a “mobile user”, i.e.  You can get access to your data from anywhere in the world where there is a data channel of adequate bandwidth.  In Russia, accounting outsourcing is very often practiced (we will not consider it), which easily takes root in this model. <br><br>  Let's try to structure all the "pros" and "cons" of outsourcing. <br>  "Pros": <br>  • reducing the cost of royalties, reduced to a moderate monthly fee <br>  • a significant reduction in the cost of depreciation, reduction of property tax <br>  • reduction of IT infrastructure personnel and associated costs <br>  • significant reduction in primary hardware and software costs <br>  • reducing the cost of maintaining server equipment <br>  • greater scalability <br>  • backup of all data stored at a remote site <br>  "Minuses": <br>  • bandwidth and reliability of communication channels <br>  • possible incompatibility of software and hardware for terminal solutions <br><br>  <i>Why "IT outsourcing for the segment of small and medium enterprises"?</i> <br>  Small and medium-sized enterprises are most often subject to change: they can grow (which means they will need to increase the capacity of the IT infrastructure, which will entail significant costs), and can be eliminated (that is, an attempt to sell "acquired by overwork").  In order to try to grow and grow your own IT infrastructure did not lead to elimination, IT outsourcing will be easy to use.  In addition, there is a multiple opinion that outsourcing in large enterprises is not practiced, because they have already created all the necessary infrastructure, adjusted business processes and it is very expensive to change them. <br><br>  <i>Instead of an afterword.</i> <br>  Currently, IT outsourcing is not significantly more expensive than using its own IT infrastructure, but if you take into account the risks and long-term cooperation, as well as the rapid development of “software as a SaaS service”, “cloud computing services”, then you can say with confidence that in the future, a large part of the emerging business will use the services of outsourcing. <br><br>  PS I would like to learn from the habrasoobshchestvo with what outsourcing faced and as briefly as possible describe (+) and (-). <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45760/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45760/</a></p>
