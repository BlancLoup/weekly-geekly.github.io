  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of budget wireless sets of alarms of Chinese, Taiwanese and Ukrainian production</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I will try for myself and my readers to figure out which <a href="http://secur.ua/signalizatsii/gsm-signalizatsii/">gsm alarm system is</a> better for buying, so that its quality and functionality would match the amount of money spent on it.  For more informative experiment, I decided to test the "signaling" from manufacturers from different countries, one of which is Ukraine.  To your attention, in the ‚Äúlight‚Äù (I emphasize twice - ‚Äúlight‚Äù; a big request to the admirers of Viewsonic, LifeSOS, Satel, Ajax and other monsters, do not compare professional systems with alarm systems for home use) of the price category: Tenex Guard 5050 G - China;  Altronics Al-100 KIT - according to Taiwan suppliers;  Guard Avizor KIT with a loud, patriotic statement of origin in Ukraine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbf/c8b/e06/bbfc8be0604aeb2a0933b9474a6b856c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What are we paying attention to? </h4><br>  From specifics: in the first part I will evaluate the external data: packaging and sealing, equipment, housing and board of the central part of the alarm (the people are central), as well as its board;  in the second part: sensors and their boards, ways to control the alarm, basic characteristics, power and other trivia important in work.  In the second stage, I will test the sensors in the laboratory.  In the end, like a cherry on a cake - the final results.  However, do not rush to flip right to them, because it is in the process of unpacking and testing that the reasons for the conclusions made will be considered in detail, focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of each set.

      As they say, meet on clothes.  In the case of technology - on the box.  Judging by it (Fig. 1), the Altronics kit I bought came to me after I had been in use, or had seen a lot upon delivery.  Perhaps any other kit would have been in a more "fresh" state, but such a case makes you wonder.  And since the box is not sealed, no one can guarantee the performance and availability of all the details and details after the second hand.  Unlike Altronics, the package of the Set of Guards is delivered in a sealed form: when you try to remove this seal (Figure 2), the text appeared on it, which means you can be sure that I receive the goods in their original form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/510/e78/7f2510e7890a78d5c7cc2bd074a601f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/740/dfe/70a/740dfe70a87a9a5d8df5b5740884105f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the Guardian box, as well as on all the components of the kit, I observed some kind of signature on a small sticker (Figure 3).  I can only assume that this person who is responsible for testing and packaging, confirmed the operability of the device.  And the letters on the control panel shown in the photo and other elements are similar to some kind of individual code.  Such a sticker is present on all devices, even on a separate cable for the power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0cc/ca5/7ab/0ccca57abf638534ba25b8281138bcd7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I accidentally saw something similar under the lid on the Altronics box (Fig. 4), but since there are no seals on the box, it‚Äôs not at all the fact that ‚ÄúPered—ñreno, control of checkpoint No. 5‚Äù refers to this set, to this alarm, to these sensors.  And as shown by subsequent testing, it is generally not clear what exactly is verified there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/769/0c2/5ee/7690c25eeacff2d1f61a1a5bb83e09c3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What's inside? </h4><br>  Outwardly, all the sets are similar (Fig. 5), their compositions are about the same: the central unit, the motion sensor, the opening sensor, key chains, power supplies, stickers, instructions, and other trifles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/63e/57e/703/63e57e703225b99abb097c5c84dac7d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You hardly want to read the full instructions, so pay attention to the speedstart (Figure 6). Tenex - the guys are very laconic, there are only 5 lines in the speed start, I, of course, understand that ‚Äúbrevity is the sister of talent‚Äù, but I on this liner to deal with the setting failed.  In addition, initially the alarm is not configured, so you have to re-read the full version of the instructions or contact technical support.  I decided to take the second way and, I must say, it took enough time, especially considering that some answers took 5-10 minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b14/17d/442/b1417d442c17f56d8cd8ea48654404ff.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the full instructions (Fig. 7): Tenex - 20 p. A6 and there is no description of the sensor settings, Altronics - 15 p. A4 and the same problem with the configuration of the sensors.  There are no printed instructions for the Guardian kits, which may cause some inconvenience.  However, the instruction is present on the disc, where besides it there are still a lot of materials that greatly simplifies the setup: instructions for the entire sensor line, software for setting up via a PC and, as already mentioned, the instruction itself for signaling in the amount of 80 A4 pages to PDF.  Instruction is 10 times more than Tenex.  And 20 times more informative.  Read it.  Understood.  Configured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0dd/5f7/565/0dd5f7565a3ca74c7dd7a30f24de2adf.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A frivolous problem, but I didn‚Äôt find Altronic‚Äôs ‚Äúobject under protection‚Äù stickers, but the Guardians and Tenex have it (Figure 8).  It would seem a trifle, but often such stickers already in the first stage of the invasion may scare the intruder.  According to the experience of friends and acquaintances, such stickers are often used instead of the alarm itself, as a preventive measure. <br><br><h4>  Whole cimmes </h4><br>  Now let's look directly at the main, its main part, its brains (Figure 9.10).  They will determine the stability, reliability, noise immunity and, in general, the functionality of the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f1/6b5/524/6f16b55243b95652180669506dc32886.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbf/c8b/e06/bbfc8be0604aeb2a0933b9474a6b856c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Figure 9, 10: Alarms, Tenex, Alarms <br><br>  About the "Chinese" (Figure 11).  The Tenex alarm system itself on the manufacturer‚Äôs website is located in the ‚ÄúSmart Home‚Äù section, which is an obvious exaggeration and blatant flattery.  More suitable for her section - "Home Alarm".  What is interesting, this ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù has a surprisingly stylish case, but it is very easy to get dirty after 3 minutes of use: it has very noticeable fingerprints, black stripes remain from the slightest teal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1f8/154/f85/1f8154f85675a33446013345998545c3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.11 <br><br>  Obviously, the reason used in the manufacture of plastic.  Perhaps this is a deliberate idea for collecting fingerprints?  On the top panel of the control panel there is a row of LEDs inducing the modes of operation of the device.  In addition to the LEDs, the notification is carried out using pre-recorded voice messages.  But since they are recorded in English, and besides, due to the influence of electronic processing, even the English-speaking pronunciation is distorted, it will be problematic even for a native speaker to disassemble these messages, what to speak about a person who does not speak English. <br><br>  Now more about the LEDs: <br><br>  1. Indicator of signal reception from wireless sensors in zones 1 through 6 <br>  2. Security status: on or off <br>  3. The presence of GSM signal <br>  4. Radio signal operability <br>  5. Notification of the enabled configuration mode, in which sensors are searched for, owners are connected, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/8e2/a77/a1a8e2a7732f5b8e7ab86770811ca8e6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.12 <br><br>  Outwardly, everything seems to be in order.  But already at the beginning of the work we encounter unpleasant surprises: <br><br>  1. Relays, power plugs, siren plugs, backup power on / off and a SIM card are all in the compartment under the lid (Figure 12), which is more disturbing than helpful. <br>  2. The power connector enters its port is very tight, not to the end and for this reason is not fixed in it.  As a result, the contact is constantly lost and the power turns off during the setup process.  The power supply cable is very short, only 30 centimeters, as already mentioned, the power connector is not fixed in the port to which it is connected and the power is disconnected at the slightest cable tension. <br>  3. In the same small box (Fig. 13) there is a tiny backup power switch. In the original assembly, it is disconnected so that the battery does not discharge before the client receives it, this switch must be on to provide backup power.  However, to reach it even with the use of available tools is very problematic. <br>  4. In the same compartment is a terminal block, to which are connected, among other things, a siren and wired sensors <br>  5. To insert a SIM card, I had to use a screwdriver, while, of course, it was very important not to damage the contacts.  Let's just say, the work is almost jewelry, with shaking hands it is better not to start it.  Fortunately, the question of connecting a SIM card is in most cases performed once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec5/390/88c/ec539088c527b4e0f2be90e5ef7235c3.png" alt="image"><br>  fig.13 <br><br>  If you can close your eyes to each problem separately, then in combination it leads to big problems in work.  The power supply is unstable, the cable BP is short.  Even if the alarm system is on the edge of the table, the cable does not reach the outlet mounted at the bottom of the wall.  Of course, the power supply unit can be soldered, but even if you have the skill of soldering, there is a chance to damage the microcircuit and certainly you will lose the warranty by breaking the seal when you try to open the case.  As a result, in the pursuit of style and a miniature case, where all the cables are hidden inside, this alarm system is inferior to competitors in the simplicity of the banal connection with the resulting problems with reliability.  Without exaggeration, at this stage, Tenex can hardly be called an effective or close to the real defenders of your home alarm system, more like a dummy or a toy for fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9da/28a/0c8/9da28a0c8ab4ca92336fbb53804b8f1d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.14 <br><br>  Now let's talk about Altronik alarms (Figure 14).  The case is stylish, does not get dirty as easily as Tenex, is equipped with an information board that displays the state: <br><br>  1. Nutrition; <br>  2. The status of protection; <br>  3. Indications of the included setting mode; <br>  4. The presence of a GSM signal. <br><br>  On the top of the speaker holes are also located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/293/673/918/293673918af3e2adab31b355d2f100f6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.15 <br><br>  The functional elements are mounted on the rear panel (Figure 15), among them: <br><br>  1. Relay for wired zones and siren; <br>  2. SIM card slot; <br>  3. Key to enter setup mode; <br>  4. The reset key, apparently demanded; <br>  5. What pleases is the power supply of 12 V, because it will not be difficult for him to find an inexpensive power supply unit, connect a battery or arrange backup power supply (UPS); <br>  6. ON / OFF switch; <br>  7. SMA-connector for connecting an external antenna. <br><br>  Immediately focus on the pros: <br><br>  1. Remote GSM antenna, by the way, as with the Guard; <br>  2. The presence of the reset key; <br>  3. Easy access to the SIM card and battery; <br>  4. Nice design; <br>  5. Grooves for mounting on the wall. <br><br>  In fact, the only, but very significant disadvantage that strongly influences the operation of the system, is the fact that connecting the siren, the cables of the wired sensors to the terminal strip will be very problematic.  The fact is that the latches are very tight, they do not even include a bare cable of small cross section.  In order not to spoil the appearance, I decided to leave the central alone.  Ultimately, if I need to connect the wires to the terminal, it is only for the siren.  And if I dwell on this alarm, then I‚Äôll scrape.  The main thing is to be reliable.  By the way, everything is normal with the power connector, the power supply plug (Fig. 16) is fixed securely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d27/041/bb1/d27041bb1d0f95d79d9fd59ff6822f98.png" alt="image"><br>  fig.16 <br><br>  Now let's talk about the alarm Guards (Figure 17). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33c/a11/8b1/33ca118b1d5bcd79ad8fd2e54be9ffaa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.17 <br><br>  On the top panel there are indicators that in the process of work will inform you about: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The status of backup power - whether or not, the indicator - "Power" <br>  ‚Ä¢ When receiving a signal from wireless devices - "Radio" <br>  ‚Ä¢ Enabled alarm or inactivity mode - ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ GSM signal available - ‚ÄúGSM network‚Äù <br>  ‚Ä¢ Setting mode in which there is a search for sensors, firmware update - "Setup" <br>  ‚Ä¢ Disabled, partially or fully armed system - the ‚ÄúSecurity‚Äù indicator <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/44a/88f/201/44a88f201aa17f976bdf104034d6d848.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.18 <br><br>  On the back side (Figure 18), as with Altronics, is a terminal block and other functional blocks: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ On / off lever for battery saving mode or PC setting; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Power connector.  By the way, the power of the Guard from 14 volt unit.  The power supply comes in the kit, but in case of need to buy a new one, the PSU with the equivalent voltage will cost more than the same 12 volt; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Jack for an external microphone.  With it, you can independently record voice commands, which in certain cases will be played for you, or voiced indoors in your absence by a call from a mobile phone; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Relay for connecting sirens, executive devices, home appliances; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Terminals for connecting external battery and wired sensors (which are available in a wide range, while very inexpensive).  In contrast to the alarms that we have already considered, these terminals are easily accessible and convenient for connecting sensors, keyboards, sirens.  It will not be difficult to connect several devices to one connector, since the sockets are wide and are outside; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Connector for PC connection.  About him a little later; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Key to enter setup mode for connecting sensors, remote controls and other wireless devices. <br>  ‚Ä¢ SIM card slot.  It is from the SIM-card that calls will be realized, and SMS will be sent in case of alarm.  It is on the SIM-card in the form of calls and SMS that commands will be received that allow you to control the alarm from the phone; <br>  ‚Ä¢ SMA connector for connecting a GMS antenna from a kit or more.  A more powerful antenna can be useful in places with a bad GSM signal, such as rural areas, basements or rooms in thick reinforced concrete walls. <br><br>  Not pleased: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Lack of fastenings on the wall; <br>  ‚Ä¢ It will be problematic to turn on and off, insert wired sensors, switch to the tincture mode and pull out the SIM card slot without sewing or a small screwdriver. <br><br>  Returning to the ability to connect to a PC for configuration, what other models from the comparison do not have (even not all semi-professional systems have this function).  This feature greatly simplifies the process and saves setup time.  All the deepest functionality of the Guardian central becomes available.  So with a PC, you can differentiate access rights to certain functions, adjust the response delay, voice control, firmware upgrade, and much more.  With the naked eye, when externally comparing alarms, this palette of functions is not visible. <br><br>  Below is a screenshot of the configurator, where the available functions are visible (Figure 19).  Now imagine that your alarm system does not connect to the PC.  Even if it has the same functions, setting up with an SMS will take a decent amount of money, the amount of time and nerve cells.  Users of the GSM service provider Life can roughly present and compare the configuration process with the replacement of a melody on an incoming call via the LifeBOX menu using DTMF commands (for example, the most popular one is * 111 #). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d82/c53/f72/d82c53f724ea1ac66051ee7bd9f4aab5.png" alt="image"><br>  fig.19 <br><br>  Speaking of power supplies.  I will not say anything special, but their parameters can be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab2/df6/9ed/ab2df69ed4846241ca456738b5758513.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.20: Small 1A 12V Tenex power supply with a very short cable <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/228/151/0fe/2281510fe09dee4022063bea7ba00271.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Fig.21: 1.2A 12V block at Altronik <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2bb/065/1db/2bb0651db1f49175905b18f42a5c1926.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.22: 14V 2A power supply at the GUARD with stickers, as I believe, about passing those controls <br><br>  It was very interesting for me to look at the "insides" of the centrals and compare them.  The barrier was a seal on the screws.  Still, 2 of 3 alarms I planned to return.  Only at the Guardian the screws were unfixed (Figure 23).  The label with authenticity, and maybe with verification is present, but does not close the screw sockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80f/cec/df5/80fcecdf5699c0c0ebab703637d4f2e4.png" alt="image"><br>  fig.23 <br><br>  On the board (Figure 24) is a sticker already familiar to us.  An important point: nowhere on the board could we find such painfully familiar words like "Made in China".  The board is quite neat, no leaks, or poorly welded parts.  Yes, and not just a soldering soldering iron.  Everything is civilized, it seems more on serial stamping.  I am not a professional, so here I haven‚Äôt found anything more for myself.  Is that the GSM module reminded me about the EMAI code that is given during customs clearance.  This information will not be useful for those who do not know what an EMAI is.  But I know and asked if there is an EMAI code for GUARD, Tenex and Altronik.  She and Altronik were there, but Tenex didn‚Äôt.  It is possible that the days when unofficially imported iPhone and other GSM devices will be disconnected from support, and the Tenex alarm system will be useless, is not far off.  Anyway.  Here I have nothing more to look at. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/692/f0f/de3/692f0fde32c0aae3d8d483892f62ede4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.24 <br><br>  Now we will deal with the sensors (Figure 25).  There are no seals on them, so it is possible to disassemble, view and compare. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f4/c7d/9f4/7f4c7d9f4943c6e5364561c0136762f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc9/05c/7b0/cc905c7b0b86fbefa699240eaee637d4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  fig.25,26 <br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the images on the Sentinel sensor.  Their essence is an advanced IR sensor system.  The first is what the Guardian sensor is protected from: when a conventional IR sensor reacts to sudden changes in illumination, for example, if the sun has gone out of the cloud or when a very bright light has turned on after a dark room, in the Guardian sensor, a compensation algorithm will work and a false positive will occur. will not take place.  Secondly, the Guardian sensor has implemented the so-called immunity from animals, which, being in a room that is armed, can cause false alarms.  If you use sensors in which ‚Äúimmunity‚Äù is not implemented and you have, for example, a dog, prepare to go home every time the dog enters the room with a motion sensor. <br><br>  After I disassembled the sensors, I discovered a couple more details: <br><br>  first, such batteries as Altronics and Tenex, will be harder to find than for the Guardian; <br><br>  secondly, a tamper - this is a small lever on the left above the switch - there is only a Guardian sensor, and he, a tamper, is extremely necessary to protect the system from sabotage, in case the attacker manages to come back unnoticed and he tries to break the sensor, the tamper will override and give alarm; <br><br>  thirdly, the sensitivity setting, the activation of immunity and the choice of the power consumption mode are, again, only at the Guardian sensor; <br><br>  fourth, about the manufacturer of the board.  Looking at Altronics I began to doubt more that this is Taiwan.  I decided to take a picture of the box and google it and almost did not get surprised: the manufacturer Delta Security Co., Limited (http://www.deltasecurity.cn/) Domain CN means China.
