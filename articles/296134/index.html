In reality, you cannot develop your startup into a full-fledged stable company without urgent work, using your haters for your own benefit, constant concentration and growing your own business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you really want your startup to become successful, then you need to crave for success, and your thirst should be unquenchable.  The worst thing you can do is try to repress the dreams that you want something big.  Do not do this, because by suppressing something in yourself you are demotivating yourself.  Let this desire for success grow. <br><br>  Startups are now popular and ‚ÄúThe Startup Activity Index grew in 2015, reversing the trend that appeared in 2010 in the middle of the Great Recession.‚Äù  The sad truth is that too many entrepreneurs have delayed the ‚Äústartup mode‚Äù longer than they should.  Leaving your business in startup mode, you yourself press the brake.

      As long as you keep telling people that your company is ‚Äújust a startup,‚Äù you will never take the important big steps that are necessary for significant development. <br><br>  Time to move from a startup to an "adult" company and from planning to implementation.  You have to ensure that in a couple of years we can remember the start-up phase of your company as an important milestone in the history of your prosperous business.  And then you can say: ‚ÄúI remember packing the goods on the floor in the living room myself.  Now there are more than 100 employees in my company. ‚Äù  This is the thinking you need to achieve, and here are five ways you can do it: <br><br>  1. <b>Hire classroom staff by transferring part of your work to them.</b>  When you are in the startup phase, you are trying to cope with everything alone.  In order for your business to grow, you need to start investing in those people who can solve those tasks that you no longer cope with.  Three-quarters of small companies do not hire employees, which confirms the fact that people do not want to transfer their duties to others, doubting the quality and level of their work.  Think you need to expand your business in order to become and remain successful.  It is wrong to assume that people are expensive, because being simple in production and stopping in the development of your business will cost more - and much more. <br><br>  2. <b>Choose battlefields.</b>  Do not spend weeks thinking about the color of the logo, when it really is not important.  Your brand will evolve with your business, so the logo is likely to change.  There are many other more important things that you really should do, for example, attracting customers and making money.  You are in pursuit of large prey, so do not count the crows. <br><br>  3. <b>Make your haters love you.</b>  The biggest challenge that every startup faces is getting fame in its industry.  Your most important task is to draw attention to yourself, your idea and company.  This will open the way for every penny that will replenish your budget.  Muhammad Ali told the world that he was unsurpassed, long before anyone found out about him.  He infuriated people and attracted their attention: his name became known in every home, he became omnipresent.  But when he proved what it was worth, criticism and hatred turned into international admiration.  Attract attention to yourself.  Get haters.  And then turn them into fans. <br><br>  4. <b>Learn to show yourself in the best light.</b>  Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI have a small web design company,‚Äù say better: ‚ÄúMy web design company is incomparable with others.  We guarantee that your sales will increase. ‚Äù  Notice the difference?  The first statement makes your business small and small, easy to ignore.  It does not declare anything and does not touch anything.  The second says that you are confident in your business, your offer is unique and you are able to earn money.  Know how to profitably present yourself and your business, be prepared to quickly explain what your company is doing, and be able to convince people that it is better and faster than others and is valuable for the market.  And then publicly announce this to the whole world.  Do not doubt - you will not be forgotten. <br><br>  5. <b>Create temporary boundaries for business development.</b>  If you set up your own enterprise, without setting clear time limits for actions and achievements, you risk forever getting stuck in the abyss of excuses and joining 90% of startups that have failed.  One of my biggest mistakes in business is that I acted without the necessary haste.  An entrepreneur's activity is a marathon with a huge number of sprint segments, and if you win a lot of small races, it will be an impetus for your people and company.  When we filmed our television shows, in my office I told the staff that I wanted to get a pre-assembly two times faster than they thought was necessary.  Every day I closely followed their progress and updates.  Such pressure does not lead to a decrease in the quality of the product, it leads to the fact that the product will be ready months before the deadline.  Haste is the key to successful completion of business. <br><br>  <b>Remember:</b> your vision will not develop if you remain in startup mode.  Time to grow, become known in the market that interests you, and begin to take away the market from other, more established, players.  It used to be that the giants devoured those who have not yet had time to grow.  Now the fast devour the slow. <br><br>  Be great <br>  Grant Cardone </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296134/</a></p>
