We have already told how the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/callhelper_kitmedia/blog/14496/">secretaries "help" with this</a> .  As it happens with sales managers, we will look at a real example (not from the IT industry). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, for example, take the company for the production and installation of plastic windows. <br>  The traditional sales chain in such companies is as follows: call the company ‚Üí metering ‚Üí contract ‚Üí installation ‚Üí after-sales service ‚Üí re-order. <br><br>  Stages where you can lose a client - 6. And at every loss is inevitable.

      For one window company, we did a small study of competitors: how they take phone calls.  The result was not inspiring: <br><ul><li>  7 managers from 8 simply advised us by phone about the cost of the window and did not try to keep it. </li><li>  3 of 8 took the contact, called back after 1 hour and again only consulted on the cost. </li><li>  Only 1 manager called back a couple of days to find out a decision on the measurement and selection of the company. </li><li>  No one could fight with simple objections, something expensive (or cheap). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>In other words:</b> <b><br></b> <ul><li>  90% of sellers did not sell anything </li><li>  60% of sellers have lost contact with the customer </li><li>  100% of sellers do not fight objections </li></ul><br><br>  Hope for talent, ingenuity of employees is too optimistic.  That is why we have developed scripts for our client: incoming call, outgoing call with price presentation, outgoing call-chime.  And for each script set their goal. <br>  And, as you have already noticed, we deliberately split the incoming call into several contacts. <br><br>  <b>Incoming call.</b>  <b>The customer calls and wants to know the price.</b> <br><blockquote>  "How much is a window?" </blockquote>  With this question addresses 90% of customers.  Only 10% (at best) are immediately asked to record for measurement. <br>  The phrase, "let's sign up for a measurement - it's completely free," no longer attract. <br>  Therefore, we set the following goals: <br><ul><li>  Form an opinion about the company and the manager as an expert </li><li>  Get customer contact </li></ul><br>  The first goal we achieve with questions that reveal the need of the client.  This stage should not be taken carelessly, asking only the window size and the 2-chamber or 3-chamber double-glazed window needed by the client.  Listen to the questions that your competitors are asking, and add others so that the client will think and form an opinion about you that you are not like everyone else. <br><br>  Then we don‚Äôt immediately give out the cost, we ask for contact and permission to call back in 10 minutes to present the price. <br><br>  Perhaps, during this time, the client will know the value of other companies, and we will have a chance to compete with objections.  With the word "no" begins the work of a sales manager. <br><br>  <b>Outgoing call with price presentation.</b> <br>  Our client, a window company, works with an expensive A + class profile.  For most callers, this is an empty sound, almost no one understands the difference.  And you need to try to present the price correctly. <br>  The purpose of this call: <br><ul><li>  Presentation of prices and values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the client </li><li>  Fight objections </li><li>  Record to measure or obtain permission to repeat the call. </li></ul><br>  We call 2 prices - expensive and cheaper.  We tell the components of each package.  Pay attention to the adjectives for each price.  For dear, of course, we save the most emotional words. <br><br>  And here you can not do without the prescribed script.  To be able to present correctly and beautifully is not given to everyone.  Especially on the phone, when there is only voice and intonation. <br>  Without fail, each manager must ask the client's opinion about our offer.  To withdraw to the objections, give us a chance to fight. <br><br>  Again, without prescribed standards for dealing with objections, only banalism can be obtained at the output.  On the objection of customers - something you have expensive, in 90% of cases it sounds - but at the same time qualitatively.  But that's what everyone says!  What are you better than competitors? <br><br>  Be sure to list the manager benefits from the cooperation with your company.  Orally tell them to the seller will not be enough. <br><br>  Shares, discount standards, everything should be written.  Otherwise, it will be forgotten, and the client will never know that you are a profitable company. <br>  If it was not possible to record for measurement, then we ask permission to call in 1-2 days. <br>  99% do not.  Believe that they will be imposed on the client.  What, they say, who should, he will call. <br><br>  There is an expression: 33% will buy from us and so, 33% will never buy from us, but for the remaining 33% you need to fight.  And it is worth fighting actively! <br><br>  Now the client has become more capricious, he likes being fought for him. <br><br>  <b>Outgoing call - ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù</b> <br>  The client has already called everyone he wanted.  He has 1-2 companies with whom he is willing to work.  Our goal: <br><ul><li>  Record on measurement. </li><li>  If you can not write to measure, leave a good impression and information about the company. </li><li>  Find out why a competitor was chosen. </li></ul><br>  This is the most difficult stage: for a sales manager such a call is stressful.  Since he has to sell, fight objections, intercept a client from a competitor. <br><br>  Most, unfortunately, do not want to and do not know how.  Incoming calls are easy, outgoing calls are difficult. <br>  And the task of the head to teach how to make such calls.  The script and the constant training - loyal assistants.  This stage will allow to grow sales.  Because competitors most likely do not make outgoing.  Just serve incoming calls. <br><br>  If you increase your activity, even according to statistics, sales will grow. <br><br>  In previous articles, we talked about how we solved the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/callhelper_kitmedia/blog/14372/">problem with the training of sellers</a> , and why it resulted in writing a separate module for our CRM system.  Now we offer to use it to you for <a href="http://callhelp.kit-media.com/">creating and using telephone sales scripts</a> . <br><br>  By the way - do you think it is necessary to call the client back after he said - think about it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290222/</a></p>
