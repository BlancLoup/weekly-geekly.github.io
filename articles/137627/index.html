And not just like that, but also to listen to interesting reports on iOs development) I still don‚Äôt know what will burn out of all this, but I have to try. <br><br>  Meetings Apple (iOs) designers and developers.  Let's call them demeet - de: signers \ velopers + meet = DeMeet.  The first meeting will be held on February 15th on Wednesday, lasting 3-4 hours (~ 18.00-22.00), at this time we will fit 3 large reports or 5 small reports.  We will hold a meeting in the ‚ÄúLiving Corner‚Äù music club, with an approximate capacity of 70-100 people: comfortable, there is a projector and WiFi.  Located 10 minutes walk from m.Tulskaya.

      The main question for me remains - speakers + topics.  According to the format of the meeting, this is not a large conference with a ticket for 20k (by the way, the fee still obliges to be - a symbolic $ 100 at the entrance, the money will go to pay rent).  So what am I talking about?  About speakers and topics - I assume the level of topics should be of medium complexity, the cases of your real work (iOs development) are most interesting.  That is, we will do review meetings for the undecided novices, but for the first time I am waiting for the ‚Äúfighters‚Äù.  Colleagues, if you have something to tell, write to me at <a href="">sky@justnotes.ru</a> or here in the comment).  As a small bonus, give each speaker ‚ÄúSteve Jobs - Walter Isaacson‚Äù. <br><br>  Perhaps, I will single out all the same, it is really important: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>"Krutyshki" let yourself know!</b> <br><br>  I really believe that we in Moscow will be able to build: <br><br>  <i>The circle was called The Homebrew Computer Club;</i>  <i>He promoted the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmerging technology and counterculture, reflected in the ‚ÄúCatalog of the Entire Earth‚Äù.</i>  <i>For the era of personal computers, he was the same as the head of a Turkish coffee shop at the time of Dr. Johnson: a place where like-minded people exchanged ideas.</i>  <i>In an invitation to the first meeting, which took place on March 5, 1975 in French‚Äôs garage in Menlo Park, Moore wrote: ‚ÄúDo you assemble your own computer?</i>  <i>Or maybe a TV or a typewriter?</i>  <i>Come chat with people who have the same interests. ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Allen Baum saw the invitation on the HP notice board and called Wozniak, who agreed to go with him.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThat evening turned out to be one of the most significant in my life,‚Äù Wozniak recalled.</i>  <i>Thirty people gathered in the French garage, and everyone took turns talking about their hobbies.</i>  <i>Wozniak later admitted that he was very worried, he said, according to the protocols that Moore had led, that he "likes video games, likes designing microcalculators for scientific calculations and video terminals for televisions."</i>  <i>At the meeting, the new Altair was demonstrated, but Wozniak was much more important to see the list of microprocessor technical requirements.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Jobs began to attend the ‚ÄúHome Computer Club‚Äù with Vaz: he was carrying a TV monitor, helped with the setup.</i>  <i>Now more than 100 amateurs attended the meetings, and the meetings were transferred to the Stanford Linear Accelerators Center audience, in the library of which friends once found a magazine describing the blue box.</i>  <i>The meetings were still held in an informal atmosphere, usually chaired by Li Felzenstein, another living embodiment of the fusion of counterculture and computer technology.</i>  <i>Lee was a member of the Free Speech Movement, an active pacifist, wrote articles in the unofficial Berkeley Barb newspaper;</i>  <i>he never received higher education, but later worked as a computer engineer.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Each meeting Felzenstein began with a short exchange of views, then someone gave a talk;</i>  <i>at the end, everyone could communicate with each other, exchange opinions, make acquaintances.</i>  <i>Woz was usually embarrassed to talk to strangers, but after the presentations around the computer were going to curious, and he proudly demonstrated how the work is going.</i>  <i>Moore wanted the Home Club to be used for the free exchange of ideas, not for commerce.</i>  <i>‚ÄúThe idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe club was to help each other,‚Äù Woz recalled.</i>  <i>Ethic hackers assumed freedom of information and distrust of the authorities.</i>  <i>‚ÄúI put together an Apple I because I wanted to share it with others.</i>  <i>And it's free, ‚ÄùWozniak said.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  If you have not read, take note - the book is good. <br><br>  <b>Arrogant plans for the future:</b> <br>  1. Issue iPad magazine with materials voiced by DeMeet. <br>  2. Training courses "From zero to the first application in the App Store" <br>  3. More global formation of the developer community.  Business Incubator for combining forces. <br><br>  <b>So:</b> <br>  Speakers please contact us: <a href="">sky@justnotes.ru</a> , call +7 917 576 09 38 - Max. <br>  As soon as we decide on the topics, we will post another topic about opening the registration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137627/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137627/</a></p>
