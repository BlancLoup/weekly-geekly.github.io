I bought it to become a bit more productive.  Since I work as a manager in the web area, the main task for the tablet was to help me in everyday affairs.

      It so happened that not always inspiration comes to me at the workplace, and it became inconvenient to write down some thoughts, draw graphs and structures on a smartphone.  This is where my tablet came to the rescue.  I chose a model based on the Android operating system, with a diagonal of 10.1 inches. <br><br>  Making a list of applications for the manager would not be interesting, and this venture would not have described my whole life.  The article includes applications that help me in programming and my hobbies. <br><br><h4>  I am a manager </h4><br>  In December, I had to speak at the conference, and therefore prepare a presentation.  The draft was prepared in the <b>Polaris Office</b> application, which turned out to be pre-installed on my tablet.  The presentation was finished on the computer, since I could not arrange the repeating elements in the same places. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the application Polaris Office 4</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e72/fa7/403/e72fa74038f555b85cc3e264ae626a9a.png"><br>  Polaris ¬Æ Office is the simplest and strongest of office products designed for mobile devices.  Anytime, anywhere, you can easily use different types of documents, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe PDF, work with several tabs, and organize your data quickly and make your presentation impressive. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.infraware.polarisoffice4">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br>  I admit, I did not write the text of my speech on the tablet, because I believe that when writing by hand, the information is remembered better. <br><br>  Let's go back to my daily tasks. <br><br>  You will not surprise anyone with corporate mail on gmail, so I use the entire set of applications from Google that have been pre-installed.  The only thing I didn‚Äôt find from Google is work with tasks.  Then the <b>GTask</b> application came to the rescue, which copes with its functions 100%. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the GTask application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/875/ce7/21f/875ce721fc2ce5c1912c1a20ab421a14.png"><br>  GTasks is a simple and effective Android application for creating lists.  He will help you organize your life in a simple and elegant way.  You can sync the app with Google Tasks. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.dayup.gtask">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Managers also have to develop new sections, for this it is useful to outline the structure.  For the PC, there are many programs for the compilation of various kinds of structures, but good thoughts can overtake me at any time, I must be ready.  I put myself a <b>Mindjet</b> application and did not lose at all with it.  I recommend this application not only to managers, but also to all those involved in the development of applications, websites and software. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the Mindjet application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9f/b2a/41f/c9fb2a41ff7d254cce0a0ad973391e1e.png"><br>  Mindjet is the best way to visually capture and organize information.  You can structure ideas, take notes and track tasks on your mobile device. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dnet.thinkingspace">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Of course, I think not only structures, sometimes I want to draw a lot of lines and think looking at them.  For such purposes, the <b>SketchBook</b> application was the best for me.  This is such a simple picture editor that I really liked.  It saves to png, has the settings tool is simple and straightforward.  It works, however, it is only in the vertical screen mode, but I'm used to it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the sketchbook application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/e7f/64a/9fce7f64a69ce2c92694e5b6ba690a9d.png"><br>  Autodesk SketchBook is a professional sketching app.  Designed for devices with a diagonal of 7 inches and less.  (On my 10.1 it looks pretty decent) <br><br>  Honestly, it was possible to buy the full version, but for such purposes, and so will go. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sketchbookexpress">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  The costs of specialists, the timing of the project, planning, all this is the work of the manager, to monitor everything, to control everything.  The <b>Project Schedule</b> and the table in Google Drive help me in this.  <b>Project Schedule</b> supports importing MPP and MSPDI-XML, as well as building Gantt charts, filtering tasks, and more.  In fact, he is not completely satisfied with me, but I haven‚Äôt yet found anything better, and sometimes I use cloud solutions. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the Project Schedule application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c78/239/ddd/c78239ddd30828fcc1ab3b65d88e5a8f.png"><br>  Project Schedule is designed to manage projects and schedule tasks on your tablet or smartphone.  Use the app to create / import business projects or schedule daily tasks. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dde.thorstensapps.ttf">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  I am a developer </h4><br>  The title is too loud for me, but it seems to me that the applications are well suited to developers. <br><br>  Since I work in the field of web, then my main hobby is writing code in PHP and JavaScript, of course, it can‚Äôt do without HTML and CSS. <br><br>  For starters, I needed a server.  He always stood on my favorite Ubuntu operating system, but on long journeys I still have a tablet with me.  The only application I found for the server was <b>KSWEB</b> .  It turned out to be simple and clear, after the first start it was necessary to create a table through PHPMyAdmin, and then everything is as usual.  A huge advantage was the external access to the server, that is, from another device.  Then I cheated a little and used to launch an application on a smartphone, using it as a server. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the KSWEB application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb2/8a3/769/eb28a37699bd0c49708fc29aa225e5a4.png"><br>  It looks like this with WP already installed on the server: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9f/15b/bce/d9f15bbce64092f21d4cc3de27db4272.png"><br>  KSWEB is a set of web developer for the Android platform.  It consists of a web server, PHP, a MySQL database and msmtp to support Sendmail. <br><br>  After some time you need to buy a key. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.kslabs.ksweb">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Not a single server we live.  For quick access to my hosting via SSH, I use <b>ConnectBot</b> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the ConnectBot application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/43c/904/97b/43c90497bbd71153fd1b9e5a19268017.png"><br>  ConnectBot is an open source SSH client. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.connectbot">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  To access the file system of the tablet, I use <b>Total Commander</b> .  I started the story with him a long time ago, I started with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander">Norton Commander</a> , and then I came to Total on the evolutionary path.  It seems to me very logical to use. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the application Total Commander</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f07/5ce/aaa/f075ceaaacd8614241ab2a2dc73b6806.png"><br>  Total Commander - android version of the well-known file manager. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ghisler.android.TotalCommander">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Many text / code editors exist in the marketplace, but I opted for <b>WebMaster's HTML</b> .  It has a view of the result in the browser, the quick addition of attributes and much more useful.  It was possible to consider other options, find a good IDE, but I was so used to it that I didn‚Äôt feel like changing. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to WebMaster's HTML application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da3/48c/345/da348c345a7eecff42f6c27e4a47bf0e.png"><br>  Source editor for webmasters and web designers.  Syntax highlighting and code completion for HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript files.  Built-in preview function and virtual keys for tags and key phrases.  Day and night color schemes. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.welant.webmaster">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  I also do Java programming.  Well, as I do, I'm learning.  Having relieved C ++ at the institute (I don‚Äôt have anything against C ++, I just somehow didn‚Äôt interest me at the institute), I decided to cast my eyes on this language, perhaps in the future, I‚Äôll write an Android application, but for now <b>AIDE</b> helps me in viewing the results of executing the code from the examples.  I cannot yet describe some of its features, except to say that it compiles the code in apk, and it needs to be installed every time. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the AIDE application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ed/904/f8c/3ed904f8c94cfea4265f8f5c261a3cd7.png"><br>  AIDE is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing Android applications right on your device.

With it, I blog and help my friends publish blog articles.  I include <b>WordPress</b> here only because having made changes to the code of my blog, I test the content through it. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the WordPress application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0a/6e8/928/f0a6e8928d5c9f964d0219938d000a0b.png"><br>  WordPress for Android is an open source application that allows you to write new posts, edit content, view statistics, and manage comments with embedded notifications. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.wordpress.android">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  You can't do without a computer, its computing power is superior to the tablet, so I use the remote desktop <b>Splashtop 2</b> .  It only works when devices are on the same local network. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the application Splashtop 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/710/ff5/c1a/710ff5c1ad097883712bff290f02e7c2.png"><br>  Splashtop is the easiest and fastest desktop remote access application for Windows, Mac or Ubuntu from your Android phone or tablet. <br><br>  Full functionality is available in the paid version. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.splashtop.remote.pad.v2">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  Well, the last thing I use when developing this is a very convenient <b>Hacker's Keyboard</b> keyboard.  I use it only in those applications where the code or commands are written (terminal). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the application Hacker's Keyboard</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5d/768/5ac/f5d7685acc72db318f92816d93fd2580.png"><br>  Simply ingenious keyboard with extra keys.

I could not break them into categories, so I will give in one list. <br><br>  I love to write music, learn beautiful sketches or difficult guitar parts.  For all this, I use the <b>Guitar Pro</b> app. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the Guitar Pro application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ff/cf4/372/0ffcf43721e279ae6fe42cf282e0d8f6.png"><br>  If you are familiar with the desktop version of Guitar Pro or Tux Guitar and want to have the same functions on your mobile device, then this app is for you. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.arobasmusic.guitarpro">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  It‚Äôs good to sit around the campfire in the summer and play early Letov‚Äôs friends, but I don‚Äôt remember by heart the chords, and <b>AmDm Lite</b> helps me <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the application AmDm Lite</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31d/5d5/294/31d5d5294072351985e897f7bb86dbf9.png"><br>  The application allows you to search and browse chords to songs, as well as peep tablature of chords. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.amdm">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  I also love movies, TV shows and educational videos.

Since when I‚Äôm typing on mobile devices I‚Äôm used to the big-finger-type dialing, it‚Äôs just convenient to use a keyboard that is divorced at the edges of the screen. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Illustration, description and link to the Perfect Keyboard application</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f7/52b/9cb/7f752b9cbc0c8e94da47031e7a1fdb7c.png"><br>  Just a great keyboard for tablets, with the ability to "push" the keyboard along the edges of the screen. <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dfree.inputmethod.latin.perfectkeyboard">View on Google Play</a> <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A few words about this article.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The article was written in Google Docs from the tablet.  Typing a large amount of text turned out to be difficult, but I decided to go for the principle. <br><br>  I miscalculated with the size of the images, at first it seemed to me that the best width would be 755px, but I did not take into account the indentation of the spoiler tag.  I also prepared pictures on the tablet, the functionality built into the gallery, and it was difficult to get anywhere in the same size.  Here is an example of a resize image: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/784/82c/592/78482c5920bcac7591e67e7f38182463.png"><br><br>  Each link of the spoiler is registered to open in a new window, but for some reason this attribute is lost when published. <br></div></div><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Of course, this is not the whole list of what I have on the tablet.  I, like most users, like to relax and play.  I have a lot of games, but I decided not to list them here. <br><br>  From my experience I can say that the tablet does not replace a laptop or desktop computer.  This device is for other purposes.  I am often told that I am trying to do too much with a device that is not intended for this.  But it seems to me that I have not yet squeezed the maximum out of the tablet.  :) <br><br>  Many thanks to all application developers for all existing platforms.  You make our lives easier and more interesting. <br><br>  PS Thanks for reading.  Of course you all know about Easter eggs Android, but I could not resist. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Easter egg</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/121/00c/320/12100c3200c8465940161103c7ab4100.png"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168013/</a></p>
