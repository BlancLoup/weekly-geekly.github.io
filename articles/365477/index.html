  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook wants to post content from other sites.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The largest social network in the world wants to take another step to become ‚Äúthe whole Internet‚Äù - Wall Street Journal journalists claim that Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs company is negotiating with online publications about the possibility of full publishing their content on Facebook.  If now sites put a link to their material on their page, the user of the network sees only a picture, a title and a few lines of text.  If the Facebook offer is accepted, that the sites will be able to fully post their publications in the user's feed, without requiring him to follow the link - everything can be read without leaving Facebook. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Both sides benefit from this solution, which is called Instant Articles on the social network.  On the one hand, the social network user will not need to go to a third-party site if he is interested in something.  On the other hand, in order to compensate sites for traffic loss, Facebook offers publishers to keep all advertising revenue for themselves.  According to WSJ journalists, materials from sites such as BuzzFeed, The New York Times and National Geographic will appear on the social network by the end of May. <br><br>  Facebook brings another advantage to the end user from such a decision.  When viewing a news feed from a mobile device, opening third-party links and navigating to the site can be both long and expensive, given that it may easily turn out to be content that the user does not need.  If the text of the entire article is available immediately, then this problem disappears by itself.  It is likely that for such a solution, Facebook should provide publishers with more advanced text preparation tools than they are now. <br><br>  However, some online publications have doubts.  Despite the fact that for many of them the number of transitions from Facebook is about 60%, few people want to tie themselves to the social network.  It also raises questions that Facebook will, willy-nilly, get access to the statistics of publications and be able to use it to their advantage, manipulating the price of advertising.

      The Russian social network "Vkontakte" also has a full view of articles, links to which are left by users.  In this article looks like a formatted text and illustrations to it - it is convenient to read.  In 2012, the leadership of the newspaper Vedomosti stated that this function of Vkontakte violated their copyright and demanded that the social network stop using it.  A little later, references to Vedomosti became inactive, and the newspaper itself, in response to this step, <a href="http://lenta.ru/news/2012/05/12/vedomosti/">closed</a> its community on the social network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365477/</a></p>
