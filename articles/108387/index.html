  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do you need to dream</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been working in a programmer‚Äôs office for quite a long time and I have always been interested in one question - why some are constantly evolving and growing, while others are content with what they are.  And they seem to be good workers, and they are doing everything well, but they lack something, let's say, ‚Äúa spark in their eyes.‚Äù  I often thought about it, but could not articulate what was wrong, until my friend started talking about her boyfriend: <br><blockquote>  It seems to work, he sits at home, but there is no growth.  and aspirations are not much.  Sometimes it seems to me that he does not know how to dream, or rather does not want to do it. </blockquote><br>  And it gave me an idea - what if it is so that if the absence of dreams and the desire to dream leads to such stagnation.  Reflections on the topic under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, let's talk abstract.  Dreams are different, but always or almost always differ from reality.  And speaking of them, I can not insert the following video. <br><video>  http://video.yandex.ru/users/xakip/view/14/ </video><br>  So what is a dream?  A dream is a possibility of the impossible, the future that we see for ourselves.  And even if it can be realized, it is very important for it.  Then it turns out that if there is no dream, then there is no future?  It seems that way, and here is another video from the same movie. <br><video>  http://video.yandex.ru/users/xakip/view/12/ </video><br>  Nothing like?  For example, those people whom I spoke at the beginning.  They are good programmers, they have achieved everything, but there is no future anymore.  And it seems to me, because there is no dream.  Dreams to make your habr, your contact or your gmail.  To do something so that you can and should achieve something. <br><br>  Everything that surrounds us now was once someone‚Äôs dream.  Below about the dreams of famous people come true. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3271437/">Steve Jobs was</a> not the creator of the first personal computer "Apple", but it was he who brought the idea into execution - he dreamed of providing personal computers every desk, every apartment, every school, every office all over the world.

      <a href="http://podumaiosebe.ru/content/view/308/88888954/">Bill Gates</a> : ‚ÄúWell, the most important work I was involved in was a personal computer.  You know, this is what I was obsessed with when I was a teenager, when I was 20, 30 years old, I didn‚Äôt even get married before that age because I wanted to create a personal computer.  This is the work of my life. ‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="http://www.epochtimes.ru/content/view/42067/8/">Sergey Brin and Larry Page</a> have a dream - to create such a search engine that will know in advance what you are looking for and display the exact results you need.  And in the 90s they dreamed of making just a search engine that would display the most popular pages on the requested word. <br><br>  And there are lots of such examples.  Therefore, dream always and everywhere, and then you will have a great future.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/69356/">A few quotes</a> in the subject. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108387/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108387/</a></p>
