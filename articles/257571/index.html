So big that you can‚Äôt hear the doorbell, the door strikes and nothing at all.  Sound insulation just super. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aec/10c/201/aec10c2015664dbb8262810085e57851.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, people often come to you and you have specially installed a light bulb in your room that lights up when someone rings the doorbell.  People come different: someone clicks the call once, someone many times;  in general, everything is different.  The only trouble is that the light bulb does not always work, and in general it works extremely selectively and super-randomly.  That is, there are people who click on the bell, wait until they open the door.  But the door does not open, because you do not see the signal of a light bulb.  People logically assume that since they did not open the door, it means that no one is at home.  And go.  On the other hand, the people whom you met, in one voice say that the call works, without specifying how many times they took to press the call.  Everything is logical, you met them, it means everything works.  And since you are told that everything works, you have no reason to believe that something is not working and burden yourself with additional research. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In practice, I was faced with the fact that all people perceive information differently.  Programmers and other techies have a specific way of thinking, based on a huge experience of working with code, algorithms and other things.  Therefore, some tasks in this form simply do not arise, and in order to realize this, they must be returned to the plane of harsh realism.

      "The problem of the doorbell" describes a lot of situations occurring in web development, the development of games, interfaces and much more.  Just compare how your product's algorithm resembles the situation with a problematic doorbell. <br><br>  1) Mobile game.  Receives many complaints about bugs and uncomfortable system of tickets in technical support (it is impossible to attach a screen).  They make a big update, fix all the problems and update the ticket system in technical support.  And here comes the splendor - all the bugs are fixed and the letters to tech support no longer arrives. <br><br>  2) Sending comments on moderation.  A chipper comes in with all the machine guns. ‚ÄúThe comment has been sent for moderation, if within 3 days it does not appear on the site, it means it is not missed.  Write a new one. <br><br>  3) Payment for movie tickets in the mobile version of the site.  A lot of people come to the choice of places and only a small part really pays from the card. <br><br>  4) There are no technical support contacts and no one in the mobile application.  From the mobile site opens in full format only the main page.  When you go to the page of the required project, the transition to the mobile version automatically takes place without the possibility of switching to the full version.  In the mobile version there is no section "contacts" (to avoid unnecessary questions - it is about working with the application and with the mobile version of the site). <br><br>  I hope this visualization of the problem will allow you to even better understand the subtle points in building communication with your users. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257571/</a></p>
