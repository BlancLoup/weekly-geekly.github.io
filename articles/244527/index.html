Advanced technologies used on ViaSat-1 and EchoStar XVII satellites (also known as Jupiter-1) are capable of providing more than 100 Gbit / s throughput.  In other words, this technology allows data to be transferred more than 100 times denser than a typical Ku-band satellite.  In fact, the 140 Gbit / s ViaSat-1, launched in October 2011, had more capabilities than all other commercial communications satellites over North America. <br>  Such satellites will be able to provide a channel of 30-100 Gbit / s anywhere in the world. <br>  So what opportunities open up for users, remote workers and enterprises in particular?  What will be the cost?

    <h5>  Overcoming stereotypes </h5><br>  Despite the technological hype, some still have the feeling that satellite communications services will not cope with their tasks.  This opinion is rooted mainly in satellite TV users, who are used to the fact that the picture deteriorates or disappears during the rains.  To minimize wagging weather conditions on the signal level, companies apply certain measures. <br><br><h5>  Geo-distribution </h5><br>  The satellite operator should take care of the availability of individual satellite uplinks located in geographically remote locations.  Spatial diversity ensures that if one of the uplinks is silenced by heavy rain, the other, at a reasonable distance, can take the load.  This approach is absolutely not new, it has been used in good old microwave radio for several decades. <br><br><h5>  Adaptive Coding Modulation (ACM) </h5><br>  Like spatial diversity, ACM is also not a new concept.  ACM has been used for many years in other wireless applications, including microwave radio.  Most recently, technology has found its place in satellite communications.  ACM adapts the modulation order used, and also uses the forward error correction code.  All this affects the spectral efficiency, expressed in bits per second per Hertz.  Adjustments occur depending on noise or other disturbances on the line.  Thus, AFM maximizes throughput regardless of the conditions on the communication line, such as noise, attenuation due to rain, etc. <br><br><h5>  Consumer business opportunities </h5><br>  In order to fully appreciate the capabilities of the consumer business, let's look at the deployment of the first satellite consumer service - Direct-To-Home satellite broadcasting services (DTH).  These services, including the Dish Network and DirecTV, were the first to be deployed in the consumer market in Japan, the UK and the USA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c6/478/68d/6c647868d2ba44b180b9e248a87ae3c1.jpg"><br><br>  At the very beginning of the journey, it was expected that DTH satellite transmission would be limited only to consumers of this service in places where there is no terrestrial analogue.  The surprise was the phenomenal interest of urban and suburban clients.  It turned out that satellite television was an appropriate, competitive offer for consumers who were fed up with a cable company.  This led to a competition between satellite TV providers and cable companies, which continues to this day. <br><br>  Returning to HTS, as is the case with the debut of digital television, there was an expectation that satellite broadband would be relevant as the only hope for people who do not have the ability to connect terrestrial broadband services.  But also, as with DTH, why waste your time on trifles, if you can get more.  Satellite and terrestrial providers will again fight for the hearts and minds of consumers around the world. <br><br>  In general, competition is good.  For the consumer, this creates tremendous opportunities, since both industries will improve and offer the most competitive prices and throughput for the consumer. <br><br><h5>  Business Opportunities </h5><br>  Ground-based providers predict the demise of the satellite industry in corporate communications almost every year, but despite this, the satellite industry services segment has grown in the corporate market.  One of the reasons is the availability of a satellite in any terrain, which is ideal, for example, for an Ibox, which can be placed on a train, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/b9a/050/139b9a0507b743d0bb955c1330a1999e.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Advantages and disadvantages </h5><br>  HTS has more power and packs more data into a carrier frequency than its C-band counterpart.  HTS has a narrower beam and provides excellent VoIP quality.  A smaller receiving ‚Äúplate‚Äù is required (from 0.5 to 1.5 m) compared to 2.5‚Äì4 m with a C-band plate. <br><br>  Rain will have a greater effect on the propagation of the high-frequency Ku-band signal (10.7-12.75 GHz) than on the classical C-band (3.4-5.25 GHz).  Although the Ku group is improving, its coverage is not as significant as that of traditional satellites, and the latency can be significant, which is especially noticeable in online games. <br><br>  Coverage map of satellite Yamal 202 using C-band <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cba/c0a/43a/cbac0a43aa61449cb582cec58b941615.gif"><br><br>  And for comparison, the reception map of the Horizon-2 satellite operating in the Ku range <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/887/911/20b/88791120b44745959013bce0711e5995.jpg"><br><br>  In Europe and the USA, the Ku band is usually used, while Russia and Asia use both bands. <br><br>  Currently, more than half of satellite operators have ordered (or plan to order) HTS satellites.  "Psychics" predict that 14 million users and 50% of the terminals in the enterprises will use the services of high-capacity satellites by 2020. <br>  This will be partly due to economic considerations. <br><br>  For example, some media companies are "predicting" a slide in the price of a satellite news channel from more than $ 100,000 to less than $ 20,000 - an 80% reduction in price.  Another factor (more significant) is the desire of different market segments to have access to network services anywhere and at any time.  In this section, satellite Internet has a significant advantage. <br><br>  HTS opens up many opportunities for a wide range of applications in places that were previously unavailable.  Cellular operators are expanding their coverage area and dealing with markets that were previously unattainable via satellite.  This is a significant advantage for consumers.  However, it is still important to remember that, as with any service, the Ku-band is not a panacea, and it is not suitable for all applications.  This is just a tool in your arsenal that you can choose if necessary. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244527/</a></p>
