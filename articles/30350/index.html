      Respectfully, <br>  Person." </blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What is a serious answer from an honest company: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHello, Man! <br><br>  In accordance with the terms of the ‚ÄúUser Agreement‚Äù valid in <br>  regarding the free provision of hosting services Narod.ru (conditions <br>  The agreements are made publicly available on the Internet at <br>  <a href="">rules.yandex.ru/index.xml</a> ), namely, clause 3 - ‚ÄúYour commitments to <br>  registration ": <br><br>  "In order to use the services of Yandex, you agree <br>  provide true, accurate and complete information about yourself on issues <br>  proposed in the Registration Form, and keep this information up to date <br>  condition.  If you provide incorrect information or Yandex has <br>  serious reasons to believe that the information you provided is incorrect, <br>  incomplete or inaccurate, Yandex has the right to suspend or cancel your <br>  registration and refuse to use your services (or their parts) ... " <br>  " </blockquote><br>  Further more interesting: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn this regard, we ask you immediately, <strong>no later than 10 days from the date of receipt</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>of this notice,</strong> provide YANDEX LLC with your contact information <br>  (contact information of your representative) sufficient to send you <br>  letters by mail (full name, postal address), and also sent to YANDEX LLC <br>  relevant official notice confirming that you are carrying all <br>  responsible for posting (and / or not posting) any information on <br>  Site and agree to protect YANDEX LLC from any lawsuits and complaints <br>  regarding the placement (and / or non-posting) on ‚Äã‚Äãthe Site of any information and <br>  any consequences of such placement (and / or non-placement). <br><br>  During this period, the Site will be closed for user access.  <strong>AT</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>If, after the expiration of the said period, YANDEX LLC does not receive the specified</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>The above information and notice, YANDEX LLC reserves the right to remove</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Website from domain narod.ru</strong> . " </blockquote><br>  Well, to complete the picture: <br><blockquote>  "Mandatory requirements for notification sent by the owner of the Site (hereinafter - <br>  ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù) to YANDEX LLC: <br><br>  1. Formal notification is sent to the name of the General Director Ltd. <br>  YANDEX.  The notice must contain the following guarantees, obligations and <br>  Owner‚Äôs assurances: <br><br>  <strong>1.1.</strong>  <strong>Assurance that the owner of the Site is an individual (specify</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>Full name, passport data, registration address, contact phone number and e-mail for</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>communication).</strong> <br><br>  1.2.  Confirmation, assurances and guarantees that the Site is created, managed and <br>  controlled exclusively by the Owner (on behalf of and on behalf of the Owner); <br>  actions of the owner to create the Site, as well as posting on the Site any <br>  information and other activities of the Owner on the use of the Site does not violate and <br>  does not entail a violation of applicable applicable law. <br><br>  1.3.  Confirmation, assurances and guarantees that the Website Owner bears all <br>  Responsibility for the creation of the Site and the activities carried out within its framework <br>  and using it. <br><br>  1.4.  Obligation of the Owner in the event of the presentation to YANDEX LLC of any <br>  claims against the Site to settle all such claims on behalf of and for <br>  Owner‚Äôs account and reimburse in full all losses, <br>  incurred by YANDEX LLC in connection with such claims. <br><br>  <strong>2.

I apologize to the girl - the employee of Yandex, this is just her job. <br><br>  Answers to all at once: <br>  - closed site was a simple hamster, without porn, Varese, etc .; <br>  - site content has not changed 6 years (!).  In fact, Yandex simply took the first site from the attic and closed it under the pretext that they are not very familiar with the owner; <br>  - this post is created for reflection.  Yes, Yandex owner, he knows better.  But the emergence of such preventive measures on the placement of information on the Internet in general is another swallow from the Internet advanced president. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30350/</a></p>
