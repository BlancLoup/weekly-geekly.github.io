      As it became known, some Uber employees <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/uber-said-it-protects-you-from-spying-security-sources-say-otherwise/">were constantly engaged in ‚Äúhack work‚Äù</a> - they tracked the trips of ordinary citizens, including former spouses, girls and boys' acquaintances.  It is possible that orders for receiving such information were taken even from outside - from friends and acquaintances.  In addition to the jealous, Uber employees tracked some celebrity taxi rides, including R &amp; B singer Beyonce.  Perhaps they did it not out of commercial gain, but out of mere curiosity.  Why not if they have access to this information. <br><br>  This practice inside Uber became known from Samuel Wang Spangenberg‚Äôs written <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3227535-Spangenberg-Declaration.html">court statement</a> , which he gave in October of this year, having signed the notification of responsibility for giving false testimony.  Earlier, Spangenberg was in the state of Uber and was engaged in internal audits.  Now he is <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3229992-Spangenberg-v-Uber-Wegley-Declaration.html">suing</a> a former employer. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Evidence Shpangenberg</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/https://translate" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br>  ‚ÄúThe lack of user data security has resulted in the company's employees being able to track high-ranking politicians, celebrities, and even personal acquaintances of employees, including former girls / boys and former spouses,‚Äù Samuel Shpangenberg said in a written statement. <br><br>  Two years ago, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/johanabhuiyan/uber-is-investigating-its-top-new-york-executive-for-privacy%3Futm_term%3D.li5brZd0wd">there were rumors</a> that the Uber leadership was using a kind of ‚ÄúGod mode‚Äù to track any taxi passenger.  Since then, the company has consistently denied this information and urged users that it cares about them as much as possible and protects personal information.  The company allegedly strengthened the protection, so that employees are not allowed to access the database, except in rare cases.  Now, however, direct evidence has emerged that a kind of ‚Äúregime of God‚Äù was available not only for management, but also for ordinary personnel.  Journalists from the Independent Investigation Center Reveal <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/uber-said-it-protects-you-from-spying-security-sources-say-otherwise/">testified</a> from five former Uber security officials that the company did not stop this practice even after the scandal two years ago. <br><br>  According to former Uber guards, thousands of ordinary Uber employees could get information about where and when specific passengers ordered a taxi and where they were going.  Staff information is also available on social security numbers and other personal information on Uber drivers. <br><br>  Shpangenberg also said that the company deliberately destroyed documents that must be stored by law.  This was done before state inspections of Uber‚Äôs overseas offices.  On computers in offices, files were encrypted remotely before the checks.  Shpangenberg claims that he warned the management of the illegality of these actions, and after 11 months he was fired. <br><br>  The company Uber in an <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3234776-Spangenberg-v-Uber-Response.html">official statement to the court</a> denied the allegations of insufficient protection of user data and illegal practices in the workflow process.  She stated that she fired several employees (less than 10 people) for illegal access to private passenger information. <br><br>  The latest update of the Uber application with the <i>Trip Related Location Data</i> function increases the convenience of passengers who ‚Äúhave nothing to hide‚Äù, but caused concern to human rights defenders, especially since there have been claims to Uber before.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation even <a href="https://epic.org/privacy/internet/ftc/uber/Complaint.pdf">sent a complaint</a> to the Federal Trade Commission. <br><br>  As practice shows, the centralized collection and storage of private information always creates grounds for abuse.  Absolutely innocent people who allegedly ‚Äúhave nothing to hide‚Äù from the state can become victims.  Remember how NSA employees <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/230339/">looked at intimate photos of naked girls</a> in randomly intercepted traffic?  Now here it became aware of abuses by ordinary employees of Uber.  If there is a central database with private information - the attackers will definitely find a way to get access to it. <br><br>  They can do this with the help of social engineering - through bribing Uber employees, even through romance with them (famous hacker Kevin Mitnick even married an administrator from the telephone company GTE, they say, to get access to the system, because before that, a thick and clumsy hacker did not show interest in women).  It is even easier for state intelligence agencies to gain access to the system - they can abuse power, creating the appearance of actions within the legal field. <br><br>  So think again before you enable the feature of collecting geodata in a mobile phone. <br><br>  Uber has more than 40 million users <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/">in 60 countries</a> , including Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  Uber Taxi carries more than 8 million passengers daily. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400015/</a></p>
