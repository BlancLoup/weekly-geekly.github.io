  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LoadRunner 12 Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  March 25, 2014, HP announced the release of version 12 of the HP LoadRunner and HP Performance Center.  HP LoadRunner has especially attracted our attention.  We decided to review the features that appeared in the new version (compared to 11.52) and select the most useful ones with annotations. <br>  On the HP website, you can <a href="http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx%3Fdocname%3D4AA5-0954ENW%26cc%3Dus%26lc%3Den">download a presentation</a> with a brief description of the innovations.  When you start LoadRunner, a welcome window appears in which you can, among other things, familiarize yourself with the list of added functionality. <br>  So, let's go through the list of innovations! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Ability to run Load Generators from the cloud </h5><br>  Allows you to submit a load using load stations located in the Amazon cloud. <br>  <i>It may be suitable for those who are testing an application with access from the Internet, and is experiencing a shortage of its own capacity to supply the load.</i>  <i>It is enough to buy resources in the Amazon cloud, add cloud load generators to the Controller scripts.</i> <br><br><h5>  Improved interaction between Controller and Load Generators </h5><br>  A Network and Security Manager component has been added that allows you to configure the Controller, Load Generators, MI Listener and Monitor interaction ports, exchange data via an encrypted SSL connection, and specify a proxy server. <br>  <i>It can be useful if the firewall blocks the connection to remote load stations.</i>

      <br>
    <h5>  Improvements for testing mobile applications </h5><br>  Added support for playing back recorded SMP (SAP Mobile Platform) sessions and improved the ability to record via proxy. <br>  <i>Can be useful for those who test mobile applications with the appropriate specifics.</i> <br><br><h5>  Added improvements and new features in VuGen </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/718/936/2e1/7189362e16d677a5b5abea42f23bccec.png"><br>  Drawing - 1. Replay Summary. <br><br>  Improved Replay Summary view using the new time-trend graph (Fig. 1), added the ability to edit standard file types in the VuGen editor, VuGen multiple usability enhancements, a new cancel button without rewriting the script (Fig. 2), improved search, improved debugger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38b/c12/c2d/38bc12c2d54982a9c57dcd1bb4aa01f4.jpg"><br>  Drawing - 2. Cancel recording without rewriting the script. <br><br>  <i>Innovations, of course, make the development of scripts somewhat more convenient, but do not seem particularly useful.</i> <br><br><h5>  Protocol improvements </h5><br>  HTTP / HTML Web: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support HTML5 WebSocket. <br>  o Ability to convert TrueClient script to HTTP / HTML Web. <br>  o SSL utility for executing various OpenSSL commands via a user-friendly interface. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support SPDY. <br>  o Internet Explorer 11 support. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Supports TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and NPN. <br>  o Improved support for asynchronous calls. <br>  o Recording troubleshooting: the ability to detect recording errors and suggest a possible fix. <br><br>  Linux support: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Added support for playback at Linux load stations running scripts with the following protocols: <br>  o FTP; <br>  o IMAP; <br>  o LDAP; <br>  o POP3; <br>  o SMTP; <br>  o Windows Sockets. <br>  TruClient support: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rendezvous points; <br>  ‚Ä¢ IP spoofing; <br>  ‚Ä¢ VTS; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Shunra network virtualization. <br><br>  Silverlight: support for the latest version and IP spoofing. <br><br>  SAP Web: Correlation Studio Support. <br><br>  LDAP: support for the latest LDAP SDK. <br><br>  Flex: Support for the latest version of Apache SDK. <br><br>  .NET: version 4.5 support. <br><br>  Citrix: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support last client receiver. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to run multiple published applications in one session. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for the latest version of XenDesktop. <br><br>  <i>In general, it cannot be said that the additions are significant.</i>  <i>The script is converted from the True Client to the Web in the same way that a web script is recorded manually, only instead of the tester, the virtual user clicks on the interface elements and executes the TrueClient script.</i>  <i>This functionality does not seem particularly useful, although in certain cases it probably could be convenient.</i>  <i>SSL utility allows you to convert certificates to PEM.</i> <br><br><h5>  Support for new technologies and platforms </h5><br>  Support for Windows Server 2012, support for recording and playback in Internet Explorer 11, Chrome version 30, and Firefox version 23, support for the latest versions of Eclipse, JUnit, and Selenium. <br><br>  <i>Here, too, nothing supernatural, we note, however, that LoadRunner 11.52 works 90% with these technologies as well.</i> <br><br><h5>  Integration with external IDEs </h5><br>  The ability to call the Controller directly from Visual Studio and Eclipse.  Add-in for Visual Studio 2012 for developers of VuGen-scripts and unit tests.  Support for the latest version of Eclipse. <br><br>  <i>In fact, HP has added "official" support for integration with new versions of development tools.</i> <br><br><h5>  Virtual Table Server Improvements </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to run multiple VTS instances at the same time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Command line support. <br>  ‚Ä¢ VTS support via JavaScript API. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to fill tables with data through the main menu. <br><br>  <i>A very useful tool for storing parameter pools and exchanging data between virtual users.</i>  <i>Any improvements to this tool are good.</i> <br><br><h5>  Integration with latest HP products </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ HP Service Virtualization; <br>  ‚Ä¢ HP Diagnostics; <br>  ‚Ä¢ HP SiteScope; <br>  ‚Ä¢ HP Unified Functional Testing (UFT); <br>  ‚Ä¢ HP Application Lifecycle Management (ALM). <br><br>  <i>They did not check, but it is worth noting that LoadRunner 11.52 probably works with the same versions of products as well.</i> <br><br><h5>  Improved documentation </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Added convenient sequence diagrams instruction on the processes of testing and creating scripts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improved documentation for Flex, Web HTTP / HTML, and TruClient protocols. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The function reference has been improved, including additional code samples and new WebSocket functions. <br><br>  <i>Improving documentation is always good!</i> <br><br><h5>  General improvements </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Simplified product installation with reduced time. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Startup support without administrator rights: now LoadRunner components can be launched from under a normal user account with UAC and DEP enabled. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Improved integration with Shunra. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Functions from the database API are now available in all types of C-scripts. <br><br>  <i>Useful improvements, especially support for launching without administrator rights and the availability of the database API in any C scripts.</i> <br><br><h5>  Modified License </h5><br>  LoadRunner is now distributed with the Community bundle, which replaces the previous built-in license.  The new license contains 50 permanent Vusers, includes all protocols except GUI (UFT), COM / DCOM and protocols from the template bundle. <br><br>  <i>Changing the licensing policy will increase interest in the product.</i>  <i>Now you can fully try the product in advance and determine its suitability before buying a license.</i>  <i>Also, this policy is useful for testers themselves, who can now completely legally study the product and use all its capabilities for non-commercial purposes without restrictions.</i> <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  HP in the new version of LoadRunner has practically not made any improvements for most testers, except perhaps: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integration capabilities with the cloud. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to configure the connection ports between the Controller and load stations. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Add WebSocket features. <br><br>  The above innovations can not be called very significant and greatly facilitate the work.  The only thing worth noting is the change in licensing policy.  But was it worth it to release a new version? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222777/</a></p>
