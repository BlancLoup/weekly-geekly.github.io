The pages of the telegram site and its web version will not work.  And also all links of the form t.me. <br><br>  The main problem is not for ordinary users - they can deal locally with locks and communicate in narrow circles and beyond.  The problem is that telegrams will gradually subside on the Russian market, it will be difficult for new users to join, and old ones will experience inconvenience when bypassing locks.

      We have been working with notifications since 2015 (4 years) Then the telegram was not yet so popular, there were no bots and channels.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/257585/">offered our service as a solution</a> in the field of sending notifications to many platforms without creating our own infrastructure. <br><br>  And then telegrams with chats and bots came out (by the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/261531/">way, we implemented one of the first</a> bots <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/261531/">and wrote an article about it</a> ) and began to write in our posts ‚ÄúWhy is this necessary if there are telegrams ??‚Äù And now the telegram is blocked.  And most likely, multiple chat rooms, bots and channels led to blocking - because of the large closed chats, the RKN believes that large terrorist groups can be in the telegraph.  Our opinion is that the bots and channels in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/320090/">telegram made it "Internet on the Internet" in an uncomfortable way.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What can PushAll offer to Telegram users? </h2><br>  We have no bots, we can not communicate between users.  However, one of the main cases of using a bot in a business is notifications.  We have already told in detail why <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/320090/">notifications via telegrams are inconvenient</a> . <br><br>  Basically, the inconvenience of notifications in telegrams is related to the directivity itself - you have a chat and the notification itself - this is not an object to which you can click, but a message in a chat.  By clicking you go to the dialogue with the bot, and already there you can click on the button or link you need.  Since the image can not be poured into the message - it will come separately. <br><br>  When notifications work in PushAll, it is you who receive the push with your data - immediately with a picture, buttons and a click link.  This saves a lot of time and nerves (doing 3-4 extra surgeries is constantly very annoying) <br><br>  <a href="https://pushall.ru/adminvk">Similarly,</a> our <a href="https://pushall.ru/adminvk">AdminVK microservice works</a> .  Users who switched from analogs for the telegram noted that they began to switch to messages faster and respond to them more quickly in the VC itself, without using the transition to the dialogue.  You can also immediately see the user's avatar and attachment, if he has attached it - this will more quickly orient the dialogue even before clicking on the notification. <br><br>  We also have <a href="https://pushall.ru/pushfeed">PushFeed</a> microservice - it allows you to drive the necessary VK / RSS feeds for scanning and configure filters to trigger alerts.  This allows for example one of the first to read new blog posts, track the activities of large communities (for example, win in the sweepstakes), helps SMM to make quick decisions about writing new posts in social networks based on external sources. <br><br>  And most importantly, these microservices are examples of work.  You can go <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/api">into the documentation</a> yourself <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/api">and make exactly the same microservices</a> for your own needs or the needs of your company.  And it's free. <br><br><h2>  What we can not offer, but what are the options </h2><br>  Telegram itself as an interactive bot is a controversial decision.  Making a couple of clicks in a chat per day is one thing.  But when a bot interface is pushed into a bot telegram, it‚Äôs a hell.  It is much easier to click on a simple web interface for dialogs and a lot of useful buttons than to wander through the wilds of telegraph navigation. <br><br>  We adhere to the ideology that the web is beautiful.  But the pushes are needed in order to induce to action.  We do not want people to sit aimlessly on sites.  We need them to come to fresh content.  This benefits both us and users and those who generate content. <br><br>  We cannot do the messager functionality in the near future.  Although progress has been.  There is an idea to create a pure web messenger that will use PushAll push notifications and work purely in the browser.  It will be adaptive for mobile devices and computers.  This will allow you to open it everywhere without installation, and in a couple of clicks by turning on notifications via PushAll, become online. <br><br><h2>  Security </h2><br>  Telegram is famous for its encryption.  We do not shine any novelties.  We use authorization through Google account, you do not need a phone number to register.  On the Google account side, multifactor authentication can be implemented. <br><br>  We do not urge to keep confidential information in the press - the content of the push must be a title to your real content, which is available by clicking and closed by your authorization.  Also, to protect the pushes themselves is a rather stupid idea - on Android, it is possible to read the notification area when receiving user permission.  This is the reason why the telegram does not show the content of the message in the pushes - the pushes are insecure initially. <br><br>  We do not have personal data.  None  Only information for authorization.  We do not analyze the messages themselves - just the fact of their reception and click.  For statistics purposes only for channels. <br><br>  We recently fixed a serious link vulnerability.  In our service, links are generated as go.php? Lid = number.  By busting it was possible to get all possible redirects.  Now old links will open only if there is an authorization, you are subscribed to a channel, or a public channel.  New links will open only with the new code sl (SecureLink), which contains a secure string.  That is, technically you can send your links in a notification without authorization - only the one who received the notification will receive access to them. <br><br>  Also, a plan is being developed to upgrade the improvement of access control to private channels.  This will allow you to give one-time invitations to the user by reference, and then take away access if necessary.  This is one of the main wishes from the business at the moment. <br><br><h2>  Job stability </h2><br>  We have been working since 2015, during which time we have had a move a couple of times and there was a serious drop of almost 4 days in 2016.  2017 and 2018 was relatively stable, but we are increasing resources and improving resiliency. <br><br>  According to our calculations, the current system is designed for a 100-fold excess of the number of active users.  That is, the stock is large enough.  In extreme cases, even with a 5-fold excess, we will be able to scale. <br><br><h2>  What will happen to the telegram in PushAll? </h2><br>  We support sending notifications via Telegram and will continue to support it.  At least more than 30% of our users are not from Russia.  If our provider in DC will block traffic - we rent a small server-konsyumera abroad, to send notifications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353634/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353634/</a></p>
