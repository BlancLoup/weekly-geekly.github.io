Against their background, companies that care about the health and comfort of their employees and provide corporate bonuses look just a gift of fate.  We will tell you about these companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/394/5c5/92c/3945c592c4114b3087954a643187e90f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, there will be both Google and Facebook (although no, we changed our mind), and companies that you can get a job tomorrow will be a bonus. <br><br><h4>  1. Google </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1d/570/271/f1d57027167d45c09fdcbc903ba6c56a.jpg"><br><h6>  The ubiquitous Google is not limited to luxurious comfortable offices around the world, but also provides countless benefits to employees.  It all starts with a full set of souvenirs and useful trifles for interns, continues with free lunches and the opportunity to invite families to work once a week.  We fill all this with free massages, yoga, car wash, support for young mothers and investments in your education.  Google, you namba van. </h6>

    <h4>  1.5.  Roketbank </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40c/82a/a26/40c82aa26f1d4d0dabece5d4c7944d36.jpg"><br><h6>  Yes, these guys.  Startup in the best traditions: flexible working hours, a projector, a play station and a bike on the wall.  Of outstanding - a beach umbrella, wooden bananas and a woman who prepares a smoothie and runs a hookah.  In general, Oleg Y. envies and by all means tries to gain access to the forbidden drink. </h6><br><br><h4>  2. Zappos </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/845/6e2/fc4/8456e2fc455f419f9e11f62466c66908.jpg"><br><h6>  Holacratia - that says it all.  Down with the managers and the concept of submission.  Every employee should have the opportunity to influence the life of the company.  Absolute transparency and a noble atmosphere of independence.  In addition to these joys, Zappos welcomes employees with the opportunity to do free fitness and seek help from nutritionists, massage therapists, psychologists and other expensive, but very important, specialists.  And in the office there is a special room for sleeping. </h6><br><br><h4>  2.5 Ostrovok.ru </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b78/016/833/b780168335b34dcdb85f839066aaa773.JPG"><br><h6>  Who's bragging about their sleeping rooms?  The island also has its own relax room with pillows and a massage chair.  And also free lunches personally for each employee, a gym on the floor and a swing in the hallway.  Come, see for yourself. </h6><br><br><h4>  3. Yahoo! </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/829/70c/e3882970c2734952b71d233f89bbf390.png"><br><h6>  Most meetings in companies are incredibly boring.  But in Yahoo!  Tom Cruise and Deepak Chopra sometimes come to the meetings with interesting reports and short stories about life.  Can you already imagine how Grigory Leps comes to the meeting in Lanit?  In Yahoo!  know how to work and relax: the company holds corporate volleyball and basketball championships, train with coaches, go to barbecues and concerts (Taylor Swift performed, for example). </h6><br><br><h4>  3.5.  Alpha Laboratory </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/64a/b7b/12564ab7b6cc43568ed64dc08303ff54.jpg"><br><h6>  Speaking of barbecue.  In Alpha Lab, in addition to the coolest superhero-style office, the democratic atmosphere and the game room, there is a comfortable veranda where employees can work over a cup of coffee or have a grill party after work.  This year there will be fine days, so you will have time to enjoy all the benefits of working in the company. </h6><br><br><h4>  4. Airbnb </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4e/a18/355/d4ea183559414bae917b8940c7676e7b.jpeg"><br><h6>  Excellent office, pleasant work and like-minded people around - what could be better for productive work?

Cisco </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f7/f6b/f2e/2f7f6bf2ed024f3785fe82bf334f9905.jpg"><br><h6>  It was not enough for the company to give its employees flexible working hours, healthy meals, and birthdays budgets.  Work-life balance is a 100% feature of this company.  All employees have the right to work remotely, but in order to increase the productivity of such work, the company has created its own telecommunication technology that serves all areas from data storage and transmission to voice service. </h6><br><br><h4>  5.5.  PROFI.RU </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/1d1/0f3/5521d10f32eb43e2ab11f50dc734b641.JPG"><br><h6>  Step by step, this company has its own unique corporate culture.  Casserole for breakfast, vitamin freshes, hours in the gym, which are counted for the workers.  And an additional bonus for those who live within walking distance from the office - a significant increase in salary.  Employees come to work satisfied, and the environment does not suffer from exhaust gases. </h6><br><br>  Take a look at our <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/projects">‚ÄúProjects‚Äù</a> section, where you can solve complex tasks from companies, receive a monetary reward or an opportunity to get a job for your ideas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296184/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296184/</a></p>
