  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to overclock home Wi-Fi</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to experiment with the transition from 2.4 to 5 GHz, since the network has become terribly noisy in the apartment.  All neighbors unscrew the power of the Wi-Fi transmitter in the router to the maximum, hoping to increase the speed, and eventually get the opposite effect. <br><br>  Gone are the days when there was a pair of Wi-Fi routers on one porch and they did not interfere with each other.  Now in the private sector it is quite easy to catch a couple of three Wi-Fi networks, and the situation is really bad in apartment buildings. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Co1NwdzuOI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, I will attach a radio broadcast in my apartment in a residential area.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b4/ts/8e/b4ts8el4mmnbrx88pfwtzhqhb9w.jpeg"><br><br>  But this is at 2.4 GHz, and there are routers and adapters operating at 5 GHz as well.  This has been repeatedly written, but I will simply cite the scan of a radio broadcast at a frequency of 5 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a9/_n/ka/a9_nkaks8bj0jprwcstnc-dt_2o.jpeg"><br><br>  On all channels, only 3 points were found operating at this frequency.  That is, in my apartment at a frequency of 2.4 GHz there were 12 access points, and at a frequency of 5 GHz - only 3. It was decided that we move to 5 GHz. <br><br>  I must say that any wireless network will still play a wired LAN, both in speed and in the stability of data transmission.  But it also happens that the repair has already been done or everyone is using mobile devices or laptops.  In general, we make a network. <br><br><h2>  Experimental Conditions </h2><br>  Everything is pretty trite with me: the router is in the hallway on the entresol where the provider has started the wire.  The repair has already been made and the wire cannot be pulled into the room.  The computer is 5 meters from the router behind a brick wall and a wooden door.  I have been working for a long time with the Zyxel Giga III router, which can work in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, so it will work perfectly for the experiment.  But what better to take: USB adapter or another router as a client - I decided to check it myself.  I had an adapter (Zyxel NWD6605), so I took another Zyxel Keenetic Air router, which also supports both wireless frequencies and started the experiment.  I chose New Year holidays for the experiment, as the people are leaving and the radio broadcast is free. <br><br>  The measurements were carried out using the Iperf utility, in modes 1 and 20 streams.  For fun, I even opened and closed the wooden door to the room to find out how the wood would affect the passage of the signal. <br><br><h2>  Experimental results </h2><br>  I must say that the results on weekdays were very different from those that I received on holidays.  This is especially noticeable when transmitting data at a frequency of 2.4 GHz, since everyone returns home and begins to actively surf the Internet. <br><br>  Most clearly about the speed of networks can be judged by the diagram.  So I measured the speed during the work of one stream, as if just one file was swinging.  At the same time, I opened and closed the door and tried different frequencies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/sx/hd/edsxhd21_ffwbyslruefzvp1btc.jpeg"><br><br>  The diagram clearly shows that the closed door cuts off the transfer speed quite well, and the Wi-Fi adapter works slower due to the fact that the antenna at the router has the best gain.  By the way, the theory was confirmed that the signal at a higher frequency penetrates worse through obstacles: the transmission speed at 2.4 GHz is higher for the adapter than at 5 GHz with the door closed.  In general, you want to watch Youtube at a normal speed - you need to connect a router at a frequency of 5 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/in/ek/ly/ineklyxoaabemt7zcunoqmclclw.jpeg"><br><br>  Go to the second chart.  Then I launched 20 transfer streams, as if the page was loaded with a bunch of photos or the torrent download worked.  It immediately became apparent that the 5 GHz frequency is less loaded and therefore provides a higher data transfer rate.  And the influence of the open door also became noticeable. <br><br>  And now I will give a separate schedule of work at different frequencies, with the door open and the transfer of 20 streams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nm/a3/uf/nma3uft1ngmi307q-9fuwkjp_l8.jpeg"><br><br>  Closed door more than 1.5 times cuts data transfer speed.  Thus, indeed, the open door allows you to surf the Internet faster. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Answering the questions above, we can safely say: the Zyxel Keenetic Air router in adapter mode works faster than the USB adapter.  If only because it has better characteristics of the antennas.  Over a wireless network of several channels, the file will download faster, so downloading by a torrent will be faster, just don‚Äôt put too many channels at the same time.  And now the answer to the most interesting question: is it true that the closed door slows down the Internet.  Yes, any obstacle impairs the passage of the radio signal, and therefore slows down the work with the network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371177/</a></p>
