Every couple of weeks I read news in the spirit of ‚ÄúThere are already 1 billion web pages!‚Äù, ‚ÄúEach group of the kindergarten‚Äú Alyonushka ‚Äùnow has its own website!‚Äù, ‚ÄúIP addresses end in the third circle!‚Äù.  Schoolchildren are distributed with iPads, all African children have been sitting on $ 100 laptops for a long time, and <a href="https://twitter.com/">pigeons</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/">bridges are</a> tweeting in advanced Europe.  In general, informatization overwhelms everyone and everything, to the most secret secrets today, literally Google submit!  Thanks to Wikipedia, you can not look like a fool on the forums, social networks successfully disguised sociopaths as extroverts, for other tasks, too, ‚Äúhave your own application‚Äù. <br>  On the Internet now you can work and have fun.  The Internet allowed the guy from the Siberian village to work on the firmware of the Hadron Collider, thousands of literary talents revealed through LiveJournal, the world saw its heroes on YouTube.  Isn't it beautiful?  Not true. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Cell </h4><br>  Where is this billion pages?  Where are these kids with sites, pigeons with ipads and laptops on bridges?  I can't see it all!  I have one (one, damn it!) Site where I read news.  Another one is for the weather.  The third is for jokes.  Here there is Habra for ... well, for what I do here, whatever it is.  And all in my bookmarks there are pieces of 15 sites.  Each of them won his place by sweat and blood, no one here is superfluous and this list changes to 1-2 positions a year.  Why?  And everything is very simple: <br><ul><li>  Good sites very rarely roll into full thrash - nothing to delete. </li><li>  Every new site is time.  My time, which is already not enough for anything.  Something worthy of it appears very rarely. </li></ul><br>  And what's the use of me from all these billions of pages, if I never get on them?  At the same time, I and my dozen sites are still not at the bottom of the food chain - there are hundreds of millions of people for whom the Internet is completely equal to the contact (Facebook, classmates) and they don‚Äôt go anywhere except for these sites. <br>  You argue that this is from my tank you can see only the desert to the nearest hump, but you, you know in this very Internet, hoo hoo!  Congratulations.  In our common prison, your cell is 2 square meters larger, and it does not go to the service yard with the piglets wallowing in the dirt, but to the street, where cars with the same piglets are driving past its windows.  Plus, you are sitting in your prison every day substantially more than me.  And even spending 10 lives, do not read everything that is written on the Internet in one day.  Well, what's the use? <br><br><h4>  Problem of choice </h4><br>  About the problem of choosing somewhere here on Habr√© there was a good video, but I can‚Äôt find something.  The bottom line is that when there are 3 options - we appreciate them well, choose the right one and rejoice.  When the options are 300, we: <br><ul><li>  None of them we really appreciate (no time) and get upset </li><li>  Spend a lot of time and get upset </li><li>  We choose not the best and get upset </li><li>  Even if we choose the best - it does not meet our expectations for the best product from 300 options and we get upset again </li></ul><br>  And this with 300 options.  And with a billion?  Everything is as much worse. <br><br><h4>  Professional swamp </h4><br>  Very well, the limitations of the Internet can be seen when using it in the professional field.  Here I am, for example, a programmer.  Sometimes I look for work information on the Internet.  Looking for various means - through search engines, through colleagues, through Twitter, through questions.  And all this monotony of paths leads in the end to the same vicious circle: MSDN, Stackoverflow, Codeguru, and 2-3 more sites.  Five resources for the whole huge globe!  If you are doing something else, you, too, most likely have one professional forum, one or two subject blogs, maybe a profile store or a group in the social network - that's all!  Same five resources.  Nowhere to go, there are no analogues!  Give me in runet analog RSDN or Habra - there are none, no!  And so wherever you look.

    <h4>  The light at the end of the tunnel is painted on the wall. </h4><br>  It is now accepted to say that the Internet, they say, has equalized everyone, has given the opportunity to work on anything from anywhere in the world, regardless of anything, and get a decent wage.  And indeed, at different ends of the electronic money pipeline the ‚Äúemployer &lt;=&gt; worker‚Äù can be found both by mega-corporations and troika schoolchildren. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8b/ec1/742/d8bec1742b7b4eb2617ffc225f184feb.jpg"><br><br>  But what does ‚Äúequalize‚Äù mean?  That means the same thing everywhere.  A designer from a village near Zhmerinka and an elite Moscow studio use the same photoshop, programmers of all stripes write in the same languages, use the same IDE and compilers, which are adequate for the whole world - a dozen.  Those.  wherever I go, in projects of whatever scale I work, my work tools (and, in fact, technologies and tasks) will be the same.  Still the same rearrangement of bytes in memory by more and more complicated and confusing methods.  Where to strive, why grow?  ‚ÄúAn interesting project, your startup‚Äù - you say.  And what's the difference, if you write all the same cycles and functions there (draw round buttons, typeset for IE6, patch KDE for DOS) the same 8 hours a day (or even 12)? <br><br><h4>  There will be no conclusions </h4><br>  The Internet is very well outlined the framework in which there is humanity.  If earlier I did not know that there is something somewhere, now I can know for sure that there is nothing anywhere in the world.  I see the boundaries of technology development and I understand that I will never go to Mars again - but a man of my age in the 80s could have been seriously dreaming about this.  I can see the announcement of a new film - and not go on this thrash, although 15 years ago I would have gone without an announcement and I would have liked it.  I cannot show off my erudition in the chat room, because ‚Äúyes you read it on Wikipedia‚Äù, I don‚Äôt know how and what I will teach my younger child - he will probably learn to google before he learns the multiplication table, and Google knows more of me. <br><br>  Do you like the information at your fingertips?  This information is tightly stuck to the fingers ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141281/</a></p>
