    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  As such, the freelancer from me is very mediocre.  Not because I am doing poorly, but because I have completed only two orders.  In addition, I am not a greedy person, but because when a person came to me in ICQ and said that he wanted to order a website for a small budget, I agreed. <br>  Half a week the layout was developed, refined and approved by the customer, after which we agreed to meet on Monday 31.05 (today). <br><br><h4>  The development of events </h4><br>  Being in the appointed place a little earlier than the set time, I easily found the right car (Volkswagen Passat blue wagon; I tried to memorize the numbers, but later they disappeared from my head and now I can‚Äôt remember).  Immediately struck by the fact that the girl was sitting in the back seat.  I, just in case, called the customer.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs an essence or not, but I was also strained by the fact that the phone had moved to him from the back seat. <br>  I got into the car.  Greeting, the conversation immediately went about guarantees.  I showed my passport.  The girl wrote off some data from him.  The next detail, striking the eye, but the price of which I did not yet understand, was the specification of the cost of the order and, in fact, the prepayment.  Asking this question, he, it seemed to me, somewhat ambiguously looked at the passenger seat, at the girl. <br>  Dear Sirs, they also clarified how many orders I have fulfilled.  I honestly answered that two were friends of the family.  I wondered with a counter question how did I find the role of a performer.  The ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù probably didn‚Äôt understand much about it himself, but the girl was doing it.  It turned out on the "freelance".  Considering that nowhere, except on free-lance.ru, I am not registered, we can conclude. <br>  By the way, the question ‚Äúwhere did you find me, because I am from the village and no one knows me?‚Äù Was asked on the very first day of the order, when the TK was only specified.  "A colleague was looking for a performer."  Well, so be it. <br>  Having specified (for the second time!) The amount, he counted the money (Belarusian rubles) and gave it to me.  As soon as the money was in my wallet, the gentlemen in the car informed me that it was a test purchase.  They also voiced their type of activity - the tax inspectorate - they presented certificates. <br><br>  Further, I was informed that the whole conversation was recorded on a dictaphone.  I asked to show my ID again and, in fact, tried to carefully examine it.  It really did not happen.  Is that the names remembered - "customer" lied something, it turns out. <br><br>  The girl (N., for short) called someone and for a couple of minutes while I was getting acquainted (in fact, it‚Äôs hard to say that I did it because I was in a completely different reality) with documents, it became in the car less space for two people. <br>  The first sat behind me and was mostly silent.  Very few people talked to him, in general (and the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù itself accepted a rather passive role of some kind of observer).  The second one (let it be A.), I still didn‚Äôt understand who, I must call and invite to the court later. <br>  The Lord specified where I study.  A. asked and advised how best to write an explanation for the question "How many orders were executed."  Sometimes I laugh it off.  For example, to the question ‚Äúwhat did you carry out the order for‚Äù I considered adequate to answer ‚Äúon the machine‚Äù.  The Lord did not try to spread rot to me, but I did not try to slander or complicate their task.  He answered, trying to maintain some kind of artificial atmosphere of friendliness, but pouring as much water as possible. <br><br><h4>  Thoughts </h4><br>  In general, there was no tension or pressure on me, which in itself is not bad.  A. said that since there had been no such offenses for me before, most likely, the fine would be in the range of 1 to 3 basic values.  This is about $ 30. <br><br>  I lie to you if I don‚Äôt say that I feel like a complete idiot.  Analyzing this situation from the very beginning, I find more and more errors.  Own mistakes.  Let's see how things turn out in court.  Judging by the experience of Mr. <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/amd_by/" class="user_link">amd_by</a> , a large sum was <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/amd_by/" class="user_link">collected</a> from him, which was held on the Internet accounts.  In my case, there have never been any accounts. <br><br>  I think that in the near future, I will urgently ask for the opinions of lawyers, as well as people who can share some experience.  Perhaps after all I will give rest to legs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95064/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95064/</a></p>
