Streaming video on the go!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Always dreamed on the road to listen / watch streaming content from the Internet.  With gprs / edge, this is not at all possible, skylink is possible, but very expensive.  Wi-Fi from Golden, coverage is negligible, fragmented, and the seam between the stations is present. <br><br>  Yesterday, I got a WiMax modem from Yota (Samsung SWC-E100), he immediately became friends with my macbook pro, got into the express card slot, the drivers got up under the mac without any problems.  On this day, I was to travel to several districts of Moscow, and it was an ideal environment for testing WiMax networks, which is called ‚Äúon the go‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to understand the intricacies of the network, so the whole review was built at user level.  What is called out of the box testing service. <br><br>  First of all, I measured the speed: <br><img src="http://rammstein.ru/yota/novinka.png" alt="image">

      In the Novinsky area. <br><br>  Well, the beginning is not bad.  In order to check how fast and seamless the network works, I launched a video stream of my favorite radio station <a href="http://rts.fm/">RTS.FM</a> and put a beech in the next seat. <br><br>  Passing from the novelty to the Crimean bridge, and then across the embankment on the street.  1905 -&gt; TTK -&gt; Leningradskoe highway, and before reaching the airport area, I was still listening and watching the streamtime video stream!  After the metro airport, the connection disappeared, and appeared only in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãVoykovskaya, worked a little bit and after the metro the river station disappeared again.  Having arrived home (in Khimki, microdistrict 2B), the signal was never caught; ( <br><br>  I note that in the center, communication breaks were, if we exceed the speed of more than 60 km / h.  Once in 10-20 minutes, my video stream stopped for 5-30 seconds, then it was automatically restored.  If you go less than 60 km.ch.  - No cliffs were observed. <br><br>  <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps/ms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26hl%3Dru%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D102254455457880522764.00046653b002b319a801a%26ll%3D55.804754,37.510071%26spn%3D0.200284,0.727844%26z%3D11">Sample route map on google (green works, red doesn't)</a> <br><br>  Later in the evening, I went to Mitino, and naturally I grabbed a beech with Wymax and carried on testing. <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe village of Putilkovo near Moscow, Yota happily said that a signal was caught, the speed was immediately measured: <br><br><img src="http://rammstein.ru/yota/putilkovo.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And the video stream of the station RTS.FM.  From Putilkovo to the mitino, I rode without a single connection break, streaming video played all the time without stopping.  Then my path was towards the October field.  He turned on rts.fm again, drove onto the Pyatnitskoe highway, which smoothly passed into Volokolamsk, when approaching the tunnel under the Moscow canal - the connection was lost, and appeared only a kilometer later, near the turn from the volokolamka to the Kurchatov Institute. <br><br>  I again listen to my favorite radio from Ineta, travel to the October field, conduct the first test indoors.  Communication is the same as on the street. <br><br>  I continue on to Novorizhskoye Highway.  I leave for the people's militia, further to Zhukov in the direction of the picturesque bridge, when approaching the bridge, <a href="http://rts.fm/">RTS.FM</a> stops playing, yota shows the zero level of reception.  After leaving the tunnel, the connection did not appear throughout my journey along the new riga. <br><br>  <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps/ms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26hl%3Dru%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D102254455457880522764.00046653e30dc6da28280%26ll%3D55.826359,37.408447%26spn%3D0.200173,0.727844%26z%3D11">Sample route map on google (green works, red doesn't)</a> <br><br>  The next day, my path was on the street.  Argunovskaya (district VDNH).  Having left Khimki, I drove along the Moscow Ring Road in the direction of Altufevskoe Highway. <br><br>  In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãDmitrovka - the signal suddenly appeared, and almost as suddenly disappeared, and returned again only on the altushka, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãul.  Khachaturian.  However, I was not able to listen to Internet radio.  the cliffs were every 20 seconds. In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Ostankino tower, the connection stabilized, and <a href="http://rts.fm/">rts.fm</a> accompanied me to my destination. <br><br>  Further, a second test was made inside the building, on ul.  Argunovskaya.  In the back of the room - the connection was normal: <br><br><img src="http://rammstein.ru/yota/argunovskay.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps/ms%3Fie%3DUTF8%26hl%3Dru%26msa%3D0%26msid%3D102254455457880522764.0004665409836cde17731%26ll%3D55.826359,37.408447%26spn%3D0.200173,0.727844%26z%3D11">Sample route map on google (green works, red doesn't)</a> <br><br>  <b>On the seed.</b> <br><br>  I really hope that yota will not develop according to the megaphone / skylink scenario (test work is normal, a massive influx of customers is disgusting, after a year or two the work is normalized again). <br><br>  About the modem, for macbook pro owners, in my opinion the best choice is an express card, because  we are not spoiled by a large number of usb ports.  By the way, as I inserted the modem into the laptop, I don‚Äôt pull it out anymore, it's quite convenient.  Well, as in all Korean / Chinese - there is a light bulb that constantly flashes when using the network.  (for which it is a mystery, because the connection status and signal level are also visible on the monitor screen).  Drivers and utility Yota Access for Mac made on 5+.  Here and the indicator in the panel (not just an icon, but shows the signal level), and shows the connection speed, how much traffic is consumed, and so on. <br><br>  I am very pleased that the available unlimited (I hope because of this, the network will not lie).  This opens firstly the way to heavy content (streaming video, audio), download podcasts on the road (I always forget to charge my iPhone with podcasts at home). <br><br>  In principle, the network is operational, but a lot of spots.  I repeat the words from other reviews - if the network is caught, then the Internet works fine. <br><br>  PS I publish the review just by means of <a href="http://yota.ru/">yota</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55897/</a></p>
