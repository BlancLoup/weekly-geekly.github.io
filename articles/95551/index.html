      The first thing that surprised and, in principle, at the same time pleased - is that they are not delivered in a box, but directly in a case with a convenient handle, which accommodates headphones and wires. <br><br><img src="http://img227.imageshack.us/img227/1526/6041994.jpg"><br><br>  What is in the black box?  I have no secrets from you.  You are welcome: <br><br><img src="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/5334/6041999.jpg"><br><br>  Equipment: <br>  - Headphones Fischer Audio FA-005 <br>  - Straight wire <br>  - Twisted wire <br>  - Adapter 3, 5mm - 6, 3 mm. <br><br>  Nothing extra.  Only that which may be useful to you.  That is, they took it and you can immediately use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3fd/6c7/eb8/3fd6c7eb8c454485f08ffb39b6cc81f7.jpg"><br><br>  The headphones themselves look quite nice.  Classic matte black with leather ear pads. <br><br><img src="http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/4143/6042005.jpg"><br><br>  Specifications <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/700/c03/4bf/700c034bffde736b6d85eab803ff6136.png"><br><br><h4>  Design and comfort </h4><br>  I think here he deserves a separate word.  Headphones look very solidly made.  Plastic matte with metal inserts (bezel, name).  The headband is made of a metal plate sheathed with two types of fabric: soft on the inside and smooth glossy on the outside. <br><br><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/8062/6042014.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones foldable (as seen in the first photo), it is very convenient during transportation. <br>  Leather ear cushions shallow, soft foam inside, which makes listening very comfortable and pleasant to the ears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4c0/ca0/abc/4c0ca0abcb23aaf4b00c95bb453d2994.jpg"><br><br>  The braid of the cables is also made of matte black material, very dense, the wire is unlikely to break or grind.  Jacks on both wires are made at right angles with a thread (for twisting the adapter to 6, 3 mm), which is convenient for connecting to various DJ settings and mixers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36f/705/b2f/36f705b2f8bf788bd8ce5853751c05cd.jpg"><br><br>  As for the comfort of the device: they sit on the head very comfortably, they do not press.  The size of the rim is adjustable, and the spread is large enough (for my head I set the average, although I usually push it to the maximum). <br><br>  Special comfort is given by the fact that the mount of the loudspeakers themselves is spinning in all directions of the world and it is very easy to adapt the headphone slope for yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/749/b69/a55/749b69a55075089283394e461cbc8090.jpg"><br><br>  Well, of course, Fischer Audio pleases users with the supply of twisted wires.  I think everyone understands its advantages: in a twisted state, short, in a stretched state - a long one.  Conveniently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/286/b6e/6a6/286b6e6a6a533e143b2b05f34edec1c0.jpg"><br><br>  The wires are connected to the headphone jack 3, 5mm.  According to users, Habr is convenient because  the wire will simply disconnect if you tighten enough of it, and not deform and damage.  And moving away from the console - it is more convenient to unhook the wire than to remove the headphones from the head (or neck), and even more so than dragging them along with the wire.  But in principle, if you wish, you can fix the jack by turning it slightly and snapping it on the keyhole. <br><br><img src="http://img688.imageshack.us/img688/7656/6042022.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br><br><img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/8485/6042019.jpg"><br><br>  These monitor "ears" are designed specifically for DJs, but if you want, they can take advantage of anyone, especially loving bass.  A bass headphones reproduce a lot and, I would say, thick, but surprisingly quite clean.  Sometimes these blows to the ears even strain a little, but low frequencies are felt.  Well, then, this is a complete immersion when you hear every beat of the Rammstein drummer. <br><br>  If you listen to the tracks without bass, you can see that the middle and high sounds are also clearly reproduced. <br><br>  In general, the sound is very clear and crisp. <br>  Easily provide a crystal clear and surprisingly clear sound, while providing comfort and ease of use. <br><br>  FA-005 are closed headphones, it isolates external noise, which is important when mastering.  Also, I think this is what affects the density of the bass, with openness the feeling would be worse. <br><br>  I personally liked the sound very much when listening to Trance and D &amp; B, as well as listening to melodic tracks with instrumental. <br><br>  For experts, I cite graphs of frequency response, phase response and impedance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12e/792/043/12e7920432ce8fefaff9e76a7329c168.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/017/445/895/01744589525824cf2c07c4234f8e7c47.png"><br><br>  Price issue: in the region of 4000 p.  Not too expensive, but not too cheap.  Rather suitable really knowledgeable people, or those who want and love to listen to the bass in the tracks. <br><br><h4>  Overall impression and results </h4><br><br><img src="http://img243.imageshack.us/img243/9067/6042017.jpg"><br><br>  Headphones like.  And the appearance and quality of reproduction.  For its price, I think, quite cool.  Undoubtedly, professionals will find more merit in work, but as an ordinary user, I can definitely say that the headphones are on the top five. <br>  Sit on his head tightly, but not under pressure.  The sound is clear, clear, well listened to the bass (sometimes even beat on the ears).  2 interchangeable wires and a cover - a great addition to the good quality of the FA-005.  Definitely advise amateurs and professionals. <br><br>  Here are the subjective pros and cons: <br><br><h4>  pros </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Design <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Design and comfort <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Clear sound <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Complete set (2 wires and cover) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/605/684/b03/605684b03744880889a86bc2023d43b2.png">  Price <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb1/41a/892/bb141a892a966a53ae6c2002b54b39cd.png">  Bass bust <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e8/464/ce7/1e8464ce7e515b02956d2e13bc2efbad.jpg"><br><br>  Thank you for reading to the end. <br>  Great weekend to everyone!  =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95551/</a></p>
