In the original, this turnover looks more neat - desktop class performance.  The marketers who invented it practically do not cheat: after all, desktop computers are very different, and, of course, there is somewhere a slightly dusty case, the stuffing of which works at about the same speed as in the advertised laptop.  However, mobile computers do not often compete with really powerful workstations: they have slightly ... choked processors and little RAM, and the volume of the drive is not serious.  You can work, of course, not without pleasure, but it‚Äôs better not to compare with a normal desktop PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2e/81b/efe/d2e81befe0b244b3940be1aaf28e6a76.jpg"><br><br>  Models that really replace the desktop computer in all respects can be counted on the fingers.  We‚Äôll talk about one of them, the Dell Precision M3800 Mobile Workstation.  It was she who first made me look at my seemingly powerful home computer with a certain skepticism and seriously think about upgrading. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/c6f/cf3/86cc6fcf355e4682830f1af09f8722a9.jpg"><br><br>  Dell itself doesn‚Äôt even consider this device a laptop.  On the US website of the company Precision M3800 is found only in the Workstations section (workstations).  Of course, there is a certain ... coquetry in this: if something looks like a laptop, works like a laptop and is easily carried away with itself - this is most likely a laptop.  Moreover, the exterior of the M3800 resembles a grown-up Dell ultrabook.  Grown up, but not plump: in the thickest place only 18 mm.  Plus, thanks to the aluminum frame and carbon fiber body, the weight of the machine with a 15.6-inch screen draws only 1.88 kg. <br><br>  So why a workstation, not a laptop?  Let's see. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36e/ac0/0dd/36eac00dd6014e81af98e16aa3de14b9.jpg"><br><br>  The machine uses an Intel Core i7-4702HQ processor with 4 cores and support for Hyper-Threading.  The nominal frequency of 2.2 GHz, under load up to 3.2 GHz.  In the benchmark built into the WinRAR archiver, he knocks out more than 7100 points, whereas the 4-core Core i5 3570K in my home workstation, with its nominal frequency of 3.4 GHz, is barely enough for 2000 points.  Approximately at the same mark stuck so-called Core i7 in ultrabooks.  In the case of the Precision M3800, it is safe to say that processor performance will be enough for any work tasks, be it image processing, video and rendering in computer-aided design (CAD) systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/43f/493/01843f493c5e4b6cac96a2d4f55782fb.jpg"><br><br>  To match the processor and graphics chip - Nvidia Quadro K1100M with two gigabytes of its own memory type GDDR5.  The GK107 chip, belonging to the Kepler family, has 384 shader cores.  Records in games should not be expected from him, everything is at the level of the GT 750M consumer accelerator.  But Quadro drivers are optimized for professional applications (CAD or DCC), and the difference with the usual GeForce in the latter is very noticeable.  It is also possible to connect an external monitor with a resolution of up to 3840x2160 pixels. <br><br>  However, it is not necessary to do this, because most M3800 configurations use a 15.6-inch IPS-matrix with a resolution of 3200x1800 pixels.  The screen is really very good.  Bright, but not cutting eyes, with juicy, but correct shades and, importantly, with uniform illumination.  In mobile computers with Windows such are rare.  You can find fault with the fact that the screen is a) glossy and b) touch-sensitive, but the first one doesn‚Äôt interfere with the work at all, and no one forces touching the glass.  Also, high resolution affects in games: despite the fairly productive graphic part, even in World of Tanks it turns out to play only at the minimum settings.  What hints again: the car is not for games, but for work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/908/4a4/5e2/9084a45e29aa47f9afa9933bd95659b3.jpg"><br><br>  The above applies to all versions of the Dell Precision M3800, with the exception of one configuration with a Full HD screen (which, as you might guess, is the cheapest).  The remaining items can vary and, moreover, you can change them yourself after purchase. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/816/72c/0b1/81672c0b15f94306baf5aa6753f73918.jpg"><br><br>  The amount of RAM is from 8 to 16 GB.  In fact, in the characteristics of the processor it is written that it will pull 32 GB, but on the Dell website it says ‚Äúup to 16‚Äù.  Unfortunately, there is no suitable volume of modules at hand and there is nothing to check the performance of the 32-gigabyte configuration.  Although even 16 GB is, to put it mildly, a lot.  The M3800 uses regular SODIMM DDR3 modules that can be replaced independently.  The only obstacle to the upgrade is the need to remove the entire back cover.  Yes, no special windows are provided in the name of the rigidity of the structure, but, on the other hand, to unscrew the 12 screws is not so hot.  The main thing that the farm was a miniature hex screwdriver. <br><br>  Then you can choose between the configuration with a conventional hard drive or a combination of SSD + HDD.  The LITEON SSD (256 GB) used in my version is 512 MB / s in read mode and 398 MB / s in write mode (by comparison, the corporate Seagate SSD in my home computer shows 431 and 440 MB / s, respectively). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86f/09f/515/86f09f5157614ec2a0a5f48639fa36bc.jpg"><br><br>  Next door is a hybrid Seagate Laptop SSHD with a capacity of 500 GB with a spindle speed of 5400 rpm.  Next to the plates, it houses an 8 GB flash memory chip, where the drive automatically copies the most frequently used files.  If you, for example, constantly open the same large spreadsheet in Excel or a database, the acceleration can be very noticeable.  If 500 GB is not enough, the user is free to replace the drive with any other volume of any kind ‚Äî as long as it fits in 7 mm height.  More precisely, the height of the usual and fit 9-millimeter, but it does not fit well with the mount.  And to insert, to hang out - is risky.  SSD is also easy to change, and you can immediately buy a configuration with 512 GB of flash storage on board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58a/534/c44/58a534c44df049d9a3573782eb664114.jpg"><br><br>  By default, the Windows 8.1 Professional OS is installed on the Precision M3800, however, Dell provides for the possibility of delivery with Windows 7 Pro.  It all depends on the user's preferences, which, I suppose, will merge together when Windows 10 comes out with all the advantages of Windows 8.1, like speed and security, and the more familiar Start menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/720/b1b/2ce/720b1b2ce2d24d9889c43b8693790522.jpg"><br><br>  The M3800, shipped to Russia, uses an Intel Dual Band Wireless-N 7260 adapter with support for 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.0.  In the American version, you can also find Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260, which supports 802.11ac, but it is still being certified in our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2bf/255/8ed/2bf2558ed6ff4600b5a04b17200ac84e.jpg"><br><br>  However, the module is not soldered to the board, and if necessary it can be replaced with a more advanced one.  And by the way, not necessarily the production of Intel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/cac/c72/da5cacc72d4843968144c27ae7df2bc9.jpg"><br><br>  The Precision M3800 cooling system serves both the CPU and the GPU, and given the fact that their total TDP is 82 W (37 + 45), it took two turbines.  However, they can only be heard during 3D games or long rendering, and in everyday use they work completely silently. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/498/18b/619/49818b61961b4caa89c59339a0ca0dcf.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In operation</b> <br><br>  The Dell Precision M3800 differs from most of its simply big counterparts not only with serious performance, but also with some sort of calm forethought.  For example, a diode is built into the charger plug, and it is always visible whether the battery is currently charging or not.  Also on the left side is the charge level indicator, illuminated by pressing a slightly protruding above the surface of the button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7f/45e/529/f7f45e529f4e47929be44e86a2213187.jpg"><br><br>  The user has three USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0, and from two (specially marked), you can charge other devices, even if the computer is turned off.  Also there was a place for HDMI ports, mini DisplayPort and card reader.  An Ethernet port is not provided, but a USB-to-Ethernet adapter is included with the M3800.  Also in the box is a 8 GB flash drive, which contains files for full restoration of factory settings.  It is useful if you decide to change the drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/479/f4f/f0b/479f4ff0bef44fe4acb1cfeb8820324c.jpg"><br>  <i>The connectors are very solidly fixed on the motherboard.</i>  <i>Ripping them out or damaging is almost impossible.</i> <br><br>  The base of the machine is made of "one piece of carbon fiber", the top cover is made of aluminum.  Build quality is flawless.  Just perfect - that's all. <br><br>  Due to the lightness of the lower part, the trick with raising the lid with one finger can only be partially: the bottom rushes for some time after the top.  The space around the keyboard is equipped with a slightly soft and very pleasant to the touch coating, which in addition is completely unmarked.  Unfortunately, the touchpad just loves to collect "fingers", which does not affect its functionality, but will force beauty lovers to always keep on hand a package of cleaning wipes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c73/6d0/860/c736d08604f147bf9d3a02f4c79e6679.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard is equipped with a backlight, extremely useful for workaholics and owls at the same time, and generally comfortable.  Especially if you get used to it during the day.  The only thing that causes some confusion is why the keyboard was made so small?  She seemed to migrate from the 13-inch ultrabook, where, for obvious reasons, you need to save space and reduce the keys.  But here there is a lot of space!  Business colleagues manage to embed almost full-size versions into 15-inch machines.  I repeat, if I get used to it a bit, it is easy to print, and the keystroke is optimally selected, but a little more ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/322/c89/826/322c8982694e4107be03cfbde5f9b6fa.jpg"><br><br>  Taking into account the diagonal of the screen and the performance of the filling, it can be assumed that the battery in the M3800 is suitable only for use in UPS mode, but this is far from the case.  Indeed, under maximum load, when both the processor and the GPU are working, the 61-watt 6-cell battery can be planted in just half an hour, but in less benign modes it will last for five hours.  If we take the version with a 91Wh battery (there is one in the options), the workstation will give odds to most ultrabooks.  With incomparable performance and overall comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/704/29c/6c7/70429c6c794b49bba61a3c1750c6dd64.jpg"><br><br>  The plate on the back of the M3800 is not for beauty.  It hides two screws and service information. <br>  The question may arise - why do we need laptops with a large screen and such a powerful filling?  There are also normal large computers, there are monoblocks.  What is the meaning of a laptop? <br><br>  I myself have a desktop (more precisely, desktop) computer since 1996.  However, over the course of four years (from 2009 to 2013), I simultaneously held at home the following workstations - laptops with a diagonal from 15 to 18 inches.  Comfortable they.  Otherwise you will not tell.  Big computer while you turn on, while you download.  And then I just lifted the lid - and please.  Plus, if necessary, you can always go to another room or to the kitchen - and continue to work with all comfort.  True, it was not necessary to think about taking these colins with you on a trip or to work ‚Äî they were thick and heavy.  Precision M3800 on their background just a feather. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed1/be0/a24/ed1be0a241f048bd9a5e924e55426ecb.jpg"><br>  <i>In this photo, you can compare the thickness of the M3800 with smartphones HTC One M8, Nokia Lumia 920 and Samsung Galaxy S5</i> <br><br>  My laptops did not have such high-quality screens, and therefore they were very conditional for working with graphics.  And with the video, I preferred to be wise on a large computer.  And yet the big comfortable laptop on the table was always very helpful.  I broke up with him just because I brought home a luxurious Philips monitor with a 21x9 aspect ratio and a resolution of 2560x1080.  "Tanks" on it look just wonderful.  The panorama is like two screens glued together.  Yes, and three pages in Word at the same time - this is useful.  In general, as a result, the desktop computer turned on more and more, and the laptop less and less.  It was necessary, reluctantly, to sell the last giant (just the 18-inch one) and finally move to the desktop.  By the way, all desktop laptops were sold almost faster than iPhones.  In the latter case, three minutes passed from the publication of the announcement to the letter from the buyer. <br><br>  The Dell Precision M3800 is an absolute replacement for a desktop workstation.  To work effectively, it has everything - an adequate supply of performance (in some cases - and excess), drives of sufficient and easily increased volume, an uncompromisingly good screen.  And, of course, interfaces for connecting additional displays and accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/797/7d3/d617977d3eea4afd9c05be3b5d410222.jpg"><br><br>  And from the laptop - the ability to easily carry the car with you, without tearing back.  A very sensible option for engineers, designers and photographers who have to move a lot in space.  Moreover, for simplicity, you can buy a device with pre-installed programs of the Adobe Creative Cloud family (with a 12-month license) and Lightroom. <br><br>  The three-year warranty, which is very well organized by Dell, cannot but rejoice.  I checked it myself with a Dell Latitude 10 tablet, a new battery for which I had just been sent from the UK. <br><br>  But the Dell Precision M3800 is a solution for those who know exactly what they want and are willing to pay for it.  The product, frankly, not from the budget.  The simplest configuration (Full HD screen, 8 GB of RAM, 500 GB hybrid HDD without SSD) will cost you 87,500 rubles (the price of the <a href="http://www.dselect.ru/dell/notebook/precision/m3800/">official online store Dselect.ru</a> ).  The configuration that I had on the test (QHD + screen, 16 GB of RAM and a bunch of SSD + HDD) costs an impressive 109,900 rubles. <br><br>  Expensive?  Well, probably, for 60 thousand such a machine would be much nicer to buy.  And over 40 - and in general.  However, such a set of iron in such a compact package can not be cheaper.  I'll tell you a secret that the various configurations of the Precision M3800 surprisingly overlap in price with the versions of the 15-inch MacBook Pro.  They are very similar in hardware, but in Macs, for example, there is no professional Nvidia Quadro K1100M GPU, as well as a hybrid HDD paired with an SSD.  Please do not see in my words a hint of holivar.  Everyone has different preferences and different tasks.  However, really powerful and well-made mobile computers are quite expensive.  All manufacturers.  Probably fun for Precision M3800 is not worth buying.  But for serious pros, such a price is not a barrier.  And for his employer too. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87a/699/878/87a6998788b34b25a71c3f5d684afd79.jpg"><br><br>  Personally, I really liked the Dell mobile workstation.  It is well made and powerful not in size.  My own experiments with photos and videos are unlikely to pay back the investment in the Precision M3800, but I know not one or two people, in whose life it would fit well.  The opportunity on the road, after a hard day‚Äôs work, to quickly process hundreds of photos and put them into layout without bringing the eye to the state of a rabbit rabbit, or edit a video in half the time ‚Äî all this is really great.  And leaves more to the interesting thing, which is called life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362295/</a></p>
