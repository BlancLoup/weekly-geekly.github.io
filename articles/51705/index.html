  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Abyrvalg - the most responsive community</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://abyrvalg.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/012/76d/c56/01276dc56e01939d7de254c840796538.jpg" width="204" height="246" align="left"></a>  I did not single out the word ‚ÄúREVIEW‚Äù by chance, this concept is the key essence of the <a href="http://abyrvalg.com/">project</a> .  Each user of the site can share his impression about any place, institution or attraction - be it a pizzeria for meeting with friends or an opera house for a cultural program with a girl.  And this is true for almost all cities of the world - geography is limited only by the presence of ‚Äúits people‚Äù in a particular region. <br><br>  Personally, I am very pleased that there are similar services that can really boast of a web 2.0 orientation, as well as bring some tangible benefits in life.  It is no secret that now most people first of all trust the opinion of other ‚Äútesters‚Äù of a certain product or service.  When choosing any purchase on the Internet (phones, accessories for PCs), the store's position or the popularity of a particular model does not play a key role, reading the reviews is what is interesting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Exactly the same approach can be applied to all sorts of institutions, shops, places of cultural recreation or attractions of any city.  Everyone can express their opinion and be heard!  You were unsuccessfully served in a cafe, do you think something will change the entry in the book of complaints?  I am sure that the probability of a positive outcome is very low.  A completely different situation can turn into a situation when a negative review falls into the World Wide Web - there are 10 more people like that and the rest of the community will think twice before going there. <br><br>  Of course, all this is significant only with a large number of participants and the presence of trust among them.  It is in this direction that the authors of Abyrvalg and other similar projects should work.  Yes, now he is not the first in RuNet and, I think, not the last, nevertheless I think that he has very good prospects.  First of all it concerns UANet and Ukraine.  It's nice that we began to appear serious teams that create something worthwhile.  I'm not talking about a classic startup, when a talented lone person releases a brilliant service with a unique idea and cuts off a lot of dough, but about a thoughtful project, with a clear concept, development plans and start-up capital.

      <strong>Now a little introduce the system itself.</strong>  After registration you can choose one of the cities.  The page displays a list of available categories - from food to art (as they say - ‚Äúbread and circuses‚Äù).  There is also a friendly search where you can find the desired place by keyword or its intended location. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f4/1c6/50e/9f41c650e4c987b1727397c2e884a9ea.jpg"><br>  On the main page of the city displays the best review and place for the week.  On the right you can see the most active authors, as well as new reviews.  In general, all the elements to track recent changes and keep abreast of events. <br>  If you go a little further into the category, we will see a more detailed breakdown and reviews on this topic.  On the right is generally the most ingenious detail - the <strong>map</strong> !  You will be able to see all the places in this area that are close by - very important for cafes or shops. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/27f/696/3d627f696d5f6e0fbe84a7fc6d46c4bc.jpg"><br>  In the "card" of the institution itself there is also a card with an address, a contact telephone.  You can add a photo or report an error, and, of course, leave your feedback. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44c/feb/07a/44cfeb07acf95c7459eda5dff8d4d4b8.jpg" width="580" height="488"><br><br>  I would also like to note that now the project is at the initial stage of development - this is not beta, but we still need to bring the final functionality.  Work is in full swing, new functions are being introduced, a video tour of the system is being filmed, etc.  By the way, now there is a small <a href="http://blog.abyrvalg.com/2008/12/ipod-nano.html">contest</a> for the most active participants - for written reviews, you can get incentive prizes - T-shirts, a 8GB flash drive, iPod shuffle 2Gb, iPod Nano 8Gb.  The main thing is to write only your impressions and not to cheat. <br><br>  By the way, regarding scams and permissiveness of web 2.0.  - Each review on the site is being moderated, that is, the system is not uncontrolled.  Project employees monitor the accuracy of the information entered (!), Add new data.  In general, there are many development plans, for example: <br><br>  <i>From the nearest plans - this is the launch of urban blogs.</i>  <i>We plan to work with interesting people when covering current topics of city life, in a new way and as far as possible.</i>  <i>As well as a number of additional features for the user, and of course many interesting topic contests for community members.</i>  <i>Soon we will soon announce on the community blog.</i> <br><br>  If you are interested in some details of the work on Abyrvalg, its specificity, monetization and decoding of such an ambiguous name, I can suggest reading the <a href="http://tods-blog.com.ua/services/abyrvalg-interview/">interview</a> with one of the participants of this action. <br><br>  That's basically it.  For those interested, I once again remind you of the link to <a href="http://abyrvalg.com/">Abyrvalg</a> .  It will be nice to see your comments, suggestions and thoughts on the project.  We share impressions in the comments, it is especially interesting to see the opinions of Ukrainian users, since ‚Äúthey live with it‚Äù :) <br><br>  <i>PS I, alas, have no relation to this project.</i>  <i>Please note that the post was published in the ‚ÄúI am PR‚Äù blog, so I am counting on constructive criticism, not personal prejudices.</i>  <i>Thank.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51705/</a></p>
