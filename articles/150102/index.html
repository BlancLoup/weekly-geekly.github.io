  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forward, despite the obstacles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How does a successful startup differ from a running one, but not gained momentum?  Often - not a brilliant marketing idea and cool implementation.  And by the fact, did he manage to overcome the ‚Äúvalley of death‚Äù by coping with all the stoppers that came his way. <br>  This is a big, important and, in fact, very positive (after all, it was settled!), The second post about the <a href="http://docdoc.ru/">DocDoc</a> service is dedicated to the topic. <br>  If you have forgotten or are not aware of it at all, I remind you: the service helps to pick up a doctor of the necessary specialization, working in one of the partner clinics for free (in an amicable way, we strive to collect all-all-all specialists, including private offices). <br>  So the troubles we had to cope with are, in most cases, specific.  Nevertheless, it is interesting to get acquainted with them at least in order to find out how we had to dodge in order to get rid of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Name, sister, name! </h2><br>  The first stumbling block was ... name.  The company is nameless (how much did you call your project ‚Äúproject‚Äù?), There is no domain, and something needs to be done with all this.  It‚Äôs easy to come up with some kind of garbage, but we‚Äôre smart, responsible guys and we are well aware that, as you call a boat, it will float.  Therefore, with the second ideologue they decided not to break their heads alone, but to arrange mass entertainment, which is so much loved in advertising agencies - brainstorming. <br>  The event took place immediately after our extremely successful vacation in Thailand.  Rested, full of strength, we were, to put it mildly, on a positive wave.  The work went cheerfully, and the flip chart quickly appeared with a dozen different options.  Four finalists were selected by voting: <br>  <a href="http://www.wikimed.ru/">www.wikimed.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.medhelp.ru/">www.medhelp.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.docpoisk.ru/">www.docpoisk.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.xn--dotorportal-toj.ru/">www.doorsportal.ru</a> <br><br>  The fifth - the very DocDoc - like all good things, appeared on the list quite by accident.  In Tae, we were very pleased with the funny name of local minibuses: ‚Äútuk-tuk‚Äù.  So blinded a double version, which seemed to sound harmoniously to the ear.  They took it and wrote it down - especially not counting on it. <br>  As smart people, we sent the list of finalists to friends from a very cool advertising agency that works with giant brands.  And no matter how surprising it was - the examination brought DocDoc ahead with an awesome break (almost twice).  The random fantasy was the most memorable, recognizable and original. <br>  As Baron Munchhausen said, ‚Äúthe most stupid things speak with the most serious face‚Äù.  Now in DocDoc we know that the opposite is true: what was said casually with laughter easily turns out to be the top ten. <br><br><h2>  In these your internet ... </h2><br>  The first real stopper was known even at the design stage: a low level of trust in the Internet, especially in topics related to the choice of a doctor. In medical matters, people try to use word of mouth and seek specialists for friends.  Like everything new, the service has caused and will cause some doubts (until it becomes widely known), especially for people who rarely resort to using the Internet.

      <b>Decision:</b> <br><ol><li>  Time, competent marketing strategy and active pr.  Current trends are favorable: increased confidence in commercial medicine, increased involvement in online.  To increase the awareness of the service and gain the trust of potential visitors, we do everything possible and plan - the impossible. </li><li>  The time base of real reviews, the development of its own unique and objective rating system, as well as strict documentary verification of the data provided about the doctor. </li></ol><br><br><h2>  Case technology or functional solutions </h2><br>  The scheme of the service, of course, was thought out at the very beginning.  But in practice, the implemented functionality always has to be finished (if, of course, I really want to get the result).  Here are three main areas that in fact had to rethink and recycle. <br><br>  <b>Reviews</b> <br>  No fakes, a minimum of emotions - a maximum of constructiveness, objectivity - these are the main factors that were taken into account in the feedback collection system.  Therefore, it was implemented as follows: the majority (90%) of the reviews are collected by the call center independently (only for patients enrolled through our service), and those left through the portal are pre-moderated and checked (we check on the basis of whether the person was at the reception). <br><br>  <i>What faced</i> .  The first negative review automatically zaparyvaet the entire profile - it turns out a biased picture (a problem that is actively being solved right now).  Now we are publishing a negative, only when there are at least two negative reviews. <br><br>  <b>Rating</b> <br>  When we started to develop a rating calculation scheme, we were not childishly embarrassed: we were attracted by a very cool medical expert who developed the ‚Äúideal doctor‚Äù model for us.  As a result, the coefficients were formed and the rating began to work. <br><br>  <i>What faced:</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Many patients like a doctor, but the clinic leads to a silent horror (reception, room, waiting, etc.).  Decided: to introduce a rating of clinics that affects the rating of the doctor.  If the doctor leaves the clinic, these indicators no longer affect the doctor. </li><li>  Relationship rating and reviews.  Rating is an objective indicator of qualification, and reviews - a subjective indicator of the patient's attitude towards the doctor.  We decided: the reviews should influence the rating (raise or lower), because in addition to professional qualities, the doctor must have human qualities: be attentive, tactful, and certainly not boor. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Mediation</b> <br>  This is a stopper, which was not originally thought out: at the moment we have to record service users through the clinic, transferring the call.  This is inconvenient for the patient (why should I still have someone to talk to?), And for us, and for the clinic. <br><br>  <i>The problem is solved simply and right now</i> : <i>we</i> are actively engaged in integrating the timetable with the clinic, the programmers department is developing a universal module for the main CRMs that the clinics work with.  In the autumn we will boast :) <br><br><h2>  Challenge by clinics </h2><br>  Where do we get most of the forms of doctors?  That's right: from medical clinics, which thus promote their specialists.  And sometimes deliver with a lot of fun.  Here are the main stoppers that we encountered at the very beginning of the affiliate work. <br><ul><li>  <b>The fear of luring</b> is an obvious fear that another medical clinic will lead a good specialist. </li><li>  <b>A phobia of a star</b> - and if the doctor suddenly becomes proud and leaves us, or will demand a wage increase. </li><li>  <b>Only favorites</b> : ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want to post data of all specialists‚Äù - some clinics try to place only doctors who are beneficial from their point of view, whereas the service policy is a diverse and honest choice. </li></ul><br>  <i>How to do it</i> : good job sales - the obvious solution.  Publication of all doctors working in the clinic is a tough condition for cooperation with us.  We do not encourage internal intrigues, our task is objectivity, for all the rest do not care. <br><br><h2>  Spoiled phone or incidents of perception </h2><br>  Listening to call-center call recordings is not only work, but also real pleasure.  What do you think, what is the first question our girls ask?  ‚ÄúPlease help me choose a doctor‚Äù?  However this may be, people often have no idea where they are calling. <br><ul><li>  Where are you at?  Visitors to the site took DocDoc for the clinic and wondered why they should transfer the call somewhere. </li><li>  My side hurts, what should I do?  Confused also with online consultation. </li><li>  Hospital help?  And they tried to buy information. </li><li>  How much is?  Many, despite the bright box "free", either did not notice it, or doubted the absolute free service. </li><li>  What day will you come?  The clinics themselves are also sometimes confused, taking us for patients. </li></ul><br>  <i>Solution</i> : To combat user confusion, no specific actions were taken, considering that it was a matter of time and recognition.  We worked on usability of the site, engaged in PR, all within the framework of classical marketing.  Indeed, such errors now occur much less frequently. <br>  In addition, after several similar cases, the call-center has taken this information into service: now during a conversation, it is always specially emphasized that we are a service for finding doctors and that our services are free. <br><br><h2>  Challenge, which turned out to be just a risk </h2><br>  The possibility of fraud on the part of clinics: the services of the service are paid for by conversion - how many people came to the reception.  The call center calls patients who have been enrolled through him to the clinic and checks whether they are on reception or not.  After that, a report about the "patients" is generated and sent to the clinic.  She, for her part, confirms the data. <br>  <i>A simple preventive solution</i> : the threat of a ban.  In the case when we see that there is a frank scam from the clinic (well, there can not be 50% of errors in the generated sheet) - a sanction in the form of termination of the contract and blacklisting will be applied.  In fact, the clinics are completely unprofitable. <br><br><h2>  In short, Pushkin </h2><br>  ‚ÄúExperience is the son of difficult mistakes‚Äù - this wonderful truth was voiced in the 18th century.  So thanks to all that has slowed us, because we are now so smart.  I hope this post is also useful to you: at least - amused, as a maximum - added valuable thoughts. <br>  And if you genuinely like our blog - tell me, what would you like to read in the next post? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150102/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150102/</a></p>
