Translation of this article was prepared specifically for students of the <a href="https://otus.pw/tLEb/">‚ÄúDeveloper JavaScript‚Äù</a> course, which starts as early as next week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2z/wm/1-/2zwm1-ll8iraf4zruvqvbeajs0e.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://youtu.be/C06s7LCrAbs">Chui's voice</a></i> <br><br>  A little about me - my name is Waibhav, I'm from Five2One.  I have been involved in VueJS for as long as 2 years (since release 1.0) and basically helped create / train 3 of the largest VueJS code bases in Sydney.  This code serves millions of people, so my task is not just to create scalable code patterns, but also to a large extent take care of its performance.

      You see, as a rule, small startups and code bases are guided by quickly pushing the code into the light and delivering the product to the client, which we have succeeded in - you can evaluate our work on the website Five2one.com.au, but beyond that, as engineers, our goal is to take care of performance and scalability. <br><br>  Let's get straight to the point - let's talk about some simple ways to improve the performance of your VueJS application. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Number one </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0g/6s/vz/0g6svzekgvs8lnquzdpqj5qb0o8.png"><br>  What we see here is a ‚Äúfunctional‚Äù pattern that has no declared state and deals only with props.  You can easily create it in a functional component based on Vue using a rendering method. <br><br>  <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html">https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/render-function.html</a> <br><br>  If you read this, you will see the props transfer with <code>functional: true</code> <br>  So a simple fix for this solution is below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/lo/2n/j-lo2n175avum709e1iwy11xq9a.png"><br><br>  Just like that, you don‚Äôt need to worry about changing the syntax of the template, you can stick to it and still enjoy the luxury of the Vue syntax. <br><blockquote>  QUICK EDIT: Since this is a functional component, its context does not exist, so you need to apply props.name to access props - thanks to Dinesh Madhanlal for the mention </blockquote><h2>  Second simple way </h2><br>  Use keep-alive for dynamically loaded components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/qh/o_/rrqho_z_ccrmp1p1kkyfvpesgsg.png"><br><br>  Sometimes we load components on the fly with Vue.  We can switch between components that load dynamically.  So that we can maintain state and prevent data reloading when switching components, the DOMless shell is a good solution to speed up the process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u-/6f/dt/u-6fdthqbtehemp6s-fadjya0is.png"><br><br><h2>  Third simple way </h2><br>  This will be a little more obvious to most, given how the vDOM system works in Vue.  The goal of the vDOM is to act as an intermediate update tool and track (very efficiently) the isolated changes in the project's user interface and run isolated redraws for these target components instead of redrawing the entire screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/h0/-g/oeh0-g-hzmq1qkub_u42wfa8fno.png"><br><br>  Often we can create a component that has a shell that is rendered many times, and some other part of the same template has to do MANY work, whenever another part of the template is redrawn.  A simple solution is to simply split the file into components.  If the child does not depend on the parent in relation to the data, it should be processed without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/dq/by/eydqbykvt583ejsmb2cwxnlwnks.png"><br><br><h2>  Fourth simple way </h2><br>  Using anonymous functions in CTA events.  Whenever an anonymous function is passed to the ‚ÄúonClick‚Äù buttons (I saw this pattern among developers who come from React, because this is one of the ways to pass user data to a function in React), it is better not to pass an anonymous function.  The reason is this. <br><br>  Consider the example below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/yd/2h/fuyd2hlui7eyzwm8cau3y8znc6e.png"><br><br>  What happens here is that every time a div increases in length (for example, a progress bar), all the buttons will also be redrawn. <br><br>  Technically, they shouldn't, because nothing changes in them, right?  No props update or data update, etc. <br><br>  This is a trick, JS interacts with anonymous functions in memory, that is, every time a re-rendering occurs, a new instance of an anonymous function is created, and the comparison algorithm selects it as a new object, therefore, re-displays the buttons even if it is not needed. <br><br>  Fortunately, Vue is so amazing that it is smart enough to understand that no function called on its own should be called until the event it is attached to works, so even if it is IIF, Vue makes it thunk, which delays the execution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s0/dn/7z/s0dn7zlqxijgprdp_byu6okhytm.png"><br><br>  If you want to be secure, you should always create a closure that returns another function, so the wrapper function has only one instance and does not cause re-rendering. <br><br><h2>  Magic 5th easy way </h2><br>  This is just as simple, there are gray areas in relation to it, and this is not a general solution.  Use this method only when there are many components on the page and switching of the component display is fast. <br><br>  Yes, I'm talking about using v-if or v-show.  There is a huge difference between them.  V-if = false never renders the component with the directive disabled.  Therefore, if this component switches several times in a short period of time, it will affect performance, so using v-show in such situations works very well. <br><br>  However, the catch is that when you add a v-show to a component, and this component has to perform a heavy operation when it is first rendered, then this operation will be performed regardless of whether the v-show is true or false.  It is necessary to postpone it using v-if, until this component is really needed.  Remember that v-show only sets the displayed CSS value for the displayed component: none if the component is still being rendered. <br><br>  However, even if this component has a large initial workload, if it constantly switches, and this method should be performed every time, it is better to do a v-show.  It all comes down to user needs. <br><br>  I hope this helped you all! <br><br>  If you like it, be sure to subscribe for similar topics: <br>  twitter: twitter.com/ <a href="https://dev.to/veebuv">@veebuv</a> <br><br>  Here is such a translation.
