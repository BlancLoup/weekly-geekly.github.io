This is really a powerful smartphone with many features.  Many users liked its design, so sales of the new phone are going well.  According to statistics, 86% of current users of the device are very pleased with it, both in appearance and capabilities. <br><br>  But, as usual, there is a fly in the ointment.  And this spoon - the fragility of the device.  Despite attempts to protect the display with tempered glass, the smartphone is poorly protected from external influences, especially from shocks.  And here you can break everything, because not only the display is covered with glass, but also the back cover of the device.  In principle, spare parts for the Samsung Galaxy S8 are not so much, and soon their price will fall even more.  But, apparently, repair shops that specialize in Samsung smartphones can literally get rich. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fragility of the display, in general, can not be surprised.  The fact is that Samsung designers have created a new version of the design of the device, calling it Infinity Display.  The screen, in fact, does not have a frame, its edges are rounded, as in Edge 7. No matter how strong the glass is, if it is bent, tension arises in the material, which manifests itself if you hit the display with something solid.  The first to suffer just rounded edges.

      The first vulnerabilities of the smartphone showed the company SquareTrade, which conducted several tests for impact resistance.  Almost all the falls and blows led to the fact that the phone screen and its back cover were covered with cracks.  Sometimes cracks appeared immediately from all sides.  Actually, from a smartphone, which is almost completely covered with glass, albeit protected, nothing else can be expected.  It should be noted that spare parts for the new flagship at the start of sales cost less than the same parts cost at the start of sales of the previous version of the smartphone.  According to the masters who are engaged in the repair of electronic equipment, the Samsung Galaxy S8 is relatively easy to repair. <br><br>  For example, a full ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù from a digitizer and a LCD panel with protective glass costs about $ 200 in China.  This is about $ 50 or even $ 100 cheaper than the Galaxy S7 screen at the start of sales for the unlucky users of such a device.  You can compare with the iPhone 7: when this smartphone just went on sale, the new display cost about $ 300 for it.  And this is just the price of the display, without work.  In general, we can say that the owners of the Galaxy S8 are lucky. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AkoZM83X_i4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Some owners of repair services are surprised at the low prices for spare parts of the new flagships of the corporation.  "This is a low price for the OLED panel in the new flagship, especially considering the type of display, Infinity Display," said Kev Notton, founder of RepairMapr from the United States. <br><br>  Of course, the fact that the displays are not so expensive is good.  But it would be nice if they were also durable.  And so the buyer gets on his hands, in fact, a glass smartphone, which can be broken from any side.  Apple had a similar experience with one of the versions of the iPhone, but this was the only attempt by the company to cover the entire smartphone with glass.  Perhaps this idea was abandoned due to the negative reaction of users, and perhaps the decision to close everything with glass seemed unsuccessful to the manufacturer.  Anyway, but Samsung is now repeating this step by Apple. <br><br>  In general, Android phones are more expensive to repair than Apple devices.  The reason is the fragmentation of the Android gadget market.  There are many models, they are all different, respectively, different and details.  In some cases, replacement elements are almost single-piece (of course, this happens infrequently).  Although there are a lot of iPhone smartphones too, but still not as much as there are variations of Android phones now. <br><br>  Sometimes spare parts for phones can be found at a low price for the simple reason that they are ‚Äúgray‚Äù; they are not quite officially produced by the same companies that produce official phones of various models.  Such companies, having all the necessary base, often produce spare parts quietly.  So, the official manufacturer of phones can cost these items 2-3 times more expensive than the parts manufactured by Chinese companies that provide parts for assembling phones by the main manufacturer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b57/546/131/b57546131c3e4faf7b6aff8c9cca769f.jpg"><br><br>  Why are parts for Samsung's ‚Äúglass‚Äù smartphone relatively inexpensive?  It is hard to say.  Maybe the company decided to lower their price by looking at their experience with previous models, the S7 and S7 Edge.  Displays for them at the very beginning cost about $ 500.  It is clear that the user, having learned about it, thought about whether it is worth taking an expensive smartphone at all, replacing the screen in which will cost 2/3 of the price of the device. <br><br>  Now, since there are even more elements that can break, the company has made them less expensive.  Anyway, the Samsung S8 is a bonanza for repair services.  Probably, their owners are already quite rubbing their hands, calculating possible profits. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403789/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403789/</a></p>
