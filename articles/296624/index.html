    <h6>  So, let's go through the skills that you forget to mention all the time. </h6><br><br>  <b>Important!</b> <br><h6>  Immediately remind you that the skills you tell your employer should be directly related to the position you are applying for.  Brevity and specifics - the first rule of the resume. </h6><br><br><h5>  // Leadership </h5><br><h6>  Of course, this is an important skill for all those involved in managing a company or even working in a team - each member will sooner or later be faced with the need to take the initiative.  So, if you know that you can be a leader in a team at some point, then this quality can always be mentioned (and even necessary!). </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  know how to solve conflicts in a team, ready to help colleagues, listen to criticism, ready to lead, take responsibility for the decisions of the team ... - everything sounds more specific than ‚ÄúI have leadership qualities‚Äù. </h6><br><br><h5>  // Communicability </h5><br><h6>  This quality-skill is directly connected with leadership.  The fact is that with people you need not only to be able to communicate, but also to understand that there must be a factor of business relations between you and mutual benefits.  When you write ‚Äúcommunicative‚Äù, you don‚Äôt need to think that you have great friends and that you are great friends with colleagues. </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  networking, knowledge of the technology of "cold" calls, building relationships with customers, ability to work in a team. </h6><br><br>  <b>Important!</b> <br><h6>  Good (great, great, you don‚Äôt have the price) if every skill you mention will be supported by an example in the summary that proves that you have it.  For example, let's compare the ‚Äúsociable‚Äù Ivan or Ivan, who organizes events and attracted famous speakers, using his ability to communicate and look for contacts. </h6><br><br><h5>  // Organization </h5><br><h6>  Firstly, in Russian, an ‚Äúorganization‚Äù can have two related meanings: you are organized, punctual, you understand what a ‚Äúsystems‚Äù approach is, and maybe you understand how to organize a lot of people and make gears spin.  So in this case, we would advise you: </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  event organization, meeting control, scheduling, planning (excellent word for resumes!), time management </h6><br><br><h5>  // A responsibility </h5><br><h6>  Only those people who just want to say to the employer ‚ÄúI can be trusted!‚Äù Mention it.  But there are much more correct ways to prove that you are a responsible employee, for example, mentioning that you were involved in project activities or that you were engaged in serious financial calculations - everything that had a specific result would be useful to note instead of ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù. </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  project activities (completed n. projects), work with client n., creation of an advertising company n. </h6><br><br><h5>  // Learning </h5><br><h6>  We are all trained.  Otherwise they could not talk, write, eat, walk.  This is a normal skill not only for humans, but also for animals.  Another superfluous and too ‚Äúcommon‚Äù word for your resume. </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  independently studied the program n., mastered the programming language n., active attendance of trainings, creation of a personal website, desire to use skills in different departments </h6><br><br><h5>  // Critical thinking </h5><br><h6>  You know that nowadays everybody is a film critic.  But in fact, when you need to show the skills of a real analyst, to say something after the presentation, all of a sudden thoughts disappear. </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  information retrieval, ability to analyze n.  in n., reporting in n., reviewing </h6><br><br><h5>  // Stress resistance </h5><br><h6>  This is an indispensable, wonderful and very necessary skill.  But not really a skill - it is a character trait, as well as sociability, for example.  You can learn to deal with stress, but most likely, applying this characteristic to yourself, you want to say that you can work under pressure, in terms of deadlines and at fast paces.  So tell me about it! </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  skill (EXPERIENCE!) work in deadline mode, ability to make quick decisions, knowledge of the market, understanding of the peculiarities of competition in the industry, ability to cope with crisis situations </h6><br><br><h5>  // Language skills </h5><br><h6>  Fluency in languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not an abstract concept, but very, very concrete. </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  I speak English at level C1, I speak fluent Spanish, my knowledge of Chinese is A1 </h6><br><br><h5>  // Computer skills </h5><br><h6>  So, you really decided to share with the employer that you know how to use a computer.  We have already said a hundred times that ‚Äúconfident possession of office equipment‚Äù is not an argument at all.  MFP too! </h6><br>  <b>We write:</b> <br><h6>  typing (?), speed printing, knowledge of the function n.  MS Excel, the ability to create infographics in n., The ability to create a banner for social networks in n. </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296624/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296624/</a></p>
