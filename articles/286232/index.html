    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">EasilyDo</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.easilydo.com/">EasilyDo</a> looks like an octopus from a cartoon that runs its tentacles deep into your phone, linking your email, as well as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Evernote accounts, putting them in order, removing unwanted subscribers and incorrect addresses.  Then he floats to the surface and tells you how to get to the upcoming meeting, how to get there better and what the weather conditions are.  If you are late, he may even warn people waiting for you that you are on the way. <br><br>  It also has other advantages - for example, scanning incoming messages and notifying about upcoming events and urgent letters.  He will tell you who has a birthday today and will offer to send greetings.  And it will do all this, working closely with other applications, which can sometimes lead to a hang.  However, the idea is to help you <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/intervyu-s-chalzom-dakhiggom-kak-sila-privychki-mozhet-pomoch-dostich-svoikh-novogodnikh-tseley/">achieve your goals in</a> the simplest and most effective way possible.  That‚Äôs what one of the creators of the Getal Pandia application thinks so: <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur team EasilyDo decided to create an active assistant, which saves time and is easy to use.  Each task we set was carefully selected based on the pain points that professionals face every day. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Timeful</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.timeful.com/">Timeful</a> not only enters events and tasks into your schedule, but also helps you develop good habits that people usually talk about, but never find time for them.  There are three categories: <b>events</b> (for meetings that are scheduled for a specific time), to-do <b>lists</b> (good ideas that come to your mind) and <b>habits</b> (things that you would like to practice all the time, for example, morning exercises).  You set in the application schedule: working hours, time to sleep and the most productive periods.  The algorithm distributes your events and to-do lists and finds the best time to practice your new habit - before or after work.  Of course, you could do it yourself.  But you did?  If the answer is no, Timeful is exactly what will allow you to master this road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62a/90c/843/62a90c84362443348cb8f641370a149f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Using the right application is necessary for the information mobility of your business: the right technology will enhance your production capabilities and help you <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-glavnykh-oshibok-ili-pochemu-vashi-ratsionalnye-resheniya-ne-rabotayut/">make the most correct decisions</a> .  This is a new world of work, we must always be ready for it, everywhere and everywhere. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Teamviewer</font> </h2><br>  You worked late on your presentation, and as a result it turns out that you forgot to take it to the meeting.  I'm sure you remember well where it is on your home computer, but what's wrong with that?  But if you had a <a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/ru/download/mobile.aspx">TeamViewer</a> , this would not be a problem.  This is one of the mobile applications that allow access to remote computers with one click of the mouse; it transfers files and folders in seconds.  It also allows you to work on documents with other people.  Even if your business does not use the corporate version of the application, it is still available for individual use. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Doodle</font> </h2><br>  Someone wants to make an appointment for you at 10 am, but you can't.  You are sending the answer ... And just like Robert, Sam, Jessica and everyone else on your team, clogging your incoming messages with amazing details about meeting with other people, calls and visits to the dentist.  <a href="http://doodle.com/ru/">Doodle</a> , which positions itself as a ‚Äúscheduling tool that you‚Äôll actually use,‚Äù knows the best way.  You can start chatting, respond and see all the events collected in one place (Doodle calls them "pools").  This makes it easy to make a simple interface where you see at a glance where you should be at this time.  This is the only thing that Doodle does, but it does it really well. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">WPS Office</font> </h2><br>  Since the phones turned into phablets, and the tablets have become much smarter, more and more people use them not only to check email, but also to work.  <a href="http://www.wps.com/ru/ios/">WPS Office</a> helps to do this.  You can edit Word documents, spreadsheets and PowerPoint slides, as well as read PDF documents.  It contains a built-in file manager and gets access to cloud applications such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Box.  There is an autosave feature in case you are distracted by encrypting documents for security.  The application is ideal for those who occasionally have to work on the run and dependent workaholics. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pyat-zabluzhdeniy-o-produktivnosti-kotorye-my-sebe-vnushaem/">Five misconceptions about productivity, which we inspire.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286232/</a></p>
