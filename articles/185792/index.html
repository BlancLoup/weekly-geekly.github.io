  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CATNIP - another CAT system for translators</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A long time ago, my friend <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/t_moor/" class="user_link">T_Moor</a> advertised my system for MT2007 translators in the ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù hub ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/30639/">article</a> ).  This article is a continuation of that story. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Much time has passed since the release of the free-running MT2007.  I myself stopped translating, and the program was slowly becoming obsolete, mostly technologically (it was written on WinForms for 32-bit systems).  Finally, the moment came when 64-bit systems began to appear more and more, where MT2007 simply did not start. <br><br>  By that time I myself switched to WPF and the soul did not lie to develop that project.  In addition, he wrote on his knee, quickly, as I needed mainly for urgent translation work and the code inside was just awful.  However, interest in this cat among people continued to glow and many people used it for work.  And according to numerous requests, I decided to rewrite it on new technologies, adding some conveniences, and in the long run expanding the functionality. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there was a catastrophic lack of time and the new project developed at the pace of a slow waltz (for three years), with constant stops, until one of the familiar translators came to a pained decision as much as possible to sponsor the matter.  As a result, the past six months, I essentially sat on the "salary" and wrote and wrote and wrote ... Catnip.

      One of the screenshots: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/09d/6d0/f8909d6d0b274535616aeb682994bf29.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Other screenshots can be viewed at the link provided at the end of the article. <br><br>  Now finances are over and although the cat has not yet been added, it is already used in real work.  Most likely, you will have to slowly slow down, take on other paid tasks, but I'm not going to give up: too much work has been invested.  In aggregate, all of this led me to write this article.  Well, also the hope that the possible positive feedback will emotionally cheer my somewhat extinct inner flame. <br><br>  At the moment it is an early alpha version.  Some functions present in MT2007 are NOT here, namely: the central repository, plug-in dictionaries, work with the Multitran website, EBMT system (Example-based mashine translation).  All this will soon appear.  But there is something new: <br><br><ul><li>  Support a large number of translation files in one project. </li><li>  The ability to connect an unlimited number of external terminology databases from previous projects with the ability to dynamically / temporarily disconnect them and reconnect with one click of the mouse. </li><li>  The ability to connect an unlimited number of translation databases of previous Catnip projects or TMX and XLIF files as a corordance with the ability to dynamically / temporarily disconnect them and reconnect with one click of the mouse. </li><li>  Dynamic statistics on the number of files in the project, proposals for translation, the percentage of completed translation, the time of work on the project.  All this is displayed both in the tree of connected files and in the list of projects with which the translator worked. </li><li>  Quick search for words, similar sentences from the files of the current project and corordance with color highlighting of the found. </li><li>  A single term can have several translations, which in case of substitution (preliminary translation of the current sentence) appears in the translation editor as a hyperlink, clicking on which gives a menu with translation options.  The syntax of multiple translations of one term is simple - the options are separated by the symbol "|"  (vertical bar). </li><li>  Simple conditional variable term definition language.  For example:? (The | a) table means that the term is considered matched for both ‚Äúthe table‚Äù and for ‚Äúa table‚Äù and for ‚Äútable‚Äù. </li><li>  Powerful term finder in connected files.  In fact, the terms for a simplified understanding are any words, phrases, sequences of characters that are found in texts several times.  In a couple of minutes the engine will find all non-intersecting repetitions up to sentences and the translator can pre-set translations for some or all of these terms. </li><li>  The possibility of cutting sentences and their gluing right in the translation editor. </li><li>  Customize translation editor.  For example, you can specify in what color to select which characters.  For example, English characters may be black by default, and Cyrillic characters - green or any other. </li><li>  Significantly improved replacement of any text in the original and in translation. </li><li>  In the settings, you can select options for splitters sentences used at the initial stage in the analysis of the text.  You can use a splitter based on a regular expression, including customizing it to your taste, or based on the NLP - Natural Language Processor.  Catnip has a built-in English model file from WordNet, which, in general, does a good job with a breakdown into sentences for other languages, such as Russian.  However, if a user can find a model of another language, then he can connect him to Catnip with confidence. </li></ul><br><br>  Well, it is clear that there is a spell check for both languages ‚Äã‚Äã(original and translation) based on the well-known Hunspell and some other amenities.  In principle, the documentation for Catnip's ancestor - MT2007 is also suitable here. <br><br>  Yes, Catnip is free for anyone to use.  Honestly, I just doubt whether it is possible to make money on this one developer without support, competing with well-known brands of similar systems, while not overstating the price of the product to transcendental peaks.  Perhaps you can set the price for some services for group work, for example, for the Translation Bureau, but this is still thinking out loud.  Therefore - for free. <br><br>  But in general, that's all.  I hope I wasted your time. <br><br>  Website: <a href="http://mt2007-cat.ru/catnip">Catnip</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185792/</a></p>
