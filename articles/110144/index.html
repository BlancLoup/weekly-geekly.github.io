      Habrahabr has always been a gathering place for IT intellectuals, so where, if not here, try to get to the truth?  It is very important for us to know your opinion on each of the questions voiced below.  In order not to stand aside, we will also try to state our own. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Demand creates supply?</b> <br><br>  And then how.  It is he who determines the presence in the market of more than 30 developed CMS, each of which has the right to exist and to be successful (purchased) in its segment.  Generally, strictly speaking, the niche CMS segment will continue to grow.  This is facilitated by a change in customer sentiment.  They stopped wanting huge, stuffed than horrible corporate portals.  They began to demand point effective solutions for a specific task.  A successful developer now focuses on precise targeting in terms of functionality and customer needs - this is a guarantee that even in a seemingly crowded market, new and new product solutions will appear.  They will always be in demand!  Or rather, until demand creates supply :) <br><br>  <b>Do I need to offer the client the optimal solution or try to ‚Äúdrive‚Äù the project into the framework of their preferences?</b> <br><br>  No matter how trivial it may sound, but the optimal solution for the client should be higher than their own ambitions.  The postulate about the fact that ‚Äúthe client is always right‚Äù, worn to holes, is accepted with us with unchanged sarcasm.  Although the West has become the norm of life.  We often do ‚Äúas it is convenient for us‚Äù and not as ‚Äúneeded by the client‚Äù.  What did it cost us to make our <a href="http://www.motocms.ru/">corporate website</a> based on our own control panel?  Easy peasy!  But for each specific task you need to find the most optimal solution that will simplify the process of making the purchase by the end user.  And trying to prove something to someone - you know, this is a totally ungrateful occupation :). <br><br>  Naturally, it would be ridiculous not to notice how much HTML5 has changed the world, and to continue to use flash technology everywhere and everywhere.  But if we are talking about niche solutions, then the flash will remain relevant, at least in the coming years. <br><br>  Let's try to create two absolutely identical interactive promo sites using flash tools and HTML5 - the resource intensity, speed, complexity of implementation will be different at times and not in favor of the latter. <br><br>  <b>The market remains a self-regulated organism?</b> <br><br>  Still would.  That is why the flash platform will be in demand for a very, very long time.  Presentation projects, multimedia sites, personal portfolios, live dynamic business card sites are all a huge niche of flash sites.  And now let's add to the beauty of the functionality for the end user - it turns out the perfect solution for a very ridiculous money.  As is true in essence, although coarse in form, he noted the habrachelovo <a href="http://olegkrasnov.habrahabr.ru/">olegkrasnov</a> in his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/motocms/blog/109997/">comment</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúNow I climbed, poked on the demo site.</i>  <i>It was thought that there was a share of clients who would piss boiling water from such pieces. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  So why, by denying the flash platform as such, we are trying to decide for the client what is best for him?  To better understand what is being discussed, test the <a href="http://cms.template-help.com/flashmoto_28302/admin/">flash site control panel</a> on one of our templates. <br><br>  In the end, who said that you can only do sites on flash cms? <br><br>  <b>Flash platform is dead?</b> <br><br>  No, this will never happen.  And yes, let's argue about it until they are hoarse :) <br><br>  We have an affirmative, though not always unequivocal answer to all four questions. <br>  It was based on these four ‚Äúyes‚Äù, we created our <a href="http://www.motocms.ru/">control panel flash sites ‚ÄúMoto CMS‚Äù</a> .  It is on these four ‚Äúyes‚Äù that our entire model for creating ready-made templates is built, the number of which, by the way, has exceeded 60 pieces. <br><br>  A growing number of clients and the opening of a full-fledged representative office in Russia indirectly tell us that we are on the right path, which means that the flash platform, if it were a living person, could have uttered the words of the unforgettable Mark Twain, without a twinge of conscience - ‚ÄúRumors about my death are greatly exaggerated‚Äù . <br><br>  Or not?  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110144/</a></p>
