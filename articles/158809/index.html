Research is constantly being conducted in the world, the purpose of which is to somehow clarify the situation and empirically prove whether there is a harmful effect on the human body. <br>  Let's try to objectively look at the problem. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  SAR </h6><br>  In order to somehow assess the amount of radiation of the cellular apparatus on the human body, the indicator "Specific Electromagnetic Energy Absorption Ratio" - SAR was invented. <br>  SAR is a measure of the rate at which RF energy is absorbed by body tissues, measured in W / kg. <br>  It is worth noting that the SAR values ‚Äã‚Äãindicated in the instructions for cell phones imply that the transmitter is operating at full power, for example, when you are in an unsure reception area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86e/26b/ad7/86e26bad7619870e5ff325297e81d6e2.jpg">

      Scientists have conducted a number of studies that did not find evidence of direct effects of mobile phone radiation on human tissue, leading to the destruction of DNA molecules or tissue ionization. <br>  However, since the human body is 70% water and the water molecules are able to ‚Äúabsorb‚Äù the radiation energy in the high frequency range and convert it into thermal energy, the attention of research has been focused on this fact. <br><br>  It was experimentally proved that in the process of vital activity, the temperature of brain tissue can vary up to 1 degree Celsius, without any consequences.  Raising a large amount may affect health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/596/028/955/5960289551bec3c5e36911706eb7133f.jpg"><br><br>  The SAR coefficient was calculated on the basis of these indicators.  In Europe, a level of 2 W / kg for the head and 4 W / kg for other parts of the body is considered safe.  At this rate, the temperature in the tissues increases by no more than 0.3 degrees Celsius, which does not harm the body.  However, already at 0.3 degrees, the destruction of protein chains was found, but scientists do not associate this fact and the effects on health. <br>  For the USA, the SAR is 1.6 W / kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/551/3f8/d7e/5513f8d7efdae16b5c5c0b360d66833e.jpg"><br><br>  For comparison, the SAR values ‚Äã‚Äãthat may cause negative effects are given. <br><br><h6>  And how are we </h6><br>  In Russia, the norms of safe radiation are regulated by the decree <a href="http://www.tehbez.ru/Docum/DocumShow_DocumID_493.html">SANPiN</a> .  The permissible radiation is measured in W / cm2 and is 10 ŒºW / cm2.  The SAR value can not be transformed into Russian standards, it is done by laboratory. <br>  Experts recognize that in the Russian Federation even more stringent requirements for radiation standards, rather than in Europe and the United States. <br><br><h6>  STUK </h6><br>  In Finland, there is a CENTER for Radiation and Nuclear Safety (STUK), which, among other things, is engaged in studies of mobile phone emissions and their effects on humans. <br>  Every year, the Center conducts testing of 15 arbitrary phone models for their compliance with standards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3dd/084/956/3dd08495625547265966a726addfea66.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/502/821/5db/5028215dbb1c0743b6a29ca4fa4a6b39.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/493/bcd/81e/493bcd81e6af2865ef8a2c8ba992da32.jpg"><br><br>  The essence of the research is as follows.  The shape of the human body is filled with a substance that is close in its parameters to human tissues.  The phone, at maximum radiation power, is positioned near the ‚Äúhead‚Äù of the form.  The hand of the robot describes a specific trajectory, with a change in the position of the phone and at different frequencies.  Radiation results are converted to SAR values ‚Äã‚Äãand saved.  Measurements are carried out separately for the head and separately for the rest of the body. <br><br>  Here is how it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_detailpage%26v%3DeH_awIiDRxU">looks</a> in the video. <br><br>  Detailed research results for different brands of phones can be found on the website of the <a href="http://www.stuk.fi/">center.</a> <br>  Similar research centers also exist in other countries of Europe and America. <br><br><h6>  As a conclusion </h6><br>  It should be noted that the temperature effect strongly depends on the position of the phone relative to the head, the biological parameters of the body and age. <br>  Conducted research on the possible interaction of the radiation of mobile phones and the growth of oncological diseases did not reach an unambiguous conclusion.  Since the active use of cell phones continues for about 10 years and for the final conclusion, it will take much longer. <br><br>  In addition, it is not entirely correct to draw conclusions only on the basis of heat exposure, because the effects of HF radiation on the moral and psychological component and other components of health have not been fully studied. <br><br>  In any case, indirect harm to health is scientifically proven.  As a result of the experiments, it was found that the radiation of a cell phone initiates interference in the operation of pacemakers, which can lead to negative consequences. <br><br>  As a recommendation, it should be recalled that the radiation power decreases inversely with the square of the distance, that is, as the distance increases by 2 times, the radiation exposure decreases by 4 times.  Centers exploring the problems recommend, without the need not to hold the phone close to the body and, if possible, to use wired headsets. <br>  To use or not such recommendations, everyone decides for himself. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Interesting results in the study of the problem can be found <a href="http://catalog.gaw.ru/index.php%3Fpage%3Ddocument%26id%3D1514">here</a> and <a href="http://www.energeticinteractions.com/clientinc/upload/EMF%2520Elixir_s.pdf">here.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158809/</a></p>
