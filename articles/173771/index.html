This is the person who gave the scientific substantiation of the technological singularity - an explosive scientific and technical process that will begin after the appearance of powerful artificial intelligence (superior to human) and the cyborgization of people.  According to Moore‚Äôs law and extrapolation, this should happen <abbr title="As some colleagues say about him, Ray takes things that everyone agrees with, and extrapolation principles with which everyone agrees, and on the basis of all this makes predictions that no one agrees with.">around 2045</abbr> . <br><br>  Google direct road goes to technological singularity.  At least, it was Google and NASA that became the main sponsors of the interdisciplinary <a href="http://singularityu.org/overview/">University of Singularity</a> , created in 2009, and Google‚Äôs research in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence fits well with the future Kurzweil is talking about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this sense, it is very interesting what the famous futurologist, who nominally received the position of technical director in the field of machine learning and natural language processing, is specifically engaged in the new job.  Recently published his <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2013/03/19/exclusive-interview-ray-kurzweil-discusses-his-first-two-months-at-google/">interview</a> on the results of the first two months of work. <br><br>  Previously, Kurzweil had already <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2013/01/10/exclusive-interview-with-ray-kurzweil-on-future-ai-project-at-google/">said</a> that Larry Page personally invited him to the company with the long-term goal of creating computers that understand human speech and are able to "think like people."  In other words, it should assist in the development of strong artificial intelligence.

      Now Ray told a little more about how he was invited to the company.  He says that he met with Larry Page in July about his new book How To Create A Mind.  He said that he wanted to start a startup to put the ideas in the book into practice.  Larry Page persuaded him to do it at Google, because the company has ‚Äúunique resources‚Äù for this task.  Now Kurzweil admits that his belief in these words has only deepened after two months of work at Google. <br><br>  Ray Kurzweil since the 70s has been developing computer systems for speech recognition.  At Google, he took the lead in developing technologies capable of analyzing the semantic context, that is, the meaning of each word, choosing the appropriate meaning of the word in each specific situation. <br><br>  Google has been solving this problem for a long time.  For this purpose, such projects as <a href="http://www.google.com/insidesearch/features/search/knowledge.html">Knowledge Graph</a> were created - a base of 700 million semantic structures and billions of connections between them.  The development team led by Kurzweil is developing software that will become part of the system ‚Äúmodeled on biological‚Äù, which can self-learn and develop in the same way that the human brain was designed, Kurzweil said. <br><br>  Kurzweil‚Äôs forecast of the technological singularity indicates that the computer must pass the Turing test in 2029.  When asked if his calculations have changed now, Ray Kurzweil answered: ‚ÄúMy goal is to make just such a contribution to the creation of artificial intelligence, this is a project for 50 years ... and now for the first time I have the time and resources to implement it." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B4jhMGzml7I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrzPuknGYxnTE3KMAPxmgMwV4EOg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173771/</a></p>
