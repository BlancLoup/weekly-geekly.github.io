      Do not forget - the number of places on the most attractive courses is usually limited and ends quickly!  And some just start very soon - <b>jump on the outgoing train!</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What should I choose? </h4><br>  <b>Be careful: the</b> abundance of options below may cause temporary disorientation! <br><br>  To make it easier for a beginner to understand, here‚Äôs the infographics of the guys from Carlcheo, where they clearly (and with humor) set out the advantages and possibilities of each of today's popular languages.

By the way, young specialists from the regions can also submit an application - the first round of selection will be held online. <br><br><h5>  MOEX code from Moscow Exchange </h5><br>  <b>Duration:</b> year <br>  <b>Cost:</b> Free <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> upgrading of professional and personal skills, 30 000 rub. <br><br>  Classes for students are conducted by employees of the Moscow Exchange, who are working to create and support complex trading platforms. <br><br>  You can take up the developer, you can go to analytics or testing.  But at the same time get training on time management, stress management and other important soft-skills. <br><br>  Another nice component is an impressive stipend in the amount of 30,000 rubles. <br><br>  To participate, you need to know Python, Ruby, Bash, Java or C ++.  And, it is important to be able to attend classes during working hours. <br><br>  Recruitment is in full swing - the <a href="http://changellenge.com/career/moex_code/">deadline is February 13</a> , so it‚Äôs best to hurry. <br><br><h5>  Moscow Coding School </h5><br>  <b>Duration:</b> four days <br>  <b>Cost:</b> 19,999 rubles <br>  <b>Advantages:</b> learning from ‚Äúdigital skills‚Äù, whatever that means <br><br>  Usually, the Moscow Coding School conducts short intensive courses for those who are familiar with the code only by hearsay: journalists, bloggers, designers, copywriters and other comrades from the creative industry. <br><br>  The organizers call the teachers of the course Digital Skilacs - in the people, these are the leading developers of good Russian and Western startups. <br><br>  But even experienced programmers will be interested here: you can learn the basics of Swift or Java-Script, if you haven‚Äôt touched them before, plus a professional company is going to be excellent. <br><br>  There is a set of new <a href="http://moscoding.ru/">courses on JS and coding for children</a> . <br><br><h5>  School of data analysis Yandex </h5><br>  <b>Duration</b> : two years <br>  <b>Cost:</b> Free <br>  <b>Advantages: the</b> best university teachers in the field of computer science, classes in the evenings, the chance to get an internship at Yandex. <br><br>  Yandex ShAD is a two-year evening course for students and graduates of engineering and mathematical specialties, where specialists are trained in working with data and extracting information from the Internet ‚Äî not necessarily for Yandex itself. <br><br>  Loading - 15-20 hours a week, 12 of which go to classes with teachers from Russian and foreign universities. <br><br>  Find out more <a href="http://shad.yandex.ru/admission/">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Technopark from Mail.ru Group and MSTU.

For admission you need to know C or C ++, but you can understand their basics and on a special preparatory course. <br><br>  Algorithm of admission and a wide range of disciplines is <a href="https://tech-mail.ru/">on the link</a> .  Keep in mind: they will follow the progress, and the failure rate will be expelled. <br><br><h5>  Basic course on Android programming from #tceh </h5><br>  <b>Duration:</b> 10 nights <br>  <b>Cost:</b> 20 000 rubles (payment by installments is possible) <br>  <b>Advantages: the</b> first application as a result, classes in the evening, a small group, and perhaps the coolest teacher on the topic. <br><br>  The course on Android for those who are already programming, but did not write under the android, like the other courses from #tceh, is based on the principle of Learning by doing.  We make people not only learn the theory, but come and do what they want to master with their hands. <br><br>  Mikhail Varakin, an expert on Android and Unix technologies, is cool because he created the first Russian Android development course approved by Google.  It will help to master all the key things that most often require from the creator of android applications, and in parallel you will write your first application. <br><br>  To participate, you need a laptop with Android Studio installed, a basic knowledge of Java, SQL, XML or, at a minimum, object-oriented programming.  <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/androidcoding1/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dtceh_blog%26utm_campaign%3DITcourses_11feb">We register in February</a> , we start in March. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> And we are preparing a new JavaScript course for beginners, where it will be possible to create a full-fledged working JS code from scratch.  Details soon, today we go on a test lesson. <br><br><h4>  activity </h4><br>  In addition to development courses, Moscow hosts a number of activities for beginners and experienced programmers.  With interesting reports and useful communication after them.  For example: <br><br><h5>  Microsoft Mobile Dev Meetup, Mobile Web Development </h5><br>  <b>When:</b> February 17, 2015 <br>  <b>Where:</b> bar "Honey, I'll call you back" <br>  <b>What: there</b> will be lectures on the creation of mobile applications, Azure Mobile Services, HTML 5-development, as well as the opportunity to tell participants about their project.
