We were noted among the speakers, and as listeners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/867/f60/fb2/867f60fb2802437591a8d7aadd0f824a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c94/093/d22/c94093d22b2d458e84caedaae2e7bfa3.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Maxim Efimov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maximefimov/" class="user_link">MaximEfimov</a> ), head of the Android-development team</b> <br>  ‚ÄúOne of the largest conferences for Android developers is finally taking place again in Moscow.  On the three-day DroidCon Moscow, the latest technological innovations and developments in mobile development were discussed.  Each day was devoted to its subject: the first - technology, the second - business, the third - communication.  Not everyone had enough time to speak on the "profile" day, so part of the technical reports went on the second day. <br><br>  In general, there were a lot of speeches and often had to be torn between audiences - so much I wanted to listen to everything.  Fortunately, on the first day an <a href="https://broadcast.comdi.com/p/Apps4all/exsamwm3sve5ngyiei8v">online broadcast</a> was organized, so you could easily sit on one speech and watch another on the phone.

      Speakers raised the main trends of the current season: Android M, wearables, new frameworks and technologies for development.  At the same time, as always, it was not without a couple of holivars, and active discussion of the topics of the reports after the presentations.  In general, the conference had a large concentration of professionals in mobile development, and everyone had something to share and listen to.  I think this is exactly what the organizers wanted, for which they are five from me. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c11/442/9b5/c114429b55f44086921a1f126be6a0f4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b8/0c3/b82/0b80c3b829ef482085552ad6ec0822aa.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Artem Kulakov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fi5t/" class="user_link">Fi5t</a> ), Android developer:</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDisclaimer: everything written below is just my opinion and may not reflect (and sometimes even goes against) the opinion of the company.</i> <br>  Having been at the Droidon # 2015 conference, I was surprised and a bit saddened by the fact that everyone is burning with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcross-platform development.  How many copies on this topic have already been broken, and people will not calm down.  At the conference itself, they literally every day made React Native from Facebook.  And most actively engaged in this are those who have nothing to do with FB.  The representatives of Facebook themselves speak with restraint about this technology, they are smiling at the critical issues, and on the sidelines of their representatives they even heard "they won't fly."  And as a result, behind all this chad of revelry and cross-platform obscurantism, such worthy things as Kotlin and really hardcore reports on the insides of Android were completely forgotten, as was the case with DroidCon in Berlin.  Yes, the hardcore at the conference was, unfortunately, negligible.  Although, of course, it‚Äôs impossible to say that the Moscow DroidCon was very bad.  Worthy organization, prize draws, a 3D printer, glasses from Epson and talk of ‚Äúsoul-wise‚Äù for IoT with representatives of Intel - all this was very pleased.  Separately, it is worth noting the different swag from the organizers, which was not given out to everyone and not immediately, but as a result, everyone who wanted it in the required quantities received it.  In general, I did not waste my legitimate weekend on DroidCon - thanks to the organizers, speakers and everyone who participated in organizing and preparing the event. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a44/c8c/8eb/a44c8c8eb6aa413ca052030de6d1746c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93b/7b4/858/93b7b4858ff84481829e7ad6f8f1eee3.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Artem Malykhin, Android developer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúA little about the first day of DroidCon 2015. At first there was a line, very similar to the one that happens at the airport.  But its difference was that in it people were talking not about the weather-nature, but about all sorts of intellectual things like ‚ÄúAndroid 6.0 support‚Äù or ‚Äúweak connectivity‚Äù.  But the queue quickly came to an end, and the conference participants selectively received any swag like stickers with androids and cats, as well as a high-tech badge, where the name is written on a nano-innovative adhesive tape and glued to a card.  Immediately followed by a mini-tour of the Mail.Ru Group office - in general, a cool tower, guys.  Immediately began the speeches of the most diverse speakers.  There were many reports, almost all of them.  Coding techniques, marketing buns and other Android goodies were licked from almost all sides. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9b/8b6/e15/a9b8b6e15164424a9e2cae2b27f157d4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bef/06c/d79/bef06cd79b2e4abfa303857d51e8318a.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Alexander Smirnov, Android developer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúDroidCon Moscow is a remarkable event in the world of Android-development in Russia.  A small number of technical reports were upset, but among those that we managed to listen to were also quite severe, for example: <br>  Denis Neklyudov ‚ÄúReady for Android M release - ready!‚Äù <br>  Maxim Efimov "Interaction between threads in Android" <br>  Daniil Serdyukov ‚ÄûCompile time @Annotation processing‚Äú <br>  Royi Benyossef "Learn to accelerate - hardware acceleration in Android" <br>  It was cool, for those who, for whatever reason, missed the event, it is strongly recommended to watch the videos available online.  The main wish is more novelty - in some moments it was a deja vu from 2014.  Well, more harsh technical reports. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77b/3ab/d08/77b3abd0842f418d8f8bfc5104721de0.jpg"><br>  <i>All photos from DroidCon - Jalil Akbashev</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a78/b4d/f10/a78b4df10dd04460acc47a93f0c3a2c6.png" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Jalil Akbashev ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jaleel/" class="user_link">jaleel</a> ), a leading Android developer:</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis year I managed to visit two DroidCons - in Berlin and in Moscow.  Therefore, there is a good opportunity to compare the two events.  To begin with about the organization.  In general, everything was fine here, I liked it, the organizers did great work, for which they thank you very much.  What was strange for me was the line to the dining room.  But this stuff.  The division into technical and business days was not entirely clear.  In fact, all three days the conference attendees were mostly developers. <br><br>  Not like the stands of large companies - Epson every time shows the same thing, Sony brought the phones of older generations.  It was possible to chat with the guys from Intel, but again - there were no interesting technical solutions on the stand.  Where is Google before you release your products?  There were also many other brands that could be represented at this conference. <br><br>  I liked some performances very much - the speakers were great.  But in terms of content, some of the presentations were noticeably inferior to those in Berlin.  Android community need to organize conferences more often.  More performances, more people, more hardcore - this is useful not only for speakers and listeners, but for the whole community in terms of leveling. <br><br>  Of course, I criticized a little, but I repeat once again - the organizers did great work, and I hope that they will continue their difficult task further.  There is much to strive for compared to Berlin, but in reality this goal is not so far away. ‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="https://broadcast.comdi.com/p/Apps4all/exsamwm3sve5ngyiei8v">Here</a> you can watch the speech of Maxim Efimov on the interaction of threads in Android. <br><br>  And what are your impressions of the Moscow DroidCon? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268279/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268279/</a></p>
