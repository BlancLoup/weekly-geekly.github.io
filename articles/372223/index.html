    <h3>  USA </h3><br>  Despite the fact that there are about 191.1 million online shoppers in the United States, only 28% of small businesses sell their products via the Internet.  In general, more than half (57.4%) of American stores work online.  For most American buyers, the ability to check the availability of goods in a warehouse or in an offline store located next to the house is of key importance. <br><br><h3>  Great Britain </h3><br>  The UK is the third largest e-commerce market ranking.  Online sales in this country account for more than 13% of total retail sales.  Most Britons use PayPal, debit and credit cards to pay for goods on the Internet.  70% of British consumers have a smartphone, but only 16.5% use it for shopping.  Interesting fact - a third of online sales are made after 6 pm.  Perhaps this is due to the fact that local residents often leave online orders in pubs. <br><br><h3>  Japan </h3><br>  Almost the entire Japanese Internet audience, which accounts for 80% of the total population, makes purchases in online stores.  This is the second most popular online activity after reading email.  Recent studies show that Japanese consumers today spend more time at home than ever, which means they spend less time shopping in traditional stores.  This opens up great opportunities for online retailers.  However, it is worth considering that the Japanese approach the choice of the trading platform with full responsibility, preferring only reliable sellers with a good reputation, offering quality products.  Reviews of various products are very successful. <br><br><h3>  Germany </h3><br>  85% of the population of Germany are Internet users.  Among online retailers, Amazon and Otto, the German marketplace, are the most popular among Germans.  Small and medium businesses are not easy to compete with such giants, but there is a way out.  The most popular direction in online trading in Germany is fashion.  Thus, if you have a small fashion store, you could successfully develop on the German market.  When promoting an online magazine, it should be borne in mind that despite the high degree of Internet penetration, Germans are not very active in social networks.  So, for example, only 17% of users check their Facebook in the morning.  The Germans pay much more attention to e-mail. <br><br>  Great value for German consumers has the ability to return the goods.  Germany demonstrates a very high percentage of returns - up to 50% of all orders are sent back to the store.  Therefore, in order for customers to be satisfied with online stores operating in Germany, it is important to think of a return system and arrange free shipping. <br><br><h3>  France </h3><br>  Only 68% of the 66.2 million people in France are Internet users.  This is significantly less than in the UK, USA, Germany and China.  The French also spend less money on online shopping than residents of these countries.  However, in terms of the e-commerce market, France occupies the 6th place, ahead of South Korea, Canada, Russia and Brazil. <br><br><h3>  South Korea </h3><br>  On average, each resident of South Korea has up to 5 credit cards.  For comparison, in the US, each has an average of 2 cards.  This explains the high credit indebtedness of Koreans.  Residents of South Korea love sales and promotions.  And the fastest internet only promotes online shopping.  Unlike the Germans, who love to shop in the first half of the day, and the British, who prefer evening shopping, South Koreans can definitely be attributed to the ‚Äúnight owls‚Äù who stay up late in front of the screen. <br><br>  South Koreans often buy American goods.  In all likelihood, this is due to the fact that local South Korean products are nine times more expensive than their foreign counterparts. <br><br><h3>  Canada </h3><br>  Slightly less than half of Canadian consumers prefer overseas sites.  The reason for this is high prices for local products, which, with a similar quality, cannot compete with cheaper American and especially Chinese goods.  To the same volume, foreign online retailers offer a wider range in comparison with Canadian stores.  Shipping costs in Canada are 3.6 times higher than in the United States. <br><br><h3>  Russia </h3><br>  About 13% of Russians make purchases on the Internet.  Mainly to save money and time.  The most popular product categories are electronics, clothing and shoes.  The main difficulties faced by e-commerce enterprises in Russia are the lack of access to high-speed Internet in some regions and an underdeveloped road infrastructure.  Unlike residents of other countries represented in the ranking, Russians prefer to pay for purchases in cash upon delivery. <br><br><h3>  Brazil </h3><br>  In the process of online shopping, Brazilians prefer shopping, working in the direction of "fashion".  Such sites cover about 18% of Brazil's online retailers. <br><br><h3>  India </h3><br>  India was not included in the ranking of the largest e-commerce markets, but it should also pay attention.  The Indian market is the largest emerging market for ecommerce.  Despite the fact that Internet penetration in the country is just over 10%, the volume of online commerce is constantly growing.  The most popular among Indians such areas as electronics and fashion.  Along with the growing number of online shoppers, the number of mobile users is growing in India.  Currently, most purchases are made through a mobile device.  The main problem in the Indian e-commerce market is delivery.  In most of the country, infrastructure is poorly developed, especially in rural areas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372223/</a></p>
