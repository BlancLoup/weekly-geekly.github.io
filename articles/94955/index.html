  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A minute of history, or what computers did the USSR</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Computers so densely entered our life that now it is impossible to present it without them.  Desktop, laptops, PDAs, smartphones, various gadgets, whether it be a player or a portable photo bank.  In addition to the various devices we meet every day, there are also service computers.  Many people know about where they came from and how they developed, from ENIAC to modern computers, with insanely powerful processors and amazing operating systems.  But the fact that in the USSR, at this time computer systems were developed, designed to solve industrial and military problems, there is little light.  That's about them and will be discussed <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/48/e2/48e23fd54b730880267c2fa8111d3f97.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first Soviet computer was launched in December 1951, developed under the guidance of S.A.  Lebedev, and it was called the year of the computer MESM.  Its name was interpreted quite simply: ‚ÄúSmall Electronic Counting Machine‚Äù Initially, MESM was conceived as a model or model of a Large Electronic Counting Machine (BESM), at first the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù in the name meant ‚Äúmock-up‚Äù.  MESM embodied the basic principles of building a computer system, which Lebedev developed himself.  The fact that similar principles put forward von Neumann, we learn from publications later.

      The first control computing systems in our country were developed in the early 1960s at the Institute of Electronic Control Machines (INEUM).  The creation of INEUM was associated with the rapid development of a new promising area of ‚Äã‚Äãscience and technology - with the development of electronic digital computers for industrial automation. <br><br>  The next on the list was the UVK M40.  It was "presented" in 1958. The UHK M40 was for special applications.  Developed it at the Institute of Fine Mechanics and Computing under the guidance of S..  Lebedeva and V.S.  Burtsev.  On the basis of this, UVK created the first Soviet missile defense system. <br><br>  In the late 1950s - early 1960s, INEUM completed the development of UVK M4 (M4-M, M4-2M, M4-3M), designed to control in real time the complex of radar stations that were created by the Radiotechnical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences as a part of territorially distributed throughout the country radio-electronic surveillance system for artificial satellites of the Earth. <br><br>  What could UVK M4: <br>  Fixed-point representation <br>  Digit capacity is 23 binary digits; <br>  RAM 1024 23-bit numbers; <br>  Permanent memory 1024 23-bit numbers; <br>  The speed of 50 thousand operations of addition or subtraction per second; <br>  5.2 thousand division operations per second. <br><br>  Transistors and diodes were used as the element base, the operational memory was built on ferrite cores using lamp current generators. <br><br>  These UVK produced commercially since 1964.  For 15 years, they did not have foreign analogues and were created by the INEUM development team under the leadership of MA.  Kartseva exclusively on the basis of its own technical solutions. <br><br>  One of the most successful developments of UVK in the early 1960s was built on UM1-NC semiconductor devices, developed in Leningrad under the guidance of F.G.  Staros.  These complexes were used, in particular, in the system of automatic control and regulation of the Beloyarsk NPP.  The control system consisted of two UM1-NCs operating in the hot standby mode. <br><br>  In 1965, INEUM took the lead in the creation of an Aggregate System for Computing Equipment (ASVT), intended primarily for the automation of technological processes and automated enterprise management systems.  Although during these years the first domestic integrated circuits were still in the development and trial operation stage, as early as 1970, the first third-generation computing computer control systems in the country were created at INEUM.  The hierarchical system of such complexes on a microelectronic base (ASBT-M) included the models M4000 / M4030, M400 and M40, each of which took its place in the integrated production systems. <br><br>  Since the beginning of the 1970s, an international system of small electronic computers has been created at INEUM.  SM computers as a system of compatible hardware and software began to be developed from 1974 through the integration of a number of countries (USSR, Bulgaria, Hungary, GDR, Cuba, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia). <br><br>  Since the mid-1970s, two international systems, SM computers and EC computers (a unified system of electronic computers), together complementing each other, became the technical basis for automating the management and processing of information in all spheres of the national economy of the socialist countries.  SM computers included: a wide range of basic models of micro and mini computers;  The base series is a process of different performance and devices of RAM, peripheral, information display, communication with the object, telecommunication, intra-machine and inter-machine communication.  SM computer was designed to build control computing systems, widely used in sectors of the economy.  One of the important distinguishing features of the SM computer was that the system also included industrial controllers and communication devices with the object.  SM computers were characterized by a combination of such parameters as low cost, low weight and dimensions, low power consumption, developed software for solving problems in various fields, primarily in process control systems, research and production management. <br><br>  The following principles, which are still relevant today, were put in the basis of the creation of hardware and software of the SM computer; <br>  - required reliability for the appropriate class of system; <br>  - sufficient performance; <br>  - functional completeness for the corresponding class of the system; <br>  - communication with computer networks of various configurations; <br>  - completeness of system software support; <br>  - program and technical continuity of the newly developed means in relation to the previously created hardware and software; <br>  - openness and development of hardware and software; <br>  - simplicity and efficiency of diagnostics of technical equipment operability; <br>  - prompt and high-quality technical equipment service; <br>  - affordability.  From 1974 to 1990, about 80 thousand computer complexes of computer systems, as well as measuring and computer systems, automated workplaces of a wide purpose based on them were produced. <br><br>  Since the beginning of the 1980s, the development of the SM series of computers has been conducted in two directions in INEUM. <br>  The first direction is connected with the SM1800 family.  Initially, they used 8-bit processors KR580.  It was created 14 modifications of machines in this series. <br>  In 1986, the mass production of the 16-bit CM1810 model (K1810 processor) began.  It was developed 6 modifications of general-purpose computers and four for work in industrial conditions (CM1814). <br>  In 1990, the creation of the 32-bit CM1820 computer complex based on the Intel 80386 processor was completed. <br>  The second architectural line represented a number of compatible mini- and microcomputers of various capacities, in which 8, 16, and 32-bit microprocessors were used.  A distinctive feature of these computers is the use of the common bus system interface. <br><br>  Modern UVK INEUM use microprocessors corresponding to current achievements, as well as UNIX-like operating systems.
