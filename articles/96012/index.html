  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to register domains - tips and myths</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúDomain theft,‚Äù or rather, unauthorized changes of NS servers, incorrect registrations by resellers, simply errors during registration continue.  The topic is not new, but, as practice shows, year after year does not lose its relevance. <br>  I tried to collect in one place all the tips on the correct registration of domains.  At the same time - I remembered several myths about domains. <br>  Even if you know more about domains than me, please look at the article - we will do together the ‚ÄúMost Complete Guide,‚Äù the article is aimed at beginners. <br>  Where and how to register domains?  What to do if the domain is already registered, but there are doubts about the correctness of its registration? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>For specifics - prices and conditions refer to the zone .RU.</i> <br><br><h4>  Domain Registrars </h4><br>  You can register a domain with accredited registrars, or with their partners - domain resellers. <br>  Accredited registrars in the zone .RU 24, in the zone. RF - 18. The list is published on the official website of the Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet <br>  <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/ru/registrators/">www.cctld.ru/ru/registrators</a> <br>  The largest registrar in this market is Ru-Center (nic.ru). <br>  Domain name resellers are partners of one or more accredited registrars.  These are hosting providers, design studios and specialized domain resellers.  And it can be both private individuals and official companies.  Resellers earn on the difference of partner prices with prices for the consumer and can only accept payments and change settings - they cannot change the owner.  Those.  in fact, the domain is also registered through an accredited registrar. <br><br><h5>  Myth - you can not register domains "for 100 rubles" </h5><br>  Officially recommended price is 500 rubles.  But partner prices can be 90 rubles or less, and therefore, you can find proposals for registering domains of the order of 100 rubles.  This does not mean that the ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù domains are worse than the ‚Äúsix hundred‚Äù domains.  These are the same domains.  But when buying through a private reseller, you may encounter a lack of support, you will not receive accounting documents, there will be no one to file a claim - and other nuances of cheapness.  But these costs may not be.

    <h4>  How to check the integrity of the site? </h4><br>  To check the integrity of the service, look at the reviews on the Internet, if payment via WebMoney is offered - you can check the reviews on the official website <a href="http://arbitrage.webmoney.ru/asp/allclaims.asp">using WMID</a> or <a href="http://arbitrage.webmoney.ru/asp/allurls.asp">the website</a> . <br><br>  It is worth making sure that you pay for the site owner, and not for a wallet belonging to an unknown person.  You can do this by <a href="http://arbitrage.webmoney.ru/">checking the WMID</a> specified by the service. <br><br>  When paying with Yandex.Money, you can check that the Seller‚Äôs Store is registered in the <a href="">Domains</a> or <a href="">Hosting</a> category. <br><br>  You can simply search for reviews on the Internet about this site. <br><br>  CY and PR site - to some extent, will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe seriousness of the company (you can check with any service, for example: <a href="http://www.cy-pr.com/">cy-pr.com</a> . <br><br>  Look at the registrar's domain whois - there you can see the owner of the domain, the date of registration of the domain. <br><br>  Of course, you should pay attention to the presence of an SSL certificate, legal entity, postal address, phone numbers on the site, an offer agreement and other <s>optional</s> features of a serious service. <br><br><h5>  Myth - you can not get free domains for shares </h5><br>  Can.  But carefully read the terms of the promotion, read reviews about the company.  Domain should be made out specifically for you, not a hosting provider or design studio.  Otherwise, you will subsequently learn that the domain has been received ‚Äúfor temporary partial management‚Äù.  There is no such concept in nature - or your domain - or not. <br><br><h4>  How to check a registered domain? </h4><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">Whois</a> .  There are many services, for example: <br>  <a href="http://nic.ru/whois/">http://nic.ru/whois/</a> <br><br>  The domain must be registered to the data that you provided during registration - i.e.  in your name or your company.  In another case, ask for the information to be corrected immediately.  If you are reluctant to help, contact an accredited registrar (if you purchased through a reseller) or the Coordination Center (cctld.ru). <br><br><h5>  Myth - domain documents </h5><br>  Registrars often provide in a different form "documents for the domain", confirming the owner.  Only, these documents do not have legal force and do not protect from anything - in terms of the rules for registering the domains of the administrator (owner) of the domain, it is not the paper document that determines, but the whois data.  You can sign a paper contract with official companies. <br>  But if you are so calmer - then please. <br><br><h5>  Myth - to host a domain on a hosting, you must confirm that you own the domain </h5><br>  This is to nothing - services are completely different.  A hoster doesn't care who owns the domain. <br>  Moreover, the owner of the account (personal account) - and the owner of the domain can be different people or organizations.  Those.  no matter who pays for the renewal and registration of the domain - the owner is still the one on whom the domain is registered. <br><br><h4>  What to do if incorrect registration data is specified? </h4><br>  Write to the registrar.  Actions are largely dependent on the accredited registrar.  The question is solved. <br><br><h5>  Myth - everything does not suit me in the registrar, but I can not do anything! </h5><br>  You can always change the recorder.  All registrars provide information - how to do it, but often this information is hidden away.  The difficulty is that it is required to submit the notarized original of the application or to come personally with the documents and powers of attorney. <br>  However, if you move from one reseller to another or transfer control directly to an accredited registrar without changing the registrar, everything is much simpler.  For example, Ru-Center allows you to do this online, and Webnames (Regtime LLC) - with a simple scan of a letter with a statement, you do not need to notarize. <br>  Consent reseller is required.  You can always conclude a direct contract with the registrar. <br>  The option ‚Äúwait until the end of the registration period and buy the same domain in another place‚Äù is not strongly recommended.  Your domain may be intercepted by a cybersquatter or go to a registrar auction (however, it is almost the same). <br><br><h4>  How to identify a registrar? </h4><br>  Use whois.  In the registrar field, see the entry * -REG-RIPN <br>  It is possible to determine the registrar by comparing it with the nic-handle field in the official <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/ru/registrators/">list of registrars</a> . <br><br><h5>  Myth - I transfer the site to another host - I need to transfer the domain </h5><br>  Not necessary.  Simply paying for a domain and hosting services can be paid either in one place - or in different ones. <br><br><h5>  Myth - I was sold a domain - I was given a password to the questionnaire </h5><br>  When selling a domain, you need to create your profile with the registrar (if not), and the seller to send a notarized application following the sample of the registrar to transfer the domain to another administrator (owner).  Only after the domain appears in your profile and whois is displayed with your data - it is yours.  Yes, it is not so easy, but then stealing a domain is problematic. <br>  If you are afraid - use auctions or the service ‚ÄúDirectional domain transfer‚Äù, this is now offered by many registrars, for example: <a href="http://nic.ru/dns/service/direct_common.html">nic.ru.</a> <br>  When transferring / selling a domain, you can either leave the domain with the same registrar or transfer it to another. <br><br>  You can change the administrator (owner) of the domain only 90 days after the domain is registered.  and this is done only by an official statement certified by a notary (this does not cause any problems, since notaries not certify the document, but only your signature). <br><br><h5>  Myth - if the registrar closes - you lose the domain </h5><br>  ICANN periodically announces termination of accreditation (Russian registrars do not meet there).  In this case, on a competitive basis, domains are massively transferred to other accredited registrars. <br>  In the case of resellers, it is even easier - the domains remain with the accredited registrar. <br><br><h5>  Myth - I can pay for the domain registration for 100 years </h5><br>  In the RU zone - only for a year.  The solution is to keep funds on the balance sheet and enable domain auto-renewal (if available from the registrar). <br>  But here, for example, the TO domain ( <a href="http://to/">http: // to.</a> ) - please: 100 years for US $ 2500.  The maximum term of payment depends on the zone. <br><br><h5>  Myth - I can register a domain for any data </h5><br>  In the zones of RU and RF it is not.  It is recommended to specify real data, since domains with status (see the state field in the whois service) UNVERIFIED can be removed from delegation and registration is terminated. <br>  To confirm the registration data rather simple document scans, but even if you are a great master of Photoshop - take your time.  Registering for your data allows you to ‚Äúin case of anything‚Äù regain control of the domain. <br><br><h5>  Myth - domain name starts with www </h5><br>  The domain name (or second level domain) consists of the actual name and zone.  For example, example.ru - ‚Äúexampl in the zone of ru‚Äù.  <a href="http://www.example.ru/">www.example.ru</a> is already a third-level domain, it is not necessary to register it.  Such an address can be made later (and this question is no longer to the registrar - but to the host), and the domain ‚Äúwith www‚Äù can point to the site (be an alternative domain name), but this tradition is not a hard and fast rule. <br><br><h5>  Myth - I bought a domain - it does not work </h5><br>  If the DNS servers for the domain are configured correctly and the domain is added to the DNS servers (the host should give their names, or external DNS servers can be used) - the zone should be updated from 6 hours to several days.  It depends not on the registrar, not on the host, but on the Internet providers.  That is why the site can earn from home, but to be inaccessible from the office - different Internet providers. <br><br><h5>  Myth - I have a Russian site and will be placed in Russia - I need a domain RU </h5><br>  Of course not.  You can register a domain in dozens of zones.  Of course, zones have ‚Äúvocational guidance‚Äù: <br>  RU - Russia <br>  NET - network <br>  ORG - organizations (non-profit) <br>  COM - commercial organizations, etc. <br>  But these are conditional restrictions.  By the way, some interesting zones: <br>  na, to, bo, at, me, in, pro, jobs. <br>  You can dream up on domains: spasi.bo.  To beat the English value of me and in or emphasize professionalism (although in the pro zone it is not so easy).  Well, prices in some of the ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù zones are high - how do you get from ‚Ç¨ 3000 per NA?  But maybe are.na worth it? <br><br><h5>  Myth - there is a hiding of the owner‚Äôs data in all zones </h5><br>  In zones RU, RF there is an option Private Person (when registering for a private person or an individual entrepreneur).  Enabled in the domain control panel.  But in the zones COM NET TV CC WS INFO BIZ ORG MOBI ASIA (etc.) - this is not possible, and the registrars offer a paid service "Protection of registration data."  At the same time, "the WHOIS will display the data of a trusted legal entity of the domain registrar."  For example, so does <a href="http://www.webnames.ru/serv_privacy.pl">webnames</a> . <br><br><h5>  Myth - Domains.ru, .com, .net, .org </h5><br>  I almost forgot about this myth.  There are no such domains officially and never have been.  However, this does not prevent some registrars from selling this ‚Äúair‚Äù. <br>  Of course, you can register such a domain, and it will even work.  But it will work only for you and those of your friends who have installed plugins for their browsers, in accordance with the <a href="http://zxnet.pp.ru/txt/cyr.html">instructions</a> . <br>  Search engines "do not use" these plugins, so that about search engines with the same domain name will also have to forget. <br><br><h4>  IDN - Internationalized Domain Name </h4><br>  In several zones, for example, COM, NET, SU and others, you can register domains in national alphabets, for example, in Cyrillic.  The domain name must be in some one language, so phishing (by mixing characters of different alphabets) will not work.  And the site will open with most modern browsers.  There is little joy from such a domain - it is inconvenient to enter - but there are lovers. <br>  It even happens like this: the <b>example.com</b> domain is registered - you can register <b>uchfydz.com</b> - in case a potential visitor forgets to switch the layout (some browsers automatically add the com zone). <br>  In the zone of the Russian Federation can only register in Cyrillic. <br><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br><ul><li>  Choose a registrar you can trust. </li><li>  Register only on the actual owner of the domain. </li><li>  If you register for a promotion - carefully read the terms of the promotion. </li><li>  Be sure to send scans of documents (RU, RF), even if the domain has been registered for a long time. </li><li>  A few hours after registration, check whois - there should be your data and the status of VERIFIED (after checking the documents, usually from the 1st day to a month). </li><li>  After domain renewal (within 3 days) - check with whois that the domain registration period has changed (paid-till field: YYYY.MM.DD). </li><li>  You must obtain a login and password to manage your domain.  In the case of buying a domain from a reseller, you must be given a login and password from the domain control panel of an accredited registrar. </li><li>  Use caution when registering email addresses received from free mail services - they can be disabled for inactivity and take control. </li><li>  Use complex and complex passwords to access the panel and mail.  Do not store passwords in mailboxes, do not save them in browsers and mail programs. </li><li>  Do not forget to renew your domain registration - in the RU zone this is done once a year. </li><li> To hide your data - use Private Person and provide individual contact information for the domain (only for individuals).  In this case, you will avoid fraud using publicly available whois data - as information will be published: <br> <code>person: Private person</code> <br>  And not the address and telephone number that you provided when registering a domain, but contact information specifically intended for public access. </li><li>  If the Internet for you is a serious business - register domains for a legal entity.  Take care of your heirs, there is no inheritance of domains by individuals: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/domains/55069/">detailed article on Habr√©</a> . </li><li>  If a startup is designed to become super-profitable - register domains in several zones and with different spellings.  Do not give too much freedom to create phishing sites and make money on the "sealed" visitors. </li><li>  If you plan to register a dozen domains - become a partner of an accredited registrar.  Many offer very competitive prices starting from 1000 rubles of general expenses or special conditions for mass registration.  There is also a minus - most likely it is necessary to draw up a paper contract. </li><li>  Read the <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/ru/docs/RU-2.php">Rules for registering domain names in the domain RU</a> and the <a href="http://www.cctld.ru/ru/docs/rulesrf.php">Russian Federation</a> - so that the terms of separation and other conditions are not a surprise for you.  Please note that some domain zones have special conditions. </li><li>  If you have a ‚Äúpotentially vulnerable‚Äù site and you are afraid to arouse the interest of the relevant authorities - use the common domain zones: COM, NET, ORG.  Divide your domain, or remove from registration will be problematic.  Of course, the laws must be respected, we all understand that. </li></ul><br><br>  I believe that every habraiser knows it all himself, but habr users are also read by beginner domain owners - success to them! <br><br>  Thanks in advance for the addition of articles and tips. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96012/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96012/</a></p>
