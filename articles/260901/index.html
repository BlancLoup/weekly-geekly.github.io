  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do Twitter users rate the “Jurassic World”? We process Big Data with IBM Watson</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7da/223/4a1/7da2234a185f4df88950c1d8eb4afde7.png"><br><br>  The new part of the dinosaur saga, “The Jurassic World” broke many box office records and garnered many positive reviews from critics.  But how do viewers evaluate the appearance of the fourth part of the film about ancient reptiles in the familiar world?  How impatient was the audience waiting for the release of “The World” in cinemas? <br><br>  Thousands and thousands of reviews need to be analyzed, which is what the IBM Watson team did.  Now between IBM and Twitter, there is a cooperation agreement regarding the processing of Big Data, social network databases.  Therefore, IBM specialists took some of the Twitter-related data from the film and uploaded it to <a href="http://www.ibm.com/analytics/watson-analytics/">Watson Analytics</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Twitter Data Connector tool was used to connect Twitter databases to Watson.  In this case, only data with the hashtag #jurassicworld was analyzed.  The time period for which the tweets were taken is from February 1 to May 29 of this year.  As soon as the data was imported, Watson immediately set to work.  No further action was required.

      The processing results were quite interesting. <br><br>  In particular, it turned out that most of the tweets about this film were sent by viewers from Chile.  Women published messages about the "World" more often than men, and in Portugal - the maximum number of both positive tweets and negative reviews was published. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b9/0c9/084/2b90c90845b94193a37e451ddbca67aa.jpg"><br><br>  IBM Watson gave a clear answer to each request from researchers in the form of a detailed report with graphs and diagrams.  It is worth noting that a great advantage of IBM Watson is its openness to all: even a person with minimal knowledge in the field of data analysis (and indeed no knowledge in this area) will be able to get an excellent report with detailed data.  Getting started is easy. <br><br>  As for the results, it is worth highlighting the following: <br>  • The number of film reviews from viewers from Mongolia is only slightly lower than the number of #jurassicworld tweets from Chile; <br>  • In April, women were more positive about the film than in May; <br>  • In general, the feelings of the audience were positive; <br>  • The total number of #jurassicworld tweets has increased in the last five days of the month. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0f/303/40d/f0f30340d0e440f6873f124dcee9f560.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <i>When you click on the image, the image will open in full size.</i> <br><br>  Such activity in May may be caused by an increase in trailers to Jurassic World on the Tumblr movie page.  The data obtained by the researchers may be useful for subsequent releases of the film in other countries.  Perhaps the premiere should be shifted to the moment when the number of positive reviews is maximum. <br><br>  IBM Watson made some more interesting findings: <br>  • it turned out that the attitude to the film of viewers from Arab countries and Ukraine was mostly neutral (we are talking about feedback in Ukrainian and Arabic); <br>  • The Norwegians, in general, left positive feedback.  And the attitude of positive / negative feedback was greater than in any other region; <br>  • This ratio was minimal in Los Angeles, and maximum (for the USA) in New Orleans. <br><br>  All the techniques that were used in the analysis of the attitude of people in different countries to the film can be used in any other field.  For example, a marketer can evaluate the assessment (even probabilistic) of the relationship of the target audience to the company's product, the scientist will receive a detailed analysis of the experiment results and the ranking of the factors that influenced the result.  IBM Watson is a powerful tool for analyzing an arbitrarily large database of relevance to virtually any field of human activity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/260901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/260901/</a></p>
