In fact, plunging headlong into freestyle creativity, it turns out that there are periods of downtime that occur every year.  As a rule, this is the January holidays, and the summer season. <br><br>  Of course, as with every rule, exceptions also occur here.  But <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/freelancers/">most freelancers</a> , if they are not cunning, will confirm that such a "off season" in their practice is the place to be. <br><br>  Another question - how to survive these periods with minimal financial losses?  And here there are small subtleties and lifehacks.  About them will be discussed further.

    <h2>  And the Swiss, and the reaper, and the dude igrets </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-c/or/am/-coramtfqy4vgv2sl0dvsdl4gv0.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In any incomprehensible situation - refer to the popular wisdom.  So do it on occasion.  At least, when summer is coming, and customers are sent to resorts by a friendly team.  For the freelancer, for stability, it is necessary to expand the range of its services for a while. <br><br>  Definitely you know how to do something from an adjacent specialty and ‚Äúoff season‚Äù - this is a great time to take orders from another sphere.  No one talks about the retraining of an illustrator as a copywriter and vice versa.  Look for closer points of contact.  Fortunately, there are enough sections on the stock exchange to find something to their liking. <br><br>  Take a look at the category ‚ÄúStudy and Tutoring‚Äù.  There may be a task in your profile.  The ‚ÄúSounding‚Äù section can please you with an interesting project if you have no problems with diction.  In the "Texts and translations" there will definitely be a vacancy in transcribing or translations. <br><br>  In the end, there are always contests in naming, where you can certainly try your hand without prejudice to personal time and finances. <br><br>  Search and find.  As they say, a talented person is talented in everything.  In the next specialization for sure. <br><br><h2>  Make an offer that is impossible to refuse. </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4c/wc/me/4cwcme7q1sa-koi-f8jcopvoshq.jpeg"><br><br>  And in this case - it is a discount on typical services.  This is a great offer for both old and new customers.  Be sure there are those who want to save money, and load you with work for all three summer months.  Still, this situation is much better than the unknown. <br><br>  And in order to find out about your offer not only old customers, but also new ones, change your resume on the exchange.  Tell him about the unprecedented action, and maybe even update the price. <br><br>  This approach always works great.  And do not be afraid to temporarily reduce tariffs.  First, you will notify that it is only for the summer period.  And secondly, September is always associated with a rise in prices, so there will definitely be no complaints about you. <br><br><h2>  Streamline your profile and portfolio </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cp/e4/qj/cpe4qjnajk0fgjxlfjpswtzj9kq.jpeg"><br><br>  Admit it, because, for the renewal of work there is always no time.  And summer is a fertile season for such matters.  Bring your profile to the ideal, so that even rare orders will be yours unconditionally! <br><br>  Here you can combine business with pleasure.  Finally, restore order to the desktop, in documents and on disks.  Follow to update the portfolio, decorating his motley works.  Hone your resume, add a motto.  Refresh a photo in the end! <br><br>  To the customer who did not go to the Caribbean, and published a serious project by going to your page, I saw the freelancer of your dreams.  Here you can read clever literature, google tips from recruiting gurus, and be sure to browse the pages of top freelancers. <br><br>  Work on your own image, because, as you know, he is everything.  Many customers continue to meet on clothes (read: profile) and accompany on the mind. <br><br><h2>  Always remember about the financial pillow </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ju/iv/sd/juivsdpjijty9wfzdyxwmbqwxom.jpeg"><br><br>  It should be every held freelancer.  It is best to form it in the period of the greatest rises.  Or make yourself a rule to postpone 10-15% from each transaction.  Believe this, at first glance, a miser for 9 months can turn into a normal amount, which is a great insure for the summer ‚Äúoff-season‚Äù. <br><br>  By the way, the rounding method also works well in this direction.  Such an operation is even available on some payment cards.  Very effective stuff.  Imperceptibly, you can accumulate a good cash safety net.  Or simply add all the change from the stores to the box. <br><br>  And put yourself as a rule to postpone all bonuses, promotions and prizes won in contests.  By and large, you didn‚Äôt count on them, so it‚Äôs easy to hide them and not so detrimental to the wallet. <br><br><h2>  Do not waste time and develop </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nk/xv/mb/nkxvmbrc6yobh1zum_7zlvcovwu.png"><br><br>  If the moment of inactivity has arrived, use it with maximum benefit.  Every freelancer has gaps that never reach.  Clean up a computer, create a personal website or start a professional page on social networks, improve a foreign language, learn the ‚Äúblind‚Äù recruitment, start writing a book, create a personal course of study ... Finally, master another specialty! <br><br>  Direct your efforts to personal improvement, which will help you to get cool orders faster, thereby increasing your financial earnings in the future.  Thus, you will invest in yourself, which means that you cannot call this time downtime.  And the summer will not be in vain. <br><br><h2>  At the worst - go on vacation </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0c/-v/l8/0c-vl8we38_cp1cnfswddadkq-c.jpeg"><br><br>  With high probability, according to Murphy's Law and universal rock, as soon as you cross the threshold of your holiday home, a message about a job offer will be sent to the mail from the stock exchange. <br><br>  That is why do not forget your laptop at home, pay the tariff plan in a timely manner and enjoy the work in an atmosphere of relaxation and fun.  Experienced freelancers know firsthand how cool it is to work on vacation.  Who has not tried, be sure to try for yourself. <br><br>  And, of course, <a href="https://www.weblancer.net/">Weblancer</a> does not leave its users in trouble.  We are preparing a series of pleasant and useful surprises that are relevant in the run-up to the summer season.  So follow our posts on social networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454880/</a></p>
