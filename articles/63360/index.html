This phenomenon has been called ‚Äúblack flow‚Äù and is an excellent example of a frightening and incomprehensible reality, waiting for humanity in distant space. <br><br>  Many galaxies, known to us as the "universe", whirl to meet the "tiny" object in distant space.  At the very least, this is exactly what astrophysicist <a href="http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Alexander.Kashlinsky/">Alexander Kashlinsky</a> wrote in October 2008 in his rather contradictory work.  The essence of this phenomenon is that far in space (somewhere between Tatooine and the Earth) a place of energy (or matter?) Has found its place outside our current world outlook.  Which, among other things, attracts the whole visible universe at a speed of 600 km / s. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, the term "foreseeable universe" is something immeasurable.  While with the naked eye we can never see the far corners of this universe itself, and scientists, as you know, do not believe in hell, something ‚Äúthere‚Äù is still there.  And this "something" does not give rest to astrophysicists.  Kashlinski is still studying the problem, using data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year program.  Launched in 2001, according to NASA, the project was ‚Äúphenomenally successful‚Äù - it was thanks to the data obtained from five years of research work that the Standard Cosmological Model was developed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0c/cd4/e0f/b0ccd4e0fbda66859a148f1d0f003f07.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Intrigues in this whole situation with the ‚Äúcenter of the Universe‚Äù are also brought in by the fact that mankind has already received one very obvious proof that we are not alone in this space and time.  Called "WOW!  signal ‚Äù, it was a 72 second impulse recorded by Dr. Jerry Ehman on August 15, 1977.  Since the unidentified signal almost exactly fit the parameters of the so-called.  ‚ÄúArtificial space‚Äù, the first words of Dr. Eman at that second were nothing but the exclamation ‚ÄúWOW!‚Äù, Warcraft has nothing to do with it.

      The main evidence that this signal was not a random impulse emitted from the Earth and reflected, say, from a satellite, is its length.  Despite the fact that the signal itself contains practically no information (or cannot be deciphered), from the 72 seconds themselves something useful can still be extracted and, for sure, they are already working on it. <br><br>  So, we come to the most interesting question - were they aliens?  If a rocket launched from the Earth and, theoretically, able to reach the speed of light, will fly to the signal source, will it be able to detect it there?  There are no answers to these questions, because during the last 20 years attempts to fix the same signal or something similar did not succeed, even though the level of technical equipment of the observatories has risen by an order of magnitude. <br><br>  Dr. Kashlinski and some other astronomers and physicists are also of the opinion that, in theory, this signal could be the last trace of radiation from an endangered (already obviously extinct) race.  Astronomer David Darling described in detail the conditions necessary to send a signal of such frequency and power to space - in principle, such technologies exist on Earth, for example, the Arecibo radio telescope.  But besides the plate itself, a 2.2-gigawatt transmitter is needed - very powerful, but affordable for both humanity and another race. <br><br>  Something in the universe screams very loudly and, oddly enough, we are able to ‚Äúhear‚Äù this.  In the words of Alan Kogut from Goddard Space Center: ‚ÄúThe universe threw us a clue.  Instead of the ‚Äúfake‚Äù signal that we have been waiting for decades, there was a deafening explosive noise.  Six times stronger than anyone could have imagined. ‚Äù <br><br>  Naturally, it is also important to understand that there is no ‚Äúsound‚Äù in space in the classical sense.  What the NASA installation called the ARCADE system actually received was the space radio ‚Äúbackground‚Äù, and its source remained unknown.  Under normal conditions, radio telescopes are able to catch a signal with a frequency of 10 MHz to 100 GHz emanating from what modern astronomers call "radio galaxies."  The fun lies in the fact that according to existing models and theories such a signal could not come from the point of space from which it came, since it "lacks radio galaxies capable of emitting a similar signal." <br><br>  As stated in NASA: "In order for such a radio background to come from a classic radio galaxy, they must be located so tightly to each other, like a herring in a bank."  What, obviously, cannot be - the galaxies would collapse with a monstrous burst of energy that would no doubt be seen on our planet, but this did not happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15e/abb/659/15eabb659105472fa6367b94137c765b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Such stories convince the scientific people, and the public that programs like Hubble should continue for as long as possible.  On February 21, 2006, the above-mentioned telescope discovered in space, without a joke, an ‚Äúunidentified space object‚Äù in that place of space where there was nothing at all.  After 100 days from the first observation, the same thing happened.  And over time, the object became only brighter, up to the light from a supernova explosion without a supernova.  What science was unable to explain was nothing like this has ever happened before or after. <br><br>  However, before we even try to find answers to all these questions, mankind must realize its actual insignificance in the universe.  Let us take as an example the ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Great Wall of the Sloan</a> ‚Äù - the largest cosmic structure known to people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d0/8ef/3b0/4d08ef3b046484b11a6e3bbe0a4318d6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A huge wall of galaxies stretching for 1.37 billion light years ‚Äúfrom nose to tail‚Äù was discovered relatively recently - on October 20, 2003, a duet of scientists from Princeton University: Richard Gott the third and Mario Juric (J. Richard Gott III and Mario Juriƒá).  This vast array is at a distance of at least one billion light years from Earth. <br><br>  It is difficult to imagine such a scale, and this is exactly what I'm talking about.  While our galaxy extends to approximately 100,000 light years and is about 1000 light years thick in the center (where there is a huge black hole) the comparison of the Milky Way and the walls of Sloan is similar to the comparison of David and Goliath (without consequences, I would like hope).  What I'm trying to convey to the entire attentive public is an obvious fact.  If it is difficult for David not to notice Goliath, then the reverse situation is much more than possible ... besides, in my purely subjective view, the possibility of the emergence of a rational form of life in conditions of a denser concentration of the planets is several times higher than our protein and, we note, rather fragile . <br><br>  Mankind, in any case, should get ready - there are still too many incomprehensible, interesting and, quite possibly, dangerous in the Universe. <br><br>  via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5238308/get-ready-humanity-because-space-is-a-freak-show">Gizmodo</a> <br><br>  PS Dear, the fact that the note does not pretend to objectivity is obvious.  I am not learning a physicist or an astronomer, but a manager.  But even despite this, I do not consider it important and / or necessary to criticize every word, because  the system of concepts / views / values ‚Äã‚Äãadopted in the modern world seems ridiculous to me and, frankly, a little real.  If you do not like what is written above - you can honestly put a minus in my karma, I will not be offended <br>  PPS Truth does not exist.  Truly only what you believe.  I believe in what is written above and, as I already wrote, if you do not like it, you can put a minus in my karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63360/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63360/</a></p>
