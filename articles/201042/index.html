We have two tunnels to the central routers, with each microtic one by one. <br>  2. Cost 10 and 40 respectively.  That is, with the live main router (provider) MT1, the route from backbone 10.0.0.0/19 we get through the tunnel to ROU1, while dead through the tunnel to ROU2 <br>  3. We have a direct link between MT1 and MT2, in order not to drive traffic always through the c3550. <br><br>  Set, set.  Everything is working: <br><br>  # MT1 <br>  ADo dst-address = 10.0.0.0 / 19 gateway = 172.20.64.1 gateway-status = 172.20.64.1 reachable via ipip_yyy_vl03_rou1 distance = 110 scope = 20 target-scope = 10 ospf-metric = 40 ospf-type = external-type-1 <br><br>  # MT2 <br>  ADo dst-address = 10.0.0.0 / 19 gateway = 172.20.64.105 gateway-status = 172.20.64.105 reachable via ether2 distance = 110 scope = 20 target-scope = 10 ospf-metric = 50 ospf-type = external-type-1 <br><br>  On MT2 route up to 10ki via ether2, as it should be in principle. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 1:</b> <br><br>  Once, on MT1 the provider dies.  Subnet 10.0.0.0/19 becomes available through the tunnel to ROU2, everything should be as follows: <br><br>  # MT2 <br>  ADo dst-address = 10.0.0.0 / 19 gateway = 172.20.64.5 gateway-status = 172.20.64.5 reachable via ipip_yyy_vl03_rou2 distance = 110 scope = 20 target-scope = 10 ospf-metric = 70 ospf-type = external-type-1 <br><br>  BUT!  As soon as the provider on MT1 comes to life, we see the following: <br><br>  # MT1 <br>  ADo dst-address = 10.0.0.0 / 19 gateway = 172.20.64.1 gateway-status = 172.20.64.1 reachable via ipip_yyy_vl03_rou1 distance = 110 scope = 20 target-scope = 10 ospf-metric = 40 ospf-type = external-type-1 <br><br>  # MT2 <br>  ADo dst-address = 10.0.0.0 / 19 gateway = 172.20.64.5 gateway-status = 172.20.64.5 reachable via ipip_yyy_vl03_rou2 distance = 110 scope = 20 target-scope = 10 ospf-metric = 70 ospf-type = external-type-1 <br><br>  We see that each router is looking into its own tunnel.  That does not suit us at all.  Reboot MT2.  It begins to receive a route through ether2 from MT1.  Disorder. <br><br>  As a temporary solution, we got all of the regional nodes on ROU1 and ROU2.  Everything worked very nicely until one day our tsisk said: too many routing processes <br><br>  And we again returned to the problem with the backbone.  Long support battles do not lead to anything, but one fine moment we get the answer that the microtic during the redistribution of the routes between the arias (in this case the route from the backbone is redistributed via IRK) <br>  starts incorrectly install routes.  And we get the picture that every router looks into its tunnel. <br>  Then the solution comes by itself: <br>  We add IP on ether2, we bring a new subnet in backbone. <br><br>  # MT1 <br>  / ip address add address = 172.20.64.121 / 30 comment = "MT-MT BB" interface = ether2 <br>  / routing ospf network add area = backbone network = 172.20.64.120 / 30 <br><br>  # Do not redistribute the route through IRK <br>  / routing filter add action = discard chain = ospf-in prefix = 10.0.0.0 / 19 <br><br>  # MT2 <br>  / ip address add address = 172.20.64.122 / 30 comment = "MT-MT BB" interface = ether2 <br>  / routing ospf network add area = backbone network = 172.20.64.120 / 30 <br><br>  # Do not redistribute the route through IRK <br>  / routing filter add action = discard chain = ospf-in prefix = 10.0.0.0 / 19 <br><br>  And we get that the 10.0.0.0/19 route is not redistributed through someone else's erie, but is received within one.  Fuf, one problem won. <br><br>  Now for consideration of the second problem, we give the GW config, I will omit the config on MT1 and MT2, there is nothing complicated there. <br><br>  In the figure we have GW68 and GW69, I will give the settings for only one and in abbreviation: <br><br>  On Mikrotik 751: <br>  ether2 - backup provider <br>  ether3 - primary provider <br>  ether5 - LAN <br>  The question arises why not ether2 primary provider.  We first made ether1 - the main provider, but it turned out that some kind of polusoftovy port and IPSec performance was completely nonexistent, just transferred to ether3, in order not to edit the config much. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">GW68 configuration</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  # Create tunnels <br>  / interface ipip add comment = X_GW64_X disabled = no local-address = 195.xxx mtu = 1440 name = ipip_x_gw64_x remote-address = 195.xxx <br>  / interface ipip add comment = Y_GW64_Y disabled = no local-address = 87.xxx mtu = 1440 name = ipip_y_gw64_y remote-address = 85.xxx <br><br>  # Create a bridge, combine wifi ap and ether5 <br>  / interface bridge add l2mtu = 1594 name = bridge_private <br>  / interface bridge port add bridge = bridge_private interface = ether5 <br>  / interface bridge port add bridge = bridge_private interface = wlan_private <br><br>  # Create DHCP <br>  / ip pool add name = 10.0.68.0 ranges = 10.0.68.64-10.0.68.160 <br>  / ip dhcp-server add address-pool = 10.0.68.0 disabled = no interface = bridge_private name = 10.0.68.0 <br>  / ip dhcp-server network add address = 10.0.68.0 / 24 dns-server = 10.0.64.14,10.0.3.6 domain = partner.ru gateway = 10.0.68.1 <br><br>  # Hang IP <br>  / ip address add address = 10.0.68.1 / 24 comment = LAN interface = bridge_private <br>  / ip address add address = 172.20.68.2 / 30 comment = X_GW64_X interface = ipip_x_gw64_x <br>  / ip address add address = 172.20.68.6 / 30 comment = Y_GW64_Y interface = ipip_y_gw64_y <br>  / ip address add address = 195.xxx / 30 comment = X interface = ether3 <br>  / ip address add address = 87.xxx / 30 comment = Y interface = ether2 <br><br>  # Add routes to MT1 and MT2 addresses via provider gateways <br>  / ip route add check-gateway = ping comment = Route_over_Y_to_Y distance = 1 dst-address = 85.xxx / 32 gateway = 1.1.1.1 <br>  / ip route add check-gateway = ping comment = Route_over_X_to_X distance = 1 dst-address = 195.xxx / 32 gateway = 2.2.2.2 <br><br>  # Add area and instance, network and ospf interface <br>  / routing ospf instance set [find default = yes] disabled = yes <br>  / routing ospf instance add name = IRK router-id = 10.0.68.1 <br>  / routing ospf area add area-id = 10.0.64.0 instance = IRK name = IRK <br>  / routing ospf network add area = IRK network = 172.20.68.0 / 30 <br>  / routing ospf network add area = IRK network = 172.20.68.4 / 30 <br>  / routing ospf network add area = IRK network = 10.0.68.0 / 24 <br>  / routing ospf interface add authentication = md5 authentication-key = 0 interface = ipip_x_gw64_x network-type = point-to-point priority = 0 <br>  / routing ospf interface add authentication = md5 authentication-key = 0 cost = 40 interface = ipip_y_gw64_y network-type = point-to-point priority = 0 <br>  / routing ospf interface add authentication = md5 authentication-key = 0 interface = bridge_private network-type = broadcast passive = yes <br></div></div><br>  How it all works: <br><br>  GW68 establishes two tunnels to MT1 and to MT2, each through its own provider.  There is no default on microtics, addresses MT1 and MT2 are prescribed by statics. <br>  On the tunnel to MT1 there is a cost 10, on the tunnel to MT2 cost 40. As soon as the tunnel comes to life, we get the default and all routes with MT1 through OSPF.  All traffic is wrapped on MT1.  As soon as the main provider falls off, <br>  after the expiration of the OSPF timer, routs through the tunnel to MT2 become active. <br><br>  <b>Problem 2:</b> <br><br>  With a live main channel, we see in the GW68 log <br><br>  20:12:26 route, packet, ospf, info database, packet has different master status flag <br>  20:12:26 route, ospf, info new master flag = false <br><br>  At this moment, our traffic itself begins to run through the tunnel to MT2.  The tunnel to MT1 is live, and the traffic runs through the tunnel to MT2.  And since stores usually have a reserve of megabytes, <br>  then we get sucking money for no reason. <br>  To return everything to the tunnel before the MT1, it was necessary to turn off on the MT1 and again turn on the tunnel to GW68.  Moreover, this problem occurred only in some cities, and not on all routers. <br>  On the forum Mikrotik, in those.  support no one helped us.  One day, my colleague, trying to raise the tunnel MT1-Juniper SRX-650, armed with a bunch of alcohol, sniffer and debugger :) <br>  And debugging IPSec, I came across authorization errors OSPF microtic.  We disabled authorization on the OSPF interfaces and voila, the problem disappeared by itself. <br>  How does the authorization go there, where it fails, neither he nor I now remember.  But the issue is resolved.  Why somewhere worked fine and with authorization, I can not say. <br><br>  With the microtic, you can only guess at the coffee grounds, since each answer of the support is a new question, each new firmware gives a new problem :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201042/</a></p>
