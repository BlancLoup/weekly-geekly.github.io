You, probably, have already been shaken by reviews of Chinese phones and tablets.  But here is a little different.  My review is somewhat recursive: I read the phone review on Habr√©, caught fire, bought an updated version, got it, wrote a review based on the motives.  Since the initial review has already been drunk from the habr, it seems to me that it will be correct if in the annals (the next word combined with Zopo) there will be at least some review.  In contrast, so to speak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3be/589/7dc/3be5897dc1a2660750b14cdc2092f696.jpg">

      So, those who are too lazy to read a large sheet, just a brief squeeze: <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - podtormazhivaet on any firmware (it is treated by the selection of the launcher) <br>  - turns on the screen with a second pause after pressing the power button <br>  - incorrectly shows the remaining battery charge <br>  - during charging, it incorrectly works out the touch (the so-called ghostly pressing) <br>  - almost does not catch GPS in rooms <br>  - The screen fades when changing the viewing angle.  Those.  if the IPS, then some hrenovenky. <br>  - has a potential Trojan in the official firmware <br>  - carries on board a twice outdated version of Android (i.e. 4.0.4) <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - price <br>  - once again the price <br>  - build quality <br>  - smart in applications <br>  - constant firmware update <br><br>  And now all this is more detailed and expanded.  Welcome under cat. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A small lyrical digression, on the topic of why the Chinese was taken: I bought my previous Android phone 2 years ago for 14 thousand rubles and sold it this fall for 4-D.  Total minus 10 thousand for two years, or rent for 5 thousand per year.  Somehow expensive and useless.  Secondly, my son is growing up, who recently hit a year.  My happiness has already been bitten by two phones (including the unkillable SE K610i), so I didn‚Äôt want to take something expensive for the next two years.  Thirdly, I have an actively used working SIM card and the second personal one, on which SMS messages from banks, etc. are dumped.  information.  And somehow I don‚Äôt want to carry a second phone for periodic SMS.  As a result, I began to look closely at state employees.  And then, about a miracle, reviews of Chinese began to appear on Habr√©, which, allegedly, are brisk as cheetahs, beautiful as Angelina Jolie, work with two SIM cards, aki Caesar, and are cheaper than the back cover of some flagship.  Gentlemen, I have desired. <br><br>  After a long selection and reading, the Habr stopped on the Zopo ZP500 as having the smallest diagonal (only 4 ‚Äù).  I waited for the processor to upgrade (it became dual-core) and ordered the model ZP500 +. <br><br>  And now, in fact, the review itself.  Unfortunately, my hands are completely crooked, and I can not take pictures beautifully.  Therefore, if the public allows, I will take photos from the old (and sawn) <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kurmunke/" class="user_link">Kurmunke</a> post about a single-core ZP500.  Fortunately, they are still filled with habrastorage and the new version of the ZP500 + looks the same. <br>  So, the appearance and equipment: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2fc/3f6/4b8/2fc3f64b820aac20f053f58306cf272a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e15/e15/ab1/e15e15ab1e7b10e5d6186018134c34bf.jpg"><br><br>  Included is a charger, an adapter to our sockets, a microUSB-cord, two native films on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb1/50d/070/eb150d070ac478425972a66bcf0a774f.jpg"><br><br>  Inside <s>it has neon</s> two easily accessible sections for SIM cards and a memory card.  Build quality is quite on par.  Squeaks, backlash and other things are not observed.  So everything is in order. <br><br>  Now let's move on to performance and feel: the phone has the standard configuration for most modern Chinese: the MTK6577 processor, two gigahertz cores, 512 megabytes of RAM, the PowerVR SGX531 graphics accelerator.  At the same time, despite this decent stuffing, right out of the box, the phone significantly slows down.  As a person who was leaving HTC Hero for a year and a half, he immediately got into all sorts of optimizations.  After smoking the forum it turned out the following: <br><br>  The phone has three types of firmware: <br>  1) official Chinese (having a bunch of Chinese software that can not be deleted except as root) <br>  2) Informal Chinese from zopomobileshop.com.  Also containing some hieroglyphs <br>  3) Vietnamese, designed for phone-clone Revo S2 <br><br>  The first two are sewn through a certain Flash Tool software.  In other words, it is proposed that some program regularly rewrite either all or the necessary parts of the phone‚Äôs memory.  To me, this approach seems fraught with various jambs.  On the second, it seems like a root is being put, but there it depends heavily on luck and the people on the forums are either sewn or not sewn.  In general, that is daisy.  In addition, in the first two firmwares there is the legendary SMSreg.apk application, which some consider to be a potential trojan that sends paid SMS to Chinese numbers.  To demolish it, you also need a root.  Here, by the way, in general, you can start a conversation about the draining of personal data - it is unlikely that the Chinese are especially scrupulous here, but now it will not be about that.  Although an unpleasant sediment remained. <br><br>  In general, I chose the third, Vietnamese firmware.  It is installed from a memory card through a modified recovery (as on most custom programs on most normal phones) and it immediately has a built-in root. <br><br>  So, even such a dance with tambourines does not solve the problem of brakes.  The phone starts to work a little faster, but still dirty.  The most interesting thing is that in Antutu the phone easily dials 5794. After long experiments, the Nova launcher was installed and a profile was set up in the SetCPU program, which gives the maximum processor performance when the screen is on.  All this together made it possible to achieve a smooth operation of the interface.  Those.  once again, in order for the phone interface to work smoothly, you need to flash an alternative firmware, install an alternative lunch, flash root, install a program that forces the processor to work well.  To interface !!! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/220/20d/c22/22020dc224dceac052310894a4b017ed.png"><br><br>  If we compare it with a single-core ZP500 operating at the same frequency of 1 gigahertz, the performance is seen to double. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87d/770/1a3/87d7701a3fe0377b5acae0562f57397b.png"><br><br>  Now the GPS.  Like most Chinese people, indoors works disgustingly.  In addition, in all the firmware in the gps.conf file, the left address is registered, slowing down the search for satellites even on the street.  After installation, the FasterGPS program (again, the root is needed) the server changes to Russian ones and the search for satellites is slightly faster.  However, even after this manipulation, the satellites are not perfectly caught.  A couple of times in the car, I missed the right turn due to untimely falling off satellites.  On the forums, people get to the point where they solder the wire to the antenna.  I want to try to amplify the signal with foil.  See if it helps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa1/138/ca6/fa1138ca68feee9e9618dd5b9d079905.png"><br><br>  This is from the fact that managed to win.  What failed.  First, it infuriates that the phone starts only a second after pressing the power button.  Those.  it turns off in a flash, and turns on after a second.  This teaches Eastern Zen.  The second, despite the stated IPS, the screen significantly fades when changing viewing angles.  So what about iPS, I would argue.  Third, the battery charge indicator behaves like a hysteric.  He is full, then in a couple of seconds he loses 10 percent of the charge, then he lives half a day by 30%.  I tried to do Wipe battery status, tried some other tips - all to no avail.  The people on the forums say that in the October firmware of the second type (unofficial) it seems that the problem with the battery was solved.  I don‚Äôt want to switch to it, because  There are problems with the root (which means that all my optimizations will fall out of the paragraphs above), plus it is more inhibited in itself.  Fourth, when charging from the network, the screen catches ghostly clicks.  This is also annoying. <br><br>  It seems like everyone else.  Oh yeah, the current version of Android 4.0.4, seems to be promising to release Android 4.1 soon, but the likelihood is minimal - 4.1 will be ported to devices with a gigabyte of memory, and whether the firmware of my half-argent Zop will be, this is another question.  But the firmware is being released regularly.  At least a couple per month. <br><br>  Now what I liked: the price.  For 6000 rubles, I received a two-part phone that rings well, works smoothly (but how long I killed it!) And works well with applications.  For such a price is quite good.  But, taking into account all the jambs described above, I would hardly buy a Chinese next time.  Too long have to hold the file in their hands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163345/</a></p>
