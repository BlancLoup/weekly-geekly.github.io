Yes, these are such mutants, where the horoscope for every day stuck to the news about street landscaping, the weather forecast shaking fearfully in the upper corner, and in the center of the resource is a jumble of new movies, political events and announcements ‚Äúselling tomato seeds cheaply.‚Äù  Not only that - the monster lived further, on similar resources just a mass of cheap banner advertising.

      In general, really not for the faint of heart. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Who uses all of this is still a big mystery. </h5><br>  But the need for a quality guide to cultural (and not so) places - is in residents of almost every major city.  And Non-rezinovaya, in addition to other merits in front of the country, is also known for the unreal number of cereal places of the most diverse properties.  In which the native Muscovites are not always oriented. <br><br><h5>  For them, we built Restlook - 3D-guide to the institutions of the capital. </h5><br>  As the saying goes, the essence is ... Panoramic photos and 3D tours are a well-known technique.  Some restaurants, clubs and hotels make a complete survey of their interiors, so that the user can practically ‚Äúlive‚Äù assess the quality of the place.  And others are limited to a modest photo gallery and descriptions.  Agree that the first has a significant advantage in winning customer loyalty.  He went to the site, looked, turned, made sure that everything is decent and that here you can call a partner for a business meeting or a girlfriend for a couple of cocktails.  And if you want, you can tell comrades on Facebook - so that they, too, wander around the virtual restaurant. <br><br><h5>  Our idea is a city portal entirely dedicated to 3D tours. </h5><br>  Hotels, restaurants, cafes, bars, saunas - now every entertainment business owner has the opportunity to literally show himself.  Even city parks, museums, planetariums and simply memorable places - and they have every chance to get their own tour.  Scheme of action: our team leaves the site, does its work, after which the institution appears on the portal in the appropriate section.  With high-quality photos, the promised virtual journey and a screwed-down system of reviews.  Approximately in this form: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d23/0e1/cbf/d230e1cbf30a4dcb20f9e5a54ed65028.jpg"></div><br><br><h5>  Where is the profit?  Profit where? </h5><br>  Placing on the resource involves some compensation from the owners of the restaurant and hotel business.  Having your own virtual tour is, after all, a good advertisement for the establishment <br><br>  Now about the conversion.  That the user was interested in visiting the resource, some photo albums, panoramas and tours are few.  We went the following way: <br><ul><li>  First, they made a review system.  With the pre-moderation, the reviews on the institution are not limited to the thoughtful ‚Äúcool‚Äù.  Visitors can now complain about shoddy squids right below the 3D panorama. </li><li>  Secondly, they added a map of institutions with smart search ‚Äúin radius‚Äù.  Visitors to the site not only come off in the comments, but also plan their route to the bars and clubs for the coming Friday in the most convenient way. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is planned to have a multi-lingual portal for tourists, the ability to book a table and watch the current menu directly from the site and several other small functional extensions. </li><li>  Fourthly, the high sociality of the resource (well, where do without it!).  Login to the site through any popular social network.  Social recommendations, of course, are present. </li></ul><br>  Our team (so far small) began to work with the institutions of Podolsk, then - Ryazan.  Now they have gained courage and set about Moscow :) Projects in the cities were popular, and the site in Moscow was launched quite recently - so we really want to hear your opinion: <a href="http://restlook.ru/">restlook.ru</a> . <br><br>  Leave comments on the wishes of the functions and impressions of the site as a whole.  We wait! <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is not enough karma for posting a blog post ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138201/</a></p>
