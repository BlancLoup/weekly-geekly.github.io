But really bright, large and innovative things do not happen so often even on a global scale.  Projects like Facebook, Instagram or Yandex that have come into the lives of almost every network user have not appeared for a long time. <br><br>  Service Ahoba (; - launching a small Siberian team from Khakassia - modestly published on October 10, 2014 in the form of the first public version. In less than a month of its existence, he won the hearts and computers of thousands of users, finding his audience in the company's personal blog on the largest Russian-language IT -resource - <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/ahoba">Habrajabr</a> , having liked fellow <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/ahoba">startups</a> at <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/ahoba">Spark</a> , having received a dozen reviews and descriptions on other various sites on design and layout topics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/912/47f/819/91247f81941344f982d849d89c38377e.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Ahoba.co, what kind of service is it, and why was it needed by everyone? </h3><br>  The official description from the project site: ‚ÄúAhoba (; - is a universal online editor for creating design layouts with autowrap and saving in various formats.‚Äù But behind this formal description there is something more: <br><br>  This is a service project that can be useful to almost any computer user, because  Everyone from time to time has the task of creating a design for anything from business cards and leaflets to pdf documents, online presentations and web pages.  The project is interesting and useful to many people, but first of all it is designed for creative people.  A designer is not a profession, it is a state of mind.  And the service Ahoba.co, not just ‚Äúeditor for design‚Äù, is a tool for the soul ... <br><br>  Every PC user is a bit of a designer ... We all have to either process photos in Photoshop, decorate presentations beautifully, then make a neat document in PDF format ... And how many ‚Äúfunnies‚Äù and ‚Äúknowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãare created every day for VKontakte?  And all this can now be done directly in the browser, without downloading or installing anything, without manually editing the graphic layout in the final document. <br><br><h4>  Ahoba (; can be used to create: </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e1/72d/a53/6e172da53a284527919c756bb9870ea5.png"><br><br>  To do this, you need the Ahoba service (;; and this is why it is useful to all users, and why everyone who finds out about it does not remain indifferent ... <br><br><h3>  Ahoba.co - why crowdfunding? </h3><br>  It would seem that the authors of the project stumbled upon a ‚Äúgold mine‚Äù, but not everything is so simple ... Software giant corporations, such as Google or Adobe, are missing this niche in the market.  They are heavy, but practically unlimited in resources.  A small young company that makes the project Ahoba.co, by contrast, is very flexible and open to users, but is very limited in resources ... <br><br>  Youth and lack of resources in a novice team are called ‚Äústartups‚Äù.  A start-up is a new business, a new project that is at an early stage, when it does not yet have revenues, or revenues do not pay for current investments (there is no self-sufficiency).  The basis of the development of the company and the project at this stage is the fanatical, hard labor of its founders.  When one person literally has to work for three.  As part of the Ahoba project, an entire article has been written about this: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ahoba/blog/240337/">http://habrahabr.ru/company/ahoba/blog/240337/</a> <br><br>  No matter how hardworking the founders may be, their capabilities at a certain moment start to be missed.  And at this moment, in order for the development of the project not to stop, it is necessary to attract external financing.  Where to find him ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù project?  The answer suggests itself - crowdfunding. <br><br>  The Russian language is rich and powerful, and we are all borrowing concepts from foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã... Crowdfunding is ‚Äúnational funding,‚Äù or in another way, ‚Äúraising funds, for implementing an idea that you like.‚Äù  It works like this: you like something, something you want, but it is not;  you find a company that implements what you want;  give them some money so that they can make your wish come true;  if enough people are interested in the project, the amount needed for the implementation is collected;  the company realizes what you want;  you use it. <br><br>  Together with the official public launch of the service Ahoba.co, a campaign dedicated to its support was launched on its website.  Interested users actively helped and helped the service by purchasing subscriptions to it at an early stage, realizing that the funds would be used to develop the tool they liked.  Everything is good, but most of those who support the project expressed some kind of bewilderment: ‚ÄúWhy did the authors‚Äú reinvent the wheel ‚Äùby organizing a fundraising on their website, scattering information about the project, development, rewards, and payment on different pages of the blog and service?  There are also specialized sites for crowdfunding fundraising, where all this is convenient and beautifully organized ... ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/826/11c/116/82611c116d504377b06637c925eda1a5.png"><br><br>  The Ahoba project team (; always listens to the opinions and wishes of its users, because this project is being done for them. They also listened to advice on the use of a specialized platform. After thoroughly studying all the Russian-language options, Bumstarter was chosen. As the creators themselves say about it: Boomstarter - <br>  The most convenient and easy way to attract collective funding for the start of the project. <br><br>  The action ‚ÄúSupport Ahoba (; on Bumstarter!‚Äù - the event itself is interesting and unusual, as the service <a href="http://sketchbuilder.com/">Mockup editor SletchBuilder is</a> curious and useful </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242891/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242891/</a></p>
