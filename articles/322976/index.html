    <h3>  Book structure </h3><br>  This book consists of an introduction and 15 chapters. <br><br>  Chapter 1. Choosing an operating system.  Provides an overview of operating systems.  The material in this chapter will help you understand what Linux is and in what situations it may be useful to you. <br><br>  Chapter 2. Software licensing.  It describes the copyright law and licenses used by Linux and other operating systems to extend or restrict users' rights to use and copy software. <br><br>  Chapter 3. Principles and philosophy of Linux.  It provides a history of Linux, and describes how to use this and other operating systems. <br><br>  Chapter 4. Popular Linux programs.  We consider the main categories of Linux software and the most popular programs of this operating system. <br><br>  Chapter 5. Hardware Management.  Provides guidance on choosing and using hardware in Linux.  It covers various topics, starting with the central processor (CPU) and ending with device drivers. <br><br>  Chapter 6. Familiarity with the command line.  Describes how to manage Linux using input commands.  Although this topic is difficult for many new users, managing Linux from the command line is important. <br><br>  Chapter 7. Working with files and directories.  Explains how to move, rename, delete and edit files.  Directories are a special type of file, so they are also described in this chapter. <br><br>  Chapter 8. Search, retrieve and archive data.  It discusses the tools you can use to search for data on your computer, as well as ways to manage archive files for transferring and backing up data. <br><br>  Chapter 9. Processes and their data.  Describes how to install programs on Linux, as well as changing the priority of starting or stopping the execution of individual programs. <br><br>  Chapter 10. Editing Files.  Dedicated to editing text files.  It describes the basic text editors pico, nano and vi, as well as some common conventions for configuration files and text file formatting. <br><br>  Chapter 11. Scripting.  It describes the process of creating simple scripts, which are programs that can run other programs.  You can use scripts to automate tedious tasks performed in manual mode, thereby increasing your productivity. <br><br>  Chapter 12. Security Basics.  Concepts that are crucial to understanding the multi-user nature of Linux are explained.  In addition, the superuser account used by the OS for most administrative tasks is described. <br><br>  Chapter 13. Creating users and groups.  It discusses software and procedures that can be used to create, modify, and delete accounts and groups that determine who can work on a computer. <br><br>  Chapter 14. Setting up ownership and access rights.  Describes how to control: which users can access files and how they can do it.  Along with users and groups, possession and access rights allow you to control the security of your computer. <br><br>  Chapter 15. Managing Network Connections.  Dedicated to the important issue of a Linux message about how to use the network (including connectivity testing and basic network security measures). <br><br>  The chapters are arranged in order of increasing complexity of the tasks and systems described in them.  The beginning of the book provides background information about Linux and describes the development philosophy of this operating system.  Subsequent chapters deal with such basic user tasks as moving files.  The final chapters of the book are devoted to tasks that are of most interest to system administrators, such as account management and network configuration. <br><br>  Each chapter begins by listing the topics described in it.  At the end of each chapter you will find a summary briefly summarizing the material presented, as well as exercises and test questions. <br><br><h3>  About the authors </h3><br>  <b>Christine Bresnahan</b> , CompTIA Linux +, LPIC-1, Linux Essentials, started working with computers more than 30 years ago as a system administrator.
