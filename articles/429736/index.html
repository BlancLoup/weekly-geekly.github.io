Against the owners of the territories providing a springboard for the spread of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">hogweed Sosnovsky</a> .  Hooray! <br><br>  True, I wonder who will pay for the titanic plantation of the Hogweed between Sheremetyevo and the Aeroexpress string.  A plantation that welcomes guests and residents of Moscow immediately upon arrival in the white-stone.  Millions of fines grow there. <br><br>  What is the hogweed Sosnovsky and why it is necessary to fight him.  How to do it.  How to do this is not necessary.  As well as scientific and pseudoscientific facts in a boringly popular presentation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Instead of intro (you can skip) </h2><br>  I have long been going to write an article on Hiktayms, however, completely about another invasive plant.

I honestly waited - suddenly, someone else would take upon himself the honorable mission of driving a skating rink of a nauchpop to Herkules grass.  And here I am, from an ambush, with an article on the topic.  But, alas, it is necessary to write horshevik himself. <br><br>  Warning: I am never a nerd (in the best sense of the word).  Therefore, everything in this article is a compilation of foreign sources (including non-scientific sources) and conclusions on such a shaky basis.  In addition, the text will contain ‚Äújokes for 30‚Äù and traces of obscene vocabulary (neatly ephemed).  I will welcome any comments, even with furious criticism, especially from professional botanists and other biologists.  And if someone prefers scientific rather than entertaining style, ... then he should run away from under the kata in a panic.  I warned. <br><br>  Ps.  Everywhere, where I don‚Äôt call the Hogweed species explicitly (for example, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9">Hogweed</a> ), it is meant the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">Hogweb of Sosnowski</a> (and it is he, although almost everything can be projected onto the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8">Hogweb Matengazzi</a> , but for our country Sosnowski is more relevant) <br><br><h2>  The essence of the problem with cow parsnip </h2><br>  Aggressively fruitful.  Growing fast.  It occupies huge areas without paying rent (even in MO).  Hard to destroy.  Causes burns in contact with skin. <br><br>  No, not so: <b>CAUSES CHEETLY CHEMICAL BURNS</b> WHEN CONTACTING THE SKIN. <br><br>  And this is not a joke.  I have two children.  Naturally, I try to explain to them that you can‚Äôt touch unfamiliar plants.  But, until widespread hogweed, I would not particularly soared with how seriously they take my words.  I myself passed through both nettle burns and cut hands of sedge and spike injections of almost all prickly plants.  This is an experience for which all children pay the price.  And this price was relatively small, if you keep your eyes and do not taste the stems and roots.  You can not ban the child all - you can emphasize important prohibitions.  Then minor ones will be violated, and the consequences of their violations will only reinforce important prohibitions (but this is a topic for a separate article, which I do not plan to write).  Therefore, to Hogshevik. <br><br>  Burns from the Hogweed can easily lead to the hospital.  Heal for a very long time.  And most importantly - they can be obtained on the "level ground".  Just run for the ball or pass the "tightrope walker" on the curb.  The last "truestory".  This year, on Leninsky Prospekt, there was a focal ‚Äúseeding‚Äù of the hogweed Sosnovsky, and one plant grew 10 centimeters from the footpath.  Slogan: "Wear sandals and find out what is PAIN." <br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not plan to write an article on Hogweed and did not take pictures.  And it would be worth it.  Especially the epic frame, where the band of mowed grass comes to the half-harvested hogweed and stops.  The worker was lucky that the day was sunny and he did not finish the plot to the end.  After all, he could get on the skin, or even in the eyes, the juice from three more bushes of the hogweed. <br><br>  Let me start with a fairy tale.  To introduce the topic and talk about some of the features of the plant. <br><br><h2>  How hogweed in childhood offended </h2><br>  <i>An absolutely unscientific tale, instead of a background story.</i> <br><br>  In the good old days, high up in the mountains, carved leaves of a mountain sun and invigorating winds put a small, but very proud green sprout into the mountain sun.  He dreamed of growing tall, slim and beautiful.  And I must say he did it.  Nearly.  After all, its growth with great interest and favor was observed by frisky mountain goats, furry sheep and locals in high fur hats.  And it was worth the sprout to grow at least a little, like goats with sharp teeth, sheep with a sickly appetite, and mountaineers with daggers and bowls.  And everyone gnawed, chewed, chopped and chopped into a salad its carved leaves and a tall, proud stem. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Be careful, the tale is long!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Therefore, under the spoiler.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> Yes, yes, then our hero was not only not poisonous, but incredibly tasty.  No wonder, his name was hogweed, because it could be boiled, soared and consumed naturally, like most of his relatives (for example, hogweed sweet complements the salads of the inhabitants of the Far East to this day). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell!‚Äù Said the hogweed, ‚ÄúYou eat me, but I will not give up, I will grow every day and every night again.  And let you be ashamed! " <br><br>  Needless to say that his initiative was welcomed by both goats and sheep and people.  And they were not ashamed, rather tasty.  Especially goats.  The teeth of goats are arranged in such a way that they capture the upper layer of soil with grass, especially if the grass has nutritious roots.  And the root of the hogweed is delicious.  Therefore, he, and with it the lower rosette of leaves, seemingly slyly and tightly pressed to the ground, also became easy prey for goats. <br><br>  It would be a joint effort and would have eaten the last borsheviki.  But then an evil fairy came for a vitamin salad. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOm-nomn, what a delicious grass,‚Äù said the fairy, ‚Äúis full of vitamins.  It is necessary to use this grass more often, so that the forces are harmful ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut it won't work out!‚Äù - the hogweed gave a voice, - ‚ÄúThey will eat me soon, especially the goats.‚Äù <br><br>  Hogweed from his last strength hoped that the fairy would exorcise nasty goats.  But the goat fairy loved no less than vitamins.  And went the other way. <br><br>  "So grow faster, hide the kidneys from the goats deeper and be more active," said the fairy and waved her fork. <br><br>  And the hogweed did so, he hid dormant buds under the ground to the depth of the hoof.  And although it was eaten at the root, stubbornly grew.  He began to grow tens of thousands of seeds.  And even, ashamed to say, I learned to self-pollinate them.  So that the seeds did not fall where the happy goats and sheep were waiting for new shoots, the hogweed began to grow wings from the seeds, so that the mountain wind would take them away from impatient mouths.  If the hogweed felt that it would be eaten soon, then he did not try to grow big and beautiful, but quickly threw out the arrow with the seeds in order to have time to scatter his children around the world. <br><br>  And the evil magic of the fairy included essential oils in the seeds that did not harm the seeds of the Hogweed, but the seeds of other herbs that fell nearby had to be tight. <br><br>  But all this did not help.  The number of eaters only increased, and horshevik not so much.  Dexterous mountain goats even climbed the impregnable peaks of the cliffs, where the good wind threw seeds.  And happily shook beards, stuffing woolly abdomen. <br><br>  Hogweed was no longer pleased with the mountain wind and the bright mountain sun.  "So that you burned on it," he muttered, thinking of sheep, goats, and mountaineers.  And it is necessary for such a thing to happen that at this moment, for the vitamins, the evil fairy again came again.  This time in a state of hangover: <br><br>  "Hey!  Even few vitamins today, but I need to improve my health. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, it's all goats.  So they burned in the sun! ‚Äù- complained hogweed. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA window, a question!‚Äù Said the fairy (or so it was heard to the borshevik).  And hiccupped. <br><br>  And since then in the juice of hogweed flowed unclouded hatred, known to us as the furanocoumarins.  It is worth furanokumarin get someone on the skin and in the bright sun, the skin is covered with evil burns.  And the taste of cow parsnip, to put it mildly, has not improved - the leaves have become bitter. <br><br>  Despondency settled in the mountains.  Over which, finally, are stretched umbrellas, panicles on tall slender stems.  And the hogweed became proud and decided to let down from the mountains: to show himself, to look at others, and at the same time to become the sovereign of the world.  No sooner said than done.  Proudly poured his hogweed seeds from the mountains.  And carved little leaves and shot green shoots in the warm foothills ... And there ... And there they were already waiting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOm-nom nom!  What a tasty grass! ‚Äù- it was heard to the borshevik.  But it was not an evil fairy.  A little green weevil. <br><br>  <i>In fact, the author is not sure that it was a weevil, and whether he was at all.</i>  <i>But he is not very sure about the fairy either - it's a fairy tale.</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Shouted the hogweed, ‚ÄúBe careful, I'm with the furanocourains!‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúYeah, great!  Just a class!  Thank!  Om-nom-nom! ‚Äù- was heard from all sides. <br><br>  "Yes, I can not eat!" - Horshevik was indignant, losing confidence, leaves and shoots. <br><br>  "Come on.  You persecute! "- They responded to him -" You would be tied up by a friend, with furanocoumarins.  And then some garbage nesh!  Om-nom nom! " <br><br>  Triumphal descent from the mountains stopped, barely beginning.  Painfully horshevik mentally accepted at a party.  And immediately went on a return visit to the mountains.  In the mountains, however, the weevil did not like it: it was chilly there, especially in winter.  But the heat-loving weevil did not stop.  He stubbornly climbed higher and higher, sometimes rolling back for the winter.  But then he returned and continued to attack the tasty bushes with alluring furanocoumarins.  Already the goats began to laugh at the hogweed: ‚ÄúIt would be better if we ate you, it would be faster, me-ee-ee!‚Äù. <br><br>  And there is only a hogweed pair of bushes.  But, as you might guess, the fairy appeared again.  And again in the state that automatically makes this tale 12+. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI-ik.  Salad!  Only you now tasteless!  With these, like them, fu-ra-no-kuu, and-uk, na-mi! ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am delicious!‚Äù - hogweed frantically lied - ‚ÄúLook how weevil eats me!  What would he swell from hunger! " <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, if tasty, then okay!‚Äù, Said the fairy, tearing off a couple of leaves, ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt really distinguish between taste now.‚Äù  The fairy put the leaves in her mouth and munched loudly (don't forget, the fairy is evil). <br><br>  More in the fairy tale, we will not see a fairy.  Whether she poisoned the leaves.  Whether she went overseas.  Whether it was burned at the stake.  Either she herself burned someone at the stake and she was even given a monument with a torch for it.  The tale of that is silent.  For it does not matter. <br><br>  And it is important that now hogweed seeds need to become stratified in order to germinate.  This is not a swear word.  And it means that you need to hold the seeds in the cold (-5 - +2 C), in the presence of moisture, 30-50 days, otherwise there will be no seedlings. <br><br>  It turned out to be a very effective way.  Now the seeds of the Hogweed could not germinate in the warm foothills and the heat-loving weevil, after the warm winter there was nothing to eat.  But he could not survive the cold winter.  In the end, half of the weevil died out.  And the other half, wintering in warm lands, could not cope with the furanocoumarin addiction, and also died heroically from severe abstinence and hunger.  It's a pity.  This is almost the saddest thing in my fairy tale. <br><br>  Here I wanted to tell you about the socialist king, who believed in agricultural tales (a real fact).  But I decided that the volume of the article and so began to roll over (I wrote the tale in the least).  Therefore, briefly. <br><br>  After World War II, it was necessary to restore both agriculture and production.  And here and there it was difficult, but things were getting better, although there were not enough hands.  In order to free up these hands a little, some "brilliant scientists" pushed through the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmass planting of the magic fodder culture.  Unfortunately, she was not corn, but the hogweed Sosnovsky (To the credit of the researcher of the Caucasus Sosnovsky, he never found out that this crap was named after him). <br><br>  Hogweed was lowered from the mountains, breaking the stratification climate barrier.  And they tried to feed them cattle.  The taste of the ensiled hogweed was so-so, but if there was no choice, the cattle ate it.  The experiment seemed successful and the hogweed was powerfully implanted into the culture.  Including in the Baltic countries and Eastern Europe (where he is now called "Stalin's revenge"). <br><br>  Here are just meat and milk of animals that ate hogweed turned out to be bitter, and the offspring are sick.  As a result, spat on the hogweed.  Hogweed wiped, but not forgotten and revenge.  The fact that a huge poisonous parsley bred in industrial quantities. <br></div></div><br><h2>  Furancoumarins (furocoumarins) </h2><br>  The main danger of furanocoumarin is the "two-component" poison.  By itself, it is harmless (we do not take into account the probable mutagenicity of coumarins).  The plant juice with furanocoumarin gets on the skin, penetrates deep into the pores and ... waits for ultraviolet irradiation.  Sun, a quartz lamp of a sun deck or ordinary arc welding.  UV radiation is not completely retained by the skin, so it can penetrate quite deeply.  Where the furanocoumarin dug in.  The latter from UV light dies in terrible physicochemical reactions.  But at the same time, according to science, it emits both heat and decomposition products - chemical compounds (mainly radicals), which already damage the cells of the skin, epithelium and even muscles. <br><br>  Burns are more than unpleasant (like any chemical burn) and often have burn directions ‚Äúfrom the inside,‚Äù which makes it difficult to access for treatment.  In some cases, autoimmune reactions are activated.  When the site of a chemical catastrophe in the body run off to a heap of phagocytes.  And, from the awareness of their own helplessness, they begin to attack cells damaged by radicals, their neighbors, and in general anyone.  There are cases of damage to more than 80% of the body (it is enough to break into the bushes of a hogweed in a bathing suit), and this is a good start for death. <br><br>  The same reactions occur when coumarins fall into the eyes (children make ‚Äútelescopes‚Äù from the stems of the Hogweed).  This is the worst case, often leading to blindness. <br><br>  There are known (although I know of such cases from the press, sometimes after numerous ‚Äúquoting‚Äù) cases of burns of the mucous membrane, when spitting tubes and pipes were made from a hellish umbrella.  Up to lethal burns of the lungs and the digestive system occurred without the direct participation of ultraviolet radiation.  Perhaps due to the inhalation of coumarins already exposed to the sun or reactions with gastric hydrochloric acid.  I will be grateful if something knowledgeable will give comments about the mechanisms and real cases. <br><br>  But let's go back to the most common case - the defeat of the skin.  The danger is that in cloudy weather, it does not appear immediately.  You can "talk" with a hogweed, walk around for a few days in ignorance, and then go to the beach, from which you can go by ambulance.  And well, if it is clear that this is a chemical burn, and not "just burned in the sun."  Serious burns (an area larger than a couple of centimeters) must be treated!  And not sour cream with honey, and the doctor.  And heal faster and complications will be much less. <br><br>  Moreover, furanocoumarins are able to persist in the skin (and under it) for quite a long time.  From the analysis of the comments of the victims, we can assume a normal distribution with a peak of two months.  That is, with the defeat of a large amount of juice, a certain amount of coumarins are likely to remain in the organization for as long as two months.  In sufficient quantity to cause new burns or redness.  Some eyewitnesses claim that skin reactions persisted for six months or longer. <br><br>  It is clear that only for the use of furanocoumarins, the cowberry Sosnowski must be burned in hell, totally disintegrated or multiplied by zero in any other way.  Even in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãoriginal growth.  But there are some difficulties with this.  Moreover, I would say: Houston has problems. <br><br><h2>  How to destroy the hogweed </h2><br>  For any invasive species, the following properties are needed: mass reproduction, a wide range of growing areas, the absence of natural enemies and ... the complexity of human destruction.  All this is present in surplus of the hogweed Sosnovsky. <br><br>  Hogweed breeds well - of course, one plant does not always have 70K seeds (as is often mentioned) - on average six times less.  But this is quite enough.  Most of the seeds fall off near the mother plant, but some scatter a decent distance, due to low weight and good aerodynamics.  They are also unimpededly carried by animals, people, and cars (on wheels). <br><br>  In the experiments of <s>British</s> scientists, about 89% of seeds germinated in suitable conditions.  And there are lots of places with suitable conditions for the Hogweed, a fairly unblooded soil (he does not like wet soils).  And on poor and even trampled soils, the hogweed grows well.  It is not by chance that his victorious spread went along the roadsides.  There was an air corridor for seed distribution, and there were no competitors capable of stifling young growth.  And with all the other problems, the Hogweed Sosnovsky copes very well. <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  And the fact that one underdeveloped plant can very quickly infect the region "back." <br><br><h2>  About pests </h2><br>  As I said, the prehistoric weevil is shamefully extinct, and the horschwort mole is hilovata (so sickly that it didn‚Äôt even get into Wikipedia).  Plus, after the beloved hogweed, she eats up to zero a practically harmless common hogweed and snapped up with hunger on poor dill and carrots.  And if you can survive the last ... This is what pleases too many moths to guarantee the destruction of the hogweed, I am not happy. <br><br>  So, there is only one pest hogweed - man.  But he is not so easy to withdraw the invader. <br><br><h2>  Ways of destruction </h2><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  Any experiments on the destruction and study of the parsnip of Sosnowski should be carried out <b>in protective clothing</b> not directly adjacent to the body.  And, of course, in <b>protective glasses</b> .  Protective - it is not fashionable glasses, droplets.  At a minimum, the eyes should be completely blocked.  Unfortunately, I did not find information on how to disinfect clothes from juice.  There is an assumption that the coumarins themselves quickly decompose when dried.  Or rather, when dry, cannot penetrate the skin.  But I would not grab hold of clothes with fresh juice with my bare hands and other parts of the body. <br><br>  If the juice gets on the skin and especially the eyes, cover the affected area from the sun and rinse as quickly as possible with plenty of water.  Preferably not in the sun.  You can use the fact that the glass lets out a little UV and rinse indoors or car.  At least find a tight shadow for this.  After washing again isolate the affected area from the sun. <br><br><h3>  Mowing-mowing </h3><br>  The most inefficient and, of course, the most common way is mowing.  Even daily thorough mowing is ineffective.  Hogweed climbs and climbs.  In addition, the lower rosettes of leaves are located very close to the ground and it is not so easy to get them with a mower.  However, after 6‚Äì10 mowing, the hogweed can surrender.  If not entered the flowering phase.  Or maybe not.  I conducted mini experiments with trampling down the reptile.  Success is variable. <br><br>  In addition, mowing biennial plants (high reptiles), we open the way for the seeds lying in the ground.  Who could not survive under the leaves of adult plants, almost completely isolating the soil from the sun. <br><br><h3>  Digging up </h3><br>  It is better to combine a braid and a shovel.  After mowing, dig 10‚Äì15 centimeters, sharpening the apex of the root with sleeping buds.  Chopped up should be removed and beaten or burned.  I do not know whether the dug up hogweed can be reborn, but it is better not to risk it.  Any NF lover will confirm. <br><br><h3>  Mowing + </h3><br>  According to reviews of the Internet specialists in the fight against hogger, after mowing a portion of vinegar in the hollow stem tube works perfectly.  Greater concentration does not require 7‚Äì10% of vinegar enough for the aggressor to <s>falsely</s> root in wild agony.  And the root was deliciously marinated right in the ground.  I am inclined to consider this method as reliable. <br><br>  Also in the Internet it is recommended to pour kerosene and crude oil into the stem tube.  But this would not advise.  Such recipes are mostly given by very sophisticated and experienced people writing with aplomb and errors.  Yes, and in modern times, vinegar is cheaper and more environmentally friendly. <br><br>  It is also possible to <a href="https://habr.com/post/429736/">leap glyphosate</a> into the tube - about glyphosate is somewhat lower. <br><br><h3>  Exploits or lifehacks </h3><br>  If you want to be confused, you can use exploits in the behavior of a hogweed.  &gt; 99% instances of hogweed fruit only once.  It can be used.  The easiest way: cut off all the "brooms", except for one.  And the last to be determined in advance in a tied package, from which the seeds cannot get out ... And the plant will end its life in full confidence that it has not lived in vain.  A big mistake on the part of hell parsley (unless, of course, remember to burn the bag and spill the seeds).  Also, in order not to rummage through the thickets of a burning reptile with a ladder, it is recommended to pre-cut the stem at a height of up to a meter, just above the joint of the "joints".  Then new panicles will be at a convenient height for sabotage.  But it scares me 1% hogweed, which is not a monocarpic.  Those.  able to bloom and bear fruit more than once.  Did hogweed start to suspect something? <br><br><h3>  Agrotechnics </h3><br>  On an industrial scale helps disking.  That is, plowing, with the simultaneous grinding of plowed special agricultural technology.  Strength and dormant buds in the reptile at the root, and shredding works magically.  By the way, in the stems and roots of the Hogweed a little less than a fig of useful organic matter - therefore disking also fertilizes the earth (though there is probably still a lot of sleeping seeds in it, so it is possible that we fertilize the earth with the Hogweed for the Hogweed). <br><br>  Hogweed is also weak to germinate through the earth.  But it seems to me that raising the ground by 20-30 centimeters is a little expensive. <br><br>  You can also block access to the sun.  Strange as it may seem, a hogweed plant fails to pick up the usual dense black film on the stems, let alone sprout through it, and for growth it needs a lot of sun. <br><br>  Another often mentioned is the mythical thunder machine.  Which travels across the field and with a crash and a reconciliation disintegrates the seeds of the Hogweed by an electromagnetic field.  I would like proofs and statistics.  I haven't found anything.  Apparently, by <a href="https://habr.com/post/429736/">its laziness</a> . <br><br><h3>  Flooding of the territory </h3><br>  In the Baltics, the hogweed has gotten so much that they are flooded against it for 48+ days.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Weed does not like waterlogged soil and leaves in frustration. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Seeds are not good either. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For me, somehow expensive.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Expel sabzh to frost </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pass the </font></font><a href="http://proborshevik.ru/proekt-moroz"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">successful experiments</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> on the freezing of hogweed with all its seeds. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under the snow layer, even in the harsh Siberian winter, the temperature of the earth is not positive, but very close to zero. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Where the hogweed root sleeps sweetly, and its seeds happily stratify. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if the snow disappears suddenly, the hogweed will understand the difference between the Russian frost and the mild mountain winter, where the snow is purely nominal. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And he will have to understand quickly, at the same time remembering his entire (un) past life. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is also a difficult and costly way, but not bad mechanized.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Glyphosate. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Systemic herbicide</font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If I ask what is worse hogweed or </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">glyphosate</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , I find it difficult to answer.

But glyphosate does not like, which is almost its only useful property. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus glyphosate is that it is very effective against fast-growing plants. They are hostages of their strategy. No growth, and the plant does not know what to do. So it perishes in confusion.

It is necessary to spray in the spring, until the flowers and seeds are tied. Seeds are capable of ripening on a poisoned and even completely killed plant. In more serious sources it is advised to spray twice with a break, be sure to double or triple concentration. To be sure. And so as not to give the weed affected by glyphosate a chance to give offspring. Suddenly, it will be able to mutate into glyphosatase resistant (some types of weeds already perfectly put their pistils and stamens on glyphosate, although they only dried out on the way before). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I am for glyphosate ... as long as they are treated with something that is guaranteed to not get into my food, even in the second iteration. I do not intend to eat a hogweed and animals that ate a hogweed of Sosnovsky. The first is ineffective in terms of fighting cow parsnip, the second is even more inefficient.

And get ready to fight with Jerusalem artichoke after a couple of years (for which I bought, I sell for that). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Methods of studying topinambur are known from Wikipedia: it is necessary to dig up its thicket in late spring - early summer, during the period before the formation of young tubers. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If this does not help, then Jerusalem artichoke, at least, does not cause burns and blooms beautifully.</font></font><br><br>  Ps.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here and </font></font><a href="https://habr.com/users/arheops/" class="user_link"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">arheops </font></font></a> <a href="https://habr.com/post/429736/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">hints in the comments</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> that with Jerusalem artichoke is not so good and simple.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Patience </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You will need it. If you entered the war with a green reptile, then do not expect a quick victory. Where one seed of the hogweed has sprouted, one more can sleep and wait for its turn. And can sleep like a fairy tale, seven years. If the hogweed managed to grow and lose seeds, then this is ... a challenge. Within a radius of several meters from the fruited plant is more than 9K seeds. And many more scattered around the wind and overly confident birds in the area (the birds are sacredly sure that they can digest the seeds). It will seem to you: whatever you do, the hogweed grows. But often it is just that new seeds sprout.

With the Hogweed no one should fight (for war means mutual sacrifices). It must be systematically destroyed, eliminating all risks to their own health. And adults should do this. They should teach children how to recognize Hogweed, including at the "larval" stage. And to report on the found zaslatets adults. Who will come with a bucket and a shovel and explain their misconceptions with undesirable umbrellas.

Hogweed is one of the most effective honey plants (per unit area) with a great season. True, the pollen of cow parsnip, Sosnowski, is allergic and contains those coumarins. And the pollen goes into honey unhindered. But, either the bees know how to cook it, or the honey mafia carefully hides something ... I did not find any mention of honey poisoning from the hogweed. On the other hand, it is unlikely that they write honey borschivichny on packages. Therefore, it seems dumb to buy honey not only ‚Äúmeadow‚Äù, but also ‚Äúbuckwheat‚Äù. You never know there in a meadow or in Greek grew. I hope that the beekeepers and the honeymooners will run into the comments and calm everyone down. Except me. I do not care.
