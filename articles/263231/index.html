  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two reasons to install Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE now</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On July 29, we are going to launch the Microsoft Windows 10 wide market. Perhaps you, like me, have subscribed to receive it through the well-known icon in your current Windows tray.  In Windows 10, there are several interesting innovations, such as the new Microsoft Edge browser, Cortana voice assistant, the ‚Äúold familiar‚Äù Start menu, and a number of security improvements. <br><br>  So, in a week we upgrade?  - Wait!  Before upgrading the operating system, it is better not to forget to make a full backup.  After all, it also happens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00f/fcd/c62/00ffcdc623134272ad9d2abf750c6107.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Operating system upgrade - a complex process </h4><br>  Such an upgrade affects not only Microsoft products installed on your system, but also device drivers from various manufacturers (including those already out of production if the computer is older than a couple of years) and applications from various manufacturers.  Remember how it happened more than once with regular Windows updates: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/176523/">‚ÄúMicrosoft advises to refrain from installing the update MS13-036‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/233603/">‚ÄúMicrosoft releases a hotfix for updating MS14-051‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/233573/">‚ÄúMicrosoft advises to refrain from installing the update MS14-045‚Äù</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/190108/">‚ÄúMicrosoft withdraws MS13-061 "</a> , - and with the upgrade to Windows 10, given the scale of the process, the more so something can go wrong.  Therefore, it will be reasonable to preoccupy in advance with the possibility to roll back if an important problem occurs during the update.

      A full backup of the entire computer can be done, for example, using the free product <a href="http://www.veeam.com/ru/endpoint-backup-free.html">Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE</a> (installed and configured in two clicks: see the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/veeam/blog/261481/">overview on Habr√©</a> ).  Separately, it is worth mentioning that the product has the ability to create bootable media (USB flash drives or CD / DVD) with system recovery tools - in case the computer stops booting from the hard disk. <br><br>  Perhaps you will have a reasonable question: how compatible is Veeam Endpoint Backup 1.0 with Windows 10, which has not yet been released?  Formally, Veeam Endpoint Backup 1.0, if it is installed in your system at the time of the start of the upgrade to Windows 10, will not be able to automatically start working after completing the process of updating the operating system, because its configuration files VeeamBackup.mdf and VeeamBackup_log.ldf are located in the folder The% WinDir% \ System32 \ Config \ SystemProfile will be moved by the Windows 10 installer to the Windows.old folder along with other files of the old system.  However, there is an easy way to bring the product back to work: just copy the configuration files back (the other day we will publish an official knowledge base article on this topic).  In addition, the release of Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE 1.1, which will be fully compatible with Windows 10, is just around the corner (mid-August). The reason for the delay is that we declare our product compatible with this or that new operating system only after official release, as the release version of the operating system may always be different from the previously released preliminary, evaluation or beta versions.  Therefore, only on July 29, our testing department will be able to start final testing of the product with Windows 10. And, only after its approval, we will release Veeam Endpoint Backup FREE 1.1, which will officially be compatible with Windows 10. We expect this to happen in mid-August . <br><br>  In the meantime, let me introduce a small ‚Äúteaser‚Äù of the future release: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/952/6bf/964/9526bf9641d2478aaaf879a224f85652.png"><br><br><h4>  2. There is no alternative to automatically install Windows 10 updates. </h4><br>  So, the upgrade of the operating system to Windows 10 was successful - can you breathe a sigh of relief?  Wait a while to delete Veeam Ednpoint Backup!  Recall that Microsoft announced that, starting with Windows 10, operating system updates will be downloaded and installed automatically, and this cannot be waived (for example, see the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/259341/">‚ÄúMicrosoft will force users to update Windows 10‚Äù</a> ).  Only users of the corporate edition of Windows 10 Enterprise will be able to postpone the installation of updates, and the vast majority of users will not have such an opportunity.  In fact, the operating system will provide the following options for the user's choice: <br><ul><li>  Download, automatically install and reboot (when idle) </li><li>  Download, automatically install and select reboot time </li></ul><br>  Not as flexible as before, is it?  How bad is it?  In my opinion, in general, this is correct, because it guarantees greater security, and I will have to manually update the household computers less manually :) <br><br>  However, sometimes installing updates leads to critical operating system malfunctions, such as a sudden system shutdown (for example, it was with MS13-036), file corruption, or even the inability of a computer to boot up (for example, it was with KB 2982791 and KB 2970228, see the article " <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2608894/microsoft-windows/users-find-fix-for-botched-kb-2982791-and-kb-2970228-windows-update.html">Users find fix for botched KB 2982791 and KB 2970228 Windows update</a> "). <br><br>  It can be concluded that, since updates in Windows 10 become mandatory and automatic, the daily backup of the system becomes simply necessary ‚Äî after all, apart from the above-described potential problems with updates, there are also threats for your data from viruses, equipment failures, power surges and etc. <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  The release of Windows 10 is nearing - a system that will bring many new and interesting features.  On the other hand, the technological complexity of the upgrade process, and the automation of installing subsequent updates, can sometimes lead to significant disruptions in work, as has happened more than once.  So now is the time to set up a daily backup of the entire system! <br><br>  Of course, in this post I didn‚Äôt say anything fundamentally new for Habr's reader ‚Äî not in terms of describing possible problems, or in terms of possible solutions ‚Äî this post is intended to simply remind you that right now, on the eve of Windows 10, your system will <a href="http://www.veeam.com/ru/endpoint-backup-free.html">straws "</a> ... <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Knowledge base article about restoring Veeam Endpoint Backup after upgrading the operating system to WIndows 10: <a href="http://www.veeam.com/kb2057">KB_2057</a> (English). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263231/</a></p>
