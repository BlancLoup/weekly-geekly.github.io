Boeing knows this and therefore has tried to provide passengers with such comfort as they cannot feel on any other aircraft. <br>  <font color="gray">Collective translation to <b><a href="http://translated.by/you/boeing-s-787-is-as-innovative-inside-as-outside/into-ru/trans/">translated.by</a></b></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The aerospace company decided that the newest aircraft should have the newest interior, and made every effort so that the interior was as modern as the fuselage, aerodynamics and liner engines.  The air that you breathe, the turbulence that you (not) feel, the windows in which you look, all the sensations at each stage of the flight - all this promises to be completely different. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen you go inside the 787, you get the wow!‚Äù, Says analyst Scott Hamilton, who happened to see the demonstration interior of a Boeing at a factory near Seattle. <br><br>  You understand that the Boeing 787 is something new, at the moment you step on board.

As soon as you step aboard this liner of a dream, immediately behind the door you will see an open space.  Blue LEDs are built into the ceiling, creating the illusion of the sky overhead. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThey designed a semblance of a living room instead of a galley,‚Äù says Hamilton.  ‚ÄúIt really makes the setting cozy without creating the feeling that you are entering someone‚Äôs kitchen.‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, the final decision about what you have to see, remains for the airlines - the owners of the aircraft.  Some of them may well re-equip the cabin and other features of the aircraft.  But even if they spoil everything completely, there will be a lot of impressive new products in the cabin of the 787th. <br><br>  One of the most remarkable features of the aircraft is the interior lighting.  Anyone who has ever flown through several time zones knows what it is like to sleep in flight and be woken up with the flick of a switch, after which the cabin is filled with fluorescent white light.  Boeing LEDs allow the crew to adjust the intensity of illumination according to different phases of flight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b2/e30/b91/4b2e30b918e7667f9800104627eac813.jpg" alt="Interior lighting" align="right">  During landing and during flight, the light is fairly ordinary.  During the meal, it becomes warmer.  As soon as you have finished your meal and want to sit back and relax, the salon will be filled with relaxing lavender tones.  When it comes time to take a nap, the light is almost completely extinguished.  However, there is nothing more remarkable than how onboard lighting will wake you up. <br><br>  Instead of instantly lighting the entire cabin, the brightness will slowly increase, moving from the purple and orange shades of the sunrise to yellow and, finally, to white daylight against the sky.  According to the Boeing plan, the lighting will correspond to the current time of day at your destination, which will mitigate the effects of the flight on an airliner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abe/cd7/00a/abecd700afa6506d27762c9f02599864.jpg" alt="Dining lighting" align="right">  Sleep Time Reveals Another Innovation.  Your dream will no longer be disturbed by the passenger in the next chair by the window, if he wants to raise the porthole curtain to look again at the Pacific Ocean, and thereby fill the cabin with sunlight.  The windows of the 787th have no curtains.  They use electrochromic shading system.  With the switch, you can let the desired amount of light into the cabin or remove it completely.  Of course, the main switch is the crew.  Thus, your neighbor will not be able to let more light into the cabin than is necessary for a quick glance at the Pacific Ocean and disturb other people in the cabin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3b/fea/a9d/d3bfeaa9d68aca4a1ff292380eb4f2ee.jpg" alt="Quiet hour" align="right">  Nevertheless, he will certainly like the view from the portholes, since in the 787th their sizes were increased by 65% ‚Äã‚Äãcompared to other aircraft.  Boeing made them elongated so that both children and NBA players (basketball players) could enjoy the view as much as ordinary passengers. <br><br>  Boeing seriously approached the way passengers feel inside the cabin.  Admit it - you are sitting in a pipe.  The fuselage is 5.8 meters wide, and this is all the space that is available to you.  In the first class there is usually a greater sense of space, but Boeing wants all passengers to feel at ease on board the aircraft. <br><br>  To achieve this, the designers of Boeing gave him an open, airy design.  This is another reason for the presence of illumination in it, similar to heaven. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe ceiling was designed in the shape of an arch to give the cabin a greater sense of space than is typical of an ordinary plane,‚Äù says Hamilton. <br><br>  Even the luggage racks have been redesigned.  Due to the fact that the price of luggage delivery has increased, and many passengers do not want to part with their belongings during the flight, Boeing made the shelves 30 percent more.  Luggage has become easier to load, due to the fact that the shelves are lowered when opened and then returned to their original position if you push them up.  This should make life easier for people who do not know what kind of baggage is suitable for transportation on the shelf, and also help all other passengers to compactly pack their belongings on the shelf without blocking the passage between the rows of seats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f1/f5a/4b5/3f1f5a4b5947257c8e867afb6f9dea0f.jpg" alt="Layout of the interior of the Boeing 787" align="left">  The composite structure of the 787th makes this airliner of dreams easier and improves its aerodynamic properties, which is an undoubted benefit to the airlines.  In addition, the use of composite materials means that the body of the aircraft is less susceptible to corrosion.  And this, in turn, will allow to increase the humidity of the air inside the cabin and save passengers from feeling dry in the mouth after a long flight. <br><br>  And again, thanks to the composite materials of the fuselage, it will be possible to increase the pressure inside the cabin.  This means that the pressure in the cabin will correspond to the pressure at an altitude of 2 kilometers, instead of the actual 2.5 kilometers.  Together, these factors will allow passengers to breathe more freely, reduce the number of headaches, heal the symptoms of the flight, such as fatigue and other signs of poor health. <br><br>  Another factor causing headaches and general irritation is noise, especially if you are sitting next to the engines.  New gear gondolas for engines of the 787th will allow to lower noise level both for passengers, and for observers from the earth over which the airliner will fly.  Even the blades of the propellers inside the engines were designed for quieter operation. <br><br>  One of the most innovative systems providing comfort for passengers on the 787th is the computer-controlled turbulence suppression system.  Boeing says its smooth-flight technology (Smoother Ride Technology) will reduce the number of rocked passengers by eight times.  Special sensors are located throughout the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe aircraft that capture changes in air pressure, and this is one of the signs of turbulence.  Based on the readings from the sensors, the computer system adjusts the position of the flaperones to suppress the vertical oscillation of the aircraft.  This system will not save us from all the troubles, but Boeing claims that this will significantly reduce the impact on passengers of moderate turbulence, most often causing airborne illness. <br><br>  According to Hamilton, all these technologies will allow the 787 to leave competitors far behind.  He also argues that if you are familiar with the typical interior of the current aircraft, you will not miss it.  Even the most modern interiors do not bear comparison with the new Boeing. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAirbus completely redesigned the interior of the A320 in 2007,‚Äù says Hamilton.  ‚ÄúBut he still has a secular look.  It is very good, but it is worth visiting inside the 787th, and you will be shocked. ‚Äù <br><br>  The new interior will give happiness in the new year and airlines.  From the portholes to the toilets and everything in between, the 787's interior was designed to be easier to clean and cheaper to repair. <br><br>  The launch of the dream liner was delayed by two years, and the Boeing company lost orders for the plane because of this delay.  But Hamilton and others say that as soon as the test flights are completed and the first passengers make the flight on a new plane, most of the bad memories will fade.  Although there may still be a few minor flaws revealed before the scheduled launch, this does not diminish Hamilton‚Äôs confidence that both the airlines and future passengers of the aircraft will appreciate the design. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe Boeing company is preparing to launch the real winner,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Whether it will turn out in reality, we will know in nine months, when the first passengers board the plane.  Boeing 787 will make its first commercial flight under the auspices of the Japanese company All Nippon Airways. <br><br>  <b>ADD1</b> <a href="http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search%3Faircraft_genericsearch%3DBoeing%2520787-8%2520Dreamliner%26distinct_entry%3Dtrue">Photo Boeing 787 outside</a> , by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/proc/" class="user_link">proc</a> <br>  <b>ADD2</b> First flight video by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/konstantinsolomatov/" class="user_link">KonstantinSolomatov</a> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fxg08M76RfA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgTyBr1n3-lvZiQ3XL9ueVuMU1qOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80173/</a></p>
