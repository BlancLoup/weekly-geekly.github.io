Today we have to keep in mind the information about a large number of acquaintances who may be offended if you do not greet them by name at the meeting. <br><br>  Significantly increased the number of incoming streams of information.  For example, each of our friends constantly generates new facts about themselves.  And there are people whose fate we are closely following, even without the opportunity to meet in person - these are politicians, bloggers, artists.

      Quantity does not always turn into quality.  World famous persons often generate continuous information noise, which does not affect our real life.  The more interesting it is to try to isolate from the white noise the voices of those who can see further and understand more than others. <br><br>  In the era of an excess of meaningless knowledge, futurologists' voices can be useful for finding new trends and understanding the mechanics of the great gears that revolve the world.  Below you will find links to the accounts of the most relevant to date visionaries of the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <a href="https://twitter.com/kurzweilainews">Raymond Kurzweil</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bt/us/8c/btus8c8ei9n10dlyb8w35fx5lvq.jpeg"><br><br>  Bill Gates called Raymond Kurzweil "the best of those I know, in predicting the future of artificial intelligence."  Not without reason, the famous futurologist since 2012 has held the position of technical director in the field of machine learning and natural language processing at Google. <br><br>  Kurzweil believes that even during the lifetime of the current generation, a singularity will be achieved that will allow humanity to rise to a new level of evolutionary existence. <br><br>  A symbiosis with strong artificial intelligence will help us to reach the next stage of the evolutionary ladder.  In fact, the singularity will erase the differences between human and artificial intelligence. <br><br>  According to Kurzweil, such intractable problems like climate change, lack of resources, disease, and even death will be eliminated by singularity. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://twitter.com/michiokaku">Michio Kaku</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/tn/ir/zstnir3jihbc9akirszjfp4arr0.jpeg"><br><br>  A theoretical physicist, popularizer of science with an incredibly wide range of interests - from black holes to brain research. <br><br>  Michio Kaku is one of the co-authors of string theory.  He has published over 70 scientific articles on the theory of superstrings, supergravity, supersymmetry, and elementary particle physics.  The ardent supporter of the Multiverse - the theory of the existence of many parallel universes.  Kaku suggests that the Big Bang occurred when several universes collided or when one universe was divided into two. <br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.jaronlanier.com/">Jaron Lanier</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h6/mv/ox/h6mvoxmea64sio4l7t78cy9velk.jpeg"><br><br>  Back in the 1980s, Lanier developed the first glasses and gloves for immersion in virtual reality.  Actually, he coined the term VR. <br><br>  Currently working at Microsoft, deals with the problems of data visualization.  Periodically appears in the media as an expert in technopessimism and the author of the book "Ten Arguments in favor of deleting your accounts in social networks right now." <br><br>  For obvious reasons, does not lead pages in social networks, so we give a link to a personal site. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://twitter.com/harari_yuval">Yuval Noi Harari</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kk/mr/o0/kkmro0hwainakm8xsp1enqdvyt8.jpeg"><br><br>  Israeli military historian specializing in the European Middle Ages.

Dee Gray seeks to significantly increase the life expectancy of people so that death is a thing of the past. <br><br>  Aubrey Dee Gray began his career as an AI / software engineer in 1985.  Since 1992 he has been engaged in research in the field of cell and molecular biology at the Department of Genetics at the University of Cambridge. <br><br>  In 1999 he published a book titled ‚ÄúMitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging‚Äù, where he first outlined the key idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis further scientific research: prevention and repair of damage accumulated by the body during aging (in particular, in mitochondrial DNA), which should help people live much longer. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://twitter.com/neurobongo">David cox</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fn/4k/6v/fn4k6vqfffs5gtwtnqruwvi303y.jpeg"><br><br>  Director of the laboratory MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, which is part of the largest industrial research organization in the world - IBM Research.
