  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AOL hassle: the main thing - do not fall in price</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the new boss came to AOL - <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/21/AR2006112101328.html">Randy Falco</a> from NBC - many company executives leave it (or plan to leave), which is not surprising given such an abrupt change in power.  At the same time they talk informally about what happened to the former chief executive, John Miller (Jon Miller).  At the moment, it is obvious that the source of information are people from his inner circle.  According to them, the unexpected appointment of Falco can only mean one thing: AOL will be separated and sold over the next year.  They do not believe that Falco has intentions to really focus on developing new products and to become as familiar to online services as Miller began to become, and without this it‚Äôs impossible to do if the company is going to compete with Yahoo and Google. <br><br>  The same sources add that the intrigue of raising Falco actually comes down to personal confrontation between Miller and Falco.  It was probably planned that Falco would come to the company to become the second person after Miller, but neither one nor the other had a high opinion of his counterpart, and when he had to decide the issue radically, the victory was left for Falco.  According to some reports, he was greatly helped by his former deputy from NBC, David Zaslav, who was certainly interested in leaving Falco, as it allowed him to terminate the contract with NBC and become the <a href="http://corporate.discovery.com/news/press/06q2/111606.html">new executive director of Discovery</a> .  It is said that a rumor was launched in the press that the question of Miller‚Äôs resignation had already been resolved, and that Falco would come to his place in AOL (Miller had learned from his journalist what a nightmare he had about his dismissal!), And this rumor was used as a source of information on NBC.  Games of the titans ... Very entertaining. </div>
