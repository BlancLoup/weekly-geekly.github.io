      We bought a new smartphone, laptop, camera - went to <a href="http://www.moiveshi.ru/">My Things</a> and said, "I am the owner."  Now you are in touch with other owners! <br><br>  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a service has been in the air for a long time, and the fact that it was needed is obvious.  After all, there are many websites ‚Äúhelping to buy‚Äù - various catalogs, aggregators of prices, reviews, etc.  And they all focus on the ‚Äúpre-purchase‚Äù situation. <br><br>  And what about ‚Äúafter purchase‚Äù?  When the cherished box is already at home - for the buyer the most interesting thing at this moment is just beginning. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Many people buy the same models of laptops, televisions, cameras and other goods.  And of course, communication with other owners of the same thing helps to understand everything, set up in the best possible way, and solve possible problems. <br><br>  But a single universal service, allowing owners of the same things to be in direct communication with each other, has not yet been.  Previously, other owners had to search "somewhere on the Internet", and useful knowledge - to collect "piece by piece" on dozens of different sites and forums. <br><br>  Now - we have done My Things. <br><br><h5>  What we have more interesting, what I would like to draw attention to: </h5><ul><li>  <b>We abandoned the traditional feedback system.</b>  Because we consider it ineffective.  Instead, we offer our own solution: an interactive block of pros and cons, which allows you to conveniently structure all the advantages and disadvantages of a thing.  <i>Here, for example, the pros / cons and opinions of the owners of the <a href="http://www.moiveshi.ru/id15855/nikon_d7000/plusminus/">Nikon D7000 SLR</a> .</i>  <i>See how convenient it is: all the most important things can be understood in seconds.</i>  The ability to add your opinion in a free form (your subjective sensations from the thing), in addition to the pros / cons, of course, is also there - for this special field My opinion.  Moreover, the published opinions of the owners can be commented on - ask an additional question or clarify something. <br></li><li>  <b>Exchange tips.</b>  We have made a separate section for advice on each item.  If you have something to advise other owners, write to this section, and other owners will receive a notification that a new advice has been published.  How to connect, configure, learn?  What tricks you need to know?  And other useful knowledge. <br></li><li>  <b>Tape.</b>  Usually a person has more than one thing, but several things ‚Äî a phone, a camera, a laptop, a Wi-Fi router, and much more.  When you are marked as the owner of many different things from various categories, in order to read new records about them, you do not need to open the page for each thing separately.  All new entries about all your things are displayed in a single tape, similar to the usual friendliness in a blog or a tape in a social network. <br></li><li>  <b>Ads buy / sell.</b>  Tired of an old laptop?  Or want to sell your iPhone 4 before you buy a new iPhone 4s?  This can also be done on our website - place your ads for buying / selling on the pages of things you want to sell. </li></ul><h5>  Appeal to Habrachiteli </h5><br>  We chose Habr as the place for the first big announcement of the project, because we know and appreciate the Habr audience - as people who can understand the idea and the ‚Äúmotion vector‚Äù, make constructive comments, maybe something to advise. <br><br>  We have already received confirmation that we are moving in the right direction - the site has never been advertised anywhere, however, every day we register new users - simply from among those who accidentally come to us on Yandex and Google.  For us, this is already an important assessment of the relevance of what we are doing and how. <br><br>  Join now!  We are sure that our project will be of interest to you not only as a new site in the consumer web segment, but also really useful in everyday life, and we will be happy to answer your questions and comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130311/</a></p>
