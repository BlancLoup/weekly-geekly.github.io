But about the player it really goes!  <b>Review, traffic.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The <b>NEXX</b> company has been widely known to the public since about 2002, and the roots of this company are growing from the well-known Hong Kong [and whose roots are not growing right now from those edges?  ] - since then, the company owns a good piece of the pie market multimedia devices.  Devices produced by the company (MP3-players, navigation systems, DVD-players) never eagerly asked for money for the name, but to say that the company works only in the budget segment means to offend the company.  And if you read other reviews, the price-to-quality ratio is observed almost everywhere, which in most cases is the golden mean.  Stability is a sign of excellence.

    <img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4551.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today I will talk about the experience of communicating with the latest player from the Flash MP3 line. <br><br><h3>  Equipment </h3><br>  Inside the box (the size of a VHS cassette) were: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4554.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Flash MP3 player Nexx NMP-280; <br>  - Headphones; <br>  - Pads on the headphones; <br>  - Wire to connect the player to the computer; <br>  - CD with software; <br>  - Documentation. <br><br>  Black pearl in a shell: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4556.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4557.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very nice to see the documentation ONLY in Russian - it is strange that often many manufacturers of hardware (and not only) forget about the largest state and about the most powerful.  The manual itself is worth a separate pair of lines.  Firstly, in some chapters there are small introductory texts, well, for example, what firmware is, why and how to change it - thanks to such a mathematical part, even a first grade student will not have any questions.  Everything is painted in great detail, but, at the same time, without excess water, where necessary - there are illustrations. <br><br>  The disk contains drivers for Win9x and the program <b>AVI Converter</b> .  In Win 2K / XP / ... no drivers are needed (unless, of course, you deleted the contents of the dllcache folder) - when connected, the player becomes a separate disk, which you can work with as with a regular USB flash drive. <br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  The size of the device is 88 √ó 57x12 mm, which is very attractive.  Initially, a protective transparent film is pasted on the front of the player.  Black glossy plastic.  God forgive me for the comparison of the gods) but the player is very similar to a smaller iPhone, which does not have a control button.  On the front panel of the player there are no bumps or irregularities - nothing that could distract.  There is not even a label, and this is very strange - for many manufacturers, the tenfold mention of their own name on the device is much more important than anything else.  I like this design :) The surface itself is quite marking - it is a pity that the manufacturer did not take care of the further aesthetic appearance of the device and did not put a wipe cloth in the kit. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4579.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All-metal parts of the device are chrome-plated metal insert, resulting in a fashionable combination of black color and metallic luster.  Everything is good, only this insert, like the front panel, tends to accumulate prints on itself. <br>  We turn the player.  Yeah, here is the label - on the rubberized ‚Äúbottom‚Äù in the very center there is an inscription NEXX, below which the model, volume and so on are written.  To the right of this inscription is an external speaker.  Around the perimeter of the lower part of the device there are small gray inscriptions that tell about the purpose of the elements located on the ends of the device.  <b>Rec</b> &gt; <b>Hold</b> &gt; <b>Play</b> / <b>Pause</b> / <b>Power</b> &gt; <b>Menu</b> &gt; <b>¬±</b> <b>Prev</b> / <b>Next</b> &gt; <b>Reset</b> &gt; <b>T-Flash</b> &gt; <b>Mic</b> .  Something is not clear?  Everything will be now! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4600.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left side there is a hole for attaching the lace on the player [I did not have it in the kit, although it is listed as a complete set.  On the other hand, on page 7 of the manual it is clearly stated that the manufacturer reserves the right to change the characteristics of the device and the delivery set without prior notice.  Therefore, if anything, it is better to check the current configuration on the product page ... the main thing is for the player to be placed))].  Next is the <b>Rec</b> button, which includes the recording function - yes, the player can also be used as a voice recorder.  If you read the instructions, you can learn about the purpose of this button in other modes.  The <b>Hold</b> switch (times) locks the device. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4589.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the top end are the main player control buttons.  The very first is responsible for (s) turning on the device - after 2 seconds of holding the player in (s) is turned on.  A short press pauses playback and pauses it again.  The <b>Menu</b> button allows you to activate additional options in different modes, but the long-term hold opens the main menu.  Then there are four buttons combined into two ‚Äúrockers‚Äù - volume and switching tracks - the same buttons navigate through the menu. <br>  On the right side, as I said, there is a fairly quiet external speaker, a reset hole, an expansion slot for a microSD card, and a microphone.  Underneath it all is 3.5mm-miniJack. <br><br>  I almost forgot about connecting the player to the computer - it is carried out only through the bundled wire.  Unfortunately, this is not a standard USB-miniUSB-B cable, but a rather specific connector that I have never met before.  The wire is inserted into the player quite tight, but for sure.  Then it connects to the computer, after which it automatically starts charging.  It turns out that if you go traveling, you will have to search for a player not for a socket, but for a free USB port. Why it was impossible to use the wire just mentioned is not clear, but with what it is, the player loses some versatility. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4561.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the program <b>HD Tune Pro 3.10, the</b> player was defined as a regular carrier, the speed characteristics of which are as follows: <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nexx.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/nexx2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The diagonal of the TFT display is almost 3 inches, to be more precise - 2.83 ‚Äù.  The resolution - 320x240 - is the same as that of my next-lying PDA;) The screen displays up to 65000 colors, it is very bright and the text reads normally in the light. <br><br><h3>  Turning on </h3><br>  As I said, it all starts with a two-second hold button in the switch (s). <br>  A short screensaver, after which the main menu appears, consisting of 8 elements (each of which is assigned a large icon): music, video, radio, photos, text, games, recording, and settings. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4727.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Initially it is difficult, looking at the screen, to control the buttons, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof which you still do not remember, and the first time I always turned the player on the opposite side.  But very soon I got used to the location of the buttons and, I must say, the navigation was very convenient.  It is necessary to sacrifice something - minimalism on the front panel and 15 minutes of getting used to navigation, or navigation with signatures on the front panel. <br>  In the upper left of the screen is always written mode, in which you are in the right - the battery charge and volume level. <br><br><h4>  Music </h4><br>  Unfortunately, the player only supports MP3 and WMA formats, but many users no longer need it.  When you start the player, immediately starts the last track to be played.  The type of player is very familiar, quite informative.  When you press the Menu button once, a list of files opens, which is nice - even with fully clogged memory, it happens almost without brakes.  Rewinding the track to any place also passes calmly. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4730.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The sound power per channel is 10 mW, the frequency range - 20 Hz - 20 kHz, the signal-to-noise ratio is 85 dB.  There are 8 equalizer presets, you can create your own. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Only AVI format is supported.  Included with the player is a special program for converting, very convenient. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4734.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Initially, a good quality demo video was recorded on the player.  Later in the program from the disk I convert a couple of clips, like how a narrow-eyed Chinese plays nunchucks in tennis - classmates check out :) The video is played without jerks or some other quirks, like music, rewind quickly and without problems.  Well implemented function, well done - it is quite possible to brighten up leisure or travel time. <br><br><h4>  Radio </h4><br>  I liked the radio too.  More precisely, how it is organized.  I don‚Äôt have to listen to the radio, so I don‚Äôt remember a single frequency - I used the autosearch stations.  On the range from 87 to 108 MHz, the player found about 20 stations, which he arranged in a convenient form for navigation - in frequency.  You need to switch between them with the Prev-Next keys, the Rec button allows you to record the air.  The necessary radio stations can be saved, but not more than 30 pieces. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4737.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a manual tuning in 0.5 MHz increments.  It is a pity that the station name is not displayed.  Work with the radio is possible only with inserted headphones. <br><br><h4>  A photo </h4><br>  You can watch photos in JPG format.  There are no settings (except for selecting the desired file from the memory) in this mode - neither zoom, nor rotation, nor effects - a simple enough bright slide show and that's it.  Simultaneously, looking at the photo and listening to music is impossible. <br><br><h4>  Text </h4><br>  The player makes it possible to read texts in TXT format, I did not have any problems with the encoding.  There are no settings either - white text on a black background, a little higher - a slider showing the percentage of "reading".  Well, except that, even the scrolling speed With the Rec button you can bookmark, and the Menu button allows you to select the available documents.  While reading you can listen to music. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4733.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Games </h4><br>  We have a simple Tetris, which is very inconvenient to manage.  IMHO, too much.  Good thing not a helicopter simulator :) <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4732.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Record </h4><br>  In the main menu of the player there was a place under the recorder icon.  The sound is recorded in WAV, the quality can be adjusted.  Shows the recording time, the time for which enough free memory.  You can exit the record only by holding the Rec button and nothing else. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4738.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Settings </h4><br>  There are a lot of settings and all of them are divided into categories - music, radio, recording, display, viewing, system and off time.  Enumerate all the settings does not make sense, but a couple of them I will call them.  Available in 13 interface languages, 5 levels of display brightness and two backlight modes (normal and economy).  Multiple music playback modes - there are plenty to choose from. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4731.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The manufacturer promises about 15 hours of continuous playback.  However, with the backlight often turned on, at maximum volume, the player lasted for me 4 Univer pairs + travel time back and forth, which amounted to a total of about 12 hours.  In the video mode, they promise about 4 hours of work, but I have not yet checked this parameter.  In principle, it is quite possible to trust this figure. <br>  When the battery is discharged, the player displays a low charge message and then turns off.  Being on the charge, the picture is displayed on the screen all the time, although it would be more practical to make it possible to fully use the player.  Some inconvenience is caused by the absence of a charge indicator on the screen. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4893.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A full charge cycle takes about 3 hours. <br><br><h3>  Fish soup! </h3><br>  I once had players - iriver, ipod, kovon.  Almost everywhere, the ears that went in the kit, did not stand out anything special.  In the iPod, there was a medium power fountain, the ear curls ached from the Iriver ovids, and in the coon x5 they wheezed already on 30 loudness divisions out of 40. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/uho.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Therefore, I have long been reconciled with the fact that, buying a player, you need to immediately take something from the plugs.  And, honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect anything special from the included headphones.  However, what I heard this time, I was somewhat pleased.  At maximum volume, I did not notice any artifacts, the sound was clear and very juicy, there were even some bass.  For a person who is not able to distinguish sound through ordinary wires and wires made of oxygen-free copper - that‚Äôs what we need.  Headphones are black, big enough, but they got into my radar easily. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_4572.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The length of the wire perfectly suited me - in a pocket on jeans it easily reaches under a T-shirt without tension, without forming tangles inside. <br>  Later I tried the player with <b>Audio Fischer Equilibrium</b> and <b>Sony MDR-EX90LP plugs</b> - just great!  Jumping on the Aviamotor barrage at the last car, under ‚Äú <b>DJ Fresh (feat Mary Byker) - Nervous</b> ‚Äù ( <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/6817579000/DJ%2520Fresh%2520-%2520Nervous%25202.mp3.html">mp3</a> ) at maximum volume, I almost started to dance on the escalator :) And the track ‚Äú <b>The Qemists - Stompbox (Spor Remix)</b> ‚Äù ( <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/6817539000/The%2520Qemists%2520-%2520Stompbox%2520(Spor%2520remix).mp3.html">mp3</a> ) caused abundant salivation and involuntary jumps with legs-hands) By the way, taking this opportunity, I recommend these tracks to fans of dnb-sausage. <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  This is no longer a simple flash player without a screen, but also not a food processor with a camera, Wi-Fi and a touch screen.  This is an affordable solution that can replace more than one device.  By the way, the touch screen would be superfluous here and here's why.  The device is designed for active use, and listening to music, it will probably lie somewhere in your pocket.  In this case, it would be impossible to use the touch screen, therefore, in this case, the hardware buttons are more than justified - you can switch tracks directly in your pocket.  If you look at videos or movies on the player, then the player will always be visible, and it is unlikely that you will often need to press something on the screen - once set to play and ready.  In addition, the touch screen would significantly increase the cost. <br><br>  Almost everyone liked the device, but still, I would like to see something in the future.  Since the player is able to play videos, it is a shame to limit one format only - I want to add at least the FLV format.  I connected the player to the computer, as I downloaded the downloaded videos from YouTube to the USB flash drive and watch-show. <br>  Clock.  I‚Äôve been used to controlling time for a long time, and in order to know it, I have to additionally climb into my pocket and watch time on the PDA.  But surely this problem can be solved by adding only one setting ‚Äî it showed the time at the first start and let it be displayed somewhere in the corner of the screen.  New firmware, you are welcome!  ) For a slot under the card it would be nice to make a plug - it is possible that dust gets into the case.  A standard USB-miniUSB wire would be much more practical and versatile. <br><br>  As a final part of the review - a small video review. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UiXiEGCVHUA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhZHBWqYrndwGp3SIImnB_7siv0QA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  Check weighing </h3><br>  <u><b>Minuses</b></u> <br>  - Mark faceplate; <br>  - From music plays only MP3, WMA and WAV; <br>  - Non-standard connector; <br>  - Charging only from the computer;  nothing can be done while charging; <br>  - Quiet external speaker (but still, it‚Äôs more a player than a tape recorder); <br>  - You can not watch photos while listening to music.  Read the text - you can. <br>  - Headphones in the kit worthy, but on the shelves there is better;). <br><br>  <u><b>pros</b></u> <br>  - Stylish appearance (and ‚Äúinterior‚Äù), high-quality materials, good assembly;  small size and light weight; <br>  - Sufficient for most tasks the amount of memory;  the presence of an expansion slot for microSD-cards up to 2GB; <br>  - Easy connection and work; <br>  - Large bright color display; <br>  - Multifunctional (photo and video, texts, radio, voice recorder); <br>  - Excellent sound quality; <br>  - Long working time; <br>  - Approximate documentation; <br>  - Price (3300r). <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  If you are affected by the financial crisis, and the player really wants it and you agree on the option without strazikov, cameras and other touch screens, try looking towards the Nexx NMP-280.  He performs his main task on the top five, in addition to this offering quite a few other interesting functions, such as viewing photos and videos, radio with a voice recorder and the ability to read texts.  I did not find any significant drawbacks or flaws, but something, of course, can still be brought to mind.  And if you fix some stuff in the software, you can upgrade the firmware, then the increase in the volume of the external speaker will probably be only in future models. <br>  Headsets from the kit can be used at first, but it is still better to find something separately.  The result is a great player for more than an attractive price.  Universal gift, is that you?  :) <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> If someone is familiar with such a bundle as <b>LabView</b> + <b>NI Elvis</b> - write 770007 in ICQ. I would like to improve the technical level of articles in order not to be unfounded.  Thanks in advance! <br><br>  The other day - a review of Orsio b731 and three nas-s with raids - stay tuned;) <b>Good luck!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54995/</a></p>
