    <h1>  0. The essence of money </h1><br>  This whole introductory part is devoted to explaining what money is in our society.  It can be skipped if you suddenly do not want to read. <br><br>  In my pocket is a bill of 10 rubles.  We are accustomed to thinking that Bank of Russia banknotes are money.  In fact, this is a bit wrong. <br><br>  Earlier, coins were made of precious metals themselves, therefore there was no such ‚Äúdivision‚Äù of value as today.  Judge for yourself - the bill costs exactly the money that was spent on its production, i.e.  may cost much less than its face value. <br><br>  Now the practice of making money from precious metals is no longer applicable, since the Central Bank of any country issues tickets, i.e.  banknotes and coins.  Of course, silver and gold coins are issued, but this is done only to indulge in coin collectors :) <br><br>  Banknotes or coins denote a debt taken by a bank (in our case it is the Central Bank of the Russian Federation).  Of course, in the history of money there are a lot of examples of real security of money with gold, relatively speaking, the bank was always ready, at the client‚Äôs request, to provide him with the amount of gold that corresponded to the denomination of the bill.  True, today the rule of securing obligations in gold has already gone. <br><br><h1>  1. Banks </h1><br>  It is clear that for quite a long time the storage of a large amount of money has become a problem.  Well, then the thieves, the fire, then something else.  Therefore, it became convenient to keep money in the bank, since he was responsible for the safety of money. <br><br>  However, before the advent of non-cash transactions was a problem - the money from the bank must be removed and transferred.  Inconvenient. <br><br>  Also, the problem of Russia was that the existence of non-state banks, and even more so, private business, was simply impossible in our country until 1990. <br><br>  However, since 1990, we have become ‚Äúall right‚Äù with the banking system and a player like the Central Bank (CBR) has emerged. <br><br><blockquote>  If someone did not know, then the banking system in Russia is two-tier.  At the first level, we have the Central Bank, which gives permissions (licenses) to other banks to carry out any specific operations.  At the second level there are such monsters as Sberbank of Russia (most of it is owned by the Central Bank), VTB (most of it is owned by the Government of the Russian Federation) and other commercial banks that already work with the public and legal entities. <br><br>  The Central Bank does not work with individuals and legal entities!  Only with banks. </blockquote><br><br>  So, returning to our starting point, it should be mentioned that before the advent of the Central Bank, transfers between banks were complicated, even if they were possible.  Today, the process of any commercial bank is as follows: it has a correspondent account with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, from which the bank transfers money to the correspondent account of another bank with the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.  And money can easily (more precisely, quickly) run between different organizations, even if they are served in different banks. <br>  Correspondent accounts, of course, can be of different types - nostro, loro, vostro).  Again, I will not go into deep detail. <br><br>  But!  It should be understood that real money for banks looks like an obligation of the CBR to them.  That is, when a payment is made, real money does not move anywhere.  Awareness of this fact we need in the future. <br><br><blockquote>  If you want to open your bank, then it is true, and why not?  Frankly, there is only one small bummer - the minimum share capital for opening a bank is 5 million euros.  Unfortunately.  But on the other hand, if you look at the possible volume of customer transactions, this amount will simply seem ridiculous. </blockquote><br><br><h1>  2. Accounts </h1><br>  <i>The head of the sponsor is the Civil Code of the Russian Federation :)</i> <br><br><h2>  2.1.  Order of appearance of the account </h2><br>  So, what our banks do, we already understand - they work through their correspondent account.  And what about the rest of the accounts, so if I have a savings book - is this also an account? <br><br>  Remember that the first point of contact between the bank and the client is a contract.  It is in the contract that the set and list of services provided by the bank is indicated, how much those services cost and in what order they are provided. <br><br><blockquote>  In fact, one should not think that banks are very free in their decisions.  Since the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for punishment is quick and harsh for punishment, it establishes certain requirements that are mandatory for all banks.  And they can already bring these requirements to the point of absurdity (like Sberbank of Russia) or not.  But for their observance the Central Bank of the Russian Federation will watch out regardless of the size of the bank. </blockquote><br><br>  So, then comes the following situation.  In general, within the framework of a single bank agreement with a client, a number of accounts can be opened for each situation.  However, depending on the person, as well as the essence of the relationship with the bank, the types of accounts may vary. <br><br>  There are two types of accounts within the Civil Code.  So far this is the only centralized explanation of what accounts can be - there is a bank deposit and a bank account. <br>  The difference between them is simple - the deposit is intended for storage, and not to pay anywhere from this account.  A bank account implies any transactions, that is, payments somewhere. <br><br><blockquote>  Once again, in a legal language, payment from a bank account is a concession to the right of claim.  Having placed 100 rubles to the current account as an individual entrepreneur, you have received the right to demand 100 rubles back from the bank.  However, you, paying by ‚Äúbank transfer‚Äù, transfer this right of claim to another person. </blockquote><br><br>  The bank can keep an account in any currency convenient for the client, as well as in the currency with which the bank works.  These are mainly rubles, dollars and euros.  Accounts in other currencies may not be kept by the bank. <br><br><h2>  2.2.  Types of accounts </h2><br>  Of course, there are a large number of subspecies to accounts, for example, an account (in the case of a bank deposit) can be called a ‚Äúpersonal account‚Äù.  And the account from which a bank debits money on a loan is often called a ‚Äúloan account.‚Äù  If you try to classify such names, you can talk for a very long time and don‚Äôt really say anything, so for more details see the comment :) <br><br>  Oh yeah, I almost forgot.  Opening a bank deposit may or may not be accompanied by the issuance of a savings book.  If its absence is not specified in the bank deposit contract separately, it must be issued without fail. <br><br>  And finally, there may be metal accounts (namely deposits).  There everything is taken into account in grams of precious metals, and also from such accounts an individual cannot pay anywhere. <br><br><h1>  3. Disposal of money </h1><br>  <i>Head sponsor - Central Bank of the Russian Federation</i> <br><br><h2>  3.1.  Bank deposit </h2><br>  For an individual, everything is quite simple.  A man came, showed a savings book, if there is one, well, he does what he sees fit, that is, replenishes the deposit, pays him wherever he wants, or simply withdraws money. <br><br>  If the deposit is open in favor of a legal entity, then it can either replenish it or withdraw money from it.  And nothing more, for everything else there is a normal bank account, not a deposit. <br><br><h2>  3.2.  Bank account </h2><br>  It's more interesting here.  Both individuals and legal entities can open bank accounts.  And they can dispose of them exactly the same. <br><br>  Operations are performed using the following documents: <br><ul><li>  payment order (jargon - ‚Äúpayment‚Äù) <br>  letter of credit <br>  check <br>  payment request <br>  collection <br><br><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/my_business/47859.html">next part</a> we will discuss them. <br><br>  With love, <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maniaque/" class="user_link">maniaque</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30205/</a></p>
