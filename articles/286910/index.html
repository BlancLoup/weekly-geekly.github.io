      And what if done differently?  Have you decided today to transcend yourself?  By joining our efforts with Best Buy, we will try to find the best time for each session in a scientific and humorous way. <br><br>  Welcome to your best day! <br><br>  <b>6.00 - Send letters that will actually be read.</b> <br>  According to data compiled by HubSpot, an online marketing company, the peak of email hits falls around this time.  Of course, no immediate response can be guaranteed, but at least you will be heard. <br><br>  <b>6:30 - 8:30 - Do something</b> <br>  Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University, calls for maximum use of the first two hours of the day: ‚ÄúIn general, people are more productive in the morning.  Two hours after waking up is the best time. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>8.00 - Make a very ethical decision</b> <br>  This is an important day for you!  Start it on a high moral level.  According to studies published in Psychological Science, in the morning we tend to make more moral and ethical decisions than in the evening.  Probably, a lot of energy and forces are spent so as not to turn into a liar and not look worse than we are, and self-control still does not allow us to do the ‚Äúordinary, unremarkable‚Äù actions that we do every day.  This is called the ‚Äúmorning effect of morality,‚Äù so hurry to do something important. <br><br>  <b>10.30 - Grab a cup of coffee</b> <br>  Believe it or not, according to Stephen Miller from Neuroscience DC, drinking a cup of coffee in the morning is not the best thing to do.  Between 8 and 9 o'clock in the morning, the level of cortisol (the so-called ‚Äústress hormone‚Äù) in the body is quite high, that is, we are already quite vigorous.  It is better to drink coffee between 9.30 and 11.30, when the concentration of cortisol begins to decline.  (We recommend reading the useful article <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-poluchit-ot-kofeina-maksimum-energii/">"How to get maximum energy from caffeine</a> . <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-poluchit-ot-kofeina-maksimum-energii/">"</a> ) <br><br>  <b>13.00 - Write an interesting post on Facebook</b> <br>  According to the marketing company QuickSprout, at this time the maximum number of people are ready to share a link to your post. <br><br>  <b>13.30 - Take a nap</b> <br>  Feel free to deserve it!  Optimal sleep time depends on when you woke up that day.  If you got up at 6 in the morning, then 13.30 is a good time to take a nap, well, of course, if you got rid of all these important letters.  The best is a little sleep for 10-20 minutes.  Provided that allows workplace.  If your office does not have a special room for sleeping, you will always have a private car and other creative solutions. <br><br>  <b>16.00 - Take a break</b> <br>  How about another break?  According to a small unscientific survey conducted by the Sparkology dating service, users are 40% more likely to receive an answer to a sent message during working hours than after 17.00.  Alex Furmansky, the company's founder, claims that the messages sent in the evening have several obstacles for perception: 1 - a message on Friday evening means that you are sitting, sad and lonely, in front of a computer, instead of talking with friends, 2 - such letters can perceived as rash, 3 - the recipient, most likely, is not in front of his computer. <br><br>  <b>17.00 - Ask for a raise</b> <br>  Despite the fact that you are walking around sites during work hours, say, online dating, we believe that you are a fairly conscientious worker.  You have really devoted time and energy to your business and are ready to ask your boss for an increase in salary.  Lin Ellis, a career coach from Texas, in an interview with Real Simple says: "The most important thing is to choose the moment when your boss is in no hurry and is ready to really listen."  Be sensible: if you and your boss are ‚Äúlarks,‚Äù you need to raise this question in the middle of the day. <br><br>  <b>18.00 - Be creative</b> <br>  If you really are a ‚Äúlark‚Äù, then, as it turns out, your creative peak is in the evening when you are distracted and slightly tired.  Marek B. White and Rose T. Zacks in 2011 conducted a study in which "deep" and "analytical" problems were addressed at the optimal and non-optimal time of the day.  The results show that deep, demanding creative approach and ‚Äúmoment of illumination‚Äù are better left to questions for a while, when your energy and internal restraining factors weaken somewhat. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/pochemu-sleduet-ignorirovat-nekotorye-sovety-po-ekonomii-vremeni/">Why should I ignore some tips on saving time.</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286910/</a></p>
