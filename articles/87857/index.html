News from the front (interview with RoX.Dimaga)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear Habragamera and all interested! <br>  Passed the first month since the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/84661/">beginning of the closed beta testing</a> .  As you know, Blizzard has distributed nine thousand keys to testers, and soon <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/87691/">promises</a> to give out some more keys, this time not depriving Mac users. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ec/5d/ec5db35c49d4daeb06105a0445f2cf19.jpg"><br>  For ordinary people, craftsmen tried to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/85844/">create an offline version</a> for the game against AI.  But still left and deprived, whose home computer does not have enough silenok to start the game.  Such people, including myself, can only follow the news and watch streams (for example, on <a href="http://sc2tv.ru/">sc2tv.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/sc2/">teamliquid.net</a> ). <br>  I decided to talk with <strong>Dmitriy Filipchuk</strong> , known on the Starcraft scene as <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/d0/b9d0b119e96c903bc4c543c799dc236c.gif">  <strong>RoX.KIS.DIMAGA</strong> , which currently won two of the three SC2 Zotac Cup (prize money of 100 euros). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will add a few facts about Dmitriy, for those who have not heard of him before. <br>  DIMAGA is one of the best European players in the Zerg race.  Among the many achievements of his career starcraft, I especially want to mention the following: <br><ul><li>  1st place BWML Individual Tour seasons 10 and 11 </li><li>  1st place ZOTAC Cup ‚Ññ12 and ‚Ññ13 </li><li>  1st place GosuGamers Gosucup ‚Ññ1 </li><li>  1st place WCG Ukraine 2008 </li><li>  2nd place DreamHack Summer 2009 </li><li>  2nd place WCG Ukraine 2009 </li></ul><br><br>  Perhaps we will begin: <br>  <i>- Hello!</i>  <i>What were your first impressions of the game and what are they now?</i> <br>  - Hello!  After the first games, there were good impressions, because  play has become much easier.  And now everything seems to be not so simple and there was a feeling that there is not enough speed.

      <i>- What struck you in the game above all?</i>  <i>(except that the beta finally came out :))</i> <br>  - In fact, I was very pleased, especially among the Zerg.  A lot of new chips and it pleases. <br><br>  <i>- Was it easier or harder to play SK2 in comparison with the first SK?</i> <br>  - IMHO - easier.  Many things have simplified - for example, auto mining (when a new worker, being close to minerals, starts mining himself), or that several buildings can be jumbled up by one digit.  A lot of things have been simplified compared to the first version ... <br><br>  <i>- What disadvantages do you think the game has at the moment?</i> <br>  - It upsets the almost complete absence of microcontrol, it was 10 times less than it was in BroodWar.  Especially in ZvZ games, now the only micro is the burrowing of the roach, and in games against other races, you just need to correctly attack the enemy from the flanks.  That's all micro. <br><br>  <i>- In the first SK you are a very strong Zerg, and in CK2 did you try to play other races?</i>  <i>What are the successes?</i> <br>  - I tried to play both terrans and protoss, but only against the computer.  I don‚Äôt want to play them on the battlenet, because  I will still lose and learn nothing, but I don‚Äôt want to lose points (Dimaga is now in the top 15 of the European ladder - note).  If there was an opportunity to conduct non-rated games, then I would love to play other races more. <br><br>  <i>- Now even the developers say that the balance in the game is shifted not in favor of the Terrans, do you agree with that?</i> <br>  - I think yes.  It's still hard for them to play against the protoss, and against the zerg it has become even harder when compared to the first Starcraft. <br><br>  <i>- What are your opinions as a zerg about the overall balance of the game and the zerg in particular?</i> <br>  ‚ÄúEverything suits me for zerg :) And the rest complain about zerg only when they lose to them. <br><br>  <i>- Roach called imbalance unit.</i>  <i>Do other races have strong units that can be called imba?</i> <br>  ‚ÄúIt may not be imbalanced, but Roach is a very strong unit, especially in zerg games on a zerg you cannot do without him, otherwise you will lose.‚Äù  And for other races, the most powerful are the immortal and the colossus of the protoss;  Teraana has banshee and, most imba, a hellion with +16 dmg. <br><br>  <i>- How do the cards now affect the balance of forces in the game?</i> <br>  - Sometimes it is very strong, for example, on Lost Temple it is very difficult to fight off landing on a cliff.  All the cards are funny in their own way ... <br><br>  <i>- At the moment you have won 4 of 5 SC2 tournaments - what is your secret of such successful performances?</i> <br>  - I'm just lucky;) <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúCan you share the secret of a simple strategy for defeating a terran?‚Äù</i>  <i>protoss?</i> <br>  - Of course, write ... Against the terran, it is best to go to the second base from the 14th slave, if he decides to rush infantry with a bunker, then you simply cancel the base and can build it elsewhere or later, when you fight back.  In the minus you will not be from this.  Against the protoss, the main thing is to beat off the first bulk of the early zealots, then build more bases and just win the game :) <br><br>  <i>- This year, for the first time in the history of World Cyder Games, <a href="http://www.wcg.com/6th/fun/news/news_view.asp%3Fkeyno%3DC10030810000%26page%3D1">Starcraft is not in the game listings</a> .</i>  <i>Your thoughts on this?</i> <br>  - This is very sad.  But let's hope that next year Starcraft 2 will definitely be among the WCG nominations.  And this year I can try my hand at some other WCG game. <br><br>  <i>- I wish you success and further conquest of the peaks in Starcraft 2!</i> <br>  - Thank!  ^^ <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  For clarity, I recommend to watch the video (with comments in Russian) from the last Dimagi games: <a href="http://www.sc2tv.ru/starcraft-2/sc2-live/1681-sc2tv-miniturnir-po-starcraft-2.html">Mini-tournament sc2tv</a> , <a href="http://www.sc2tv.ru/starcraft-2/sc2-live/1791-ne-shutite-s-zotakom.html">final of SC2 Zotac Cup No. 3</a> , <a href="http://www.sc2tv.ru/starcraft-2/sc2-live/1738-starcraft-2koth-rox.kis.dimaga-vs-mouz.white-ra.html">KOTH Dimaga vs White-Ra</a> , <a href="http://www.sc2tv.ru/starcraft-2/sc2-live/1806-starcraft-2-koth-rox.kis.dimaga-vs-rox.kis.brat_ok.html">KOTH Dimaga vs BRAT_OK</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87857/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87857/</a></p>
