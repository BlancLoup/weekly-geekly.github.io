      The record wind speed recorded on Earth is 512 km / h, but fortunately for us, such winds occur only in tornadoes that are small and exist only for a few hours.  However, for inflicting irreparable harm, the smaller one is enough: the wind at a speed of 200 km / h is enough to carry the woman along with the bathroom to a distance <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4156940/Texas-woman-son-fly-bathtub-tornado.html">of 180 meters</a> , and the record distance that the person managed to fly after remaining alive is <a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/furthest-distance-survived-in-a-tornado-">almost 400 meters</a> .  But of course, the most important thing is that as a result of such weather, people continue to die and enormous material damage is inflicted: since the consequences of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD)">hurricane Maria</a> (wind speed in which was 280 km / h) became almost $ 92 billion in damage and more than 100 human casualties. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">Great Red Spot</a> (Jupiter) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3u/ji/bu/3ujibuhxikovex4b47brfqzaytg.jpeg"><br><br>  This hurricane is perhaps the most famous atmospheric phenomenon among all the planets of the Solar System and the ‚Äúcalling card‚Äù of Jupiter - it has existed since at least 1664 and although over the past century its size has decreased by half, it continues to exceed the size of the Earth by a third.  And before that, its size reached 14,000 km by 41,000 km.

However, on August 24, 2006, it was possible to register the hurricane on its surface with the help of the Hubble telescope - its dimensions were 1300 km per 2,700 km.  On November 13, 2011, he sent his 10-meter mirror to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">the Keck Observatory</a> telescope at Uranus and <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/20120904-hammel-uranus-dark-spot.html">discovered</a> this dark spot on it ... in the appendage to several light ones: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/c_/4g/vrc_4glmt3kz4icz-gmkwp4rghk.jpeg"><br><br>  On average, the speed of the winds on the 40 parallel of Uranus reaches a speed of 540-720 km / h.

That, however, did not prevent him until recently to have a hurricane with dimensions of 6,600 km per 13,000 km, and the wind speed around this spot (discovered by Voyager-2 in 1989) is truly enormous - as much as 2,400 km / h!  Like the spots of previous planets, it also turned out to be inconsistent: in the images taken with the Hubble telescope taken in November 1994, it was no longer there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9y/d7/zb/9yd7zbiaxr6du4biuyemnee2w20.jpeg"><br>  <i>Recurring hurricanes on Neptune captured by Hubble</i> <br><br>  The cause of this activity of Neptune is considered an internal heat source.

He lost his eye in a car accident in the 50s, which did not prevent him from finding a job at NASA in 1964.  He retained his place after <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-1">the Apollo 1 catastrophe</a> and became the NASA Deputy Administrator for Manned Programs in 1970.  In this position, he managed to take part in the rescue of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD-13">the Apollo 13</a> crew and appointed <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Harrison Schmitt to the</a> Apollo 17 crew - the only scientist to visit the Moon (initially he was to fly with the next, canceled mission).  In 1974, he left NASA, having worked in the North American Aircraft Group to build the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockwell_B-1_Lancer">B-1 aircraft</a> , serve for five years as Deputy Secretary of Energy for the United States and even as a private consultant and director of his own company. <br><br>  In October 1986 (11 months after <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0_%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25C2%25AB%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25C2%25BB">the Challenger disaster</a> ), he was again invited to serve as deputy director at NASA, but did not want to accept this post.  As they write, he accepted the invitation for the post only after the call of the then US President Ronald Reagan.  He worked in this position until April 1989, when the then head of NASA, James Fletcher, left the post, so he worked as acting head of NASA for another month until a new head was appointed.  As NASA historians point out: ‚Äúhe managed to bring a sense of optimism to the agency after the disaster‚Äù. <br><br>  After leaving NASA in May 1989, he returned to the work of a private consultant and even managed to participate in the Rocketplane Kistler startup, which was able to win the NASA <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services">COTS</a> program contract, but because of financial problems, the company was unable to collect the necessary funds to participate in the program.  At the time of his death in 2015, he had two daughters, 5 grandchildren and 3 great-grandsons, and he himself was already 93 years old. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/411147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/411147/</a></p>
