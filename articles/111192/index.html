It became very interesting to me, and decided to go on reconnaissance. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>First meeting</b> <br><br>  The first meeting as it should not bear any load, purely organizational, so that people just ask the price of each other.  We talked for a long time about how to responsibly take care of and protect the site, during its update and so on.  An hour after all the fiery speeches and questions from future teammates, we divided the sections for which we will answer.  We agreed to meet in a month (!). <br><br>  <b>Second meeting</b> <br><br>  It just did not take place.  The teacher said, ‚ÄúI have no time to work on websites, I‚Äôm busy!‚Äù  I refused to participate in such a project, the <a href="http://school20.tgl.ru/">site</a> continued to run completely incomprehensible people, sometimes they just forgot about it, sometimes they forgot for a long time - a month, two or even all three. <br><br>  I fired up with this thought, to build a large community, to bring all the students to one site, where they would discuss topics that are interesting for students, not for educational officials.  For a start, I found out what the school‚Äôs website is all about.  It turned out to be the usual CMS, written without any problems, wooden so to speak.  Then I decided that I would make my community.  It took me about a year to find a solution to this issue and to implement it (i.e., my website earned on the following September first). <br><br>  I think it will be correct if I describe its functionality: <br>  - Displaying school news <br>  - Forum <br>  - User pages (ala Fkontakte) <br>  - Groups <br>  - Rating (awarded for useful action on the site, for example, adding a photo to an album, opening a forum thread) <br><br>  From the first of September began the most interesting.  I went to an informatics teacher (deputy director) and said that the site is ready and running, you only need to transfer it to the school server, since the school has a weak internet, to put it mildly, to which I was told that this is great, but come in two of the week, while I'm picking up a bunch of papers. <br><br>  Two weeks passed. <br><br>  We approach the teacher and say ‚ÄúTwo weeks have passed!‚Äù, To which we get the answer ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt, I‚Äôm in the department now.  Let's do it tomorrow?". <br><br>  Match tomorrow. <br><br>  - Oh, forgive me, but it‚Äôs impossible to get the server out for you, we have an inventory of the property and a commission on the nose.  Let's just take your site in a month? <br>  - Good. <br><br>  At this time, the number of users has already passed for 150 (for 1.5 months, without much advertising), and a daily viewing of the site is about 2.5 thousand, while the official one, it was simply impossible to access it, because that there were already very outdated bases, I was listed there as a student of the 6th grade. <br><br>  Another month has passed. <br><br>  I come up and here they say to me: ‚ÄúCome to XXX, now they will give you a computer‚Äù, I come up and really, they gave it to me.  At a detailed examination of what he regretted, he took it.  It turned out to be a 15-year-old computer, and the real thing cannot be deployed on it.  Left him where he took. <br><br>  At this time, the site continued to spin on my server. <br><br>  After the New Year (2010), I decided to turn off the site. <br><br>  The reasons: <br>  - The school is not interested in this.  The teachers (there are such) do not know that the school has a website. <br>  - Schools do not need a website at all, they have not grown to say so yet.  They do not know what to publish there, how to attract and retain users, to introduce and develop new services. <br>  - Pupils as well as teachers also do not need it, or rather, most students (grades 1-8), since at the end of the 9th and 11th class, everything comes alive, everyone starts to run around the teachers, run around the extras, etc. <br>  - No benefits from it.  If something is discovered and invested in it, it is clear that I want to get at least a small, but a benefit.  Here it does not happen because there are no competent people who can organize it. <br>  - This is not necessary for the city.  Well we understand what country we live in.  Let's imagine such a situation: there is a separate department, for the support of which not comic money is allocated (of course, we understand where the part goes), and here come such proactive ones like me ... no further comments. <br><br>  Summing up, I want to say the following: normal sites, with the exception, however, in our country will not be a few more years, until those who could become a user grow up and go to school (children 4-5 years old).  I think that it will take about 5-6 years before schools realize not only the benefit from the site, when all the news and all the information about the school is open to everyone (for example, it is useful for parents when defining a child to school), but also convenience, the document flow is simplified. no need to search for anyone in the ‚Äúnetworks‚Äù to strike on the wall or in drugs, learning becomes easier, for example, sick, you can not go to school, but you must!  Opened the video broadcast and you're in the classroom. <br><br>  Of course, this may seem like a dream and utopia, but it can be turned into a reality, if you only want it! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111192/</a></p>
