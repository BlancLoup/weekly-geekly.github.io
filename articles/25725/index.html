Competitions are held in the categories Algorithm (sports programming), Marathon (research programming), Component (application programming) and Studio (graphic and web design). <br><br>  Traditionally TopCoder Open (or TCO) attracts thousands of participants from around the world.  This year, 3980 of the strongest programmers participated in the selection at TopCoder Open in the most popular category Algorithm.  Of these, 72 of the best qualifiers and four online qualifying rounds went to full-time semi-finals in Las Vegas.  Among these 72 in the world capital of entertainment and 10 finalists were identified category Algorithm.  A total of 120 people arrived to participate in all four categories this year. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The final TCO of this year in sports programming was marked by a tense struggle between the leader of the past years, Pole Tomash Chaika (the winner of the TCO 2003 and 2004) and the current number one in the TopCoder sports programming ranking Peter Mitichev, a postgraduate student at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mechanics of Moscow State University.  Mv  Lomonosov, the winner of the 2006 TSO.  The confrontation between Peter and Tomash has a rather long history.  Back in 2003, the team, which included Peter, lost in the final of the ACM ICPC team student world championship to the team of the University of Warsaw, in which Tomash Chaika played, and took second place.  Since then, Peter and Tomash constantly face open international competitions and compete for first place with alternate success. <br><br>  This year, Peter Mitrichev lost to the Polish programmer and took second place.  In third place is also the representative of Poland, the winner of the 2005 TopCoder Open, Eric Kopczy≈Ñski. <br><br>  Despite Peter's second place (which in itself is a huge achievement for any country), this year's TSO final was marked for Russia with a record number of participants.  Three out of ten finalists in the face-to-face semi-finals and Wildcard in Vegas represented Russia. <br>  This year, the TopCoder Open final was undoubtedly exciting.  Before the start of the Challenge Phase (the stage at which participants can offer counterexamples to opponents' programs, getting 50 points for each successful action and, consequently, losing 25 points for each unsuccessful), Tomash Chaika, the leader of the tournament table, is 137.5 points ahead of Peter Mitrichev.  However, Peter managed to build counterexamples to the decisions of two participants, reducing the gap to 37.5 points, and then, at the last minute, to the decision of another participant, going forward by 12.5 points.  After that, Tomek in less than a minute before the end sent a counterexample to another solution and regained the lead.  Everything was decided in the last seconds, and the finale in terms of entertainment was not inferior to the finals of the largest sports competitions.  That is why the term ‚Äúsports programming‚Äù is used for such tournaments.  Viewers from around the world watched the competition with the help of the already traditional webcast. <br><br>  In general, the Russian participants showed excellent results: 3 out of 10 finalists represented Russia.  Also in the final were two Polish programmers and one each from Ukraine, China, Australia, Sweden and Indonesia. <br><br>  The results of TopCoder Open 2008, as well as statistics on participants, countries, universities and the history of the competition can be found on the Russian-language project <a href="http://www.snarknews.info/">snarknews.info</a> covering the programming competition in a <a href="http://www.snarknews.info/trial.cgi%3Fdata%3Dnewstape%26menu%3Dtco08%26head%3Dindex%26class%3Dtco08">special project</a> dedicated to TopCoder Open 2008. <br><br>  <strong>Photo and video materials:</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc%3Fmodule%3DStatic%26d1%3Dtournaments%26d2%3Dtco08%26d3%3Dphotos">www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco08&amp;d3=photos</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc%3Fmodule%3DStatic%26d1%3Dtournaments%26d2%3Dtco08%26d3%3Dmovies">www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tournaments&amp;d2=tco08&amp;d3=movies</a> <br><br>  <strong>About TopCoder Open Finalists</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Pyotr Mitrichev</strong> , who took second place on TopCoder Open 2008, in 2006 established a unique achievement.  He won both the TopCoder Open, and Google Code Jam and the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge, thus becoming the first ever participant who managed to win all three of the world's largest personal sports programming tournaments in one year.  On TopCoder Open 2007, Peter was unlucky and he failed to reach the semifinals.  At the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge 2007, he again won a landslide victory, and now at the TopCoder Open 2008, which for Peter was already the third final of the TCO, Mitrichev took second place. <br>  Peter participates in programming competitions from the sixth grade.  Three times he was the absolute winner of the All-Russian and the prize-winner of the International Olympiads of students in computer science.  Enrolling at MSU, Peter continued to participate in programming competitions and twice (in 2003 and 2005) became the vice-champion of programming in the student team world championship ACM, consisting of two different teams of MSU. <br><br>  Since the participation of students in the finals of the ACM student team world championship is limited to two years, Peter focused on open competitions.  In 2005, he reached the TopCoder Open final for the first time, where he finished fourth.  In May 2006, he became the winner of the TopCoder Open, in June - took second place in Google Code Jam Europe, held in Dublin.  In November of the same year, he won the World Google Code Jam in New York and the TopCoder Collegiate Challenge.  It is also worth noting that Peter has been the winner of the Open Programming Cup for three years in a row - the largest open regular team online competition held in the CIS and several Eastern European countries.  The latter achievement is all the more significant because in the 2007‚Äì2008 season, Peter participated in the Open Cup alone, while most of the other teams had 3 participants each.  During 2008, Peter was the leader in the TopCoder rating, and before the TopCoder Open finals his rating reached a record high for all participants in the entire history of TopCoder 3890. <br><br>  Peter is actively involved in the preparation of school teams of Russia at the International Olympiads in Informatics, in the preparation of student teams, in the conduct of various summer programming schools. <br><br>  The second year student of St. Petersburg State University, <strong>Sergey Kopeliovich</strong> , who took the 5th place, as a schoolboy, twice won the gold medal at the International School Olympiads in Informatics.  In the first year, he participated in the onsite round of TopCoder Collegiate Challenge 2007, where he entered the transition tournament.  In the semifinals of TopCoder Open 2008, Sergey won first place, beating, in particular, the future winner Tomas Chaika. <br><br>  For <strong>Andrei Stankevich</strong> , who drew 6-9 places in the final of the TSS, ITMO team coach at the ACM ICPC student world programming championships, this is the second final of TopCoder Open.  Note that in 2007, Mikhail Dvorkin participated in the final of the TCO - one of Andrei Stankevich‚Äôs students, thus, representatives of ITMO St. Petersburg State University, whose team is the current world champion in programming ACM ICPC for students, reach the TopCoder Open final for the third year in a row that is the second such case in the entire history of TopCoder Open (after the University of Warsaw, whose representatives participated in all six finals of TopCoder Open). <br><br>  Andrei Stankevich does a great job of organizing and holding programming competitions.  He is the chairman of the Scientific Committee of the All-Russian Olympiad of Schoolchildren in Informatics, a member of the jury of the semifinal of the East European semifinal of the ACM ICPC student world programming championship, participates in various summer schools in computer science.  For his services in organizing student programming competitions, Andrei Stankevich was awarded the Prize of the President of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  For the first time during the TopCoder Open, the representative of Ukraine reached the final.  Sophomore of the Kiev National University <strong>Vladislav Simonenko</strong> in 2006 was a silver medalist of the International Olympiad in Informatics for Schoolchildren.  And here is another success - a victory in the semifinals of TopCoder Open 2008 and reaching the final.  At the same time, in the semifinals, Vladislav was ahead of Peter Mitrichev and Eric Kopchinsky, who finished second and third.  In conjunction with the fourth place and the gold medals of the team of the Lviv National University.  Ivan Franko in the finals of the ACM ICPC team student world programming championship of this year, the result of Vladislav is evidence of the undoubted success in sports programming, which Ukraine has achieved over the past year. <br><br>  <strong>About TopCoder Inc.</strong>  <strong>and contest TopCoder Open</strong> <br><br>  TopCoder, Inc. is a global leader in online programming programming competitions.  Annually holds two tournaments - TopCoder Open (actually open personal world championship) and TopCoder Collegiate Challenge (actually student personal world championship), as well as several regular online competitions per week.  The competition system developed by TopCoder, which allows a participant to receive points not only for solving problems, but also for finding errors in decisions of opponents, was used not only for competitions organized by TopCoder, but also, for example, for Google Code Jam.  The tasks offered at TopCoder competitions are complex algorithmic problems, the solution of which requires both theoretical and practical skills.  To be counted, the decision of the participant must pass a certain set of tests.  The points accrued for the task depend on the complexity of the task and on the time of the decision.  The leaders of the rankings awarded to TopCoder competitors are considered the leaders of sports programming in the world.  In addition to competitions in sports programming (Algorithm), TopCoder also holds competitions in the design and development of software components (Component), research programming (Marathon), graphic and web design (Studio). <br><br>  To participate in the semifinals and finals, participants were gathered in Las Vegas (USA).  at the same time the organizers assumed all expenses.  The prize fund in the Algorithm nomination was $ 70,000. In this case, the winner received $ 15,000, 2nd place was given $ 8,000, 3 - $ 6,000, 4 - $ 4,000, the other participants in the final receive $ 1,000.  Semifinalists who did not reach the final - $ 500 each.  The total prize fund of this year's TCO was $ 260,000. <br><br>  Competitions TopCoder Open since 2003.  During this time, three times the champion in the Algorithm nomination was Tomash Chaika from Poland (in 2003, 2004 and 2008), and each time - Eric Kopczy≈Ñski (Poland) in 2005, Pyotr Mitrichev (Russia) in 2006 and Jan Kuipers ( Netherlands) in 2007. <br><br>  More than once, Tomash Chayka (1st place in 2003, 2004, 2008 and 2nd place in 2006), Erik Kopchinsky (1st place in 2005, 3rd place in 2007 and 2008) and Petr got into the top three on TopCoder Open in the Algorithm. Mitrichev (1st place in 2006, 2nd place in 2008).  Interestingly, these are the participants that made up the top three TopCoder Open this year. <br>  Polish participants entered all 6 Finals of TopCoder Open.  Russian participants were present in 4 finals of TopCoder Open (all finals since 2005).  Representatives from other countries have no more than 3 entries in the TCO finals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25725/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25725/</a></p>
