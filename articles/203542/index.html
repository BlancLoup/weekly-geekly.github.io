      After countless hours of research, I eventually bought several bitcoins, when their value was still below $ 200.  The more I understood about bitcoins, the more I fell in love with digital currency, which was rapidly gaining popularity around the world. <br><br>  On November 12, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that one of the first bitcoin-accepting businesses in the US was located near my home.  I learned that I only needed 45 minutes by car to become one of the first people who performed an operation in the real world using bitcoins. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For fun, me and my good friend Christopher Nash went to Allentown, PA - the place where the first Subway in the United States is located, accepting bitcoins as payment.  During the trip, we talked about the possibility of bitcoins to completely change the world of commerce and finance, which only strengthened our desire to make the first purchase using bitcoins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e0/089/cd8/8e0089cd88cda188aaf6565d4a260d3c.png" align="left"><br><br>  We stopped at a small Subway-a otdelitsa at Hamilton Boulevard and stared at the sign on the front door, "Here accept bitcoins."  We thought about how many people pass by this tablet every day and do not even suspect that they make a step into history.  After a mute scene across from the door and a couple of strange looks from visitors and restaurant workers, we headed towards the terminal and made our order. <br><br>  While our sandwiches were preparing, we bombarded the staff with questions.  They liked it and were happy to help us.  I asked how many people came last week to make a purchase using bitcoins.  The staff looked at me in surprise and said that more than a hundred enthusiasts had already arrived.  "Some drove about 4 o'clock and bought only a few cookies." <br><br>  It is worth noting that the commission of operations will become the basis for the future of bitcoins.  If you really want to develop the long-term success of bitcoins, you definitely need to make purchases and thereby support a business that accepts payment by bitcoins.  Unfortunately, due to the instability of bitcoins over the past year, the majority chooses not to spend their investments, but to observe how they rise or fall in price. <br><br>  Neither Chris nor I were bitcoins prepared enough to buy, but mostly because we were hungry.  Besides, I forgot to take with me any cash.  Fortunately, Chris found enough to pay a toll on the toll road. <br><br>  When our sandwiches were ready, the cashier picked up an iPad and opened Coinbase.  She broke through our account at the checkout, and then on the iPad, which immediately generated a QR code with a link to the Subway account in Coinbase.  It was preinstalled when calculating our final bill.  I took my iPhone, opened the Coinbase application and scanned the QR code.  The bill immediately appeared on the screen, the application offered me to leave a review about my purchase. <br><br>  I clicked "send" and after a second the cashier received confirmation on his iPad that the account had been bitcoins.  It took no more time than a bank transaction, and did not require my signature. <br><br>  Thank you for Subway and I installed the Coinbase application before Apple unexpectedly removed it from the AppStore less than a month after launch.  This step Apple could become a blockade for the implementation of the adoption of bitcoins in the United States, I hope that Coinbase will soon be able to resolve this problem with Apple.  Perhaps, after the last positive senatorial hearings, Apple will change its mind.  Bitcoins have taken a new height this week - more than $ 700.  This happened after the US ministries told the senatorial committee that bitcoins are legal ways to exchange.  However, it is important to note that the adoption of bitcoins in China is the main reason for the surge in prices. <br><br>  After the sandwiches were finished, we knew that we had to make another purchase.  This time we ordered cookies and even wrote down a short vine about this deal. <br><br>  In general, this experience was memorable.  A great story I will ever tell my grandchildren.  Whether you love Bitcoins or hate you, you cannot deny that Bitcoins are exciting new technology that will undoubtedly change the world.  I can proudly say that I played a small role in the process of becoming Bitcoins. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e02/642/10d/e0264210d736773d2924d02933ab13ba.jpg" align="left"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/170/a23/cda/170a23cdafa1d1c9b850fd261fd8f547.jpg" align="left"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203542/</a></p>
