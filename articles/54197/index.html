  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony DR-BT21G Bluetooth Headset Bluetooth Survey and Pick History</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past couple of years, I really wanted a Bluetooth headset for myself, but because of the high cost and non-proliferation of them, I only drooled at the pictures on the Internet.  The last six months, I have been actively looking for custom-made headphones in Ukraine, because  there was work, money, I wanted to fulfill my dream. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first I looked at the Logitech headphones, but as it turned out later, they were not BT, but used their transmitter (like everything from Logitech).  After that, I came across Genius headsets and the possibility of ordering them in the city, these are the models: <a href="http://genius.ru/Product.aspx%3FProductID%3D15047%26amp%3Barchive%3D0">BT-02N SE</a> , <a href="http://genius.ru/Product.aspx%3FProductID%3D13669%26amp%3Barchive%3D0">BT-03A</a> , but after reading the Internet, there were a lot of negative reviews, I did not dare, because  120 bucks. <br><br>  And about six months ago, I saw the DR-BT21G on the Sony website and was just in shock.  First of all, they look awesome, secondly they are worthy of their characteristics, and thirdly, due to few reviews, she really played well. <br><br>  And so, when I searched it for six months on the Internet shops, and did not find it, I accidentally went to the Foxtrot store (supermarkets of technology, such as Eldorado, only in Ukraine) and saw it, for 400 hryvnia (less than 50 dollars), with a new guarantee , packaged!

      Now, after a week of using it, I want to tell you about it. <br><br>  So first, the design. <br><br>  Headphones are folding, with an occipital mount on the head, rather small in the opened form and compact in the folding form (in a pocket, shirts fit easily).  I give 2 photos in comparison with the usual computer mouse: <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Assembled view" src="http://www.it4it.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dsc00047-450x320.jpg" alt=" " width="450" height="320"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img title="Open view" src="http://www.it4it.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dsc00046-449x339.jpg" alt=" " width="449" height="339"></a> <br><br>  The hinges in which it folds look very secure, they have a retainer, they do not stagger. <br><br>  The buttons are only on the right earpiece, they are: <br><ol><li>  Volume control button, they are a single button </li><li>  Power button (and control pairing) </li><li>  Player control button.  It goes both ways (song forward / back) and is pressed (start / stop) </li><li>  Phone control button (answer, activate voice dialing) </li><li>  Actually this is not a button :) just a microphone </li><li>  Indicator - two LEDs, blue and pink. </li></ol><br> <a href=""><img title="Buttons" src="http://www.it4it.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/dsc00050_2-450x372.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="372"></a> <br><br>  The control buttons are pressed quite easily, with a move that can be felt. <br><br>  Now, consider the interaction with devices. <br><br>  Because  headphones support simultaneous communication with several devices, they were checked in such a mode for a long time (if you can talk about a week of using headphones at all :) Device pairing occurs 1 time (headphones remember up to 10 devices) by simply pressing the power button for 7 seconds and then adding them on the phone / player / pda.  After that, at any time a familiar device can connect to them. <br><br>  I connected the SE k800 phone and the Dell Axim x51v PDA (with WM6.1 and Broadcom drivers). <br><br>  With connected PDAs and phones, music is managed on a PDA, in what sequence it was connected, and the buttons of the phone are controlled directly by the phone (voice dialing on, answer).  A very pleasant surprise was that when they call the phone, the headphones stop the player, and after the call, they turn it on from the same place. <br><br>  There are no complaints with the connection of devices and their management.  Unfortunately, when using one phone, I noticed a weirdness.  Wherever the phone is lying, when you turn your head to the right, the connection is interrupted, and returning your head to the fore, music continues to play.  When using a PDA as a player, there is no such problem, even if it lies in a backpack. <br><br>  And so, we got to the main part, the assessment of sound quality. <br><br>  The sound quality I checked at my ear for a variety of music played from the phone and PDA, as well as listening to podcasts and receiving calls from mobile (comparing with wired headphones Sennheiser pmx100), a couple of friends with different musical tastes and capabilities, and 1 "music fan" with almost musical ear with hard rock.  Immediately make a reservation, all the music was in mp3 with a bitrate from 192 to 320. <br><br>  I, as a person who is not very knowledgeable in music, listened alternately to the Sinhayzers and Sony.  High and low do not differ much, the bass is better for Sony (surprisingly), and Sony does not begin to pop at maximum volume.  On all the listened songs, Sony were comparable or better than syngers. <br><br>  A friend, a lover of heavy music, immediately said that Sony is better.  In addition to the synheiser, he compared with a fairly high-quality headphones from Walkman phones SonyEricsson.  After such an assessment, was proud of Sony. <br><br>  And the last, how many they live. <br><br>  According to my measurements, when used with a PDA and a phone immediately in the music listening mode, they live up to 10-11 hours - I listened to kill them.  If you listen in my mode (2-3 hours of music per day, hours 6 in standby mode), then they lived 4 days, which for myself, I consider it a great indicator. <br><br>  On the example of Sony headphones, I believe that Bluetooth headphones have already achieved good quality and work time, so those who are against the wires should think about buying. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I will answer questions from the comments. <br>  In my opinion, they are strong enough, do not hang out and look good. <br><br>  In terms of the distance of work, they work with a computer about 5-7 meters through the wall (walked from 1 room to another).  With a smaller phone, apparently the transmitter is weaker. <br><br>  It is possible to lie with them on your back, falling down a little from the ears, but not very critical.  Also, as said in the comments, with long hair there will be a slight discomfort when removing them, because  1 hinge without latch, can catch on the hair. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54197/</a></p>
