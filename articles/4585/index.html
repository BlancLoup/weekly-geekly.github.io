Generally speaking - preizryadno. <br><br>  Let's start from the beginning.  <a href="http://sup.ru/about.html">The Soup Company is a new player on the Russian media market.</a>  I will tell you something strange - it all begins with this very phrase.  Do you know why? <br><br>  Livejournal is NOT a MEDIA PROJECT.  Its cash flows arise from the SERVICE model of the project - users pay money.  Now for a small part of the accounts, the media component has been introduced, but it is more contextual, not media.  And, I will ask, this is the American Market, quite different than ours.  Total first, important:

      <b>The model for extracting revenue from the service within the Russian-language segment is changing.</b> <br><br>  Much of the success of LJ is due to the fact that making money was not related to the personalities of the writers, and, indeed, with the quality of their texts, LJ was a technological service for us.  Now it will change and change is guaranteed, because the technological service does not need a pathetic office in front of the Foreign Ministry.  Guys, when you reproach the SOUP office - by the way, you are completely wrong.  People do it the way they do it effectively, do not count their money.  I fix something completely different - for the technical service that extracts money from the service, it is simply not needed.  There is no problem that he solves.  And Mr. Mamut knows how to count money, he would not have spent it that way. <br><br>  Is the thesis clear?  He is by the way not completely negative.  He is a statement.  And another follows from him, he as a source of surprise from those who vote against: <br><br>  <b>The transition to the media model should be ensured by the growth of the attractiveness of the service.</b> <br><br>  Guys.  You will be fine.  I guarantee you.  I personally will be happy to use the new SUP services, ready to pay money for them, etc.  Because the gears are always lubricated.  The transition to a media model makes an important relationship between beneficiaries and producers of high-quality content.  You ask, where will the $ 20 million deal go?  In part, you, my dear ones, would not be surprised if SUP will take to share with you the revenue from display advertising and even subsidize you in the absence of sales, for example.  And this will undoubtedly greatly enhance the blogosphere, will have a generally significant positive impact on the industry as a whole. <br><br>  Do you have doubts?  Are you plagued by fears?  It seems to you that the assurances of the SUPU managers that there will be no depressive policy is a trick?  By no means.  Here is the following thesis: <br><br>  <b>Promotional policy is cheaper and more effective than depressive</b> <br><br>  Despite the strange words, everything is extremely simple.  Learn a lot of bloggers.  Lots of.  No one needs to ban, close and cut in some repercussions against 400 thousand ideologically unsuitable.  It is much easier to ensure the promotion of 100 thousand suitable.  Just someone will be better, but someone is much better.  And that's all. <br><br>  This is exactly the behavior of media in the concept of web2.0, an unbreakable method of sampling.  Moreover, my dear, you cannot and cannot fight this.  See - there is an SOUP, and these are blogs, just like Yandex is a search, and Mail.ru is an email.  SUP support will make bloggers successful, famous and strong. <br><br>  Are you against SOUP?  Ok, no question, what next?  That you leave LJ, that you do not leave - it does not matter.  You - the elusive Joe, which no one needs.  And those who need them will receive help, support, gingerbread and freebies from the SUP.  And you, my dear, will not say a word against it, because I do not have to give you anything good for SUP so easily.  What, will you go rogue, count someone else's pennies in your pocket, and gain what from this money SUP?  You will not, right?  Will you be proud lonely birds that will burst without SUP?  Yes you will.  And you will spend a significant number of forces and equipment.  Look at the proud lonely Nikitaeva, who sings an order of magnitude better than half of our superstars.  But without a producer.  And what, you see a lot of it in the rotation?  Or stadium concerts?  Do you still believe that talent will win financial support? <br><br>  Well, believe God to help.  Total fix: <br><br>  <b>The emergence of media money in the blogosphere will inevitably lead to a change in relief in favor of financing ideologies.</b> <br><br>  By the way, I note that ideologies here are not necessarily political.  Fashion, music, whatever, principle is important. <br><br>  And in this place my assessment appears ‚Äúnegative.‚Äù  I have a negative attitude to the fact that there is only one such player on the market.  I have a negative attitude to the fact that the person who is engaged in blogs is the best expert on ideological games in Runet.  Not because I do not like him, what is wrong, and not because we disagree with him in political preferences, which is definitely so, but because this appointment is guaranteed around political money.  I am aware that my bad attitude will not affect the universe, but I am not ready to change my opinion on this matter.  My opinion in this place is purely ideological, the market will get better and better from all these matters.  Only now I do not feel joy from this.  Do you understand why? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4585/</a></p>
