The topic itself became relevant after the flood in this topic: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/81311/">Humane and effective mousetrap</a> <br><br>  I would like to tell what kind of ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù animals contain at home.  In the beginning I wanted to write which animals IT-specialists contain at home, but it did not work out, since everything is very traditional, with very few exceptions. <br>  Immediately I will clarify, by ‚Äúnon-traditional‚Äù animals, I mean not cats, dogs, parrots (Wavy, Corell, Rosell, etc.), fish (guppies, cockerels, watchdogs, etc.), and other common rodents . <br>  I will start with reptiles and divide them into 2 groups: lizards, snakes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Snakes </h4><br>  It is very difficult to compose the kinds of snakes that are kept at home, as they hold almost everything from the grass snake to the anaconda.  I will start from the most simple in maintenance and care and describe the 5 most popular types.

      <b>1. Royal snakes.</b> <br>  They are very simple to keep at home, they do not require much temperature, it is quite enough from +20 at night to + 25, + 28 in the afternoon, whoever said anything there.  Based on personal experience of their content.  Eat mice. <br>  Personally, I hold the Royal Milk Snake Campbell.  Here it is, photos of month 4, so the snake has grown up. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/938/397/4fd/9383974fdb20e6605763ad7433f7c1e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Information on the Royal and Milk Snakes (with photos): <a href="http://www.terraria.ru/lampropeltis">www.terraria.ru/lampropeltis</a> <br><br>  <b>2. Runners</b> <br>  They are often loved to keep at home, as they are not expensive, they are not particularly capricious in their content, they grow rather quickly, and they do not create special problems.  By species, the people prefer to keep the Maisovs, although I don‚Äôt want to speak here, it‚Äôs just this kind that I most often see. <br>  <b>Corn snake</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a1/f2a/c3e/6a1f2ac3e3055bc2ca5c2d14d9d2679d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Amur snake</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b9/c6e/caf/6b9c6ecaff12aa1b7ce248c3465d2ded.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Information on the snakes (with photos): <a href="http://terraria.ru/elaphe">terraria.ru/elaphe</a> <br><br>  <b>3. Pythons</b> <br>  These animals have a special amateur.  I would recommend them to keep an experienced person, well, or at least responsible.  Firstly, because they no longer eat small mice, but larger and live food.  Secondly, we need a larger terrarium.  And the biggest problem is that they get sick and refuse to eat quite often.  Most often in the home terrariums can be found royal, tiger and reticulated pythons. <br>  <b>Royal python</b> <br><img src="http://i045.radikal.ru/0911/f1/d83904c43569.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Tiger python</b> <br><img src="http://www.avito.ru/images/big/2246897.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Reticulated python</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af0/d24/527/af0d2452745952094b6e1c33144b52eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>4. boas</b> <br>  As well as pythons, it is not easy to keep, although for an experienced terrarium player all types of reptiles are not a problem. <br>  <b>Paraguayan Anaconda</b> <br><img src="http://s48.radikal.ru/i121/0905/50/d6dd11191e07.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On this one can finish with snakes, there are a huge number of snake species, even in one species a lot of subspecies, for example, the same Polozov or Royal Snakes and all of them are kept at home quite successfully.  In terms of content, it is difficult to recommend something in common, since the method of content for each species is separate.  The only thing that is common is that it is not <b><u>possible to keep snakes (reptiles) in the aquarium</u></b> !!! <br><br><h4>  Lizards </h4><br>  Unfortunately, I am not an expert in the field of lizards, more on snakes, but there is some experience in the content.  I‚Äôll say right away that it is much more difficult to keep lizards at home than snakes, they require more care, and knowledge too.  The biggest problem in keeping lizards is feeding and disease. <br><br>  <b>1. Iguana</b> <br>  This lizard can be found quite often in domestic terrariums, it feeds on vegetables and fruits.  We need for her a large vertical terrarium.  An important factor is the lighting and UV lamp system. <br><br>  <b>Common Iguana</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf3/908/9d6/bf39089d6048c3eb1886cde7872dc135.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. The Agamas</b> <br>  They like Iguan like to keep at home.  I don‚Äôt understand them at all and I never kept it myself, unlike Iguan, so for a clearer understanding I throw off the link to the article <a href="http://www.floranimal.ru/families/2308.html">www.floranimal.ru/families/2308.html</a> <br><br>  <b>Bearded Agama</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af8/090/a39/af8090a39cfef1076e15cb4eba79b0a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3. Chameleons</b> <br>  In my opinion they are quite difficult to maintain, they eat a lot of insects, so along with the chameleon it will be necessary to keep a colony of ashy cockroaches to feed the chameleon.  For iguanas, humidity, lighting, heating, the presence of UV lamps, etc. are important.  I recommend that before the content is very responsible to get acquainted with the view. <br><img src="http://semashko3.ru/wp-content/uploads/x_c9decadd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also at home you can meet various Geckos.  One of the advantages in the content of lizards is that you can keep several species together, after making sure of this))) Of the minuses, these are diseases in lizards and there are many of them. <br><br>  <b><u>Common to all reptiles</u></b> <br>  Reptiles are quite difficult to tame and some can not be tamed all their life, biting their owners and not giving in their hands.  In addition, you need quite a few initial investments in their maintenance, namely: a terrarium, a thermal cable / thermal cord, a lighting system + UV, ground, a hydrometer, a thermal controller, etc. <br><br><h4>  Now go to the spiders </h4><br>  I will not describe them in common into species and groups.  Since here, in my opinion, everything is much simpler, both in content and in feeding.  From my own experience I kept and keep the Tarantulas, but there were also Tarantulas.  There are a lot of variations of both those and others, but the content is quite simple. <br>  They can be kept in an aquarium, the size of which is not very large, in general the size of the place of detention should be minimal.  Soil land, you can buy in a flower shop, 2 times a day spray with water, the temperature is enough room +20 (+25).  They feed on insects. <br>  Here are all kinds (or almost all): <br>  <a href="http://www.pauki.ru/species/index.shtml">www.pauki.ru/species/index.shtml</a> <br><br>  <b>Tarantula</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39c/da4/4a7/39cda44a72b95b0c200f173a66f36132.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Birds</b> </h4><br>  Well, in general, it is possible for a month to go into the description of who the people are keeping ... so I will not even try and write those who are now the most popular. <br><br>  <b>1. Black Raven</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/112/304/f3f/112304f3f8b4dbc67270f440f8fdab4f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. Owls (most often keep barn owls and long-eared owls)</b> <br>  <b>Barn owl</b> <br><img src="http://www.bizpages.ru/messimg/ann_uploaded113_2009-03-01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Eared owl</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b71/e9c/1b3/b71e9c1b3d148a6b4ea923356f02cbff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Long-tailed tawny</b> <br><img src="http://i057.radikal.ru/1001/32/bfbcd979343b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photos from Nizhny Novgorod Exotarium</i> <br><br>  <b>3. Parrots Ary</b> <br>  Varieties of macaw parrot, very many, I will mention one of my favorite: <br>  Green Wing Macaw <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/680/e4a/581/680e4a581f70e273956bb53096a507fa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>There are in the collection of the Nizhny Novgorod Exotarium.</i> <br><br>  <b>4. Falcons</b> <br>  Sokolov is also very much, for this, as in the cases with Arami, I will show one of my favorites: <br>  They are usually kept at home by hunters or ornithologists.  Although lovers also hold. <br>  <b>Sapsan</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91f/e93/4ac/91fe934ac06d863cf84b5b6a5ab3111f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Especially Owls and Parrots Ar began to keep quite active.  Owls are not demanding, eat 1.5 mice or measure in meat per day.  Ary, well, it's already more difficult, because they are expensive, even very much, for example: Green-winged macaw will cost from 40 to 80 tons.  Yes, and the disease they have quite difficult to treat, in the provinces, so all with this problem. <br><br><h4>  <b>Now go to the general section</b> </h4><br>  Here I will write someone else hold, without details. <br><br>  <b>Achatina snails</b> (quite popular, easy to maintain, few requirements, eat vegetables, fruits) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/849/0bf/ca4/8490bfca47089deaf5e0b9c763a707a6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Madagascar hissing cockroach</b> (eat vegetables, fruits, contain easily) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99f/0d7/e80/99f0d7e80daeed1f69bf237307c7fda6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Kivsyaki</b> (rare stuff) <br><img src="http://s49.radikal.ru/i125/0905/65/240df3015eda.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Crocodiles</b> (even nothing to describe, at home to keep it more expensive) <br><img src="http://s003.radikal.ru/i204/1001/af/c451b4609f99.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>I took this photo at the Green Parrot Clinic (January 21)</i> <br><br>  <b>Ferrets</b> (now very popular) <br><img src="http://i.uralweb.ru/albums/fotos/files/a6b/a6bb5c622640148c4249f5b4eef58e00.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>Turtles</b> </h4><br>  I‚Äôll dwell on them and sign for them. <br><br>  <b>1. Land Turtle</b> <br>  The people, in no case they can not keep at home, just letting go for a walk around the apartment.  You kill the animal with it.  Turtles die slowly, so they suffer for a long time, just because they just walk on the floor.  They need to be kept in the terrarium with the conditions, that is, the soil, drinking bowl, the right food.  Why can not they walk on the floor ?!  Because their limbs are deformed, diseases of internal organs from dirt and dust appear on the floor, etc., the ground is needed to prevent deformation of the legs, they also like to drip))) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72e/158/556/72e158556fee7af6669f1ec4c5909dab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. Plover tortoise</b> <br>  Oh, how many sick and half-dead Krasnoushek brought me, even scary ... People, here without comment, before the content of such turtles should be treated as if you are having a child. <br><img src="http://i56.beon.ru/86/93/759386/93/24874593/vidd037c.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <s><b>Well, that's all.</b></s>  Of course, I did not describe and did not even describe 1% of those who are kept at home, but this is impossible, since you can keep almost everyone.  In our Nizhny Novgorod Exotarium more than 700 species of different animals, in Moscow I am even afraid to count. <br>  Now I want to add something from myself, as a person whose animals are not only a hobby, but also part of life. <br><br>  PS: Be responsible, to those whom you keep, do not feed animals with what you eat, only a person does not die from sausage and cheese, for animals it is poison-like, it acts which slowly </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81635/</a></p>
