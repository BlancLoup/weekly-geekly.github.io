  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NFC - let's go ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past two decades, the importance of physical money is gradually declining, and, according to forecasts, very soon we can expect a future without cash.  62% of Americans believe that they will find that moment when cash disappears from circulation, and in the UK cash payments account for less than half of all payments, and the use of electronic money is also growing in Russia.  At the same time, we are witnessing fundamental changes in how we use public transport, which is associated with the introduction of mobile technologies, geolocation systems and NFC by the authorities and companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/b33/088/f2db330887aa4f94aff55c1a04eafe0d.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have already talked about the widespread use of contactless payment cards, but still the main factor contributing to these changes is the development of mobile payments and the use of mobile devices to pay for travel.  According to Future Market Insights, this year the world's population will spend about 769 billion dollars using mobile devices, which is 42% higher than 550 billion dollars last year.  And it is possible that this growth will continue until the moment comes when using the card will look as strange as today - writing a check. <br><br>  In China, mobile phone manufacturers Xiaomi and Huawei have launched their own NFC-based payment services (Huawei Pay and Mi Pay).  Both of these services were launched with the support of China Union Bank and use biometric authentication and tokenization technologies to enhance security.  Meanwhile, in the US, according to a recent survey by First Annapolis Consulting, 89% of iPhone users heard about Apple Pay, 64% of Android users heard about Android Pay, and 54% of Samsung users heard about Samsung Pay.  These are impressive numbers, especially given that this is about the growing popularity of this technology in the two largest mobile device markets in the world.

      NFC technology has already been launched in almost 70 countries of the world, including France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Holland, Poland, Canada, Japan, South Korea, China, New Zealand and, of course, Russia.  Major initiatives to introduce contactless payments in transport have been launched in the largest cities of Europe and Asia. <br><br>  Today, dozens of cities around the world offer the possibility of purchasing tickets using NFC.  At the same time, each month the penetration rate of this technology is getting higher: new services are emerging, and people are beginning to realize that their smartphone combines all the tickets that they need. <br><br>  If you are faced with a choice - whether to buy a phone or smart watches or bracelets with NFC support, or, on the contrary, you want to understand how much your service will be demanded using this technology, consider the following numbers. <br><br>  The NFC ecosystem is constantly growing, an increasing number of smartphones support technology, which increases the choice for the consumer.  According to the 2015 GSMA report on the mobile economy, in 2014 alone, 43 commercial launches of mobile services using NFC took place, and the total number of commercial and pilot launches has already exceeded 300 worldwide. <br><br>  As shown by Juniper Research data, the number of NFC-enabled smartphones sold will also continue to grow.  In their study, they suggest that the total number of smartphones with NFC support worldwide will increase from 740 million at the end of 2015 to 3.9 billion by 2020, that is, more than 5 times in five years.  Buying tickets using mobile devices is also becoming increasingly popular on both land and air transport and will receive an extra boost with the increase in the number of wearable devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9de/ba3/df0/9deba3df0b054516b3fb45d50d9736d7.png" width="100%"><br><br>  In addition, it is worth noting the increasingly widespread biometric authorization devices that meet the security requirements of payment networks, and at the same time are easy to learn and use - which makes the development and increase in the popularity of mobile and contactless payments even faster. <br>  Now that the technical infrastructure is ready, and users are becoming more aware of the services they offer, the time has come for the next stage to continue popularizing this technology.  Having implemented many global projects, we have learned a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/312404/">few lessons</a> , which we hope will help you in deploying new services and solutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317120/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317120/</a></p>
