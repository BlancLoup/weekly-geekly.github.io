PI is considered on the simplified taxation system (USN) with a tax payment scheme of 6% of income and without wage earners - that is, you are your own; <br>  5. you provide IT services (programming, design, consulting, etc.). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Do not forget about these items!

      What we need for our business: <br>  - certificate of IP registration - with this I think everything is clear and so <br>  - bank accounts <br>  - contract with the customer <br><br><h4>  Banks </h4><br>  I recommend to study which banks are represented in your region, what tariffs they have for settlement and cash services (CSC) and what percentage do they charge for performing currency control functions. <br>  Here it should be noted that some banks take some fixed amount when opening an account, but then do not charge anything for the monthly service.  And if you plan to work long and fruitfully, then this is the best option that minimizes costs.  Next, you need to pay attention to the cost of such a transaction as an intrabank transfer (usually generally free), the cost of processing the transaction passport, the cost of currency control services.  Based on these parameters, you need to choose a bank. <br><br>  Also, the important thing is the availability of a good Internet bank and the ability to submit all documents remotely - this will completely save you from visiting the bank. <br><br>  The bank will give you two accounts.  The first is a current account in the currency for the IP and the second is a transit currency account.  In your invoices, you will specify the transit one, that is, the money will initially flow to it. <br><br>  And in the same bank you need to open an account, but as an individual, in the same currency as the contract currency.  But you can not do this if you want to receive rubles (again, the bank may have an unfavorable exchange rate). <br><br><h4>  the contract </h4><br>  All this is ultimately necessary in order to make a profit, and for this you need a contract with the customer.  You have got him from somewhere and you want to formalize your relationship, and it is normal to use the received profit in Russia, without fear that you will do something wrong or they will <s>take</s> you <s>to the ass to be</s> fined. <br><br>  It is best to issue the contract in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once (of course, if your customer understands Russian, then you can simply in Russian), otherwise you will have to translate the contract and notarize it.  This is done by simply splitting the page in half: on the left in Russian, on the right - English.  Sign, scan, refer to the bank.  No "live signatures", seals and other nonsense will not be asked, and if they are, demand a foundation. <br><br>  Now one trick.  In order not to do acts of reception and transmission each time, to sign and scan them - it is possible to prescribe in the contract a clause stating that payment by the customer of an invoice (account) entails acceptance of the services rendered. <br><br>  All design is over.  It may take about a week to open bank accounts, and a working day is required for processing paperwork on the contract and passport of the transaction.  Perhaps the bank will ask some questions and ask for something in the contract to supplement or correct it - I recommend listening to the advice of the bank, since they act in your own interests (of course, they act primarily in their own interests, but if you are fined financial violation, then they, too). <br><br>  There is still an important point (thanks to <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dihalt/" class="user_link">DIHALT</a> that I recalled) - it is necessary to <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dihalt/" class="user_link">state</a> in the contract who bears the costs of banking operations, and sometimes it happens (this was especially evident in 2009) that banks can charge commissions for the passage of money, usually 10- 15 cu  and even if the sender sends and the commission for sending is charged off, it is not a fact that the exact amount that was sent to you from the sender will come to you.  Accordingly, there will be a discrepancy.  And the bank will pull you on this subject.  So this must be taken into account too. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  And then you provide a service, issue an invoice to the customer, in the same way in two languages ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, I write each field in English, and indicate the Russian translation in brackets and there are no problems) and wait for its payment. <br><br>  When you find out that the customer has paid your bill, after about 3-5 days (and sometimes every other day), the money falls to the transit account and you will receive a notification about it.  You can arrange to call you from currency control, you can check every day ‚Äúdid not send the money‚Äù via the Internet bank, or you can ask the currency control specialist to simply send you an email that the money has come - there is nothing complicated about it. <br><br><h4>  Input Output </h4><br>  After you have received the money on your transit account, you must provide the bank (all this is sent via the Internet bank) with two pieces of paper and it is written in detail <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/132360/">here</a> .  When certificates are sent, you make an application for transfer from a transit account to a regular one (payment is made).  And immediately make an application for transfer from the usual account of IP to the account of nat.  persons (which we prudently opened in the same bank). <br>  This is all if you want to receive money in foreign currency.  If you want to sell currency and receive rubles - you can sell directly from the transit.  In any case, there is enough space for maneuver and freedom of choice. <br><br>  After the money gets into the account of nat.  persons - they can be immediately withdrawn either at the cash desk or through an ATM (if there is a card and the ATM can issue the necessary currency), as you like.  That is, it is completely your money, white, clean and absolutely legal. <br><br><h4>  Taxes </h4><br>  Taxes are taken into account at the rate of the Central Bank on the day of receipt on the account  Received, recorded, forgotten.  Once a quarter they paid 6% of the total amount and that's it. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  It may seem that this is some kind of terrible procedure that requires a lot of time or some special skills - and nothing like that, everything is quite simple.  And if you really want to do business, then there‚Äôs nothing terrible about finding out how and what works and then doing it with peace of mind. <br><br>  PS <br>  I myself am a programmer and all these banking and accounting things are not very interesting to me, like many here, but still forced myself to understand and have no regrets, since the seeming horror actually turns out to be all nonsense. <br>  And if it seems to someone that offshore is much better and simpler and less taxable, then the flag will be in his hands and let him show what offshore legal money gives in Russia at a rate of less than 6%. <br><br>  If everything frightens you very much, then just as in the case of offshore companies, you can contact the accounting office, where you will be given all the documents for a small fee, advised, etc., and then your head will not hurt at all.  Although I still recommend to do everything myself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132432/</a></p>
