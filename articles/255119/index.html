The exponential growth of the volume and the complexity of the semantics of these assets force business owners to continuously assess and minimize the information security risks associated with these assets. <br><br>  One of the necessary conditions for economically viable risk minimization is the implementation of the ILM strategy - Information Lifecycle Management (information management and storage strategy), which involves a differentiated approach to storing and managing company information at all stages of its life cycle. <br>  In turn, a prerequisite for implementing the ILM strategy is the use of ISS - Intelligent Storage Systems (intelligent storage systems) and SAN - Storage Area Networks (storage networks).

      The development and implementation of standards in this industry is engaged in a non-profit association of leading manufacturers ( <a href="http://www.snia.org/member_com/member_directory">EMC, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, etc.</a> ) <a href="http://www.snia.org/member_com/member_directory">.</a> SSIA - SNIA - Storage Network Industry Association.  The Association is the operator of a developed <a href="http://www.snia.org/education/certification">vendor-independent certification</a> program for all significant categories of specialists in the SSCS: engineers, architects and experts.  In 2011, SNIA delegated the compulsory initial exam on the basics of SSDS to the <a href="http://www.comptia.org/about-us">CompTIA</a> association already known from previous articles in this series - this is how one of the most popular ‚Äúyoung‚Äù certifications, <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/storage.aspx">Storage +,</a> was born. <br>  My mentor <a href="http://de.linkedin.com/pub/ting-ying-li/5/8a1/109/en">Ting-Ying Li</a> from EMC Corporation introduced me to her when I began to specialize in <a href="https://russia.emc.com/storage/index.htm">data storage systems from</a> this manufacturer. <br><br><h4>  1. Familiarity with certification </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  CompTIA Storage + certification is recognized by leading manufacturers of SSDs and is the ‚Äúentrance ticket‚Äù to vendor-dependent certification for their products, for example, the <a href="https://education.emc.com/guest/certification/">EMC Storage Administrator</a> .  To obtain it, you must pass the test with code <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/storage.aspx">SG0-001</a> worth $ 270 in English in a controlled environment of the Prometric testing center.  For 90 minutes (plus 30 for those who are not native speakers), you must answer 100 questions that test knowledge and skills on the basics of SSDS, namely: <br><br>  1) components <br>  2) communication technology <br>  3) management <br>  4) data protection <br>  5) performance <br><br><h4>  2. Method of preparation </h4><br>  Even those who have graduated in IT and have recommended work experience, I strongly advise you to get or at least prepare (without directly passing the exams) for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/251595/">CompTIA A +</a> , <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/network.aspx">Network +</a> , <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/getCertified/certifications/server.aspx">Server +</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/253353/">Security +</a> certifications - they are indicated in the entry requirements for Storage + candidates. <br><br>  For convenience of preparation, I recommend to present a detailed <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/docs/default-source/exam-objectives/comptia_storage_sg0-001.pdf">list of requirements</a> for candidates for the exam in order from simple to complex, from general to private: <br><br>  1) familiarity with the basics of information storage <br>  2) data center environment <br>  3) RAID technology <br>  4) intelligent storage systems <br>  5) Fiber Channel SAN <br>  6) IP SAN <br>  7) NAS <br>  8) object-oriented and unified storage <br>  9) Business Continuity Basics <br>  10) backup and archiving <br>  11) local replication <br>  12) remote replication <br>  13) cloud computing <br>  14) protection of the infrastructure of SSD <br>  15) management of the infrastructure of ISCS <br><br>  You can prepare for the theoretical part of the exam with the help of self-training materials recommended by CompTIA.  The <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118679210,miniSiteCd-SYBEX.html">Data Storage Networking</a> book from Sybex has helped me a lot.  But it should be understood that such literature only ‚Äútricks‚Äù on a short-term goal - the successful passing of the exam, and the long-term perspective is more interesting - understanding the principles of building and operating SSHD and the willingness to quickly master the features of their implementation in products of a particular manufacturer.  To do this, I highly recommend reading a book on the basics of storing and managing information written by a team of authors from among the leading industry experts and teachers from leading technical universities - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Storage-Management-Virtualized-Environments/dp/1118094832">Information Storage and Management</a> , currently (2015) relevant to the second edition of this remarkable book (version 2). <br><br>  Perhaps these principles will be revealed to you by video tutorials (Computer-based training - CBT), which can be found in search engines by the names of their world leading, for example, Pluralsight (formerly CBT Nuggets), developers, and also by the names of certification statuses and exam codes. <br><br>  I was also greatly helped by the passage of an authorized course by <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/emc/2753/">EMC Information Storage and Management</a> Corporation, which is held at leading training centers and technical universities of <a href="http://microinform.ru/emc/MR-1CP-ISMv2.htm">Moscow</a> , <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/emc/2753">Kiev</a> and <a href="http://www.avalon.ru/Courses/Storage/Courses/About/%3FCourseID%3D837">St. Petersburg</a> . <br><br>  If you prepare for the theoretical part of the exam is possible only with the help of books, then questions checking the availability of practical skills require at least minimal experience in working with real hardware and software of the information security system. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the specific features of an SSDS even at the entry level (not to mention corporate-class solutions) imply the unbearable cost of creating a laboratory stand, and the producers of SSDs almost never produce virtual lightweight versions of their products, unless they are extremely limited in capabilities simulators. <br><br>  Therefore, here I can advise to use the already created educational laboratories.  For example, the first in the CIS <a href="http://www.avalon.ru/Courses/Storage/Lab/">SSHD laboratory</a> on the basis of the Faculty of Retraining of Specialists of the St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University, where my fellow enthusiast <a href="http://ru.linkedin.com/pub/eugene-norka/62/21a/794/en">Yevgeny Norka</a> has been teaching <a href="http://www.avalon.ru/Courses/Storage/Courses/">bachelors, masters and specialists undergoing retraining for</a> <a href="http://www.avalon.ru/Courses/Storage/Lab/">many</a> years already. <br><br>  The same laboratories lease the training centers of Moscow and Kiev authorized by them at SSHD manufacturers, but the cost of training makes them available only to corporate customers who purposefully train their employees. <br><br>  Also, do not forget that every attempt to pass the exam is paid, so it‚Äôs worth ‚Äúdragging yourself‚Äù into paid testing systems (Boson, TestOut, MeasureUp, etc.) with a pool of corresponding exam level questions that emulate what happens on a real exam.  In search engines and subject forums like <a href="http://www.certcollection.org/">www.certcollection.org</a> you can always find these testing systems by exam codes.  Having achieved a consistently high percentage of correct answers (&gt; 90%), one can hope for the successful passing of the exam from the first attempt in the real Prometric testing system (www.prometric.com). <br><br><h4>  3. Result </h4><br>  At the moment (2015), the first version of the exam from 2011 - SG0-001 is still relevant, but in the light of the rapid development of the SSDS, in the next year or two it is worth waiting for its new iteration.  It is also important to remember that the status of Storage + is given for 3 years and for its extension it is required to regularly confirm to the CompTIA operator that you maintain your qualifications up-to-date in the framework of the <a href="http://certification.comptia.org/stayCertified.aspx">Continuous Education</a> program of continuous education. <br><br><h4>  4. Perspectives </h4><br>  Even during the crisis years in the CIS, the SSCS market is continuously expanding and requires qualified specialists, whose training must begin in the academic environment in accordance with the latest standards of this dynamically developing industry.  Storage + is a convenient starting point in the career of an SSDS specialist and will soon be counted in the certifications of the leading manufacturers of these products (EMC, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, etc.) <br><br>  Also, for those who have not read other articles from the CompTIA Certification series, I remind you that in many American universities, undergraduate / graduate programs, as well as additional professional education, CompTIA certification counts, saving time and money for training. <br><br><h4>  5. Continuation of the story </h4><br>  My interest in networks and data storage systems was initially generated by the desire to significantly raise the cost of my normal hour, having received access from products whose value is often measured in millions of dollars.  This led me to the universe of EMC technology, the <a href="https://education.emc.com/guest/certification/">certification program for</a> which I will write a separate series of articles. <br><br>  I look forward to questions about training and certification CompTIA at PashkovK@muk.com.ua <br><hr><br>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/security/">Training courses on information security, which is conducted by the author of the article (TC MUK - Kiev)</a> <br><br>  Training courses on EMC technologies (Kiev) <br>  April 15-17, <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/emc/1747/">VNX Block Storage Management / Storage Management VNX BlockStorage</a> <br>  May 5-8, <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/emc/4890/">Data Domain System Administration Administration of the Data Domain System</a> <br>  May 18-22, <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/emc/1470/">NetWorker Installation, Configuration &amp; Administration Installation, Configuration, and Administration of EMC NetWorker</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255119/</a></p>
