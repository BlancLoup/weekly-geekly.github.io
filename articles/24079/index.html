  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The main mistakes on the presentation of the project before the investor.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For many, what is written below is trivial, but nonetheless errors appear in almost every presentation (and I see them from 200 to 300 per year).  I decided to bring all the frequent repetitive errors together. <br><br>  The main mistake is that entrepreneurs are trying to put everything on the slides.  In fact, only supporting points should be placed on slides. <a name="habracut"></a>  The smaller the text, the better.  Pivot points allow you to change the flow of information depending on the audience and its response.  If you prepare a presentation where everything will be described in too great detail, you will lose the opportunity for maneuver. <br><br>  The main thing that interests the investor is whether the project will earn money.  This means that the project description itself should take one or two slides, but at the same time be complete (see my post for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/34799.html">brevity in the description</a> ). <br>  Instead of painting the project in detail, it is better to indicate why your users will certainly use your product, much less pay money for it. <br>  It is best to describe your Target Audience - positioning becomes immediately clear.

      Market.  There are two extremes: <br>  - about the market did not say anything <br>  - much has been said about the market <br>  I recommend spending two slides on the market.  On the first, indicate the total size of the market, its segmentation and market growth in retrospect and forecasts for the future (it is desirable to operate with data of a marketing research thread), on the second, list the competitors table in the context of key product parameters and show which parameters you will be better off .  It is also necessary to indicate the market share that your project wants to receive in the future. <br><br>  Business model.  It is very important to draw a plan of income with good growth, but it is more important to show who will pay you money for what and when.  I‚Äôll say right away that the advertising model has ceased to be fashionable, it is allowed only if advertising can be very tightly targeted.  If you understand where and for what the money will come, then the numbers will look like a formality, if you guess the orders. <br><br>  You need to understand how much money, when and most importantly what you need.  It is not necessary to paint far, now it will be difficult for you to assume what your funding needs will be in 3-5 years, you have no experience. <br><br>  Team.  Usually they write here horrible.  The description of this section should make it clear that you have team members who can create a technological advantage and people who can build a successful company based on this advantage.  The most recent is to put the CEO of a person with experience in software development.  If you do not have a person in the team with an entrepreneurial nature of character, write that you are looking for him now and are ready to listen to the recommendations of the investor. <br><br>  And we must remember that the project should please the investor as a whole, then he will ask questions and demand details.  If he immediately drowns in the details, he will not see the big picture. <br>  If the presentation is public and time limited, then I recommend using only 2/3 of the time for the presentation, and leave a third to answer the questions (a proven strategy).  If the presentation is face-to-face, it is advisable to make a general presentation, to have with you a sammari (which the investor should have studied by that moment) and a business plan.  From the business plan it is better to make a lot of slides and to find the questions you need very quickly (as an option, run over the printout of the business plan). <br><br>  Questions from the investor - one of the most important parts of the presentation.  Investors are experienced people, and their questions need a lot to think about.  Why did he ask it?  What does he see that which I do not see?  And do not hesitate to ask them questions. <br><br>  A very serious mistake - do not fit in time.  Then a lot of things remain unsaid (most often the most important part of the presentation is the team) and the impression remains of a person who does not know how to manage his time.  Some investors say that if you delayed the presentation - most likely delay the release.  (I considered time issues in the post of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/39705.html">Startup Presentation to the Public</a> <br><br>  And most importantly!  The presentation is considered well done, not when there are no questions left, but when an invitation for further conversation followed. <br><br>  Hope that startups.  who prepare for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/40512.html">SeedCamp will</a> avoid these mistakes.  It is a pity when interesting projects can not submit themselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24079/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24079/</a></p>
