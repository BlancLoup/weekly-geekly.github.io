Non-financial figures</b> <br>  Well, I promised in the previous part of the figures and graphics, I will keep my word.  First I would like to demonstrate the growth dynamics of my project, starting with the first visitor and ending on December 17, 2010.  I do not know why, but the data on unique and views are strikingly different in the three main (used by me) systems for collecting statistics about visitors: Liveinternet, Yandex.Metrica and Google Analytics.  Personally, <b>I prefer the latter</b> in quality and completeness of reports, interface and authority.  Also, naturally, in my interests, a greater number of visits and page views is recorded in GA than in the other two systems.  About the Rambler, I say nothing, perhaps. <br><br>  Here's what the promised visiting dynamics looks like on GA: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c04/5e2/431/c045e243164e1bca5919e8015ed1d831.png">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚Äúbursts‚Äù are also seen in the picture - the consequences of getting posts with links to the site to the main Habra. <br><br>  The dynamics of traffic growth was very balanced and, importantly, almost synchronously with the dynamics of traffic growth from the substation in particular.  This is me to the fact that the god of the Internet was merciful, and I did not receive (pah-pah-pah, so as not to jinx it) any sanctions and, as a result, I did not have, for example, to prevent the failure of the schedule to buy massively traf.  Once again, three times "pah" (pun).  Thus, as far as ongoing: all sorts of PR actions (well, I mean self-made ones), increasing the number of topics and, as a result, increasing the number of pages indexed by PS, and SEO proportionally increased search traffic: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/abb/714/282abb7141cf403e7b76b9e5e2781066.png"><br><br>  On the graph, starting from April and ending with September of this year, you can clearly see the very seasonality about which I wrote in the previous parts.  In 2011 I will try to "ride" on the crest of the predicted second wave, which we see in the picture above. <br><br>  I will answer the question received in the form of a commentary on one and two previous publications, in which it was asked, in particular, on which COP was untwisted.  Unwrapped by the COP, which seemed to me the most "tasty" in the process of competitive intelligence is not closed with a password Liveinternet'ovskih statistics of competing resources.  But it is, I think, very logical. <br><br>  <i><u>Tip 7:</u></i> Conduct competitive intelligence on the COP, for which you intend to unwind, both in the LI and in <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">http://wordstat.yandex.ru</a> . <br><br>  I also recommend novice startups to focus on Google Analytics as a system for collecting statistics about visitors.  It hurts so good. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 8. Finance: from the context to the "serious guys"</b> <br>  I began to sell advertising on the site somewhere for a set of 300 unique per day.  Such is the requirement of Yandex to join its affiliate program.  I don‚Äôt remember if I hung up AdSense to Yandex.Direct, but if so, then it‚Äôs ridiculous to remember those 50-80 cents).  Direct carried a little (for my reasons).  I will not give the numbers, but I will say that having such a resource as mine and Direct in several places (most importantly - under the menu) is not particularly interesting. <br><br>  There is an affiliate program with <a href="http://www.booking.com/index.html%3Faid%3D328116">booking.com</a> (their representative came to my site, but I didn‚Äôt refuse - why refuse something? They don‚Äôt ask for porridge!).  Since November, somewhere in 2009, I have received about 17,000 rubles for all my reservations (another euro 150 is on the way to payment).  Not too interesting as the main way of making money, but it‚Äôs definitely not worth to disdain with such things!  Little is not enough, but 20 000+ rubles a year is the same laptop!  -)) <br><br>  Then he started a partnership with ROPER.  There is a good, high-quality and catchy advertising there (hence the normal CTR).  It carries somewhere twice as direct (the place was: where the Garmin banner is now 240 by 400; the place has become: under the Garmin banner).  Already more interesting, but not quite "Ice". <br><br>  But it became Ice when I am. <br><br>  <i>Tip 8:</i> monetize, too, gradually, experiment.  Probably, taking into account the specifics of each individually taken start-up, you will be able to find some other minor ones (like my own booking), but bringing monetization methods.  And if there are a lot of them?  This will obviously be a good help both BEFORE the placement of serious advertisers and in time. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 9. "According to the clothes they meet."</b> <br><br>  Then, when I realized that I could already be interesting (not I myself, of course, but the <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/">portal</a> ), I began to think about what I wanted to, in the end, come to.  And he came.  Right!  Direct advertiser.  A good friend of mine from one big advertising agency (RA) advised me to make an audience ‚Äúcutoff‚Äù, so that later there would be something to ‚Äútrump‚Äù before potential advertisers.  I am confident in my visitors (in their ‚Äúquality‚Äù, solvency, etc.), but where would such confidence come from an advertiser?  From here was born such a <a href="http://avtoturistu.ru/page/opros">poll</a> (by the way, made with the help of Google documents - very good!), Which was answered by visitors of my community for a couple of months.  I hung up a small banner that called for participation in such a census, both on the site and in <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club9824026">the VKontakte group</a> . <br><br>  And, most importantly, the <u><b>presentation</b></u> .  The presentation (or, in a fashionable way, ‚Äúmedia kit‚Äù) for Avtotourist.ru we did together with my ex-wife, and my colleagues at work (pardon for such verbal tin, but otherwise did not write) helped me as an appearance , and above the contents.  The main outline, pursued when it was created was: so that it is not too faded, but not too pretentious (vulgar);  without going through the text part, but also not stupidly slideshow of pictures;  Well, so that the web viewer looked;  without impudent lies, but not too modestly.  So did.  I think <b><a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/page/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580__%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/">our preza is</a></b> very, very good. <br><br>  <i>Tip 9:</i> The audience slice and presentation are a must!  Without these two tools, like a river without a bridge, it is almost impossible to transfer ‚Äúcontextual monetization‚Äù to the coast ‚Äúserious advertisers‚Äù. <br><br>  Traditionally I complete this part with three written chapters.  In the next part I will continue with the numbers (already with financial ones), tell you about how you came out into relationships with ‚Äúserious uncles‚Äù and figure out what else useful to write for you, a start-up starter! <br><br>  <b>Continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/110582/">Part 4</a> .</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110250/</a></p>
