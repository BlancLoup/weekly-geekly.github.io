  <section class="page js-page"><h1>12 episodes from the history of the keyboard</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day we use the keyboard, both physical and virtual - on the displays of smartphones and tablets.  Let us recall some interesting episodes from the history of this remarkable invention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36e/aa2/58c/36eaa258c9ca46af5dd3e279f300bf86.jpg" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  The Tale of Two Layouts </h4><br>  The QWERTY layout was not created so that we remember it better and faster.  It was created in order to protect mechanical typewriters from damage: everything depended on the frequency of using specific characters. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But the alternative layout, more effective, was developed by Dr. Augustus Dvorak in the 1930s.  The characters were arranged in such a way as to maximize print speed, so that fingers do not make unnecessary movements.  This keyboard was patented in 1936. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6cb/49f/095/6cb49f095f6b47659af8fcb91af454e6.png" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Ergonomic topography </h4><br>  PCD Maltron entered the input device industry in 1977.  Many models have been developed to combat ailments and for the convenience of people with disabilities.  For example, in this photo - the keyboard for one hand created in 1989. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bbb/b77/90b/bbbb7790be5f3b7edb1ec72b0910b4be.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Losing keys </h4><br>  It is much more convenient to type when you clearly feel every key.  In the 1980s, however, there was a short period of time when a membrane keyboard was used.  This format was cheaper to produce, since keys were not needed.  In addition, it was resistant to water and dust.  This budget input interface included small and portable computers like the Sinclair 1000 and Sinclair ZX81. <br><br>  At the same time, this type of input is still used in commercial and consumer devices - for example, in the control panels of microwave ovens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5b/d71/9ff/c5bd719ffeca4c09debea4b5bbe56b64.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Freedom from wires </h4><br>  After the success of business-oriented PCs, IBM made an attempt to capture the PCjr 1984 home computer market.  One of the key "features" was the "Freeboard" - "free keyboard".  The wireless keyboard worked on four AA batteries and contacted the computer using an infrared beam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d70/cbf/b9a/d70cbfb9af1993a7c99042d7d54421a6.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Choose </h4><br>  In 1984, the Apple II, the ‚Äúportable‚Äù personal computer, was released.  The keyboard included a button that allows you to switch between the default QWERTY layout and the alternative Dvorak Keyboard, which was mentioned at the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50f/0a6/140/50f0a61400e66c1b86b82faa81a8c15a.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Keyboard for your watch </h4><br>  In the 1980s, long before the current hysteria on the topic of ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù, computers began to decrease to the size of wrist form factors.  The Seiko Data 2000 and UC-2000 models could store two thousand characters in memory, but they still needed a keyboard.  Both of these models come with a portable keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ecb/ee2/907/ecbee2907eaa9e4ec018460d42c0a5a7.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Classic </h4><br>  The IBM Model M, a 1985 computer, was a workhorse focused on the corporate segment.  The keyboard with its more than 100 keys was very comfortable.  And the special keystroke mechanism made this keyboard classic. <br><br>  The spring immediately after pressing returned the key to its place with a characteristic click. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f02/710/882/f027108820985caded54bbfd0c6cac40.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Joy for a hacker </h4><br>  While the Model M had a lot of keys, in Happy Hacking Keyboard their number was reduced to 60. Only the most necessary remained.  This compact keyboard has been manufactured at Fujitsu since 1996. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d00/51e/780/d0051e780b7043c30636a9f254c4e3da.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Transformation </h4><br>  To print on early PDAs was not so painful, the company Think Outside has developed for them a full-size keyboard Stowaway.  It was a kind of docking station for PDAs, allowing the user to comfortably type on normal keys.  When the device was not needed, it was folded, taking up not much space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/341/2d7/951/3412d79513bee1322884bbff25f2d891.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Virtuality </h4><br>  In 2002, Canesta, a startup that lived in Silicon Valley, wanted to bring the keyboard's portability to a new level, depriving it of its physical embodiment.  The infrared sensor was supposed to monitor the user's finger movements. <br><br>  The company licensed the technology to another company - Korean Celluon, which introduced this technology into various devices like evoMouse, Prodigy case and projector for iPhone, and also Magic Cube (now called Epic).  In 2010, Canesta was bought by Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88d/85d/e47/88d85de4722ece390e76856d59355f61.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Touch pixels </h4><br>  Both the projection and the virtual keyboards have one drawback: there is not enough feedback.  Of course, you can turn on the vibration, but you will not become better at distinguishing the keys from it. <br><br>  Tactus is hoping to solve this problem.  The tixel tactile pixels will protrude, and when the keyboard is not needed, go back, making the display flat again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85f/f91/b2d/85ff91b2dd623fff2b458f5d652c2784.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Something for professionals </h4><br>  We saw keyboards optimized for programmers and office workers, and here is a version for gamers. <br><br>  Keyboard 2012 Mad Catz STRIKE 7 has ample opportunities for customization, as well as many additional keys.  Many additional components, including an LCD touch screen, turn this keyboard into something more than just an input device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b91/d0d/083/b91d0d08306f8759d2417b84561e587c.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br>  And these two keyboards are for video editing.
