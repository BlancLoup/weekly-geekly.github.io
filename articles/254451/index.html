  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clickberry - perhaps the most powerful video platform on MS Azure is now open source</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As long as the software development industry exists, so much is the eternal battle of closed source with open source.  How many copies were broken, do not count.  We, at Clickberry, also in this battle, 3 years on one side, and now, you can consider us defectors, we are on the other.  Meet us in the open source camp.  For those who don't know, Clickberry is a platform for creating, storing and distributing video in general and interactive video in particular. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fff/fa9/79c/ffffa979c29b65c2dcca1b6354be81c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  First, let's discuss what an interactive video is.  This is what allows the viewer to interact with the video stream.  Youtube annotations are the easiest example.  Links inside the video to external pages, additional information in pop-up windows, Facebook likes attached to objects (this is our technology), all this is available and available in different products from various developers: Videoclix, Wirewax, Interlude and many others.  All of them, even quite advanced and popular, have one drawback.  They are sharpened for one specific task, whether it is advertising, music video or e-commerce.  The functionality set is usually strongly limited to the particular specialization chosen.  Like the platform, but is it sharpened for another?  Look for the same, "but with pearl buttons."

      Many systems, all different.  There are no standards.  In some, one is good, in others - another.  We looked at this picture a lot on the one hand and on the other.  Each system fights for a customer.  It protects its technology.  He tries to make himself even more proprietary and tie the user to him as much as possible. <br><br>  And what if there is an interactive video platform, open, basic, based on which you can do what a specific developer needs.  You want - modify under e-commerce.  You want - under music videos.  You want ... yes whatever.  In fact, a flexible system in which the basic elements are laid, on the basis of which you can build any video system, including an interactive one.  So we decided that our Clickberry Video Portal product is suitable for this role.  For 3 years we have invested thousands of hours of design, development and testing in it.  We created all the necessary basic modules that will allow using our (or rather already common) system to create video platforms of any complexity and architecture. <br><br><h5>  Clickberry Video Portal </h5><br>  Video portal is a distributed software system designed for fast video delivery for various software platforms.  The general scheme of the main components of the system: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbc/9a3/233/fbc9a323348775c160127d8d82b8de5e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The portal has a multi-tier architecture in which the main services Front-end, Middle-end and Back-end are distinguished.  Client applications using the portal REST API can execute custom scripts, for example, creating video projects or managing files.  In particular, users in the browser, through the SPA, can authenticate through social networks or a couple of login / password and view, comment on others and manage their videos. <br><br>  Since from the very beginning we used the Microsoft technology stack, the technologies underlying the Clickberry Video Portal are relevant: cloud services and virtual machines Azure, Blob Storage, CDN, ACS, .NET 4.5, ASP.NET MVC, Web API, AngularJS.  However, over time, Azure Table Storage, which ceased to meet business requirements, was replaced by MongoDB, and Cassandra was used to collect statistics and likes. <br><br><h5>  Front-end </h5><br>  This web role consists of the following IIS virtual applications: <br><ul><li>  The Web is an ASP.NET MVC static transfer application (Web UI). </li><li>  The API is an ASP.NET Web API application that provides a REST API for client applications. </li></ul><br><br>  The front-end was designed and implemented with support for vertical and horizontal scaling.  Its main task is a public access point for client applications. <br><br><h5>  Middle-end </h5><br>  This role consists of the following applications: <br><ul><li>  The API is an ASP.NET Web API application that provides a REST API for Back-end servers. </li><li>  Scheduler is a background service that performs daily aggregation of statistical information. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Back-end </h5><br>  This working role contains services that process video files, for example, video encoding to webm and mp4 formats or creating snapshots from video. <br><br>  The back-end was designed and implemented with support for vertical and horizontal scaling. <br><br>  Our product was originally developed for Microsoft Azure, and at the moment is probably one of the most advanced in terms of functionality and manufacturability in Azure, and as an open source video platform for Azure, in general, perhaps the only one. <br><br><h5>  So why did we decide to transfer our product to open source? </h5><br>  We believe that in this form the technology is much more likely to win a place in the sun.  No matter how hard we try, it is not possible to make a product that is good and applicable to all types of video and all customer needs.  However, by making the product open, we enable new modules to appear, application possibilities, and even new (why not?) Market segments.  I have been seen many times as clients and partners, they are not satisfied with one thing, or they want to refine another, to fit their specific needs, but the closure of the platform stops. <br><br>  Now it is not.  The first open source video platform with interactivity features for Azure is available to both partners and enthusiasts.  Everything that previously required development from scratch can now be obtained by taking our system as a basis and refining it to fit our needs, contributing to the development of interactive video.  For our part, we are ready to assist in the development, configuration of infrastructure and launch, as well as open to joint projects in any field related to video in Azure in general and with interactive video in particular. <br><br>  View work Clickberry Video Portal, you can at: <br>  <a href="https://clickberry.tv/">https://clickberry.tv/</a> <br><br>  You can find the repository of the project, as well as participate in the development of the platform at: <br>  <a href="https://github.com/clickberry/video-portal">https://github.com/clickberry/video-portal</a> <br><br>  Product documentation can be found on the pages: <br>  <a href="https://github.com/clickberry/video-portal/wiki">https://github.com/clickberry/video-portal/wiki</a> <br><br>  We always welcome feedback, so we are waiting for your questions and suggestions at info@clickberry.com, and are also open to <a href="https://github.com/clickberry/video-portal/pulls">working together on a project.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254451/</a></p>
