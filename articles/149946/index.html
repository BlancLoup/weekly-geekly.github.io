  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Two stories about communication with one of the leading Russian telecoms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, habrayuzer. <br><br>  Fasting would be more suitable for Friday, but while dinner is going on ... Let's write off a couple of funny experiences to get the utility from, as I wrote in the title, the leading Russian telecom. <br>  Under the cut, in fact, two stories, the first happened a long time ago, then this telecom had a different name, but the second one is happening today.  Yes, there will be another question at the end, but this is already the lyrics. <br><br>  These stories do not pretend to originality and occur constantly, and not only with telecoms.  But, I hope, after reading, you smile (like funny stories), well, having organized your business and grown it to the same size, you'll pay a little more attention to what is called customer focus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  So, the first story.  About <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRI">BRI</a> </h5><br>  It happened a long time ago.  At that time, at least in Kaluga, this telecom was called Centertelecom.  A thoughtful and legally savvy reader might want to correct me, pointing out that there were swallows, resale and so on, but it doesn't matter if the people who work in the organization have not changed, and the approach has remained the same ... <br>  The director of the plant where I looked after the net asked to organize two more BRIs, since  the available three became missed.  Well, it is necessary and necessary.  We discussed what they would be used for and decided that it would be nice to order 8 external numbers to one of them, and to another 2. We wrote a letter and took the letter to the office.

      Knowing the features, then CenterTelecom, I had patience and waited.  Two weeks passed.  Patience is over.  Ok, call and remind.  And yes, there is an application, but the employee who took it went on leave.  I was asked not to worry and promised to prepare an invoice for a couple of days.  Taking the bill and paying it, I got the second portion of patience.  As you know, it was useful. <br><br>  After calling two weeks later, I listened with pleasure that the employee who wrote me the bill went on vacation ... Ok, well, at least the work began. <br><br>  I am waiting.  About a week later, a wonderful girl called me, who said that you can do 8 numbers on the BRI, but 2 technologies do not allow.  At my understandable perplexity, that if you can eight, why you can‚Äôt register six empty ones, the girl thought and promised to clarify. <br><br>  A week later, a miracle happened!  They called me and said that the installers would come to set up the equipment.  For those who are not very aware, BRI can be used with different equipment: telephones and PBX.  And if with telephones (the most frequent option) there is also a sense to tune something, then when plugging BRI into the PBX, the situation is as follows: the wire is plugged into the modem (without a single control button or interface connector for setting), and from the modem goes immediately in the PBX.  I tried to convey this simple scheme to the dispatcher, who offered to agree on a time for the installers to arrive.  All my attempts to explain that the modem can not be configured, and in the PBX, I will not let anyone know, they stumbled upon a wall of incomprehension.  An attempt to enter from the other side, with the explanation that I didn‚Äôt need anything from them except the pair numbers in the fifty-pair from the nearest PBX to the plant and the phone numbers assigned to BRI, also failed.  True, I was offered to transfer the call to the head, in order to explain to me that I do not understand anything and need to adjust the equipment.  Switched.  Another 30 minutes to the dog's tail and agreed on the time of arrival of installers "to tune the equipment." <br><br>  Okay, since the installers should arrive, the BRI is already connected.  We take the tester, run through the plinth.  Oops!  One BRI found.  We switch it to a modem, a wire from a modem to a PBX.  Hooray!  It worked.  Looking for a second pair.  I run to the end of the plinth - no.  Once again - no.  OK.  Waiting for installers. <br><br>  The next day, at exactly the appointed time, the installers came (together, apparently setting is a very complicated process).  Well, I ask, what numbers are assigned to BRI on a pair with number N. Yeah, that's the BRI where there are 8 numbers.  I drive them into the PBX.  I‚Äôm dialing from my mobile, the call goes to the phone that is on the table.  Gud  I ask installers a question on the second BRI. <br>  Here should play tush.  They have only one dress!  Pancake!  I call the office.  A lovely girl happily reports that I have one BRI ordered in my application.  I ask her to look at my application, invoice and payment again.  I hear the sound of a pipe placed next to the apparatus and ... like someone from them there yelling with a man‚Äôs voice: ‚ÄúWell, when will you learn to read what they bring to you !!!‚Äù.  Ales, I almost dropped the phone.  Okay, the same male voice, after a couple of minutes, picked up the phone and said that within a couple of days I would get the second BRI connected. <br><br>  So, most of all I was pleased installers.  They listened to my dialogue with the office and asked: ‚ÄúCan we come to you next time and don‚Äôt just go and say phones and a pair number?‚Äù.  It was here that the third reserve of patience came in handy to tell them in parliamentary terms how much I killed yesterday to explain this fact to their boss. <br>  Then it was already boring, so let the first story on this finish. <br><br><h5>  The second story.  Optics in every home </h5><br>  As I said at the beginning of the post, I live in Kaluga.  It is a quiet provincial town two hundred kilometers from Moscow.  True, this is Moscow, recently, we have jumped heavily to us, but the story is not about that.  With internet providers, we are now more or less.  There are wired, wireless, with Internet from the outlet and even on optics.  In the house where I live optics, for a long time, no one turned on.  Having tried several options, I stopped at Domolinka from Rostelecom, using ADSL2 technology.  The connection was falling regularly, but since I‚Äôve got the internet from my house, and playing with toys, it didn‚Äôt bother me too much. <br><br>  A month ago, they called me on a wired phone with good news: ‚ÄúThey brought optics to your house.  Do you want to switch from ADSL to it? ‚Äù.  Looking at the tariffs, and reliability should be higher - agreed.  Because  transition from ADSL to ADSL2 took a week, immediately clarified, we will be laid in one day?  Having received the answer, yes, and the recommendation to wait for a call from installers on Wednesday, in order to reach an agreement on Thursday, got out a little battered patience and waited.  Reader, have you of course already guessed that they did not call me on the promised Wednesday?  But, since  Patience is still got, I waited on.  A week later, when I was at work, they called the home one again with a proposal to switch to optics.  My wife said that we did not mind, and gave my mobile.  Started circus with horses.  When I asked what was there with my previous application, they told me that there was an overlay (not a word about the holidays), but now that, they will take me under personal control and everything will be fine.  It was Friday lunchtime.  By evening, they called me again and, apologizing for not having time today, promised to contact me on Monday.  8 days have passed since that Monday. <br><br>  Actually the promised question: of those who work in Rostelecom, respected by me, no one knows what happened to the girl who called me and where did she go along with her personal control? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149946/</a></p>
