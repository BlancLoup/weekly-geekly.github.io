I‚Äôll tell you straight away - so far I haven‚Äôt proved myself to be either a tough IT specialist or a great Internet businessman.  Of course, I am more or less up to date with modern trends, I imagine what is web 2.0, the blogosphere, social networks and ... many other words to the right of the main Habr :) But I'm not a guru. <br>  However, I look forward to success.  On the one hand, I am doing business offline quite well, on the other hand I am familiar with the history of top4top.  The second deprives me of the excessive confidence that the money will do everything for me, the first allows me to hope for my sober and uncompromising glance.  Therefore, the very first conclusion that suggests itself is as follows: Since he is not an expert himself, trust the experts.  And then the second conclusion: Since ... emmmm ... as if it were without specifics ... once experienced investors make mistakes with the selection of performers, with the idea, and with the performance itself - it is naive to hope that I will succeed.  Therefore, we attract collective intelligence.  ;) <br>  So, dear habrasoobschestvo, you have the opportunity in the most direct sense to participate in the birth of a startup and help him ... or kill ... :) Nobody ever did this, so why not try it? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Input data: <br>  <b>Financing</b> : my function <br>  <b>Budget</b> : in the range of $ 450,000 to a confident exit to the growth stage. <br>  <b>Duration</b> : 9 months <br>  <b>Idea</b> : I propose, we all develop together <br>  <b>Management</b> : collective intelligence.  Postulate: we submit to the reasonable majority. <br>  <b>Execution</b> : recruited command.  Options are possible. <br>  <b>Purpose</b> : to create a project that a) will be useful and demanded by users, b) will be financially successful. <br><br>  Get down to business.

      <b>Popular and promising in RuNet</b> : Vkontakte, Classmates, LJ, Habr, Yaroshka, Imhonet, Mamba, GoogleRider <br>  What from this should take: <br><br>  <b>Circles</b> - communication based on common characteristics (interests, age, region, place of study or work) <br>  <b>Blogs</b> are content, their place on the Web, a tool for self-expression. <br>  <b>Collective content</b> is another strong binding factor, a catalyst for development.  (Groups, communities, community blogs?) <br>  <b>Ratings, voting</b> - the opportunity to express their attitude to the phenomenon / fact / action / personality, social recommendations. <br>  <b>Media Galleries</b> - the user should not be constrained by the ability to produce media content - pictures, video, audio. <br>  <b>The format is a platform</b> .  Not the site on which admins rule and their livelihoods are consumed by users, namely the platform.  Where each user organizes and equips his own habitat. <br>  <b>Niche and subject</b> - you should choose one unoccupied and promising niche.  Or create a lot of narrow-topic projects.  Considering the previous point, we decide: each user account is a full-fledged thematic project. <br>  <b>Syndication</b> - the ability to both aggregate the necessary user content from external sources (rss, xml, what else?), And to give the outside in a convenient format. <br>  <b>Tags, Folksonomy</b> - high-quality rubrication of materials is necessary as air.  No admin can handle this better than the users themselves. <br>  <b>Open platform</b> - API for developers. <br>  <b>User influence</b> - evaluation of ideas, selection of functionality, formation of a project development strategy <br>  <b>Fashion</b> - modern gadgets, without which the project will look like a product of the Soviet era.  Ajax, drug &amp; drop, drop-down tips, custom themes, RSS, compatibility with mobile devices, etc. <br><br>  And all this needs to be combined into an organic and understandable service - something between a webOS and a social service. <br><br>  <b>Promotion strategy</b> <br>  a) media plans, budgets ... - traditional advertising <br>  b) non-standard, viral advertising, hidden promotion - "Jeans" <br>  c) dirty promotion - spam, buying user databases, etc. <br>  d) Google's strategy - we do not give direct advertising, we make more of a good product in demand. <br><br>  The third option, as I understand it, works effectively from the point of view of the project owner, but it causes a lot of negativity to users. <br>  Morally ready for the first option, but I would love to go on the <s>third</s> fourth path.  If the project builds the whole community - why not?  Is it real? <br><br>  <b>Monetization strategy</b> <br>  1) paid services - unpromising in runet, poorly perceived by users. <br>  2) advertising - contextual advertising based on all the knowledge about the user, his interests and actions - REALLY USEFUL, minimal annoyance, the obligatory observance of complete confidentiality. <br><br>  I see a more promising second option. <br><br>  <b>Stages</b> : <br>  - Formation of ideas and visions of the project <br>  - Preparation of technical documentation, drawing up a business plan. <br>  - Search / collect team <br>  - Technical implementation <br>  - Run <br>  - Promotion, continuous development <br>  - Monetization and capitalization <br><br>  I need your opinion, assessment, requirements and suggestions.  I need your participation. <br>  What else is needed, what is missing in my scheme?  What am I wrong?  What would you like to see in the project as a user?  What would you advise to implement as a specialist? <br><br>  PS If my project is accepted by the community, the next post will be the first step.  It will contain a description of the model and functionality of the project.  I spread the skeleton and we discuss it, change and supplement it.  Those who want to participate in the formation of the skeleton - unsubscribe here or in personal.  I will be glad to everyone. <br><br>  PPS do not want to hear anything about the crisis.  For the most part because of him, I decided to invest in an Internet project. <br><br>  Dmitry Matetsky </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49558/</a></p>
