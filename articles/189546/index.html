  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review Wexler.Tab 7b: tablet "for two rubles"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until last year, Wexler did not stand out on the tablet front - it was a typical B-brand medium with the same average ‚Äútablets‚Äù in all parameters.  This was the case with the announcement of the model Wexler.Tab 7t with nVidia Tegra 3. That is, not the most famous Russian brand suddenly took and released a device that is better than ASUS Nexus 7 in terms of price and functionally. Unfortunately, such ‚Äúinsights‚Äù happen quite rarely, so now I will talk about the representative of the budget segment, model Wexler.Tab 7b.  This tablet seems to give a kind of "entrance ticket" to the world of mobile Android - here you and 3 990 rubles of price, and 3G support. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb0/60c/fec/eb060cfecb5edf6e4f884f330dbd0601.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  "On paper" the device looks very attractive: the battery is as much as 5000 mAh, ... ....  Perhaps this is all.  On the Wexler website, it‚Äôs impossible to look at the model; for some reason, the brand only shows miniatures about 200 x 200 pixels in size.  And in vain.  If the visitors of the resource could consider the tablet in all details, the interest in it would be clearly higher.  Why?  A little patience - about everything in order. <br><br><h4>  Package and package </h4>  The model comes in a box with a white background on the front and ends - an ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù solution for long-term storage and protection from dirt.  At least it‚Äôs good that the lower platform was not made ‚Äúglamorous‚Äù - but they forgot to specify distinct technical characteristics.  "Powerful battery" and "Wireless Internet" do not count. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/779/05a/716/77905a7165a2c1f8ee6aef02f04a76d4.jpg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/abb/beb/e35/abbbebe35bc3ad3b69234c389243f166.jpg"><br><br>  However, enough to find fault with the box, inside there are really interesting things.  For example, the warranty card is combined with the instruction.  This is done in the form of a large two-sided sheet of cardboard with a palm-high.  Originally, but the convenience of going to the service with such a "guarantee" raises some doubts. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/281/38c/1ae/28138c1ae1e153e5e748dd5662cd9781.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a37/d13/59b/a37d1359b26c6154fba84728411a86f9.jpg"><br><br>  Wexler decided to make accessories as branded as possible, the brand logo is marked on both ends of the microUSB cable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/702/c56/769/702c5676921dd61bf3d5c869be86dfef.jpg"><br><br>  The charging unit is also not lagging behind - the most non-standard in form I have ever seen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f80/733/92f/f8073392fa915d37845ef97815aa30a6.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4>  Taking the tablet out of the box, we reveal its main intrigue - the whole "salt" of the model lies in the case.  First, it weighs almost half a kilo - to be exact, 390 grams.  Secondly, the case thickness is 12.5 mm.  And this is the case when in reality the numbers are felt even more clearly than ‚Äúon paper‚Äù.  The body of the model is completely in bends, which are designed to make it more ergonomic.  I liked the relief, as it easily distinguishes Wexler.Tab 7b from its own kind. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20e/79e/3c7/20e79e3c7cb0f324f8883e29228f9147.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb7/e74/67b/eb7e7467b028b1df45d3187b5ce33ca9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e05/3e5/114/e053e51144ad6f636628e123365cb617.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34a/b55/ca6/34ab55ca6e5a88e20bf65fb85bc5d07d.jpg"><br><br>  The back side material is a familiar soft-plastic, coupled with ‚Äúperforation‚Äù, while holding it is rather pleasant.  The paradox is obvious, as during the work there is a persistent feeling that we have a secure tablet.  However, Wexler himself says nothing about it.  As a result, we get a rather heavy and large 7-inch ‚Äúpill‚Äù, although neither the first nor the second is justified by anything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/345/449/e72/345449e7292dbad027687f546c9aea1e.jpg"><br><br>  Along the edges at the top you can see the slots of the speakers, which can be called a good solution - the sound does not overlap if the device is held in hands in landscape orientation.  As practice shows, some manufacturers are guided by completely incomprehensible categories when choosing the location of the speakers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e0/8c7/de7/2e08c7de795bf6f6c868f2c4ae9e08ab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/751/ae9/05b/751ae905b5e4ea6b2ee8276a4155147e.jpg"><br><br>  Almost all connectors and other elements are located on the right side.  This connector microUSB, slot for memory card microSD, port miniHDMI, full USB, audio output and Reset button.  Strange, but I didn‚Äôt need the last one - the tablet always coped with hangs on its own. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28c/7cc/6a4/28c7cc6a4b69197638fa775176fa954f.jpg"><br><br>  Below is a slot for a SIM-card, which would be worth it to cover the cap. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/303/a2f/cec/303a2fcec7b92d3c3bfe301155793156.jpg"><br><br>  Wexler coped well with the choice of seats for the speakers, but it didn‚Äôt go further, the volume and power keys were set side by side on the right side at the very bottom (if you look in a vertical orientation).  In principle, this is a great option for landscape orientation.  Otherwise ... I think if the tablet developers read the books in Cool Reader and like to turn the pages with the volume buttons, we would get a slightly different key layout. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd7/f58/c90/bd7f58c90ee44f0e08d5c383063563af.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Camera </h4>  Installed two modules - 0.3 and 2 MP.  Again, based on personal experience, manufacturers love to mow with a 2-megapixel module.  For example, Wexler.Tab 7b categorically does not accept sunlight.  During the daytime in the room, the tablet takes pictures of the expected quality, but if you turn the camera on to the street, you get a whitish image. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2a/376/921/f2a3769214dacd7479a7deb965fb5785.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/440/9b7/459/4409b74593c434e5730dc4105eb5d415.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Screen </h4>  At 7 inches diagonal, the tablet has a TN + Film matrix with a resolution of 1024 x 600 pixels.  The viewing angles are small - the intrigue was only in what deviation the color inversion will manifest.  The least acceptable option was found - to get a normal picture in landscape orientation, you need to deflect the tablet upside down.  In another embodiment, the display becomes unreadable.  For image clarity, I first thought that the resolution here is 800 x 480 pixels.  On the positive side, I can say that the screen is protected by glass. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/344/eb3/1e0/344eb31e0bf1feb53069477f865d8089.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Performance </h4>  I looked at the hardware characteristics of the tablet after I worked with it.  Subjectively, the device pulls on the presence of a single-core processor, about 512 MB of RAM and a simple graphics chip.  In fact, I was mistaken only with the amount of RAM.  Before us is Rockchip RK2918 (1.2 GHz, ARM Cortex-A8), 1 GB of RAM, and Vivante GC800 "graphics".  Obviously, the components were selected taking into account a small budget.  The main thing you need to remember when working with Wexler.Tab 7b - this tablet categorically does not like multitasking.  If, however, in memory to keep on execution one main process such as a browser or video player, special problems in the speed of work should not arise.  However, with the same browser, you should not count on much - a couple of ‚Äúheavy‚Äù ‚ÄúYAP‚Äù pages, opened in parallel, become a serious test for the tablet. <br><br>  I consider the performance tests for such tablets to be meaningless, but I will still give the results of a couple of benchmarks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/db2/879/8ba/db28798bad1133252c3f4d221f7b14ba.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/96b/e3d/069/96be3d0697a0580e210fe51d817ac583.png"><br><br>  It is clear that the tablet has a complete order with 2D games like Cut the Rope or the recent Dune 2. Actually, the maximum gaming scenario of using Wexler.Tab 7b is calculated on the titles of this level.  Therefore, it was much more interesting for me to know how things are going with the possibility of launching ‚Äúweighty‚Äù 3D games.  Still, it is no secret that even single-core devices can ‚Äúanneal‚Äù if they have a proper graphics chip.  Here, unfortunately, even the "smoke" is not visible.  Real Racing 3 gave an error when trying to "get through" to the start menu.  I managed to play Eternity Warriors 2. However, for this, at first it took about 4-5 minutes to wait for the game to start.  In Dead Trigger, which, except on the calculator, refuses to start, FPS clearly does not exceed 15-20 units. <br><br>  Referring to the video playback method IXBT: <br><br>  watch-1920x1080-60p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1920x1080-50p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1920x1080-30p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1920x1080-25p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1920x1080-24p.mp4 - cannot be played <br>  watch-1280x720-60p.mp4 - not playing <br>  watch-1280x720-50p.mp4 - not playable <br>  watch-1280x720-30p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1280x720-25p.mp4 - excellent <br>  watch-1280x720-24p.mp4 - excellent <br><br>  Nothing special, to the tablet as a video player, there are no complaints. <br><br><h4>  System </h4>  Wexler did not leave Android 4.1.1 "as is", adding a couple of different degrees of utility programs.  There is an APK installer, a file manager, a GisMeteo program and, for some reason, two applications for reading at once.  There is also a Wexler Play catalog - apparently, for those who are too lazy to create an account for Google Play.  The 3G connection passed without incident, the connection did not require additional settings.  Communication breaks did not occur more often than in the case of other devices with cellular modules that were in my hands.  Yes, I almost forgot - to call or work with SMS will not work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52b/80d/830/52b80d8304605a5697b4d949bfb2b2d1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6d/a5b/090/d6da5b0903060e6e2eb309e6560b7476.png"><br><br><h4>  Battery </h4>  The claimed 5000 mAh is enough for an average of 4 hours of work, which is not the best way characterizes the mobile capabilities of the device.  In 3D games, it‚Äôs worth counting on 2-2.5 hours at best; a film show can last about half an hour longer.  In general, if you take Wexler.Tab 7b with you on a long trip, it will not be superfluous to acquire an external battery. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  I do not know exactly how Wexler controls the retail prices for its products, but on the Wexler.Tab 7b brand site is offered for 3,990 rubles, and Yandex.Market has a lot of sellers with a price tag of 2,300 rubles (and free shipping).  It is clear that first of all the buyers of Wexler.Tab 7b are people who for one reason or another are seriously limited in budget and unable to spend 10,000 rubles on a modern tablet.  Considering that Wexler.Tab 7b also has 3G support, for the extremely minimal price there is a solution that is not the worst for its narrow niche.  It is clear that if you still want to get normal performance, screen and battery life, it is better to delve into the range of the same Wexler and look at something like Wexler.Tab 7iS. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189546/</a></p>
