My choice fell on a certificate authority from one large company.  What came of this can be found in my article. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39f/a88/afb/39fa88afb349208d838d31b1fe2597ac.jpg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The selected javascript test consisted of 45 questions that needed to be answered in 30 minutes. <br><br>  Description: <br><blockquote>  The advanced test has been compiled for a version of the JavaScript language (ECMAScript 5, unless otherwise specified in the question) without the use of third-party libraries.  Tested in the latest versions of browsers, unless a specific version is specified: Chrome 32+, FireFox 24+ Certificate - yes.  Complicated.  4764 attempts. <br></blockquote>  From myself I can say that most of the questions are on js-y, but they are also found on HTML5, and even Flash.

      The test itself was compiled not only by developers, but also by ordinary users.  It is provided that anyone can add their own question to replenish the common base. <br><br>  To begin with, I asked an employee of this company to take a test from his post (you need to see what the questions are about).  As a result, out of 45 answers, only 18 turned out to be correct, although he had already worked in this organization for two years.  Some questions seemed to him vaguely formulated and not correct, he wanted to write about it, but, alas, the site has no direct feedback from the developers (at that time).  Then he tried to contact them through corporate chats, but it turned out that this was some kind of third-party company.  As a result, they gave me advice: ‚ÄúDo not pass these tests, they are bad, you will not find anything useful for yourself there‚Äù. <br><br>  I, as an <s>obstinate</s> persistent person, decided to try.  The indicators turned out to be approximately the same, but on average I answered 10-15 questions correctly.  For all the years, my maximum - 28 questions, although some, for the repeated passage, I managed to learn by heart. <br><br>  Time passed, sometimes I started to get bored, registered a new mailbox and began to storm the test again.  The maximum number of correct answers - 28 pieces.  A suspicion crept in: "Can I be stupid?", Because according to the results table it passes successfully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/ha/6p/mgha6pykpcmbe-azftofytrbovu.png"><br><br>  Some even manage in record time - 6 minutes 56 seconds.  An average of 9 seconds to think about.  I'm not sure that during this time I will have time to at least read the whole question, but I still have to understand it. <br><br>  Three years later, I forced my friend to take this test again.  He scored 24 correct answers.  At that time in this company, he had already grown from a senior to a solid team lead. <br><br>  At the beginning of the test, you can specify your level, in theory, the higher you evaluated yourself, the more difficult the questions.  But as practice has shown, this does not affect anything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pd/mr/dq/pdmrdqqnn8k6xxxynnufoqbgr7e.png" width="500"><br><br><h3>  Convenience test </h3><br>  What strikes the first is the difficulty of understanding the meaning of some questions or answer choices.  When moderating, they should be formatted, although it may be so conceived, why should the candidate's life be easier. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wf/2a/3q/wf2a3qlw2vj_dz9cl6lkg1nmaoe.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cu/3a/hx/cu3ahx2z2tblfuuxfqv3weacnfm.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/vs/h2/onvsh2p4w-pj9jgbyu3iihb1mei.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60a/8b7/3a7/60a8b73a7abd36b9e0e97d7b4607c794.jpg" alt="image" width="100"><br><br><h3>  Correctness </h3><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/y1/8f/rcy18fcjqciws5ioiibw1gqxlyq.png"><br><br>  Almost everyone has already refused a flush, what advantages could it have? !!! <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/om/au/coomauidlzxx3jdfa9unit2dwas.png"><br><br>  It is possible to mark all the points and not one, and both answers will be correct. <br><br>  There are questions with clearly wrong answers. <br><br><img width="450" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/od/r-/h_/odr-h_xu6qgmliegsnzvmjtwpj0.png"><br><br>  I scribbled the rating system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-f/uv/gf/-fuvgf15qsmjjzcaqfz0fcypfxa.png"><br><br>  I decided to check. <br><br><pre><code class="html hljs xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">div</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">id</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag"> </span><span class="hljs-attr"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-attr">class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">=</span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">div</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></code> </pre> <br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">document</span></span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span></span>).getAttribute(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'class'</span></span>)); <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">document</span></span>.getElementById(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span></span>).classList.remove(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"bar"</span></span>); <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">//1 console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' '); document.getElementById("foo").setAttribute('class', 'bar'); console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' -  '); document.getElementById("foo").className = ""; //2 console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' '); document.getElementById("foo").setAttribute('class', 'bar'); console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' -  '); document.getElementById("foo").className =document.getElementById("foo").className.replace( /(?:^|\s)bar(?!\S)/g , '' ); //3 console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' '); document.getElementById("foo").setAttribute('class', 'bar'); console.log(document.getElementById("foo").getAttribute('class') + ' -  '); //   //document.getElementById('foo').removeClass('bar'); //document.getElementById('foo').toogleClass('bar')</span></span></code> </pre><br>  In general, I already know in advance that I will not answer some questions. <br><br><h3>  Problem with quotes </h3><br>  You can find different quotes - "", "", ``.  With the latter, the most problematic thing is: it‚Äôs hard to say if it‚Äôs specially conceived or they just play the role of single quotes. <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m1/ne/5q/m1ne5qqbsb8k0bkuxrpq2xlh5je.png"><br><br>  The correct answer is 44. <br><br>  Here is another question. <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-p/r4/b2/-pr4b2czmuenfk4gzpzudn10ise.png"><br><br>  Here in the same question are two different types of quotes.  It is logical to assume that here single quotes are single quotes and there are still some strange ones (where did they take such people at all, did I find anything similar on my keyboard?). <br><br>  We would have to answer <br>  "{} === {}", "'a' &lt;'A'" and "'A'&gt; 'B'" <br><br>  In principle, the console agrees with me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n1/mp/hh/n1mphhykgwpchsrlzuvqlss9w0q.png"><br><br>  In the test, the answer fell into the wrong.  Hmm, maybe the console is lying? <br><br>  Here is another interesting question. <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs">     <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">Foo</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"></span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params"></span>)</span></span>{ Foo.counter++; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(Foo.counter); } Foo.counter = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span></span> bar = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Foo; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span></span> buz = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span></span> Foo;</code> </pre><br>  Console: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/op/m7/z4/opm7z4gcllbevtc8btt64n-y34a.png"><br><br>  This answer was not correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dm/zi/u-/dmziu-71fl5hchqdwzdehxdghcu.png"><br><br>  If your answer is not correct, then there is an opportunity to ‚ÄúAsk others‚Äù, thus creating an active chat.  I decided to use this feature on this issue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r7/5v/m6/r75vm6idq0hb2qbyup_-5zegin8.png"><br><br>  At the time of this writing, 01.02.2018, no one answered my question.  Yeah, very active chat. <br><br>  Studying the results of the test, it is possible to see how many people who answered correctly now online and start a chat. <br><blockquote>  There are 128 users online. </blockquote>  128 and 128. Having come in a week and a half, I saw that the figure has not changed. <br><br>  The questions are about the same as a couple of years ago.  I decided to add there some of my own, for the sample I threw a light one. <br><br>  What are the cons I saw.  First of all, the question adding form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/sf/r_/ersfr_yrxbu4mkhgo8xjqbp4oju.png"><br><br>  I did not immediately understand that a check mark with the correct answer was in question, I almost didn‚Äôt notice the wrong one.  For some reason, the distance from the input field from the bottom to the checkbox is greater than the distance from it to the next field for the next answer. <br><br>  Apparently, user questions can be given only 4 possible answers, although in the tests there are six options. <br><br>  There is not any preview function, as well as viewing after sending for moderation.  Saved the question and that's it, he went somewhere.  You have only one attempt, without the possibility of editing.  And for some reason, from the 10th, it still hangs on moderation. <br><br>  From the application for the project <br><blockquote>  Authorized users can create their own questions.  They will be moderated and published so that other users can evaluate their usefulness.  Particularly prominent questions will be added to the tests for the respective programming languages. </blockquote><h3>  Other worthy questions </h3><br>  This question was also marked as wrong for me. <br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8x/84/x5/8x84x58fulbza_mcc36aspwvlhc.png"><br><br><pre> <code class="hljs xml">     ,    ,      <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">script</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>,  <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">p</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>.       ,       <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">script</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span><span class="xml"><span class="xml">,  </span><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span></span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">p</span></span></span></span><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span></span><span class="xml"> ,       .    ,    </span></span><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">script</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span>.   :  "   <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">script</span></span></span><span class="hljs-tag">&gt;</span></span><span class="actionscript"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="actionscript"><span class="hljs-string">"  .    "</span></span></span><span class="actionscript"></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="actionscript"><span class="hljs-string">"   .  ,   .</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br><br>  Here is another controversial question: <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wn/v7/b8/wnv7b8uwq7gf9btn7iplajsvlyc.png"><br><br>  In my understanding, something like this will return the string object <br><br><pre> <code class="javascript hljs"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">typeof</span></span> {} -&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"object"</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  But in this case, the correct answers are 1 and 2 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d1/il/uk/d1iluk9xgmar5iph-1clf3ili68.png"><br><br>  How often do you use such an operator? <br><br><img width="350" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uq/tj/-y/uqtj-yjydgcqocirxw-ov8_une8.png"><br><br>  I've never been. <br><br>  There are a lot of questions on XMLHttpRequest, a thing of course needed in the household, even in the darkest years, js, I didn‚Äôt use the native method anymore, then JQuery provided a more reliable method, and now the frameworks provide functionality. <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e5/t1/zt/e5t1ztxfpq9sr9ehf1j_hzkqvm4.png"><br><br>  Also an interesting question, how many times did the test pass, never correctly answered it <br><br><img width="450" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m4/kv/bk/m4kvbkjvwolsav54azkyepf9kqw.png"><br><br>  In theory, if it‚Äôs in one line, then the closing of the function gets into the comment and the console just hangs. <br><br>  This is the question I remembered: "By how many points can you build a Bezier curve?" <br><br>  Here I am in my front activities, all I do is build different curves.  The manual understands that writing filters and molds is too despicable. <br><br>  This question was also counted as wrong <br><br><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zq/el/ji/zqelji1miwe6hmu6unxlosontvu.png"><br><br>  Even though I changed the element, I added the necessary id-nickname, I ran their code through the console.  Option when I mark separately 2 and separately 1 did not pass.  12 - no either.  Perhaps for the correct answer you need to choose 2, 1, 12. Although not, I also checked this answer and still not. <br><br><h3>  Pro console </h3><br>  You, probably, have already noticed that during my test the console was opened and I checked answers in the process.  In principle, everything that got into the Internet can be copied.  The developers, of course, put some effort against preventing tasks from being copied during the test by blocking the right mouse button.  I opened the console through the chrome menu, selecting "developer tools". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/ss/xy/messxyfq93l_5vidn_u3_b4ixiw.png"><br><br>  Then I can inspect any item and copy the text.  Could turn into pictures of the task. <br><br>  It is assumed that the test can be taken three times a month.  If in the incognito mode to register a new mail, then there is an automatic authorization in the text.  So you can pass the test as much as you like. <br><br>  The results are also displayed strange.  If you do not correctly answer the question, then at the end you can see the text of the question and the selected answers.  On those that are answered correctly, only the text of the question is shown. <br><br>  In principle, if not laziness, then you can make a base of all questions with the correct answers.  If you get confused and look for the answer, as well as in the process of repeated search, choose the right ones.  Questions are repeated relatively often. <br><br><h3>  Sweet </h3><br>  In the console at all settled error <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hj/xz/fy/hjxzfyyqdny_37hvsydakmd-n2y.png"><br><br>  Some questions are not straightforward by the fact that there is no indication anywhere, when choosing an answer, to take into account strict regime or not. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  About the authors. <br><blockquote>  The authors of the tests are professional developers and experts in their subject areas.  All of them have proven experience in using IT-technologies in projects of large Internet companies. </blockquote>  From the company, which organized a wide educational activities in the field of it, I expected more.  Moreover, this educational project is actively advertised. <br><br>  If you suddenly become very bored, then you can kill time.  If you are looking for something to improve your knowledge, then this test is unlikely to help you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/347446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/347446/</a></p>
