  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Companies with detailed client databases, their clients and users of social networks are dedicated to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Trying to throw out ‚Äúall superfluous‚Äù from this post, I face the fact that the absence of certain pieces of the narrative will cause the reader of the questions, which then I will have to answer in one way or another in the comments.  Therefore, if it seems to you that the post is redundant and emotional, try to figure out how you would have presented it to the public. <br>  The events described in the post took place a couple of years ago in the city of Rostov-on-Don.  However, the ‚Äúmorality‚Äù extracted from them is perfectly projected onto today's Russia.  Actually, why are they published by me in Habr√©: there is a hope that the people involved in developing software for database operators, personnel management, employees of information security departments will read or hear the retelling ... in general, all those who determine the occurrence of similar situations in our country .  Also, some users of social networks will benefit from the story.  And, in general, this story concerns everyone who has a SIM card issued for his real passport data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Plain story </h5><br>  2010  Vkontakte network.  ‚ÄúI knocked as a girl friend‚Äù from a profile addressed to Svetlana Mikheeva. <br>  Enjoyed "her" photos.  "I tried to talk."  This is all in quotes because he knew perfectly well that it could be a program, a script, a schoolboy, a spammer ... The conversation revealed a real person, not a spam link, not begging for money. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Svetlana claimed that it looked like this:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d5/638/1fe/9d56381fe63d2b540cd3dab7832b78c1.jpg"><br>  <i>At first I thought about cutting contact information from a screenshot, but I decided to leave the employees of the VKontakte and security agencies the opportunity to log in / backups ( <i>although why in backups, even though it was only the Dr. profile that was active in it, and today, probably, still continues his ‚Äúactivity‚Äù</i> ), and make sure that the problem exists.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d04/de4/172/d04de4172040e16b7a485f59c1e1970a.jpg"><br>  <i>Moreover, the photos were periodically updated, for example, after May 9, a photo appeared in a soldier's cap:</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/503/fdf/99d/503fdf99deb4ffa7db6ed7ea94bb3555.jpg"><br></div></div>  Svetlana's friends were mainly "real Rostov boys".  Svetlana claimed that she works in the service of tracking the statistics of the inflow / outflow of cellular operator subscribers ( <i>as it later turns out, she really worked for a cellular provider, but differently. Considering the fashion of good companies to demand from people who leave negative blogs / social networks / I see the need to stipulate that compromising reviews, compensation, that in this story the real place of work of Svetlana will be the mythical provider ‚ÄúELE‚Äù, which exists in the Russian market of cellular communication only in</i>  <i>th parallel reality).</i>  Somehow Svetlana even asked to find people who want to work in the salons of cellular communication managers "tuning the Internet on phones." <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">and even an ad in the questionnaire hung</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9b/053/c81/b9b053c8159a079ce7076db3f3dc0da1.jpg"><br></div></div>  She regularly invited for dates ( <i>to drink beer in bars</i> ), to go with her to Moscow ( <i>and at her expense, as she was afraid of one</i> ) and other strange suggestions.  However, at the same time, I did not leave a phone number ( <i>and by that time I had a principle not to go to a meeting with a person without knowing his number</i> ).  She complained that I didn‚Äôt pay much to her, but to my malicious remark that ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt care with whom to flirt,‚Äù ‚Äúoffended‚Äù, and gave me a login / password from her VKontakte profile.  I rummaged in the correspondence for about 5 minutes. I almost did not find flirting, but I found a lot of profanity, however, I didn‚Äôt understand anything of those dialogues.  After 5 minutes, she changed her password.  But I stopped communicating with her after she ‚Äútearfully‚Äù asked to spend the whole evening on the plane the next day and the next day it turned out that she came up with this trip, ‚Äúbecause she really wanted to meet with me‚Äù.  So, having spent a total of 2-3 hours on the correspondence of Vkontakte and ICQ, I considered further communication inexpedient. <br><br><h5>  And now - an unusual story. </h5><br>  <i>Before turning to the more interesting part of the story, I would like to recall <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/popular/ukrf/10_38.html">our remarkable legislation</a> and once again stipulate that all the following information is nothing more than artistic fiction.</i> <br>  So, a few months later, I came across, or in a text file, or in historical VKontakte, on this login / password, which she gave me.  Thinking as if in place of the girl, I quickly changed the password of the ‚Äúabracadabra-11‚Äù type, I rejected ‚Äú11,‚Äù and thus I guessed the password the first time.  Having entered the questionnaire, I began to read the correspondence, of which there were quite a lot.  Conventionally, I divided them into 3 types: <br><ul><li>  peaceful dialogues with guys (with elements of flirting) </li><li>  scolding with guys and girls </li><li>  conversations with the ex-boyfriend and his girlfriend </li></ul>  If you believe the questionnaire of the former guy, then at that time he worked in the call center of ELE.  The fact that he was "former" was clear from the conversation.  She believed that the profile of the girl he added to his ‚Äúmarital status‚Äù was a fake created by this guy.  And I wrote to him in this form, and from his profile he asked to "leave his girlfriend alone."  At the same time, he called the interlocutor Irina (and not Svetlana, which alarmed me). <br>  Then I remembered that the login on VKontakte is represented by the mailbox, I decided to check if the password would work for it.  Came up.  There was nothing interesting in the mail.  In addition to registration in some MMORPG (rather wow) on Irina Surname.  I decided to search VKontakte using this data - I received a girl from Belaya-Kalitva in the query results ( <i>with characteristic appearance, lack of intelligence in the eyes and a photo ‚Äúagainst the background of the carpet‚Äù</i> ) working in the ELE call center ( <i>again, it was indicated in the questionnaire</i> ) .  The mosaic began to take shape. <br>  By the way, even when I first looked into a questionnaire from its submission, I was struck by the fact that the abundance of profanity in the questionnaire did not match with the appearance on Svetlana's photo.  With the appearance of Irina found in the questionnaire, it fit simply beautifully.  I could not understand only the abundance of profanity.  In search of a solution, I began to read the dialogues more closely.  They were built according to the same principle: Sveta / Ira ‚Äúknocked on friends‚Äù, and when the interlocutor / interlocutor asked ‚Äúwhat she needed,‚Äù she began to insult them.  In one of the dialogs I stumbled upon the phrase ‚Äúand you, moron, we are constantly calling the ELE call center‚Äù.  And then the puzzle came together finally - the girl took revenge.  I wrote down or memorized the identification data of those who got her at work, entered the fake questionnaire, found them through a VKontakte search and scolded them, throwing out their negative. <br>  It was already 4 am and I could not be surprised.  He went to bed, changing passwords, but not changing VKontakte email to confirm the questionnaire.  T.ch.  when I woke up access to the questionnaire was already closed.  By that moment, I understood the situation and the idea that a mentally unbalanced person has access to databases and successfully uses this, I was terrified.  Having rummaged through the history of the browser, I found a guy to whom she described that he ‚Äúcalls them in ELE‚Äù and tried to persuade him to go to the ELE office to write an application, but he turned out to be somehow Russian-speaking and not very Russian-speaking, t.ch.  in the end I dropped this idea. <br>  It was necessary to go to the ELE office, but I was embarrassed by the fact that the staff of the Security Council might well be her friends.  Then the efforts would have been wasted, and I could easily sting a portion of the acid from such an ‚Äúimpressionable‚Äù girl.  Yes, and what evidence base, in addition to oral statements that I violated the legislation of the Russian Federation, I could provide?  As a result, he published a closed note for friends, asking for advice.  Most voted to leave the provincial alone. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  <b>It seems to me that the following useful points can be extracted from what I have told:</b> <br><ul><li>  designing software for database operators is necessary in such a way that they do not receive ‚Äúredundant‚Äù information, but only operational information necessary to resolve issues </li><li>  for posts tied to work with databases containing contact and passport information, people should be recruited for whom such relaxation is unthinkable (that is, attention should be paid to families and upbringing) </li><li>  monitoring of the mental state of employees working with detailed databases is necessary ( <i>monitoring should be carried out objectively and regularly, in conditions that exclude personal sympathy or bribe taking</i> ) </li></ul><br>  <b>Recommendations to users of social networks are no less obvious:</b> <br><ul><li> the less information you leave about yourself on social networks - the calmer your life </li><li>  reasonably minimize communication with people you do not know </li></ul></div>
