In general, the Apple iPhone presentation is undoubtedly a revolution in the market for mobile communications and consumer electronics in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/83a/89c/72c/83a89c72ca02027b3e2b99c3b3b68742.jpg" width="440" height="292" alt="Blog Photos Engadget" vspace="10"><br><br>  In the famous Moscone Center in San Francisco, already a familiar place to arrange stunning presentations of technology companies, in its usual introduction (now available and <a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">video</a> ), opening the exhibition of achievements of Apple, its head Steve Jobs (Vibrant).  And it was from what.  He began by summing up the work of the corporation last year. <br><br>  In 2006, half of all new Apple computers went into the hands of customers who first bought a Mac, indicating a growing interest in this platform.  This was largely due to the exceptionally fruitful collaboration between Apple and Intel, whose processors are firmly established in stylish silver and milky white Macintosh cases.  And 2007 promises to be even more successful.

      The iPod family, updated in the fall and awaiting another update in the near future, firmly holds the lead in three categories - the most common video player ( <a href="http://www.apple.ru/ipod/ipod.html">iPod Video</a> ), the most common mp3 player ( <a href="http://www.apple.ru/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> ) and the most ... easily wearable mp3 player ( <a href="http://www.apple.ru/ipodshuffle/">iPod Shuffle</a> ). <br><br>  iTunes, which is destined to be an eternal companion and assistant to the iPod, also lives happily ever after.  Even <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1956/">despite</a> recent pessimistic articles in the press.  Sales of songs rose to 2 billion pieces (the proprietary ironic statistic is 58 songs per second), which allowed Apple to move to fourth place in the ranking of music vendors in the United States, ahead of Amazon (perhaps <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1906/">not for long</a> ). <br><br>  The conclusion of a cooperation agreement with Paramount, which, following Disney, will give away its films and TV shows for sale through iTunes, promises Apple to conquer an even more delicious slice from the pie of the video content market. <br><br>  From the video theme, we are moving smoothly to the future center of the digital home, according to Apple, the multifunctional Apple TV combine (previously known as <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/lenta/810/">iTV</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/245/fee/9f7/245fee9f7591d518f17cdad19664cb7e.jpg" width="440" height="292" alt="Blog Photos Engadget" vspace="10"><br><br>  Equipped with wireless Wi-Fi and other high-speed interfaces, the device can display video and photos on the widescreen (with the necessary support for high-definition HD Video) and play music on the audio system, retransmitting it all from any of the five nearest computers, with One of which (with only one, DRM, you see) can be connected by the strongest bonds of automatic content synchronization, recording new items appearing on it on its built-in 40-gigabyte hard drive.  When you want to watch something fresh, just turn on Apple TV and sit comfortably in a chair. <br><br>  However, we have to admit that such devices are still quite rare for understandable reasons: they are designed to work in conjunction with stores like iTunes, from which video and other content is downloaded.  And even quite reasonable, in general, the price of $ 299 will hardly make Apple TV popular in our open spaces in the near future. <br><br>  Well, the main event of the day, performed by Jobs, is worth <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/">quoting in</a> full. <br><br><blockquote>  In 1984 we [ <i>Apple</i> ] introduced the Macintosh.  It didn't just change Apple, it changed the whole industry.  In 2001, we introduced the first iPod; it did not just change the way we all listen to music, it changed the entire music industry.  Well, today we present three revolutionary new products. </blockquote><br><br>  And who would have thought that these three products: a widescreen iPod with a touchscreen, a mobile phone and an Internet communicator, will be inside one single device ... an <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> that everyone has been talking about for so long.  The one that can definitely be entered in history as the most anticipated mobile phone.  The one that really has a chance to change another industry, this time the industry of mobile devices.  Without a doubt, the iPhone has become better, more perfect, more interesting and nicer to the heart of every geek than anybody imagined. <br><br>  Brief specifications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/71d/66a/35a/71d66a35ab388165e7f1f89862ddd103.jpg" width="200" height="228" alt="iphone" hspace="15" align="left"><br><br><ul><li>  Touch screen 3,5 ", 320x480 pixels, without keyboard (there is a virtual one) </li><li>  Dimensions: 115x61x11.6 mm (width and thickness are almost the same as for iPod Video, but longer), weight: 135 g </li><li>  Work in GSM / GPRS / EDGE cellular networks, Wi-Fi connection (when connecting to the Internet, it is possible to automatically smoothly switch from Wi-Fi to EDGE and back to improve connectivity) and Bluetooth 2.0, iPod connector </li><li>  Operating time from one battery charge in the video / internet surfing / talking mode - 5 hours, in the player mode - 16 hours </li><li>  Full-featured Mac OS X operating system, office applications, Safari browser, map services from Google and Yahoo, synchronization with devices, work with iTunes </li><li>  Features: proximity sensor, turning off the backlight during a conversation with the phone at the ear;  a screen rotation sensor that guides the image on it depending on whether you are holding the phone horizontally or vertically;  light sensor that controls the brightness of the backlight </li><li>  Price <b>subject to the conclusion of a 2-year contract with a telecom operator</b> : $ 499 for the 4 GB model and $ 599 for the 8 GB </li><li>  Date of sale: in the USA - June of this year, in Europe - the last quarter, in Asia - 2008 </li></ul><br><br>  More than 200 patented technologies and reasonableness to the smallest details, attracting design and environment from dozens of special services and other "goodies" will surely become a topic for many future articles. <br><br>  The last exhibition day did not end at the presentation of the phone.  Apple‚Äôs new official strategic partners, Google and Yahoo, are united around the iPhone, who, in the person of their top executives Eric Schmidt and Jerry Yang, expressed their admiration for Apple‚Äôs work and the emerging prospects. <br><br>  Cooperation with the largest US cellular operator Cingular at the initial stage of promoting the phone in the future can be extended to other providers, including, possibly, European and Asian. <br><br>  In the following days, we should expect new details on cooperation with these and other companies, as well as other, less revolutionary, but also interesting presentations.  For example, updates to the line of desktops and laptops, the announcement of computers with new Intel processors, etc.  But, as always, surprises are possible.  Stay with us and we will keep you informed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4922/</a></p>
