  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Estonia applies the blockchain to the whole state</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4cf/e7a/5e3/4cfe7a5e3cd74244ad6e98e8393792c2.PNG" alt="image" align="left">  Against the background of public discussions about the global outlook for blockchain, one of the countries actively using this technology at the state level is Estonia.  In this Baltic country with a population of just over 1.3 million people, the technology has already managed to find practical application in medicine, the banking sector, stock trading and notaries.  We, in the <a href="https://wirexapp.com/ru/">Wirex</a> blockchain service <a href="https://wirexapp.com/ru/">team,</a> decided to examine in more detail each of the uses of blockchain technology in Estonia. <br><br>  In early spring, Guardtime, a project specializing in data security, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-startup-aims-to-secure-1-million-estonian-health-records/">announced</a> a partnership with the eHealth Foundation, the Estonian e-Health Foundation.  The solutions proposed by Guardtime are based on KSI (Keyless signature infrastructure), a blockchain technology that provides large-scale data authentication without reliance on a centralized trusted authority.  The goal of the project is to protect over 1 million medical records.  According to Guardtime developers, the KSI infrastructure they implemented was implemented in the Oracle database engine.  Through this integration, changes in patient records can be seen in real time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Guardtime blockchain technology ensures the safety, transparency and integrity of medical information, protecting data from unforeseen changes or deletions due to hacker attacks, system failures and actions of malicious programs.  Every time when the data is subject to any change, the system automatically creates an updated signature, allowing you to respond promptly in the event of an unlawful encroachment on the integrity of the information.  The records themselves are not stored on the KSI blockchain - only a series of their hash values ‚Äã‚Äãare recorded, in which information about the changes is displayed.  KSI's blockchain infrastructure was implemented by the Guardtime team and began functioning in April 2008 before the advent of the Bitcoin blockchain. <br><br>  The prospects for the blockchain were also relevant for the Estonian banking sector.  An example of this is the <a href="https://www.lhv.ee/">LHV Bank</a> , which, with the support of the Swedish company ChromaWay, has developed the Cuber Wallet wallet.  The operation of the solution is based on the open protocol of Bitcoin blockchain Colored Coins.  Cuber Wallet is available to owners of devices based on Android and iOS.  Cuber Wallet users store private keys on their mobile phone.  Wallet allows you to send and receive euros instantly, around the clock and for free.

Last fall, the head of NASDAQ, Robert Grifeld, announced the prospects for applying the blockchain technology for the implementation of electronic voting by shareholders on the Estonian NASDAQ exchange.  Thanks to the blockchain, it becomes impossible to make changes to the voting results, and it also becomes possible to see the voting results from different devices.  On February 12 of this year, a pilot <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/nasdaq-shareholder-voting-estonia-blockchain/">launch</a> of the blockchain voting system took place.  Based on the results of technology testing in Estonia, NASDAQ later <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/nasdaqs-blockchain-services-global-exchange/">discovered</a> blockchain services for more than 100 global partners. <br><br>  In November last year, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/estonian-government-partners-with-bitnation-to-offer-blockchain-notarization-services-to-e-residents-1448915243">it became known</a> that the Bitnation project used blockchain technology in the notarial sphere.  By consolidating with the Estonian government's e-Residency program, participants in the Bitnation project gained access to traditional notarial services transferred to the blockchain, such as marriage registration, birth certificate, and some types of commercial contracts.  Bitnation notary services are characterized by decentralization and the ability to use them from anywhere in the world.  The e-Residency program started on December 1, 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/419/fdb/b94/419fdbb94a3345e6bba935978dcf45a1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>E-residency digital ID card</i> <br><br>  Estonian merchants also do not refuse to accept Bitcoins.  In the segment of small medium-sized businesses, such companies include the seller of fresh Salatte salads and furniture retailer Finca m√∂√∂bel. <br><br>  The purposeful policy of state digitalization has helped to diversify the implementation of blockchain technology in Estonia.  As an example, there are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/dell/2016/06/14/the-tiny-european-country-that-became-a-global-leader-in-digital-government/">several facts</a> from modern Estonian history that are not directly related to the blockchain: <br><br><ul><li>  By 2002, the government built a free Wi-Fi network covering a high percentage of localities. </li><li>  In 2007, the Estonian authorities introduced electronic voting. </li><li>  In 2012, Estonia established a massive fiber optic cable infrastructure for ultra-high-speed data transmission. </li></ul><br>  The technology of the blockchain against the background of these facts seems only a logical continuation of the general state technological policy. <br><br>  <i>Continue to follow the updates of the blog of the <a href="https://wirexapp.com/ru/">Wirex</a> multifunctional service that performs instant money transfers worldwide without banking intermediation, and learn about the cases of using the blockchain technology not only in the interests of private business, but also on a government scale.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396095/</a></p>
