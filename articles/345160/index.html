Many are now planning their trips next year and we decided to offer you one interesting option. <br><br>  2017 was very important for us.  In July 2017, the community of users of the portal vivaldi.net <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/one-hundred-thousand/">has grown to 100 thousand participants</a> .  But this is only the beginning: at the beginning of 2018, this number will already be 200 thousand!  Our community is growing very fast and we want to thank you for your help in creating the best browser in the world.  Therefore, we decided to hold a small competition and invite the winner to visit our Norwegian office for a few days. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Grand Prize </h3><br>  So, the winner of the competition will receive a free flight ticket to Oslo and back, as well as a three-day stay near the company's office.  You will have the opportunity to meet with the developers and explore the sights of Oslo with us.  We will take care that these days will leave you a lot of good memories.
