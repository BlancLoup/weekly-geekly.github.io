With its help, we improve the quality of service, eliminate losses and try to anticipate the expectations of our customers.  In the arsenal we have about 10 tools and techniques.  One of the most popular tools that is used in most divisions of a company is a problem solving session, or problem solving session. <br><br>  We use the session method to solve problems of different levels: technical problems in small teams, drawing up a business plan for the unit, solving issues of employee motivation throughout the company.  With the right approach, you get a good result - problems are solved seriously and for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/no/ur/monour8y7qpnk09jsedg61iaip8.jpeg">

      The ability to solve problems depends on how quickly and truly your company responds to changing reality and new challenges.  The ideal situation is when problems are effectively solved at all levels of the organization.  According to the <a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Future_of_Jobs_2018.pdf">forecasts of the World Economic Forum</a> in the professions, the future skill of solving complex problems is in demand now, and the trend will continue until at least 2022.  Want to be trendy?  Then welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><p>  I work in the service delivery optimization department.  My colleagues and I help teams and the company as a whole to work better - we remove inefficient steps from processes, introduce best practices, create an environment of constant improvements.  The problem solving session performs several tasks at once: <br><br></p><ul><li>  problem has an optimal solution </li><li>  root causes are eliminated, then the problem will not happen again </li><li>  employees with greater responsibility implement the solution found, as they participate in all stages of its search. </li></ul><br>  At first I will tell about the organizational moments of similar sessions.  Then we analyze the steps that it includes. <br><br><h2>  How to conduct a problem solving session </h2><br>  We select a specific problem and collect a group that will solve this problem.  It is best to work with a group of 3 to 8 people.  We also hold sessions for a larger number of participants, but in them a lot of resources are spent on facilitating the group. <br><br>  The composition of the participants is determined by the problem itself - we invite those whom this problem affects, and who will then carry out the action plan.  For example, the problem with the passage of certain trainings: trainings are canceled due to the low enrollment.  We invite colleagues from the training department and trainers who prepare the training material to solve this problem - in our case they are from different departments.  Do not forget about the representatives of the target audience of the training.  As a result, we get a look at the problem from all sides and excellent solutions at the exit. <br><br>  The session must have a moderator.  He sets the format of the meeting, keeps track of time and leads the group on the necessary steps.  For noncritical problems, a person who is familiar with the algorithm of such sessions and understands what result to expect at each step will do.  It is not difficult to learn this, we teach basic skills of problem solving sessions at two-hour trainings.  The more difficult the problem and the conditions, the more important the skills of the facilitator.  Here the leader needs personal experience in conducting such sessions, knowledge of various facilitation techniques. <br><br>  At a quiet pace, the session takes up to two hours.  At the output we get an action plan, which should not only fix the problem, but also eliminate its repetition. <br><br>  Often a group can only be assembled for an hour.  In such cases, it is necessary to tightly control the time at each stage, stop side discussions, make something offline.  For example, an action plan for the solutions found can be made a little later. <br><br>  There was an experience when the session was held in two or three visits.  There appeared a risk not to collect the same composition of participants for the continuation of the session. <br><br>  Immediately make a reservation, if the problem has an obvious or proven solution - you can do without such sessions.  Just take and do what is necessary.  On the other hand, in the case of known decisions, such a session may lead to more effective, unnoticed earlier decisions. <br><br>  <b>Six step algorithm</b> <br><br>  The problem is solved in six steps.  The session covers the first four.  The fifth step is performed in the timeframes set at the session.  Go to the sixth step back after performing the planned actions: <br><br><ol><li>  Identify the problem and desired state; </li><li>  Find root causes; </li><li>  Find possible solutions; </li><li>  Prioritize decisions and draw up a plan of action; </li><li>  Execute an action plan; </li><li>  Assess whether the problem is solved. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vv/sr/mk/vvsrmkl6zaf1vrpoyjkgxvvoleq.jpeg"><br><h2>  Step 1. Identify the problem and desired state. </h2><br>  In my opinion the most time consuming step.  At the very beginning, opinions about the problem being solved in the group differ: everyone understands it in his own way.  For some, it may not be a problem at all.  It takes up to 15 minutes to form a common understanding on which we will work.  Several times it was that they chose a new problem for the analysis instead of the initially stated one. <br><br>  <b>Options for problems and desired states:</b> <br><br>  Problem 1: In the first half of 2018, 33% of the planned monthly training sessions were canceled due to an insufficient number of participants. <br><br>  Desired state 1: 100% of the training sessions scheduled in Q4 2018 were conducted with a sufficient number of participants. <br><br>  Problem 2: KPI for one of the processes in the red zone for more than a month. <br>  Desired state 2: since March, the KPI for the process does not fall below the target value. <br><br><h2>  Step 2. Find root causes </h2><br>  At this step, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583">‚ÄúFive Why‚Äù</a> method goes well, and at the same time it becomes clear to the participants what a root cause is.  Versions ‚ÄúWhy the problem occurred‚Äù are recorded on the board or flipchart.  Here the presenter will use handwritten language :) <br><br>  After the first step, the group has already tuned in to work and gives many possible reasons.  It is useful to overpower yourself and not dwell on the most obvious versions, try to dig deeper. <br><br>  I will give an educational example of determining the root cause: <br><br>  You have discovered a water leak on the first floor.  The solution to this problem is a basin for collecting water.  This is a temporary solution, since we have not eliminated the root cause of the leak, and it can be repeated.  Asking questions "why", we reach the source of the problem: <br><br><ul><li>  Why is there a leak on the first floor?  - flows on the second and third floors. </li><li>  Why leak on the second and third floors?  - it rains and the roof leaks. </li><li>  Why is the roof leaking?  - physical wear of the material and the lack of regular inspection of the technical condition of the roof. </li></ul><br>  The root cause of the leak on the ground floor is the leaking roof and the lack of regular inspection.  Our solutions should be aimed at eliminating root causes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7v/fy/gd/7vfygdpkx1d0cmf8lo43y1osazs.jpeg"><br><h2>  Step 3. Search for possible solutions </h2><br>  That came to decisions.  It is difficult to imagine what to do here without a quiet brainstorming.  It involves all participants in the discussion and saves time, which is always not enough.  I distribute sticky stickers for all participants.  Within five minutes, participants write to them what can eliminate root causes.  On one sticker - one idea, so then it is more convenient to work with them. <br><br>  In his first sessions he forgot to focus the group on the elimination of only those reasons that are in their area of ‚Äã‚Äãinfluence.  As a result, we received actions that someone outside the group had to implement: a neighboring department, a management, etc.  If such an action plan is transferred to a neighboring department, it will take a lot of effort to adopt it.  Remember step 1 - for someone it may not be a problem, the solution of which is worth spending time and resources. <br><br>  Now I remind you about finding solutions in your area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility.  Thus, colleagues form the habit of looking at the problem through the prism of ‚Äúwhat can I do here‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Step 4. Prioritize decisions and plan action </h2><br>  At the previous step, the group is at the peak of its performance: it turns out a large number of stickers with solutions.  Together with the group, we prioritize each idea for its impact on eliminating the causes and the amount of effort to implement.  The sticker is read to the group, and it decides which quadrant it belongs to.  For example, the idea is easy to implement, but the effect will be a little - this is the left lower quadrant.  It may be that the benefits of the idea will be great, but you will have to spend significant resources - we bring the idea into the upper right quadrant. <br><br>  I noticed that one opinion can dominate here, for example, the manager.  Therefore, I try to find out the opinions of all the participants.  At this stage, an approximate assessment of decisions is made, but practice has shown that this is quite enough for further work. <br><br>  We do not have time to draw up an action plan in the hourly session.  The group does it already outside the session.  To draw up a plan, first of all, stickers are taken from the left upper quadrant of ‚ÄúSignificant Impact / Little Effort‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wa/s1/ia/was1iasxnkwg85gvxxxuya7njb4.jpeg"><br>  Steps 5 and 6 are clear from the description, there are no features here.  It is useful to immediately determine how and by whom the implementation of the action plan will be monitored.  A good idea is to hang the plan in a visible place so that the whole team can see the arrangement.  If at the sixth step it turns out that the problem still exists, we return to step 1 and re-run this algorithm, excluding the solutions already implemented. <br><br><h2>  Afterword </h2><br>  Confidence in the application of this method appears after 2-3 independent sessions.  At first, he took with him a printed template with steps - he allowed us not to forget anything.  Each step is easily complemented by various useful techniques ‚Äî a SMART approach to formulate the problem in the first step, Ishikawa diagram in the second step, and so on. <br><br>  The problem solving session sets the structure for the problem search process.  Without it, there is a risk of missing something and finding a less effective solution.  For example, if instead of searching for root causes immediately go to solutions, the problem may arise again.  This is how to eliminate only the symptoms of the disease. <br><br>  On the contrary, if we work out each step qualitatively, we can come up with new, non-standard and effective solutions.  Involve employees in improving workflows, teach them how to best solve difficult situations and take responsibility for implementing the solutions found. <br><br>  I hope that I have spoken in sufficient detail about this method, perhaps he will be able to assist you in solving your problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444200/</a></p>
