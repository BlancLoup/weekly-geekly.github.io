At one time, the official REDMOND blog on Geektimes.ru published a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/271932/">review of the</a> REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S smart outlet.  It, we recall, can be controlled from a smartphone - both via Bluetooth, while in the apartment, and over the Internet from anywhere in the world.  Today we bring to your attention the review of REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S.  This is the so-called skyport, that is, it seems to be a socket, but much more advanced.  Let's just say: this is the further development of the ideas embodied in the REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S.  In addition, we will talk about several new REDMOND devices - in particular, the REDMOND SkyCenter 11S smart home center and the REDMOND SkyControl 21S IR remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/537/780/36a/53778036a74241ab9722c11f9a3934d5.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, let's start with the <b>REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S</b> .  All the features of the predecessor, namely the smart outlet REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S, in Skype have been fully preserved.  Recall - what is at stake.  The skyport is plugged into a standard outlet, after which household appliances are connected to the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S.  It could be an iron, TV, lamp, water heater, curling iron - anything.  After that, they can be turned on and off from any distance using a smartphone with the Ready for Sky app.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fad/428/a97/fad428a9785b4aa89495a0766a833ba1.png"><br><br>  Take the same iron.  If you suffer from forgetfulness in the operation of this unsafe electrical appliance (do not hesitate, so many suffer from it), REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S can destroy this problem once and for all.  Even when the user goes to the subway or minibus to work, he can with one click on the virtual button to cut off the power supply to this very iron.  So go back home to disable it is not necessary.  Yes, for this you need to get a home smartphone-geytveem, which will be connected via Bluetooth with Skype, and over the Internet - with your personal smartphone, but still it is a great way to solve issues from the category "and I just turned off the iron, or the apartment is already flaming ? ‚ÄùIn addition, you can use the REDMOND SkyCenter 11S device, which we describe at the end of this material, in place of a smartphone gateway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d62/cf3/429/d62cf342921846e8ab50dcbbb908fc81.jpg"><br><br>  Another example.  If you suspect that children instead of doing their homework, spend time on the Xbox, you can block the power supply to the TV or to the console itself.  That's right, better pay attention to mathematics than to some GTA.  However, if you adhere to more liberal views on upbringing and you think that games are also needed, then you can set up a schedule of energy supply on the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S.  For example, from 14:00 to 15:00, let the children smash the enemies, and then - everything, the TV screen darkens, and it's time for the guys to learn. <br><br>  Another useful option is the timer: REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S allows you to customize the operation of the connected device in a specific period of time.  So that, for example, waffles in the multi- <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/286170/">Baker REDMOND MultiBaker M604 are</a> not burnt.  It‚Äôs like it happens: you started cooking, and here they call you and urgently demand, for example, to drive up to the office to solve certain work tasks.  Or the same first-grader child reports that they were released at school earlier, and the child must be met.  How to deal with waffles?  You can, cursing, stop cooking halfway, and you can leave the multi-clerk, indicating that he should turn off, say, in half an hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/757/3a3/aa0/7573a3aa0ae34029b6da93a2e7f3db22.jpg"><br><br>  It is important to note that for all supported types of household appliances - and there are more than 30 of them - in the Ready for Sky application there are ready-made work scenarios, and sometimes additional materials.  For example, for the same multibakary REDMOND MultiBaker M604 provides a set of recipes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ce2/db0/550/ce2db05501fa48819ac940a7fd791284.jpg"><br><br>  And for the heater, you can choose the mode "Apartment", "Balcony" or "Country House".  In the first case, thanks to the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S, the heater can ‚Äúinsulate‚Äù the apartment to your return from the office, not working all day long in vain and not wasting energy.  In the second, she will maintain the temperature on the balcony (for example, so that the tomatoes in the banks do not freeze over).  And in the third, in the case of a country house, warm up the home by Friday evening, when you decide to visit it, and turn off by Sunday evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5b9/670/d97/5b9670d970fb4278ae4baedfaaeace82.jpg"><br><br>  If you connect a luminaire through REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S, the user will be able to set the schedule for switching on the light (including the ‚ÄúAlarm‚Äù option in the morning), as well as adjust the presence effect.  So that the lamp automatically turns on at a certain time when the owners of the home, for example, on holiday in another country.  Thus, potential ill-wishers will see that the lights are on in the window, and will not break into the apartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/089/c20/c5a/089c20c5a192495cb60d13cccd01f7ae.jpg"><br><br>  Water heater thanks to REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S can also work on schedule.  Heating water to your return from work or, for example, coming from vacation.  That is, during the absence of the heater will not function and, as a consequence, energy will not be wasted.  But hot water will be waiting for the user to return - it's so great to take a shower after a train from Sochi, which is stuffy and filled with dubious aromas. <br><br>  Another example is a thermal steam: water for coffee and other drinks can be heated on a schedule, that is, it will be ready right by the time you, for example, arrive at the office, or children return home from school.  All you have to do is to connect the thermopot to the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S and set the appropriate settings in the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/34f/ef9/059/34fef905931044b8add721d8eca243b3.jpg"><br><br>  I emphasize that in the case of all devices connected via REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S, it is possible to lock the inclusion.  So that children do not include what they should not include at all - for example, the same iron.  Or TV, the situation with which is described above. <br><br>  The main difference between the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S and the REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S smart socket is the ability to interact with various kinds of external sensors REDMOND, which significantly expands the capabilities of the skyport and turns it into one of the centers of the smart home. <br><br>  What is the point?  The REDMOND sensor line includes, among other things, smoke, door opener and motion sensors.  Here they are just and can work in conjunction with the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S, being connected to the skyport via radio.  If the smoke detector realizes that something is burning in the room, the skyport will instantly turn off the appliance - for example, a stove, heater or kettle.  A motion sensor can capture your presence in the room, and the luminaire connected to the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S will only be lit when someone is in the room.  And, of course, turn on automatically.  Approximately the same with the door opening sensor: the light will illuminate only when someone enters.  Thus, it will not be necessary to grope a switch in the dark with your hand each time. <br><br>  It should be noted that the skyport itself costs about 2,000 rubles, and each of the sensors is less than 1,000 rubles.  So, everyone can afford to equip their housing with such a system. <br><br>  Also REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S is able to work with the REDMOND SkyClimate climate station.  The point is this: the latter monitors the temperature and microclimate in the room, and in the event of a change in the situation, sends to REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S a command to turn on one or another device.  For example, if it became too hot in the room, the fan connected to the skyport is activated, if the heater is too cold, and if the humidity falls below a critical level, a humidifier.  The thresholds for temperature and humidity are set in the application on the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9b2/469/954/9b246995421f4c218210b14efec1546b.jpg"><br><br>  Thus, REDMOND today has the usual smart sockets, there is a gateway outlet, and there are skyports.  The REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-100S smart socket for 1,499 rubles (there is another version of the REDMOND SkyPlug RSP-103S with a slightly different design, but for the same money) is the simplest: it allows you to enable and disable the equipment remotely, plus there is a schedule mode.  The socket does not know how to work with the sensors and the climate station. <br><br>  In the hero of this material, Skype REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S for 2,000 rubles, all the possibilities of smart sockets are saved, plus there is the possibility of working with smart sensors and the REDMOND climate station.  Here, perhaps, I will note that REDMOND also has a device called REDMOND SkyPort RSP-123S.  Instead of a conventional plug, it is soldered to any electrical appliance - a heater, a multi-boiler, and so on (except for irons).  Then it becomes possible to remotely control the device via Bluetooth or the Internet.  Plus REDMOND SkyPort RSP-123S can work with sensors and climate station.  That is, the functionality is exactly the same as the REDMOND SkyPort RSP-121S <br><br>  Well, it's worth remembering about the gateway outlet - this is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/288328/">REDMOND SkySocket RSP-102S-E</a> for 1,499 rubles.  It can connect to your home Wi-Fi network and does not need a gateway smartphone to control from anywhere in the world.  REDMOND SkySocket RSP-102S-E works with Ready for Sky Guard sensors. <br><br>  Finally - a few words about the center of the smart home REDMOND SkyCenter 11S and the IR remote control REDMOND SkyControl 21S.  It is worth recalling that the management of smart appliances REDMOND ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/286846/">humidifier</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/286422/">kettle</a> , <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/266380/">iron,</a> and so on) on the Internet previously needed a smart gateway.  He had to be left at home, the device was connected to REDMOND technology via Bluetooth and received commands over the Network from your main smartphone from anywhere in the world.  Such a home gateway in the form of a separate ‚Äúsmart‚Äù is quite a working solution, but perhaps it seemed to someone not too elegant.  And now REDMOND has released a specialized device for organizing remote control of the Smart Home product line.  Speech just about <b>REDMOND SkyCenter 11S</b> , estimated approximately in 1 500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0c9/296/fa9/0c9296fa9e014f2dba0866c5745a3c2e.jpg"><br><br>  REDMOND SkyCenter 11S connects to your home Wi-Fi network and, in turn, connects home appliances via Bluetooth.  Actually, everything: you can give a command to the slow cooker from the subway so that it warms up the food for your return home, as well as, for example, turn off the left iron on the way to the airport.  In general, now you can do without a smartphone-gateway.  REDMOND SkyCenter 11S looks like a more convenient and reliable solution.  In the sense that this device is enough to insert into some outlet behind the cabinet and forget about it forever.  And the same smartphone can be discharged, freeze, just turn off - in general, a lot of different troubles can happen to it. <br><br>  The <b>REDMOND SkyControl 21S</b> IR remote control (the price is also around 1,500 rubles) is intended to turn a smartphone into a remote control for all the equipment in the apartment - a TV, an air conditioner, a set-top box, and so on and so forth.  Agree, not very comfortable to rest, surrounded by a half-dozen different remotes, which are often also similar to each other.  REDMOND SkyControl 21S solves this problem once or twice: we connect it to the outlet with a cable, and to the smartphone via Bluetooth.  After that, using the REDMOND Smart Home application, you can control all home appliances with an infrared interface from the touch screen.  A useful option: the infrared ports in smartphones today almost never occur, they are only in a couple of models Xiaomi and Philips.  So REDMOND SkyControl 21S will find its fans, especially considering the affordable price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/408/5a8/5f9/4085a85f94e44e4a91cb86964caf2010.jpg"><br><br>  Which of the new REDMOND devices seems to be the most interesting and worthy of attention?  Speak in the comments and ask questions, and we will be happy to answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370469/</a></p>
