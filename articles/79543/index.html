  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New Ion Wexler. Overview</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my tenacious paws another device based on nVidia ION was caught, I already published a press release on Habr√©.  The company "Avirsa Electronics" I like first of all because it allows you to open the device and inspect the inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0a/47e/c49/f0a47ec49fb63e23203547c910311911.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is also pleasant that many of the shortcomings of the first version of VisION have been fixed.  In this model, Wi-Fi has finally appeared, different color options and two digital monitor outputs \ TV.  Well, the rest of the little things ... <br>  In the review, I decided not to focus on benchmarks, because the average capabilities of the platform are already known, and from time to time they change insignificantly.

Device dimensions - 190x135x25 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7e/fa7/848/b7efa784875d807b1dc68a139724933a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The box describes in detail the configuration of the device, from which the characteristics of the sample that came to me are visible.  Judging by the serial number, I got the third nettop from the first batch, which went into retail.  According to representatives of the manufacturer, only last week nettops received colorful boxes and began to go shopping.  The manufacturer of the platform is a well-known company Foxconn, which has a positive impact on the quality of the assembly, when compared with the first version of the device. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><ul><li>  Intel Atom 330 </li><li>  nVidia ION </li><li>  2Gb ram </li><li>  Samsung 250Gb HDD </li><li>  Wi-Fi </li><li>  Card-reader </li><li>  Gigabit lan </li><li>  7.1 Audio </li></ul><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a04/716/43f/a0471643f3259f070e717da6b9952a20.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff6/9da/2a0/ff69da2a0badf1e11edfdb2eb20524c3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The front and rear panels are packed with connectors and buttons.  On the front panel even appeared a non-standard sleep-button, which I have not yet seen on similar devices.  It should immediately be noted that the buttons do not have unpleasant backlash that take place on the Acer Revo and Wexler VisION-1.  Pictures are clickable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80a/b01/40c/80ab0140ca12b45132e271d652e5f797.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A set of four magnets to which an optional optical drive is mounted.  The drive itself, alas, did not get.  By the way, at retail it is also not visible yet, it may appear in the near future.  I wonder how the drive will be connected to the nettop ... let's hope that with a flexible usb-cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5a1/8c7/675/5a18c767539faf68acd3d0bfe76320c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This is what magnets look like when installed.  The nettop stand has two perpendicular connectors for installation, one just for the nettop, the other for the nettop with a drive.  Quite an ergonomic and spectacular solution.  VESA-mount does not interfere with the attachment of the optical drive, but does not hold it in any way, the drive will be mounted exclusively on magnets.  The mount complies with VESA 100x100 and 75x75 standards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4d/2d7/293/c4d2d7293e4437d83a00210ac4b3f569.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was in such an intricate way that I managed to connect both digital outputs to my work monitors.  The adapter mount in the HDMI port was quite flimsy, since the DVI connector interfered with it, however, a slight gap did not prevent the monitors from correctly determining on a nettop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81b/505/ace/81b505aceb2bb94cd566d644cdd15899.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can visually compare how the dimensions of the VisION-2 relate to a standard 5.25 "optical drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fec/8b2/462/fec8b24625471cb669691b5cb74fbc83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The proud volpaper with the logo appeared on both monitors right after the initial setup was completed.  The most fastidious can comment on the clutter of our office.  =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d0a/c93/73e/d0ac9373ec2c23ea18fad696bd2588ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Built-in performance testing gives 3.3 points, but it‚Äôs not very clear where such low points for performance in games and the Aero interface come from when your <a href="">younger brother</a> has better results.  The memory subsystem and the central processor (in the place of the atom, I would be proud of such a title) work more brightly.  Maybe the lack of an Aero interface in the delivery of Home Basic also affects the test results ... <br><br>  Included is a utility Badaboom, which can convert video for iphone, using the power of the integrated video card.  Left 4 Dead 2 also works quite well, although not as fast as on a full desktop.  This is mainly due to the fact that the graphic component has practically not changed relative to the first part, and also works on the Source engine five years ago. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : <br><ul><li>  Compactness </li><li>  Wi-Fi with external antenna </li><li>  Two digital video outputs </li><li>  6 USB ports </li><li>  Solid and high-quality case </li><li>  Sophisticated stand and VESA mount </li><li>  Rich set of delivery </li><li>  Several colors of performance </li></ul><br>  <b>Cons</b> : <br><ul><li>  No short DVI-D lace included </li><li>  Lack of cable organizer included </li><li>  Impossibility of upgrade (without loss of warranty) </li></ul><br><br>  As I wrote at the beginning of the review, most of the shortcomings of the first VisION model were corrected, but the ‚Äúchildhood diseases‚Äù remained.  I do not understand why not to put in a set a short monitor cord and a loop cable organizer.  The impossibility of upgrading nettops is already time to take for granted, but nothing prevents to organize a compartment to replace the hard disk or RAM, by analogy with many laptops. <br><br>  Personally, I liked the nettop much more than all the other devices that have passed through me, both by touch and by hardware.  Yes, and dark blue textolite to this has ... but more on that later.  =) <br><br>  Find in stores Wexler VisION-2, similar to the hero of the review - can be approximately <b>16000r</b> .  All the same, but with Windows 7 Starter - for <b>13000r</b> .  A great option for a New Year's gift. <br><br>  <b>See you ... an autopsy will follow ...</b> <br><br>  <b>upd!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>It just turned out that after opening the nettop is not removed from the guarantee.</b>  <b>The warranty is valid only for components included in the product.</b>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>The use of third-party components does not affect the warranty of the motherboard.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79543/</a></p>
