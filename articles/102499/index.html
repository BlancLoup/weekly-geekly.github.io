  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cisco CCNA / ICND1 for every self-respecting system administrator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  At the 3rd year of university I got the subject ‚ÄúComputer systems and networks‚Äù. The subject in general told about OS and networks, I was interested in this topic and it was one of the first subjects I was interested in, I bought a couple of books on this topic. and began to study the issue in more detail, especially I liked the book ‚Äú <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4750268/">Computer Networks.</a>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4750268/">Principles, technologies, protocols</a> ‚Äù!  But in fact, I studied it for myself and when I recruited special confirmation of the deep knowledge of the OSI model and the TCP / IP stack did not exist. <br>  As a result, as time passed, I finished the university slowly moving up the professional ladder and when planning the next job shift I decided to somehow confirm my knowledge of any of the MS or Cisco certificates.  I started to study the issue in more detail and decided to stop at Cisco courses (I initially thought that Cisco is very cool, difficult and generally for a mega guru :)), and MS to study independently with books. <br><br><h4>  About the courses themselves </h4><img src="http://i9.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0824/ed/755c7985b8ebf251da612a2f7b872bed.jpg" align="right" alt="Cisco networking academy"><br>  After searching for courses, I decided to stop at a 3-month course on Cisco CCNA directly from the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/web/learning/netacad/index.html">Cisco Networking Academy</a> .  Courses are held at one of the Moscow Institutes at fairly reasonable prices (I will not write exactly where they would think that advertising, but in principle I think it‚Äôs easy to get from the information that I already wrote to google in 10 minutes) 35 tr.  Considering that the total duration of the courses lasts about 72 full hours (not academics). Those who dealt with this issue I think will understand all the pros and cons of such training. <br>  Well, now, after completing the full course of CCNA, I can say for sure that every person who has something to do with networks should have ccna level, no matter how - self-study, half-year or 10-day courses, the main thing is that knowledge is not on paper ( dump) and real. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About CCNA </h4><br>  In general, who has not come across this direction and does not know what is being studied at ccna, thinks - ‚ÄúWhat for me, CCNA?  I never saw Tsiski in my eyes. ‚Äù <br>  But in fact, this course as it turned out quite for beginners.  It all starts with the basics, from such basics from which even sometimes you start not to smile arbitrarily and smile, I just because I understood how well that I did not go to the 10-day course for 80t.r.! <br>  In fact, CCNA is divided into 4 chapters, and also includes 2 subcourses ICND1, ICND2: <img src="http://i9.fastpic.ru/big/2010/0824/4b/1b157638f1ec37d9479da10ebe8d5c4b.jpg" align="right" alt="image"><br>  1) Basics of basics - OSI model, TCP / IP stack and other network technologies - the material is set out very well and structured, after passing the first chapter in my head everything fell into place, 70% of the information I knew before, but all this the information in my head was loose in a chaotic order, and now everything is clear and understandable. <br>  The first chapter does not have anything to do with Tsisks ... <br>  2) Routing - this chapter discusses the routing technologies, static and dynamic well, and the configuration on the cisks of all these routing protocols, but even if you exclude Tsiski and their configuration, the chapter is very useful because  All dynamic routing protocols are considered in great detail and thoroughly, considering that of the 3 protocols, only one is purely ciskovsky (EIGRP) and all others including statics can be implemented on all other pieces of hardware including * Nix systems. <br>  At the same time, the ICND1 course ends, so ICND1 is generally very weakly related to cisco hardware. <br>  3) The third chapter is shorter compared to the first two, in general terms, the division of a grid into subnets VLAN, VLSM, etc. <br>  4) Chapter 4 is already more focused on configuring Tsisok - VPN, secure hardware configuration. <br>  ICND2 includes the 3rd 4th chapter.

    <h4>  findings </h4><br>  In the end, I was very sorry that while I was studying at the university I did not pass such a course, the order in my head still did not interfere with anyone, well, and the beautiful inscription on the resume that can be confirmed will be only a plus.  That's why I think that those who are interested in the direction of networks and administration, the CCNA or ICND1 course will not be superfluous at all, but will only be a big bold plus, but how can anyone decide these underreaches and status themselves, it was more convenient for me to attend courses and listening to the teacher, it will be easier for someone to read a couple of books and not spend money on teachers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102499/</a></p>
