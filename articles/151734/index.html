This is the first such big event that Dell will hold in our country. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What is this event and whom we invite ...</b> <b><br></b> <br>  This event is considered by Dell as an opportunity to present to the Russian partners, customers and journalists the full range of Dell solutions developed by the corporation, all the innovations of our IT products. <br>  You will be able to ask questions that interest you, both in the conference halls and at the round tables that will be held as part of the Dell Solutions Forum.  There you can take part in discussions where modern methods of reliable storage of information assets, protection of data, construction of highly scalable IT platforms, creating the basis for a cost-effective approach to the development of infrastructure of enterprises of various sectors of the economy, will be discussed.

      Of course, we will talk about the entire wide range of Dell solutions for commercial and consumer segments.  We will talk about the essence of the concept of Bring Your Own Device.  In fact, we believe that such a trend is gradually gaining momentum as the gradual merging of two hitherto independent areas: computer systems for work and computers for personal use.  The trend, when the same systems can be used for professional and leisure purposes, is now at the center of attention of Dell, and we are in a hurry to share with you our findings and plans on this matter. <br><br>  The Dell Solutions Forum will be one of the first events in Russia (and maybe even the first) where the line of devices on Win8 will be officially and in detail presented - the embargo on the presentation of the system is removed on October 26, a few days before our forum. <br><br>  But we are not going to dwell on ourselves.  Dell Solutions Forum is an event where we share our views on IT development, trends and prospects in our professional field.  Presentations will be made not only by Russian and European representatives of Dell, but also by our partners (Microsoft, Intel, etc.), as well as clients with their own cases and success stories. <br><br>  <b>How it will all go ...</b> <b><br></b> <br>  The whole program of the day is divided into two large blocks.  In the morning, from 10:00 to 13:00, we will hold a few general lectures with Dell representatives, experts and partners.  And in the second half of the day, from 14:30 to 17:00, we will divide into groups and work on parallel thematic sections on methods of storing and protecting information, building IT platforms, infrastructure and cloud solutions, etc. (it‚Äôs a pity that you can‚Äôt break and participate in two or three round tables at once, right?). <br><br>  It won't do without an exclusive: until we reveal all the secrets, but one of the world's leading IT auditors is going to our forum.  And he will not speak common phrases about the importance of IT innovation as such - his story will be about how to think, choosing these innovations for your business. <br><br>  And of course, you will have the opportunity to talk with colleagues, partners and even - not afraid of this word - competitors on the sidelines, in areas for informal communication or at a friendly cocktail party in the evening, after the forum. <br>  <b>For whom is this event ...</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Who will find the Dell Solutions Forum most useful and interesting?  We are waiting for IT decision makers, including CIO / CIO, heads of IT departments, consultants from system integrators. <br><br>  To our great regret, our forum will not be able to accommodate everyone, and we will have to make a small competitive selection.  To apply for participation in the forum, click <a href="http://goo.gl/6qpxZ">on this link</a> and register.  Do not forget to indicate that you learned about the forum through social networks (Habr).  As we process applications, we will confirm invitations.  Participation in the forum is free. <br><br>  And although we are already planning a series of publications on Habr√© following the results of the forum, we will not retell everything in any case.  So, perhaps, the Dell Solutions Forum is exactly that professional event that should not be missed.  Do not delay with <a href="http://goo.gl/6qpxZ">registration</a> . <br><br>  If you have any questions, you can directly contact your Dell representative <a href="">Marat Rakayev</a> . <br><br>  <b>When and where will all this take place ...</b> <b><br></b> <br>  October 31, 2012 <br>  Forum Hours: 09:00 - 18:30 <br>  Venue: Exhibition Center "Infospace", Moscow, 1st Zachatievsky lane, 4 <br>  m. "Kropotkinskaya" or "Culture Park" <br>  Participation is free </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151734/</a></p>
