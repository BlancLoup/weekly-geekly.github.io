  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Notepad vs goal setting service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The beginning of the year is associated with many new beginnings and ideas.  It is necessary to set new goals and identify the prospects for their development.  The reality is that there are no goals, no actions - no achievements.  The choice in the direction of self-development and self-education in recent years has become more and more popular, and the path to development and achievements is built precisely by goals.  Goals keep the focus on the important and do not allow to spend it on other things. <br><br>  It should be understood that technology does not stand still and carry useful target-setting services to the masses.  Someone in the old manner writes down goals in a notebook or his diary, others are looking for more promising online platforms.  Today we will try to do a kind of ‚Äúdebriefing‚Äù and compare the old methods of working with goals with the help of a notebook and modern ones, using the example of a social service to <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">achieve goals - SmartProgress</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f8/0ae/d48/8f80aed4891f47f590744a1a4fd9c5f4.jpg">

Sociality </h4><br>  Why is SmartProgress social?  Here, participants are not locked in their account with a list of goals, being within the framework of limited personal experience and lifestyle.  Profiles and goals are by default open to the world and this facilitates communication between people with similar goals, sharing experiences and allows you to inspire yourself and inspire others.  The ability to look at other people's goals and see the realism of their achievement is a great motivator.  Is a paper notebook capable of this? <br>  <b><i>0 points notebook</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>1 point online service</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  2. Mobility </h4><br>  Only guest workers do not have a smart phone in their pockets now.  And in this regard, SmartProgress is not far behind - the project has mobile applications for the 2 most popular Android and iOS platforms.  This is a significant plus to mobility and convenience, allowing you to work with your own goals on the road or free moment of waiting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/3e0/77e/3433e077ee630bff9547871133abc451.jpg"><br><br>  Notebook also does not take up much space in your bag or pocket, this is +. <br>  <b><i>1 point notepad</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>1 point SmartProgress</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  3. Publicity and price of the word </h4><br>  When a person declares a goal on a site, he subconsciously begins to understand that now he must not only himself, but also those around him.  Retreat is equivalent to the recognition of a weakling.  Practice has shown that for many it is a powerful incentive to move forward. <br><br>  In addition, SmartProgress has in its arms a special tool that can enhance the effect of publicity.  All of us in our childhood did something to argue, at that moment they put much more effort into winning the argument by all means.  The price of the word is an identical way to start the excitement and motivation in the process of achieving the goal.  It works very simple - make a bet on yourself and your goal.  If the goal is reached, the money goes back, the goal is failed, they burn out of the account. <br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/site/promise/">More information about the price of the word can be found on the promo page.</a> <br>  <b><i>0 points notebook</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>1 point SmartProgress</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  How does the project work? </h4><br>  Registration on the site is possible through the main popular social networks, and registration through an email is simple to disgrace - 3 input fields and you already have your profile.  After registration, it is possible to create your goal, subscribe to other people's goals, set templates and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  4. Templates </h4><br>  Templates are ready-made instructions for achieving the goals, which are experts who have a wealth of experience in achieving this goal.  It is very easy to work - choose the desired template from the list of available ones, install it and now it is already in your profile as a draft.  Here it is possible to customize it for yourself, change the picture, the text and then publish it.  This saves a lot of time, you do not have to search for the necessary information yourself, useful links are already inside.  What is important after the installation appears a block with a list of people who have installed the same template!  This is a very interesting feature!  Now you can peek at the goal of other users. <br>  <b><i>Another 1 point in SmartProgress, for a notebook everything is sad - 0 points</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  5. Conscious goal setting </h4><br>  The process of creating a goal takes place in 3 stages, with the creation of a mode at the top of the page.  By default, the ‚ÄúSimple‚Äù mode is enough to get acquainted with the basic tools.  When you get comfortable go to the "Advanced".  They differ in the number of questions that are asked in the creation process.  These questions are aimed at ensuring that the author is deeper plunged into an understanding of his goal and an awareness of its importance or unimportance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db8/90c/0e5/db890c0e5bdcf8f767c53aa8773e9a52.jpg"><br><br>  A distinctive feature of SmartProgress from similar analogues is the work with stages.  As you know, big goals and tasks should always be broken down into small ones, otherwise this goal is not perceived by the brain.  This principle was introduced by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">Allen in his GTD</a> and there is no doubt about its effectiveness.  On the service, you can break the goal into sub-steps and make these sub-steps separate goals, you get the hierarchical structure of your goals. <br><br>  Completion criterion, environmental goals, personal resources.  One can get acquainted with all these terms more closely and learn a lot of new things in goal setting not from a theoretical but from a practical point of view. <br>  At any time you create a goal, it can be added to drafts and finalized later.  This is especially important when there are a lot of stages, but I don‚Äôt want to publish it unfinished. <br><br>  Such trifles affect the overall feeling and quality of the service in general. <br><br>  <b><i>Notebook silent, set 0 points.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>1 point online service.</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  6. Tactility </h4><br>  A good notebook brings some tangibility to everyday life.  To pick up a pen and write down something in your favorite moleskine is an irreplaceable sensation for some.  It is not always pleasant to work with the cold screen of your smartphone or to type ‚Äúdigital‚Äù letters on the keyboard. <br>  <b><i>+1 point notepad</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>0 online service</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  7. Gamification. </h4><br>  The services incorporating the mechanics of online games into their functionality enjoy great success.  So in the same Foursquare there is a system of badges, and in Lingvaleo - levels.  On SmartProgress there is also a system of levels, while it is non-linear, at the 5th level the user can choose the direction of development of his character.  Different directions allow you to receive different bonuses for activity on the site. <br>  The progress bar accompanying any goal displays the current status in achieving the goal.  Having crossed out the next stage, observe how the progress bar is painted over and is approaching the finish.  And this is what makes the activity on the site not only interesting, but also carries a payload for other users.  The progress bar displays progress and creates a complete picture of the goal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f12/998/26e/f1299826efcc5ced19ddd94faee4d8ad.jpg"><br><br>  <b><i>0 points notebook</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>+1 SmartProgress</i></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b1/135/2bd/6b11352bdc0bff1326fedc64c098385d.jpg" align="left"><h4>  Summing up </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/623/3d4/358/6233d435837e2b1e6b2a0bfa8a9d2456.jpg"><br><br>  In everyday life, the feeling of pleasure from small things leading to our goals is often lost.  And tracking our results makes it clear that we are not wasting our days, if there is any sense in them and whether something can be improved. <br><br>  A person uses those tools that are convenient to him and the above list is subjective.  Whether it's a notebook or an application on the phone, only the results are important.  If it is more convenient to use a diary, use it.  For those who are just looking for their system to work with goals, we suggest <a href="https://smartprogress.do/">trying SmartProgress</a> .  Many users have already appreciated its functionality and implemented in everyday life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/272/be5/00d/272be500d6c2a05edf5a036b1af5b7a8.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211244/</a></p>
