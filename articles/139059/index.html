  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scrum, CSM and Robin Diamond March 5-6 in St. Petersburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I cannot fail to publish reflections from Tanya Vasilyeva about the upcoming CSM certification in St. Petersburg on March 5-6.  Can not argue! <br><br>  ‚ÄúProbably there are few people who would not have their own opinion about Agile.  The number of disputes and wars around this topic is already starting off scale.  And Scrum is the most popular Agile methodology - like no one is overgrown with myths and prejudices. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I often come across very categorical opinions from ‚ÄúScrum will solve any of your problems quickly and efficiently‚Äù to ‚ÄúThere is no more nonsense than yours this Scrum‚Äù.  As a rule, any such opinion is only the result of a misunderstanding of what is behind each of the tools offered by the methodology. <br><br>  Once, back in 2005 (or even in 2004), our customers began to implement Scrum in our company.  We were forced to use tools, without really explaining what we want to achieve with these tools and why we want to achieve this.  And my first reaction, as a programmer and team-leader, was extremely negative.  But behind it came the desire to understand.  And then I went to Moscow for certification from <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/">ScrumAlliance</a> .  By that time, I had already read a couple of books on Agile and had already managed to fill some cones.  And it seemed to me that I did not learn anything new.  I did not know. <br>  But in two days of training, each tool of the Scrum methodology was supplemented with an understanding of the situations in which it can be applied.  It is understanding that allows us to analyze each specific case and apply (or not to apply) the knowledge and tools that we own.  And to do it consciously, and not because it is fashionable or someone somewhere said that this should help.  So now I advise everyone to go through this training.  Especially if you think that you have implemented Scrum and you no longer have anything to improve.  Especially if you think that you have tried Scrum and realized that this does not suit you.  And of course, if you have specific questions about how Scrum works, or why it does not work in any given situation.

      And I am writing about it today because now there is a good chance to get certified in St. Petersburg.  Robin Diamond (the person with whom I passed my second certification for Product Owner) comes to us.  Robin Diamond‚Äôs ‚ÄúCertified ScrumMaster‚Äù training will be held March 5-6.  In addition, upon completion of the training, a ScrumAlliance certificate is issued.  Details <a href="http://agilerussia.ru/events/training-robin-dymond-spb_march_2012/">here</a> .
