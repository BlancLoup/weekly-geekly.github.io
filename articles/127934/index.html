Now we are ready to tell you in details and from the first person what is planned, what processes are already taking place and what news and innovations are waiting for you further. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0f/49f/354/e0f49f35429b0784cbff127dd05cddef.png" alt="image"><br><h5>  Q: Grandma said in two? </h5><br>  A: What you heard is true.  At a press conference at the RIA Novosti press center, the heads of the REG.RU registrar and the Masterhost group of companies officially shared their joint plans to solve the problems facing the market today. <br>  <a href="http://ria.ru/press_video/20110906/431072152.html">Video of the press conference</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Q: What will it be? </h5><br>  A: Shareholders of companies made a strategic decision on joint activities, the organizational and legal form of interaction between companies will be determined later.

    <h5>  Q: Who did you eat? </h5><br>  A: Officially, we are not talking about takeover or any other forms of M &amp; A.  It is about cooperation, involving the sharing of resources, opportunities, technological base for solving business problems and further joint development in the market. <br><br><h5>  Q: "The Empire Strikes Back"? </h5><br>  A: The market is ‚Äúripe‚Äù for the emergence of new major players: there is a transition from a highly specialized market to a massive one, along with its active growth.  Joint activities and pooling of resources will allow companies to develop to meet all the needs of a growing market, provide new technological solutions and services, as well as high-quality customer service. <br><br><h5>  Q: And who needs it? </h5><br>  A: The goal of combining companies is to achieve new success, create a new client market and promote the development of the industry.  We strive, firstly, to offer our clients the best services, services, developments of each company, and secondly, to combine resources and capacities to create new services and technological solutions that will move the market forward. <br><br>  We will quote REG.RU CEO Alexei Korolyuk: ‚ÄúWe want, by combining our knowledge, experience and resources, to provide the market with new technological solutions, new products arising from our knowledge and experience.  The market needs a driver, we need a team, we need technological solutions that are available to interested users and professionals.  We would like to create a market in terms of technology and to develop it to the maximum: create a new one and use the new for the benefit of all the participants in the process.  This is where we see our task. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Q: Who is here? </h5><br>  A: Today, REG.RU and Masterhost are serviced by more than 1,100,000 domain names and more than 500,000 clients, which represents 20% of the domain and hosting market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ba/acc/740/1baacc7404755c1bcc41b953dabe9dc1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d52/dcd/e22/d52dcde2276d71dcfd467b399512ff07.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Full data on the domain and hosting market presented by <a href="http://www.openstat.ru/">Openstat.ru</a> : <a href="http://img.reg.ru/conference/domeni_rossii.ppt">img.reg.ru/conference/domeni_rossii.ppt</a> <br><br>  If you look closely at these statistics, you can see that more than 10% of the Russian market is occupied by foreign hosting companies.  This trend is a logical continuation of the situation in the Russian market: more than 500 companies offer hosting services, only about 200 of them work with a license, more than 300 provide services as intermediaries, often without the necessary resources and without providing a decent customer service.  Whereas foreign hosters attract customers with their pricing policies and high manufacturability (good equipment abroad is much more affordable). <br><br>  To return consumers of hosting services to Russia is one of the tasks to be solved by large market participants.  We are ready to compete with foreign companies at the expense of a decent technological base created by combined resources, and high-quality customer service in their native language. <br><br>  Of course, in the Russian domain and hosting market there is the potential for lower prices.  There is an active market growth due to the influx of new consumers.  In any market, the rule applies: the more customers, the lower the price.  The hosting and domain market is no exception, which is easily traced by the movement of domain prices in .RU / . zones.  Once the price for a domain was $ 100, then dropped to $ 50, now - 590 rubles.  Now in the zones. RF and .RU about 4 million registered domains, for comparison, in .COM - 95 million domains.  The potential for growth is, as is, and the potential for reducing the cost of services. <br><br>  We will be happy to answer your questions.  And also hear your opinions, suggestions and wishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127934/</a></p>
