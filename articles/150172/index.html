  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Education mobility</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>/ *</b> This post reflects my judgment on today's education and teaching methods.  I am not trying to advertise any services mentioned here, I just want to share my idea about now days education, which in the past helped me to organize my time competently <b>* /</b> <br><h4>  Overall picture </h4><br>  Most people use public transportation.  Let's think about how much time we waste by pushing in an electric train / subway / bus, etc.  Let me tell you about my situation: I live in the suburbs, 6/7 days a week went to university in Moscow.  Approximate travel time to the university: 15 minutes by bus + 30 minutes by train + 20 minutes on foot = 65 minutes, we multiply by two (go home too), we have <b>~ 130 minutes of</b> absolutely lost time. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How to spend time with benefit? </h4><br>  So, we have about <b>130 minutes of</b> conditionally free time per day (I think everyone understands why it is conditionally free).  For a student (at least a physics and technology department) this is a disaster.  Realizing all this, I thought, ‚ÄúNooo, boy, things will not work, let's do something interesting,‚Äù and the solution was found! <br>  During my studies, I often use the iPad as a work tool (books, graphics, some lectures, etc.).  One day, after talking with an older student who also lives far from the university, he learned that he solves the problem for <b>130 minutes with</b> <b>iTunes U</b> service.  Of course, I had heard about this service before, but after my comrade's enthusiastic exclamations about the benefits of this service, I also decided to ask more seriously about it. <br><h4>  Way out </h4><br><img src="http://internetua.com/upload/tinymce/images/MarinaV7/itunesu-222.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So, this badge opened for me as a cherished Eldorado of knowledge.  This service offers you a huge freedom of choice.  You can learn almost everything: from oratory and the history of English to computer science and atomic physics.  It so happened that in the summer I had to learn a lot of algorithms, practically starting from scratch.  Taking advantage of the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Second-Edition-Thomas/dp/0262032937">Algorithms: Construction and Analysis,</a> I realized that, nevertheless, this is not enough and you need to listen to something.  One day, while browsing courses in iTunes, U came across a course on Algorithms from MIT.  A quick glance at the description made it clear that the course was made entirely on the book! <br>  <u>What is attractive about this service:</u> <br>  1) <b>Mobility</b> - if you have any device from Apple with a diagonal of 3.5 ', you can listen to courses everywhere! <br>  2) <b>Synchronize</b> data between all devices. <br>  3) The presence of a large number of <b>interesting courses</b> in good quality from the largest universities in the world. <br>  4) Everything is absolutely <b>free</b> ! <br><br>  Language is English only.  This may cause some difficulties in learning, but in general, if you are watching technical lectures, the pronunciation of lecturers is quite clear (even among Americans), so a foreigner is understandable + of course, good courses have pdf lecture slides (something like ).  It is also a good idea to have an American Apple ID, because there will probably be more courses in the US service. <br>  Even if you do not have any device from Apple, it does not prevent you from learning.  You just download iTunes client on your PC, go to the iTunes U service and do the same. <br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  <b>130 minutes</b> - almost two lectures from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255">cs193</a> .  Of course, everyone chooses how to spend this time, but you must admit that throwing time into an empty one is quite a pity. <br>  <i>A small list of interesting courses:</i> <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ipad-iphone-application-development/id473757255%3Fmt%3D10">iOS Dev</a> <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/introduction-to-algorithms/id341597754%3Fmt%3D10">Algorithms: Construction and Analysis</a> <br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/brain-structure-its-origins/id385157530%3Fmt%3D10">Brain structure</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/">Link to the official description of the service</a> </div>
