  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Post of Russia. Endgame</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day! <br>  Half a year has passed since many of the buyers over the hill experienced a post collapse of early 2010.  Then in March 2010 I published a video message and, perhaps, this shook this stronghold of Sovdepiia a little bit. <br>  Captain Obvious hints that if I write in this blog, then I definitely have some results that I would like to share with you.  It so happened that in the past 6 months, I became even more convinced that I could not hope for the Post of Russia, even when sending internal letters, under the cut proof. <br>  Everything that I will describe <b>happened to me by accidental coincidence of circumstances</b> .  To reach this, recording the video in March, even in my thoughts was not.  Perhaps my experience will be useful to any of you.  However, I am sure that many of you will be turned back by this senseless and merciless bureaucratic machine, which I had to face in the face of federal structures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How was it next </h4><br>  At the time of recording the video message (March 16, 2010), I had 8 parcels in the black mail and customs hole.  In the video one of the first, I indicated this track number: CQ003166534US.  I still received the parcel!  So she came to me: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d8a8af96/85c56a40/91e68c79/e139fc65.jpg"><br><br>  Crawling on <a href="http://www.ebay-forum.ru/">www.ebay-forum.ru</a> , I stumbled upon a post in which shoppers displeased with the work of the Russian Post wrote to the <a href="http://www.rsoc.ru/treatments/ask-question/">Roskomnadzor Internet reception</a> and received written answers about the results of the appeal.  By the way, there is also a reference to the federal law 59-FZ ‚ÄúOn the procedure for considering appeals of citizens of the Russian Federation‚Äù.  (At leisure, I advise you to read, useful thing.) <br><br>  Without thinking twice, I filled out the application form and sent it, not particularly hoping for the result.  After a while, I did receive a written response from this structure (Shl: at that time I did not receive the package yet). <br>  <a href="">Read Roskomnadzor letter</a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

        </script>
      <br>
      According to the response of Roskomnadzor, the following happened: <br>  <b>- the parcel flew by no means a month</b> (a month on a board of a plane - the name of the video) from the USA to this country, as seen from the tracking above, but only <b>4 days</b> (February 19 - February 23).  Moreover, there is no date in the tracking above 23.02.  Well, then?  And then the month just lay (until 20.03).  Well, yes, I understand, the dam ... <br><br><h4>  "‚Ä¶ I'm not guilty..." </h4><br>  Well, the thought came: once FGUPchik is guilty and the superior structure has already established it, it would be very logical to write a complaint and compensate for the delay in a poorly rendered service.  Moreover, the delivery on this item cost me $ 38 - a trifle, but it's nice ... <br>  I wrote a paper letter to the department of claim work on international postal exchange, enclosed the Roskomnizdor‚Äôs reply to the letter, and a copy of the customs declaration so that the overdue could be calculated and paid to me. <br>  I sent the letter of compensation claim by mail to the Post Office in Moscow.  Recursion, but it's flowers.  You can <a href="http://info.russianpost.ru/servlet/post_item">check it</a> yourself (RPO number 61304623405695) how this letter to the main mailers went and have fun.  But the <a href="">screen deserves</a> , nevertheless.  Warning: unknown mark. <br><br>  In other words, the <b>letter did not reach the Russian Post and returned back 2 months later</b> , despite the sorting <s>Podolsk</s> nanocenters, with which valiant <s>effective</s> mail managers are proud (at that moment Podolsky, by the way, did boast). <br>  Having sent a letter in the middle of May, I realized that it was time to entrust the claim to the electronic communication channels, which had already proved itself in the case of Roskomnadzor, and still sent the contents of the paper letter to elena.kolesnik@russianpost.ru after having phoned Elena Elena herself (the woman is very polite and responsible).  After a while my claim was considered by her superiors and sent a written response. <br><br><h4>  Strelochniki - part of the harsh reality of this country </h4><br>  <a href="">Read the answer of the Russian Post</a> <br>  This is how the situation turns out, the mail is ‚Äúnot in business‚Äù and is not going to pay me. <br>  Going on the principle, but from a sporting interest, I <b>wrote a registered letter to the International Post Office in Moscow</b> , where the package was inspected and put a copy of the mail reply (without Roskomnadzor‚Äôs response). <br>  <a href="">Customs response</a> <br>  And they also (well, it turns out ...) "not in the business."  I remind you, reader, that all this correspondence and red tape (at that time it was already June / July) are going on specifically one international shipment. <br><br>  Since no one is to blame, (we understand that someone is still guilty and simply does not confess, as usually happens in this country), then <b>the idea arose to file a claim for consumer rights protection in court</b> . <br>  <a href="">The first page of the claim</a> , and the <a href="">second</a> . <br><br>  <b>The court is scheduled for December 1 of this year</b> .  My truth-seeking is not an ‚Äúorder‚Äù at all.  I heard here that some of the dismissed employees of the Kirov branch of the post office are even ready to give the sum to the customer.  It became most interesting ... (By the way, in the region, the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù of delivering such packages works, in my opinion, well). <br>  Partly to blame for the delay in passing the MPO CQ003166534US, there may be customs, but it is necessary to file a lawsuit against the service provider, and there it will be seen. <br>  It is likely that the defendant will go to a higher authority, but I personally don‚Äôt understand how they will prove their innocence and how. <br><br><h4>  Endgame </h4><ul><li>  Winter is coming, which means the situation may happen again ... So, be vigilant!  Lawyer-kun notes that in theory, you can write a claim on my sample, and not to write numerous requests to the post office and customs. <br>  The court itself will request the necessary documents from all structures ... The court for the protection of consumer rights, which means that you are simply exempt from state duty, the case is considered at the place of residence of the claimant, that is, you do not need to go anywhere. </li><li>  I really hope that this post is honored by effective managers and the press service of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise and will not relax in the future (you are not so unattainable). </li><li>  Probably, some of you saw the story on the TV channel "Russia 2" from 11/16/2010.  <b>Plots were actually two</b> (the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DdW6wAVIe_H4">first</a> and <a href="http://www.vesti.ru/videos%3Fvid%3D307531%26cid%3D700">second</a> at 11 minutes, after the intervention of the mail).  Those who are in the subject understand that the <b>plots of the off-screen text and the presentation of information differ wildly and both are not very correct in themselves</b> .  For example, parcels no longer go through just one international exchange point in Moscow; after the collapse, several were built.  I myself received a package in May, which was imported in Kaliningrad, which I talked about during the shooting.  And the question of sorting is a completely different opera, and where it is incomprehensible to me.  Some things were said by me <u>in the past tense</u> , and are given in the video as <u>in the present</u> .  The whole story above was also told, but showed nothing.  The second movie, in my opinion, is delusional, a little more than full. <br>  In my opinion, there is an attempt to replace the concepts, confuse the topic of international postal exchange with the notorious sorting shop in Podolsk, whitewash the FSUE and at the same time expose me incompetent, which is much cheaper and more profitable than the kipsh around the structure itself (there is information that the press service of the mail was indignant and asked remove the video from the air). </li><li>  There is a lawsuit, there will be a trial ... Nefig was "football formal replies" and make me an idiot on TV. </li></ul><br><h5>  P.S: </h5>  I wrote the claim for the most undelivered letter with the claim to the post and received compensation after a month and a half. <br>  In the summer, the post was corrected and set records - two weeks for delivery of an unregistered small package from China, but I had to wait for the last parcel from Singapore for about a month (October 13 - November 8). <br>  And I also sincerely hope that this winter there will not be a ‚Äúblack post and customs hole‚Äù.  I wish good luck to the employees of all postal and customs services in their hard work! <br><br>  The same text, although I am not an amateur, in <a href="http://cyxou.livejournal.com/8336.html">LJ</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108343/</a></p>
