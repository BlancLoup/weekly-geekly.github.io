  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference Report ‚ÄúLooking to the Electronic Future‚Äù - #eFuture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  September 13-14, Sochi hosted the international conference ‚ÄúLooking to the electronic future‚Äù, which was mainly devoted to cloud technologies.  It was organized by Rostelecom. <br>  I was invited to the press tour from the company as a blogger with Habr.  In this post I will talk about how this trip went, I will note the most interesting moments from the speech, and share my impressions. <br>  Actually for me this is the first press tour, so I will note the ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù moments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c6/317/034/0c631703445c41853c59918c6bb0731d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We flew out of the terminal D Sheremetyevo, September 12.  A little more than two hours before departure, I landed in the same terminal returning from Holland.  Fortunately, my flight did not linger, and I ran and passed the passport and customs control and joined the rest of Rostelecom.

      Flying over Zelenograd, I could not help but photograph my hometown: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fb/0e9/c79/4fb0e9c79fdb342b02341f9da156d9a5.jpg"><br><br>  Two and a half hours later we landed at Adler airport, got into a minibus and drove to the Marins Park hotel.  As always, Sochi was stuck in traffic jams.  I wasted time watching the online broadcast of the presentation of the widely discussed gadget. <br><br>  We got to the hotel, left the things in the rooms and went to dinner, where we were deliciously fed and watered. <br><br>  The next morning I managed to capture a wonderful view from the hotel window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dea/b57/6d1/deab576d1e9b4ada1000826d9b067e0d.jpg"><br><br>  ... and joined a group of journalists traveling to Radisson SAS Lazurnaya, in whose congress hall the conference was held. <br><br>  Pending the start of the conference: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b71/a29/5e2/b71a295e217ed3769987db64dd3b69dd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbb/723/b09/bbb723b098e9867b708d004ded35ff00.jpg"><br><br>  ... participants gather in the hall: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f22/8d9/273/f228d9273dc90f414d32c7348a42203c.jpg"><br><br>  Video of Cnews.  On the threshold of the conference, Alexey Nashchekin talks about her program: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kzjIIWWK-EM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi_3RNdvFogCnk0e3v4YryXJImPcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The entire conference was broadcast online on the Rostelecom website.  Now you can <a href="http://www.rostelecom.ru/projects/innovations/conference/live/">see in the record</a> . <br><br>  At the same time was broadcast on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/%40rostelecom_news">@rostelecom_news</a> . <br>  Those present (including myself) tweeted with the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/">hashtag #eFuture</a> <br><br>  I see no reason to describe in detail the chronology of speeches, I think it is better to see the record.  Just to mention the most memorable moments from the speeches. <br><br><h4>  Clouds  The time has come. </h4><br>  Andrei Aksenov, Rostelecom. <br>  It was told about the benefits of the cloud approach. <br><br><h4>  Public services in the service of the population. </h4><br>  Dmitry Tarasov, Minister of Information Technologies and Communications of the Chelyabinsk Region. <br>  It was announced about the leadership (among the subjects of the Russian Federation) of the Chelyabinsk region in the field of transfer of public services into electronic form. <br><br><h4>  Electronic government of the Republic of Kazakhstan. </h4><br>  The topic of the speech is clear from the title. <br>  I remember a statement that in Kazakhstan you can register a legal entity online. <br>  I liked the statement of Gerhard Schroeder, given in the presentation: <br>  "Data should run, not people." <br><br><h4>  Single information space of the modern metropolis. </h4><br>  Alexander Martynov, NVisionGroup <br>  The problems of the implementation of the Safe City projects are touched upon, the project ‚Äú7.  CITY.  Safe City ‚Äù, which should be completed in December of this year, and is now at the stage of the current layout. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Based Smart Life </h4><br>  National IT Industry Promotion Agency, Korea <br>  The forecast was presented that in the near future the share of mobile users of the network will increase the share of ordinary ones.  In this regard, in Korea, the e-government phase has already been passed, it was replaced by the Mobile e-government. <br>  In fact, everything is implemented in the form of mobile applications. <br><br><h4>  IBM Cloud Computing. </h4><br>  Stiven Deskovic. <br>  A story about the prospects of cloud solutions from the point of view of the company IBM. <br><br><h4>  Cloud technologies: trends and usage models. </h4><br>  Oleg Syutin, director of technology policy, Microsoft Russia. <br>  Talked about the benefits of cloud technology. <br>  I remember the moment from the speech, where it was said that with the existing technologies the human genome can be decoded in 24 hours, and costs about 1 thousand dollars. <br>  In the future, it will be much faster and cheaper, which will allow doctors to prescribe medicines adapted for a specific patient. <br><br><h4>  The future of e-school. </h4><br>  Timur Akhmedov, BARS Group <br>  The speaker shared his vision of the role of gadgets in education. <br>  Interesting, in my opinion, was the concept of ‚ÄúSchoolchildren's Cards‚Äù, which besides being a passport to an educational institution, allows parents to see that their child really was at school, came and went at a certain time. <br>  Also, the student can pay with this card, for example, in the school canteen. <br><br><h4>  Future of medicine </h4><br>  Rustam Sungatov, General Director of KIR, began his presentation with a demonstration of an episode from the movie ‚ÄúPrometheus‚Äù Ridley Scott.  The very moment when Elizabeth Shaw is in a ‚Äúmedical unit‚Äù that removes the ‚Äúalien‚Äù embryo from her. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe whole speech was the need to eliminate the bureaucratic stage between the patient and receiving medical care. <br><br><h4>  The future of mobile applications </h4><br>  Sergey Shilov, General Director of AT Consulting, significantly revived the situation. <br>  Besides the fact that his slides contained all the known "faces", he himself was alert and moderately frivolous. <br>  I will give the most masterpiece: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/67f/c65/706/67fc65706e37e3820704ee211a37eedf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/710/e25/528/710e255285551aedcfd2d77827f7c0f7.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/294/6d6/f73/2946d6f73a3093989ce0730d763e87bd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/055/f6d/3fb/055f6d3fbba6a5116e5aa97d710cf4e7.png"><br><br>  Finishing the story about the official part of the first day of the conference, I will <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rostelecom">provide a</a> link to <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rostelecom">the ‚ÄúeFuture‚Äù presentation.</a> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rostelecom"><br></a> <br><br>  Then there was a press dinner, then the press group was taken to ride the UAZ on mountain roads and rivers ( <i>‚ÄúJeeping‚Äù</i> o.O.).  In the end, they again fed and watered deliciously, soared in a bath and dipped into a mountain river. <br>  Finally a few hours of sleep. <br><br>  The next day, a round table was held (in question-answer mode) on which it was not possible to linger, as the time of departure was pressing. <br><br>  At last I‚Äôm at home, caught by the contrast of the scorching Sochi sun, and the cold jets of the air conditioners at the congress hall, I press the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button. <br>  PS <br>  Do not judge strictly, never wrote such reports before. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151552/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151552/</a></p>
