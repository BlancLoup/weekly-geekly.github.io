  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conference "Client Technologies"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On December 15-16, the conference ‚Äú <a href="http://www.clienttech.ru/">RIT: Client Technologies</a> ‚Äù was held at the Avia Plaza conference center in Moscow.  I took part in it, so I decided to share my impressions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The conference is held for the second time in a row.  It looked at technologies that work directly in the user's browser - layout, javascript, flash, AJAX, SilverLight, etc.  The reports were divided into sections: <br><ul><li>  layout, web standards </li><li>  usability </li><li>  performance </li><li>  client programming </li><li>  flash, flex </li></ul><br>  First, the overall impression - I liked it.  This is the second conference in which I participate, and I can say that after such events you come inspired and immediately rush to implement everything new that you have learned.  But the organization of the conference this year leaves much to be desired. <br><br>  On the first day, the reports started very late - they could not adjust the equipment in any way, plus the first speaker did not arrive.  And in general, the speakers often changed places, could not come, were detained in traffic, etc.  In addition, the crisis apparently hit - instead of the declared 500 participants, there were only a hundred or so.  And the most amusing was the lack of internet :).  Therefore, in the reports of the speakers, the phrase was often heard: ‚ÄúWell, since we do not have the Internet, I will not be able to show you an example.‚Äù <br><br>  On the reports: not all of them were informative, they were more of a presentational character.  Yes, I heard about the technology of Silverlight, and I understand that this is cool, but it would be great to see the code of some real application, and not just a beautiful picture.  In addition, I did not understand from the report what this technology is better than Flash.

      In general, as a coder, I was most interested in the layout section and web standards.  Here the reports were really interesting.  Most memorable performances technologist studio Lebedev Sergei Chikuyenok.  He spoke twice - with a report on browser performance depending on the layout and with his new javascript library of vector masks.  The work, of course, Sergey did a tremendous.  With the help of this library, which, by the way, has already been laid out, you can <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ictinus">download</a> and test, you can add all sorts of beautiful corners and frames to the pictures and blocks.  Already have library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/ictinus/wiki/Documentation">documentation</a> .  In addition, Sergei promised in the near future to post on the website of the <a href="http://www.artlebedev.ru/">studio the</a> results of their browser performance tests.  Well, we will wait) <br><br>  Also interesting was the report of Yuri Artyukh ( <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/">cssing.ua.org</a> ) on the layout for the iPhone, <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/iphone.pdf">here is</a> his presentation (pdf, 7.9 MB).  Probably the best thing about the iPhone is that IE is not there :) <br><br>  The biggest excitement caused the report of Peter Didenko from Microsoft on the new browser IE8.  After the speech, the speaker was surrounded by a crowd of people and did not let go during the entire coffee break).  As always, the new browser did not embody the designers' dreams of supporting CSS3, HTML5 and DOM2, although there is still a bit of support for these standards) <br><br>  A lot of speeches were on the topic of usability.  Most of all, I remember the report about registration errors.  Examples showed correct and incorrect registration forms, told how to fix them.  One of the speakers of this section, Dmitry Satin, has already posted a video of his <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui_design_and_usability/47048/">speech</a> on Habr. <br><br>  At one of the coffee breaks in the conference hall held a quiz WebHiTech Lite.  There in the form of a test questions were asked from the field of web-standards.  It was interesting to participate, to quickly find among the wrong answers one correct.  There were three winners, they were given prizes. <br><br>  In general, the conference was interesting, I hope that next year it will also take place and its organization will improve. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47290/</a></p>
