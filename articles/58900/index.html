Namely, about online games.  Pay attention to them for several reasons.  I was working on a large project and brain drain was absolutely necessary for me.  When I use a laptop, sometimes I also want to play, relax, but put on an old packard bell something like NFS or Half Life = hanging and losing everything that is open in the browser, Dreamweaver. <br>  Then I decided to look for something on my own from new online games, went through games such as Teeworlds, Combat Arms, but it was hampered by the fact that they required installation on a PC and rather slowed down the comp.  Games like Ragnarok, I simply don't like the Great Patriotic War, I feel like a vegetable with them, which just sits and purposelessly clicks anywhere.  In fact, it turned out that there are a lot of online games at the moment, there are a lot of browser games that install a client on a PC (their disadvantage is that there is no cross-platform). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Traveling on the Internet in search of a game, I could not help but notice that now developers are really eager to make their games exciting, smart, beautiful. This is extremely pleasing.  For example, last year the company InstantAction pleased with many interesting games and continues to improve them.  But adventure quests are still small and only 1 out of 10 is really fascinating, the percentage of their output is extremely low, and the percentage of garbage (or, according to the people‚Äôs tradition, trash) is high among those games that are still out.  There are very few who are hard to break away from and want to play and play until you pass.  And very few of these games, which cause regret that they have already been passed by you. <br>  And recently I found a game for myself - Estelad or Chosen of Fate, the game is really in the spirit of the genre and works from everywhere.  If someone is also looking for something similar for himself, then this game will suit you (the graphics are of course not GTA 4, but for leisure it is the very thing). <br><br>  The developers of Chosen of Destiny have created not just a game, but a whole world, exciting world.  It combines the realities of the familiar world with the magical world, which will delight with its amazing and exciting features.  Due to a more complex and diverse game, gamers will need much more time to get acquainted with the game world, but this only decorates this game, because the exaggerated games from EA have already proven to be boring.  Chosen by Destiny is a living world that develops with each player, and any action of a character can change this world. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ae/e3f/4d1/2aee3f4d18de2995b32cb55b0381f7c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very important that any person can play the Chosen One of Destiny, since it is completely free, cross-browser and cross-platform and works even on the slowest connection.  The game has a rich infrastructure of the worlds, unusual ways of movement, a unique combat system, ample opportunities for the development of your character and much, much more that you have to learn as the game progresses.

Chosen of Destiny will not get bored because at will you can become a mayor, you can be a thief, you can choose any profession and earn.  The game has resources that you can use to get something for your character.  The most interesting plots and events of the game are entered into the library and stored there for beginners and those who come up with what else to achieve in this game. <br><br>  I advise this game sincerely, you are a designer or a manager, it will entertain you more than once.
