It can be anything from a new type of webmail system to a social network, from instant messaging to electronic debates, from co-writing prose to multi-user virtual reality.  We do not want to limit your imagination;  the fancier the idea, the better.  Remember that the car and the TV at the time were branded as useless eccentricities with no commercial value and no future.

      Winners will receive valuable prizes.  Which - we will not say, but Opera works on all prizes. <br><br>  Opera Software believes in web standards and the future of the Internet, free from proprietary formats and accessible to all.  Therefore, our requirement is to use only the technologies described by current or future web standards.  For example, using SVG is allowed, but Adobe Flash is not.  More specifically, you can use any valid recommendations and working drafts of W3C, IETF and similar organizations, as well as standardization proposals (HTML, CSS, SVG, DOM, MathML for CSS, XML, ECMAScript / Javascript, SMTP, NNTP, IRC, etc.). . P.).  This includes the latest proposals for standardization: DOM File I / O and Widgets.  In addition to the W3C websites <a href="http://www.w3.org/">www.w3.org</a> and IETF <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">www.ietf.org</a> , we recommend web standards articles and useful tips for <a href="http://dev.opera.com/">dev.opera.com</a> developers. <br><br>  Your development should work in at least one of the browsers ever published by Opera Software.  This includes all sorts of alpha, preliminary, and experimental releases.  We offer free download of the following browsers, depending on which one is best for your idea: <br><br>  Opera 9.51 for Windows, UNIX and Mac <a href="http://www.opera.com/download/">www.opera.com/download</a> <br>  Opera Mini 4.1 <a href="http://www.operamini.com/download/">www.operamini.com/download</a> <br>  Opera Mobile 9.5 beta <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/download/">www.opera.com/products/mobile/download</a> <br><br>  However, especially for this competition, we made a special edition of Opera for personal computers with experimental support for some of the latest web standards.  This release is similar to Opera 9.51, but additionally supports the VIDEO element, 3D canvas and DOM file I / O.  Download the edition for Windows, UNIX and Mac, and also read the documentation and find examples here: <a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2008/07/18/">labs.opera.com/news/2008/07/18</a> .  Remember that experimental releases do not guarantee the same level of stability as regular ones.  Nevertheless, we will be happy to see interesting ideas implemented with their help! <br><br>  Remember that the original idea is more important than full capacity or stability.  Even sketches of a very interesting application can be more valuable than a carefully implemented mediocre project. <br><br>  You need to send your work, but it is allowed to use open source libraries.  You are responsible for copyright compliance when using other people's work, such as software code or images. <br><br>  Anyone who arrives at iCamp 2008 can participate in the competition. You can send your work before midnight Moscow time from 1 to 2 August.  Works are accepted only by e-mail.  Opera Software reserves the right to publish submitted work.  Teams are allowed to participate, but the winning team receives only one prize.  If the project requires web hosting, the participant is responsible for the performance of their hosting for the period of iCamp 2008. You can use the hosting on <a href="http://my.opera.com/">my.opera.com</a> and <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/">widgets.opera.com</a> in appropriate cases. <br><br>  We will have regular computers (at least one running Linux and one Mac) and mobile phones with Opera Mini to view the work, but you can use any hardware, including self-made, if you bring it to iCamp 2008 to demonstrate the project. <br><br>  Address for sending work: icamp2008@opera.com <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  PS I'd like to add that, unfortunately, as the participants of the competition, its organizers decided to consider only those who will come to iCamp personally.  I did not take part in the preparation of the competition, so I could not influence the relevant amendments to the rules.  But I can promise that I will try to convince the competition commission to consider as equal candidates for victory and those works whose authors could not come to iCamp personally for various reasons.  In other words, if someone wants to compete for prizes (and, perhaps, for an invitation to work in Opera Software) - send your work on a common basis, and I will apply certain "methods of influence" on the competitive commission;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29535/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29535/</a></p>
