When the number of quotations began to approach 20 thousand, I began to think about creating a portal dedicated to quotations and aphorisms, but it was still far from the beginning of the work, as I was faced with the main problem that I myself would not be able to write the program code of the site.  After a while I began to earn money and began to think about the realization of a dream.  First of all, in my free time, I began to put in order a data table collected over the years of my enthusiasm, then made a design outline, and began to think about what the output should look like.  I studied similar sites, tried to take into account all the minuses and all the advantages and wrote TK from this test. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The next step was the selection of a programmer, I could not imagine that this would be the most difficult!  Before I found a more or less intelligent person who, apart from words, was also able to do business, I had to suffer several months and work with two different people, but it turned out that after I gave the TK, nothing more happened, and for For several months I only heard that ‚Äúeverything will be soon‚Äù.  In the end, after a long search, I was lucky!  And I started a nice job.

      After a couple of months the site was almost ready, it remained to solve several problems associated with optimization and reduction of requests to the database.  Since the site is located on a regular hosting, the speed and power options are severely limited.  We took advantage of indexing the database, pulling the information out of the database with an array, thereby reducing the number of requests to the database and caching all the generated pages. <br><br>  There was a testing phase.  To solve all the mistakes and finish the site, we used the free project <a href="http://www.teamer.ru/" title="web service for organizing team work on projects">Teamer.ru</a> .  There are some inconveniences in working with this service, but at the same time we did not forget to find one error found in this web service and fix it later, which is probably the most important thing. <br><br> <a href="http://textik.ru/" title="text almanac, quotes, aphorisms"><img src="http://textik.ru/imgs/habr/flaer.jpg" alt="flyer, sex, life, love, quotes, aphorisms, sms, toasts, greetings"></a> <br><br>  I also want to thank <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/combax/" class="user_link">combax</a> , which helped me in the design of the site and a separate thanks to him for the flyer.  Many thanks to <a href="http://webo.in/">Webo.in</a> this service helped me deal with some problems related to caching, and indeed the right site.  And, of course, many thanks to programmer Jura for the interest in the project and for the good work. <br><br>  I want to draw particular attention that thanks to the articles on the website about optimizing web sites, a huge amount of work was carried out, which allowed us to reach the first lines on search queries in the shortest possible time.  In the near future <a href="http://textik.ru/" title="quotes, aphorisms, quotes from movies, quotes from cartoons">Textik.ru</a> will be improved, new headings and services will be added.  I hope my little experience and advice on the organization of a web project will help the same newcomers in this business as I do!  I will be glad to criticism, advice and suggestions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53185/</a></p>
