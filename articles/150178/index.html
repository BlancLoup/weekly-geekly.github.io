  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A small text report on SIGGRAPH 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This year SIGGRAPH was held in Los Angeles.  The venue, Convention Center, is slightly different in atmosphere from the city to the best.  Everywhere is clean and tidy, there is a large buffet with different fast food. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The exposition itself opened only on Tuesday, but besides it there were pavilions with representatives of small caliber and indie projects.  Most of the reports were available only to holders of tickets like Full Conference, I had Basic Conference Plus for $ 300.  And the closer the moment of buying a ticket to the date of the conference, the significantly higher the price rises.  After the purchase, they send a PDF invitation, which makes it easier to get a visa. <br><br>  It was very uncomfortable to listen to Russian speakers who did not even try to portray the normal pronunciation.  True, such criticism is valid for many non-English-speaking speakers from different countries.  One even read a piece of paper in such a plaintive voice, as if with a muzzle at his temple. <br><br>  I would like to mention our two figures, who decided to surprise the public Motion Capture with the help of Asus Xtion (analogue of Kinect).  One of them was a representative and the second (Vasily) was a technician.  I started a conversation with one of them, as after 20 seconds an elderly lady approached him and he simply turned away from me and began talking to her.  Apparently wants to have the maximum benefit from a place at the conference.  In general, about half of the indie know-how was implemented using Kinect.  Most of the solutions were presented in a rather raw form.  There were several computers with connected Wacom Intuos 5. None of them had drivers installed, so the pen simply replaced the mouse pointer, making it impossible to use additional degrees of freedom.

      In the same hall, they demonstrated a system similar to the one used to create animations of faces in the game LA Noire.  But here, too, only the process of capturing images was shown, and the calculation of the 3d grid was no longer deepened. <br><br>  Further down the corridor were extensively represented by 3d printers from MakerBot.  After studying the "prints", we can say that after all this inkjet technology is very bad at hanging sites.  For example, on the lower part of the hand of a figure in the pose of the letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù, plastic trickles randomly sag, not having time to dry out.  There was another facility installed by another company, using ordinary office paper as a starting material.  Here the result is more interesting, but how much paper is this necessary to translate for the sake of a small figure.  In the closure of this company, you can record a boom with an afro hayer and its installations for cutting wood, making noise within a radius of 30 meters and having coarse crafts at the exit. <br>  On Tuesday, the main hall opened with exhibitors' stands and a job fair (stands of companies hiring).  I would like to note the appearance of the employees of the companies - most of the American women scored on their appearance, and for a long time.  Oversized shirts, yes jeans.  If they came to the conference in this way, it wouldn‚Äôt really inspire them in their work office, especially in the artistic profession.  The opposite is the girls from the Brazilian company, even now wear a costume and a carnival on them. <br><br>  The brightest stands at Autodesk and Intel.  Moreover, Autodesk made quite interesting reports on its products and Intel stimulated visitors with daily draws of two SSDs and an ultrabook.  In order to take part, it was necessary to go around 4 of the 8 Intel subsidiary booths and listen to the stories, after which they would put the seals in a special ‚Äúpassport‚Äù to throw into the ballot box.  At the Autodesk booth, there were also Intel SSD draws for 460 GB, but they were managed with a common lot of business cards from the urn.  The company Fusion-io announced the presentation with the participation of Danny Trejo (the one that Machete).  By the appointed time, a huge crowd had gathered at their booth wishing to gawk at the militants' star, but instead of him a thick showman emerged, and Danny himself was shown in the form of a video message on the screen.  Nvidia had a rather bright booth, where the speakers also constantly spoke with praising the company's products.  3D printing was also extensively presented in this room, but in the highest price range.  From hardwired participants can be noted a large number of different storage systems. <br><br>  The most positive episode for me was an acquaintance with the Autodesk evangelist in the promotion of the Softimage program, Mark Schoennagel.  I always watched with pleasure his online presentation, and here I managed to have a personal interview. <br>  In general, everything almost met the expectations caused by the stories of Sergey Cyptsin about SIGGRAPH.  In the fall, SIGGRAPH Asia will be held, it will be interesting to compare. <br><br>  <a href="http://photos.siggraph.org/gallery3/index.php/SIGGRAPH-2012-Photos">Some pictures</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150178/</a></p>
