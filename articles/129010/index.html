  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Website creation on MODx CMS - video lesson</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Almost a year ago, in November 2010, I had a desire to make a training video on creating a site on MODx Evolution.  Less than six months, a year has passed and I can gladly show you my creation.  Since the long video is not a Habra format, I made a short teaser called ‚ÄúSite on MODx in 5 minutes‚Äù, but under the cut a full video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9jjTWbqg3o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhucVcHxueu5X5i2R7UW6T4UdNprA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Especially for those who are interested or do not have time to quickly learn information - under the cat a full video ( <i>30 minutes</i> ) on how to install and configure MODx, prepare a template for integration into MODx, integrate and get a ready-made site.  And I explain all this in detail.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here is the complete video, and below is a story about how I did it. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/29422796&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhguwPRviis5UZenjuodjXcvNhdehg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Website creation on MODx Evolution" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>HD version</b> - <a href="http://vimeo.com/29422796">vimeo.com/29422796</a> <br><br>  As I said above, the story of the creation of this video stretched for almost a year.  It all started with the fact that I didn‚Äôt want to moo and mumble into the microphone and decided to record the video and sound separately according to the script. <br><br>  The script was ready in a week, a total of 10 pages.  Then I filmed a video without sound.  Not the name of the experience in such a case - I have long fiddled with the choice of codec and program for recording. <br><br>  In the end, I chose CamStudio 2 for video recording, they downloaded a codec on the site that gave acceptable output files.  I recorded the sound in the spring of 2011 in a studio with a friend, but it turned out that the microphone was quiet and I had to sit closer to it, but I didn‚Äôt have another opportunity to register and had to figure out the first sound editor that came up with, Adobe Soundbooth.  Honestly tried to use Audacity, but it fell several times along with all the changes and I abandoned this idea. <br><br>  Much of the time was spent cleaning aha, sighs and noise in audio.  But then the question came up much more interesting - and what is all this to unite, because my sound was 15 minutes, and the video 40. <br><br>  I failed to understand Adobe Premiere simply by the fact that all my attempts to create a project and add videos there were in vain.  Time after time the devil machine refused to show me my video and then I went back to where I started - Camtasia Studio.  It was because the video recording in it was buggy on my machine, and I didn‚Äôt have the slightest desire to reinstall Windows because of this, I started writing video in CamStudio. <br><br>  The process went slowly, work was constantly piling up on me with laziness and 2 months ago, about 7 minutes of the finished video was ready.  However, volitional effort helped, and in this case, I began to spend 2-3 hours every Saturday for this good deed, and the work went. <br><br>  You can not imagine how I worry, putting this video on public display, because  it was not very easy for me =) <br><br>  Those who read up to here are entitled to a bonus - a <a href="http://a42.ru/site/tutorial-cash">selection of useful links from the video</a> , as well as source codes. <br>  <a href="http://gorbarov.ru/tutorial-cash">Spare page</a> , but it is not enough =) <br><br>  PS: YouTube said it would not show the short video clip to the people of Germany, <a href="http://vimeo.com/29471255">here it is on Vimeo</a> .  And the big video refused to place at all because of its size. <br><br>  PS2: I suggest everyone to make such a video about their CMS.  I mean a short video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129010/</a></p>
