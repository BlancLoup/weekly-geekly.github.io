I am very pleased that the first publication on how we created our hosting was much to our liking.  Thank you for your opinion and comments and taking into account your wishes, we will continue.  In today's material there will be small digressions, and they will serve as answers to some of the questions that I have been asked. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320300/">Previous post</a> <br><br>  Let me remind you that last time we stopped at the acquisition and installation of a diesel generator, hereinafter DGU.  And for the purpose of fire safety, a module of powder fire extinguishing of domestic production was attached to it.  Such modules are widely used in many fields of activity due to their convenient location, as it is mounted on the ceiling, aesthetic appearance, and the ability to start both forced and independent in the operation mode during a fire.  We are to great happiness to apply it failed.  Again, no instructions were attached, we figured it out, but everything is simple enough.  Mounted as a chandelier, triggered by a rise in temperature.  Well, for forced actuation from him there are contacts to which it is necessary to apply a voltage of 12 V. Here is his photo.

So what is ABP?  Automatic Input Reserve is a way of providing back-up power supply to loads connected to the power supply system, which has at least two power supply inputs and is aimed at increasing the reliability of the power supply system.  It consists in automatic connection to the loads of backup power sources in case of loss of the main one.  As always, guided by price. <br><br>  We found an organization in a search engine, it was not a big deal, we chose the first one that came across, now I will explain why.  I wrote to several at once, but I really like it and for me it is important when they quickly respond and call the price.  Therefore, the one who first responded and put everything on the shelves, so we began to work.  AVR we chose a three-phase, 100 Amps for each phase, immediately with a margin for the future, since its price was acceptable -17,000 rubles, plus delivery to our city, about 1,000 rubles.  If you buy with less features, then the money comes out almost the same.  The size of the cabinet is the same, the delivery is the same.  You could install it yourself, but decided to resort to using a familiar electrician and install it. <br><br>  We paid for the installation very inexpensively, I do not remember how much, but symbolically.  He exploited to this day.  The downside is that the organizations involved in the sale of such equipment were not burdened with operating instructions and this certainly brought certain problems, but we learned from our mistakes and independently studied all the issues that arose. <br><br>  AVR analyzes several power supply parameters.  So, for example, when voltage drops above or below the minimum of the ATS, the electricity was turned off, and the monitoring feature of the diesel generator set did not take this into account, so the monitoring was connected to the ATS.  There was also a case when the phase rotation changed. <br><br>  To eliminate such inconveniences, voltage monitoring was installed, the UPS status was monitored, which made it possible to respond manually in case of non-standard problems. <br><br>  Then I will reveal the details in changing the connection scheme when the turn comes.  And a little more about the shortcomings.  This AVR is inconvenient for us, we did not take it into account.  The photo shows that there are no protective pads at the terminals, and since the data center is constantly changing, the number of racks increases, I would like to connect new racks without turning off the electricity.  This was later corrected and this will be further published when we come chronologically to purchase another AVR. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e0/3e3/219/8e03e32194379eea7081010283bd43b8.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Now for more information about the Uninterruptible Power Supply, hereinafter the UPS, the English form of the UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) is a power source, which is necessary for a brief disconnection of the main power supply and protection against voltage surges.  His task is in the continuity of the supply of electricity.  It is turned on in case of emergency power cuts before the emergency power source is put into operation, in our case, the diesel generator set, or to eliminate the shortcomings of the emergency shutdown of the main source.  Our chosen foreign production, which was in use at one of the domestic data centers and from them is also acquired, with a capacity of 18 kW.  The input voltage is 380 V, the distortion of the input current is about 5%, the frequency of the input voltage is 45-65 Hz.  The output voltage is 380 V, the efficiency is 92%, the operating temperature is 0 - 45 ¬∞ C.  Its cost was 120,000 rubles, plus delivery to our city of 5,000 and 5,000 from a transport company in the city.  Its weight is about 400 kg with batteries.  The installation and adjustment was also independently made, as our electrician said that he had not encountered such equipment. <br><br>  At that time, our small data center was located in a business center on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã8 square meters.  m. and it was located in four racks and about forty servers.  Now let us touch upon the question I have been asked on the form of ownership.  It was a limited liability company, a lease, the cost of rent is 5,000 rubles, payment of electricity on the meter, approximately 15,000,000,000 rubles a month.  Accounting services were handwritten and based on their own opinion and refined in the development process.  As for accounting, I don‚Äôt know what to write, accounting itself was.  A license for telematic services was obtained.  This is a very easy to obtain license available to anyone.  There are no pitfalls here.  My story was not very big, I refer to employment and the next publication is almost ready and will be added this week.  See you. <br>  Continued here <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/322192/">habrahabr.ru/post/322192</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321226/</a></p>
