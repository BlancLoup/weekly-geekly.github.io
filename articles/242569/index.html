  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet services: how to find now and what they promise in the near future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month ago, Yandex launched the order service for consumer services Yandex.Master - another one in its already not a small piggy bank.  Users joke: ‚ÄúJanedks.All‚Äù service will be out soon! ‚ÄùAre they far from the truth?  It is easier to say what the Runet giant cannot yet do. <br><br>  So, Yandex.Master.  If someone has not heard yet, this is such a service for finding employees directly.  That is, in Yandex they looked at how many requests for household services people drive in daily and thought that the process of finding a solution to such problems can be accelerated.  No need to look for a company to clean the apartment, assemble furniture or repair a faucet;  you just need to leave the application and everything, and the system will select the master.  Simple, ingenious, with taste. <br><br>  In order for such a service to work properly, you need many, many contractors, preferably already proven ones.  Of course, Yandex didn‚Äôt recruit from scratch, just connected about 70 companies and consumer services aggregators with their own executors bases as partners and sends them the received applications.  In other words, the idea is not new, and at the moment many companies are already doing the same.  And Yandex decided to "streamline" this market - in time to grab a substantial share of it, and if it succeeds, then head the movement in this fairly recent trend.

      Let's look at some of the most notable projects of this type: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b><a href="https://master.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Master</a></b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fab/bb9/ddb/fabbb9ddb67241d39d1a034c0fc1cbcb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Works since September 2014.  Project manager Alexander Korotayev said: ‚ÄúThe lion‚Äôs share of orders in the services market is received not by the best companies, but by those who have more aggressive advertising.‚Äù  It is difficult to say how much in his service it will be possible to choose the best performer.  From the contractors themselves you can see only the name and prices for their work, which they charge for the work.  View reviews on them will not work, the rating either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e7/75a/318/9e775a3180fa47f6b9e7d4c32d942a60.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Benefits </h6><br>  - Yandex's reputation <br>  - the audience is again Yandex <br>  - the largest at the moment the number of performers (from partners) <br><br><h6>  disadvantages </h6><br>  - ‚Äúnot twisted hands‚Äù <br>  - few types of possible tasks (4 in total) <br>  - only partner companies can become performers <br>  - there is no access to information about the artist and the customer <br>  - only in Moscow and St. Petersburg <br><br><h5>  <b><a href="https://youdo.com/">Youdo</a></b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9f/dd8/e72/e9fdd8e722cf478ea357dd00672f070b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Has been working since April 2012.  Long-developing service, now has a fairly large stable audience of customers and more than a thousand artists who have passed a special test.  The most famous of these services in Russia.  It is possible to set tasks in 14 categories, but judging by the requests on the site and reviews, only courier services are in demand.  Well, household too little.  Partner Yandex.Master. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad3/174/937/ad317493756741c88941c58210bd4a28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Benefits </h6><br>  - the most famous <br>  - earnings for all <br>  - accumulated audience of customers <br>  - own large base of performers <br><br><h6>  disadvantages </h6><br>  - only in Moscow and St. Petersburg <br>  - reputation as a service only for couriers and "husbands for an hour" <br><br><h5>  <b><a href="http://profi.ru/">Profi.Ru</a></b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/00f/274/a7900f27499c454f877d7be0ef343ca7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Created by ‚Äúcombining several services under one name, each of which specialized in a specific segment of the service sector: tutors (working since 2005), sports trainers (2007), private doctors (2010), repair technicians (2013), etc.‚Äù off  site.  This is a service where you can find real professionals for your task.  Performers are almost an order of magnitude smaller than YouDo, but there is no place for amateurs here.  So to say, the small party for the intelligentsia and people more or less accomplished, and not affordable simple income for all.  Partner Yandex.Master. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/677/70e/20f67770e9384710ab72f5593bb14ca3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Benefits </h6><br>  - they are professionals <br>  - access to artist profiles <br>  - TV ads <br><br><h6>  disadvantages </h6><br>  - only in Moscow <br>  - small base of performers <br>  - there is no possibility to set tasks that do not require qualification <br>  - it will not work to earn people without a specialty <br><br><h5>  <b><a href="http://phaton.ru/">Phaton</a></b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/f40/299/96bf4029932f4d9facbd7492973d289f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Launched also in the course of the past month, the service from Barnaul is docked "on the go" and claims its place in the market.  Superhero themes, initial accessibility for all regions (they soon promise release in London), the ability to put up any kind of tasks - the guys waved widely.  The scale on which the same Yandex wants to go gradually, they decided to cover at once.  The regions, of course, are more difficult to shake ten times, but one way or another everyone will be there.  So if you take this bar from the very beginning, there is a chance to get ahead forever. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/364/cbf/485/364cbf485c1245ad82fba3115f2d67c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Benefits </h6><br>  - all regions, global idea <br>  - any tasks <br>  - earnings for all <br>  - access to artists and customers profiles <br>  - absolutely free for Russia <br><br><h6>  disadvantages </h6><br>  - the very start of the project, while a small audience <br>  - without the support of monsters like Yandex <br><br>  Rumor has it that Avito will introduce a similar service next summer.  Everybody uses his section ‚ÄúServices‚Äù, although it is terribly inconvenient for performers who spam dozens of advertisements of the same type into the tape and for customers who flip through this spam without being able to understand it properly.  And still use, and still it works.  The need to make a service that will streamline this process is already overdue.  In general, the task is formulated very simply - the one who entices people from this section of Avito to himself has won. <br><br>  The only question is who can, who will be ahead of all: <br><br>  - Yandex.Master can, only he needs a lot of time; <br>  - YouDo slowed down in development, cooperation with Yandex is a good way out for him against the background of a decline in the last six months (again, according to rumors); <br>  - Profi.Ru is too narrow for a global scale; as part of Yandex.Master, it looks organic; <br>  - Phaton is a dark horse.  If you have enough audacity and pressure, if you hold the right advertising campaign, if you can go to Europe ... there are a lot of variables.  But there is a chance; <br>  - Avito.  They will need to try to not succeed.  Only they will start later than others, they may not have time to partition the cake. <br><br>  In any case, in a couple of years one of these services will be as familiar to us as Avito or HH. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242569/</a></p>
