We decided to open our corporate blog on such a respected resource for a number of reasons.  Firstly, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dpayoneer">they often write about us here</a> and such articles always generate discussions in the comments, secondly, the Russian-speaking market is one of the priority areas of our company and we consider it right to communicate directly with our users so that you can learn about all the new services from firstly, thirdly, you will have the opportunity to ask us questions, to which our specialists will try to give qualified and detailed answers, and fourthly, it is very important for us to receive feedback from you about the work of the company and our servers  Isah, and also your wishes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, as usual, we will tell about ourselves: Payoneer has been on the market since 2005, thanks to the correct strategy and demand for our services, we can still boast of good growth dynamics, with each year the company's turnover doubles.  In 2010, we transferred over USD 500 million to cards. <br><br>  What are we doing?  The service is simple: recipients of payments (freelancers in all niches), by the link received from partner company Payoneer, order a refillable MasterCard card from us.  Payoneer produces a card and sends it by mail.  After receiving the card, the payee must activate it on our website, after which the funds transferred by the payer (company partner) to this card can be withdrawn at any MasterCard ATM or used to pay the card in stores or on the Internet.  The card is embossed and issued for a period of three years.  Dollar card.  Access to card statements is available on the Payoneer website.  Payoneer support is available by email.  mail, telephone and online chat in a number of languages, including Russian. <br><br>  Since the launch of the service in the CIS countries, the number of our users has been growing steadily, talents from the CIS countries (freelancers, photographers, webmasters, etc.) have long since discovered the possibility of earning online and hundreds of thousands of Payoneer cards are used in the post-Soviet space to earn money.  This market is a priority for the company, Russian was the first language after English which was spoken by the support service.  Card order pages are also translated into Russian.
