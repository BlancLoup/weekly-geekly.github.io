      Here are the main benefits: <br><br>  <strong>XForms improve usability</strong> . <br>  XForms are designed to allow you to check a lot on the browser side: field types, their obligation to fill out;  that one date should follow another.  This reduces the need for data exchange with the server or for bulk scripting solutions, and also improves usability: the response to the input follows as the fields are filled. <br><br>  <strong>XForms is XML and can pass XML</strong> . <br>  XForms are properly embedded in XML: these are XML, the data collected in the form is also XML, XML documents can be loaded as source data, and the results can be transferred in XML format.  Ultimately, this means that we have an XML transmission channel, right down to the user's desktop. <br><br>  <strong>XForms integrate existing XML technologies</strong> . <br>  Instead of reinventing the wheel, XForms uses many existing XML technologies, such as XPath to access and calculate values, and XML Schema to define data types.  This gives a double advantage: ease of learning for those who already know these technologies, as well as the opportunity for developers to use ready-made components to create systems. <br><br>  <strong>XForms is platform independent</strong> . <br>  The same form can be transmitted <em>without changes</em> to a regular browser, PDA, mobile phone, voice browser, and even some new exotic clients like messaging programs.  This greatly facilitates the transfer of forms to a wide audience, because you have to write one universal code. <br><br>  <strong>XForms makes it easier to create complex forms</strong> . <br>  Since XForms use a declarative approach to defining the properties of values ‚Äã‚Äãand the links between them, it is much easier for the author to create complex and universal forms without resorting to scripting. <br><br>  <strong>XForms are internationalized</strong> . <br>  Since the data is transmitted as XML, they are properly internationalized. <br><br>  <strong>XForms available</strong> . <br>  XForms are designed in such a way that they work equally well with special technologies, for example, for visually impaired users, as well as with ordinary visual browsers. <br><br><h2>  What can I do with XForms, what can't I do with old HTML forms? </h2><br><br>  XForms can do everything HTML can, and something else.  In particular, XForms allow: <br><br><ul><li>  Check data at a time when entered by the user. </li><li>  Denote that the individual fields are required, and without them the form can not be sent. </li><li>  Submit form data as XML. </li><li>  Interact with web services, in particular, using SOAP and XML RPC. </li><li>  Send the same form to different servers (for example, send a request to several search engines). </li><li>  Save form data to a file and restore it from there. </li><li>  Use the result of the submission as input to the following form. </li><li>  Get raw data for a form from an external document. </li><li>  Calculate the sent values ‚Äã‚Äãthrough other values. </li><li>  Restrict values ‚Äã‚Äãin different ways, for example, requiring them to fall within a certain range. </li><li>  Create a "shopping cart" or a master form without using scripting. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  XForms harder than HTML forms? </h2><br><br>  Not.  The XForms recommendation may seem complicated, but it is not a technology tutorial;  it is intended for authors of implementations who require precise details, and therefore contains a lot of details. <br><br>  The same form, written in HTML and XForms, looks about the same.  Once you create forms that are not intended for HTML, XForms becomes much easier.  Thus, XForms contains something that is not in HTML, but this is done to simplify the process of creating forms.  For examples, see ‚Äú <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2003/xforms-for-html-authors.html">XForms for HTML Authors</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  Do I need to wait for new browsers? </h2><br><br>  Not.  There are already several implementations that allow using XForms with existing browsers, both with the attraction of plug-ins and server-side form conversion, and with the help of the built-in functionality. <br><br>  There is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">list of XForms implementations</a> that contains details about many projects;  xml.com has an <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/09/10/xforms.html">editorial overview</a> with snapshots of some implementations. <br><br><h2>  Will XForms work on PDAs and mobile phones? </h2><br><br>  At the time of writing, XForms were shown on PDAs and mobile phones using substitutes, using technologies that are widely used to present network content on small devices.  We expect that native XForms clients will soon appear on mobile devices. <br><br><h2>  What servers are currently working with XForms? </h2><br><br>  Everything!  XForms has several new submission methods compared to HTML forms, but they are all standard HTTP methods for sending data over the network.  XForms can use <code>PUT</code> to put data on a server, can communicate with a SOAP or XML RPC server, but also inherits formats that allow forms to work with all existing servers. <br><br><h2>  What organizations support XForms? </h2><br><br>  The XForms working group, which created the technology, includes representatives from many IT companies, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/xforms-pressrelease">press release</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/xforms-testimonial">reference features of</a> XForms for <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/10/xforms-testimonial">details</a> .  In this case, a <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">large number of implementations</a> .  In fact, XForms is the most widely implemented W3C specification at this stage in its life cycle. <br><br>  Some large user groups are already emerging, including the British initiative with the electronic parliament, the tax service of a particular country, and the insurance industry. <br><br><h2>  Are other companies not working on new form technologies? </h2><br><br>  This is true.  Forms have become the basis of the revolution in network commerce, and they still remain an important issue!  However, many companies that support XForms, believe that the advantage of using technology that is not protected by patents, which is based on common standards and is not tied to one developer.  This means an abundance of user agents for various platforms.  In addition, we believe that, once appreciating the advantages of XForms ‚Äî the creation of one code for different platforms, the interaction with XML, the ability to ‚Äúedit‚Äù external XML documents ‚Äî you no longer want to look at other technologies! <br><br><h2>  Where to get more information? </h2><br><br>  A good source of information is the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms home page</a> . <br><br>  Books are published on XForms, the search query "XForms" in any well-known online store should help. <br><br>  There is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/2003/xforms-for-html-authors.html">introduction to XForms for HTML authors</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31391/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31391/</a></p>
