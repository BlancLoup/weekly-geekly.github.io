Perhaps some thoughts will help some "freshly baked" managers not to step on the old rusty rake.  Those who are not connected with the leadership will help to understand what the work of the manager is.  And, wise guiding experience, I hope, will express in the comments, and share their experiences. <br><br>  This article will not talk about the organization of processes.  Only the subject of the working relationship will be covered here. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think that many will agree with the following answers, and some will add their own to the question: <b>what should a good leader be able to do?</b> <br><ul><li>  Set an employee with a <b>clear and clear goal</b> , aimed at achieving the result. </li><li>  Provide <b>independence</b> in decision making. </li><li>  Since we provide freedom in choosing a solution, it is necessary to shift the <b>responsibility</b> for it. </li><li>  <b>You need to trust</b> your employees. </li><li>  Do not forget to <b>control</b> them </li></ul><br><br><h4>  "Alpha male" </h4><br>  Vasily Bublikov lived there, did not touch anyone, worked for three, ate for four.  He was often set as an example to the rest, his passport photo hung on the honor roll.  Here, it is decided to put him on his head like a snowman ... <br>  When ‚Äúthe best employee of the week / month / year‚Äù is placed in a management position (and this happens often), in most cases, two mistakes are made.  First, they lose a valuable and productive specialist (a kind of "bull-maker").  And secondly, they gain a bad leader. <br>  There are cases when a person immediately understands that it is necessary to retrain as a manager, and this requires a change in many ways, the development of appropriate competencies.  But more often the situation proceeds in other scenarios.  Consider a simple example: <br> <code>             .      .       ...</code> <br> <ol><li>  He can still perform his past duties in order to maintain the high productivity of his department.  In this case, time will be allocated for its employees on the residual basis.  Performing most of their work, and almost without controlling their activities, he will soon lose touch with the ‚Äúpulse‚Äù of his department.  Obviously, the staff will feel extremely comfortable with this.  After all, you see, rarely anyone will come up and say ‚Äúgive me a job!‚Äù </li><li>  Or another bright option.  Vasily, as a mega-guru, starts to ‚Äúmeasure by himself‚Äù (which is extremely unacceptable), as a result he turns into a tyrant, in whose worldview all mediocrity and loafers are.  Subordinates are in a state of constant pressure from such an ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù. </li></ol><br>  Of course, other less bright options are possible, but the trend is that a good employee is not always a good leader.

    <h4>  Delegation </h4><br>  If you remember Bashubov Vasily, and look at the situation through his eyes, what we will see: <br><ol><li>  Responsibility added </li><li>  Work has increased: now we still need to correspond with various people on administrative issues, plan work, delve into the Labor Code of the Russian Federation (vacations, sick-lists, budget, other ...) </li><li>  The level of performance of work must be maintained, no one has canceled the planning. </li><li>  ... </li></ol><br>  It is obvious that alone to our friend Vasily Bublikov cannot cope with this volume of tasks.  Here <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">delegation</a> comes to the rescue.  At first glance, the delegation process seems simple, but such an opinion would be extremely erroneous.  Cases of refusal from the delegation process are not rare, the reasons may be different, both from the position of management and from the position of employees.  But usually the reasons for refusal or resistance are errors in the delegation process.  Let's consider the rules of the delegated order: <br>  To simplify the understanding of the process, back to Bublik.  Let's say our manager Bublikova needs to delegate something to his employee Ivanov.  In order for Ivanov not to resist this assignment internally, and he didn‚Äôt have any negative feelings, Bublik needs to build a conversation in such a way that he can answer some questions that Ivanov has not yet asked. <br><ul><li>  <b>What</b> to do (content) </li><li>  <b>Who</b> should complete the assignment (employee) </li><li>  <b>Why should</b> this employee perform (goal) </li><li>  <b>How</b> should he do this (Details, sometimes this item can be omitted) </li><li>  <b>What means</b> need to do this (means) </li><li>  <b>When</b> should be done (deadline) </li></ul><br><br><h5>  What? </h5><br>  What generally should be done in general? <br>  What parts of the general task must be performed separately? <br>  What result do we expect to get? <br>  What errors and deviations from the result should be taken into account? <br>  What difficulties are possible? <br><br><h5>  Who! </h5><br>  Who is best suited for this assignment? <br>  Is such an employee available? <br>  Is someone else needed to perform? <br><br><h5>  Why? </h5><br>  What is the purpose of the task?  (motivation, goal setting) <br>  Consequences of partial fulfillment or complete non-fulfillment? <br><br><h5>  How? </h5><br>  How should the execution process take place? <br>  What techniques should I use? <br>  What instructions (OSA) must be followed? <br>  Who should be informed? <br>  And the like ... <br><br><h5>  What means? </h5><br>  What tools / technologies should be used? <br>  What documentary support is required? <br><br><h5>  When? </h5><br>  Start / finish time, date? <br>  What are the critical milestones in the implementation, in terms of which it is necessary to meet? <br>  When should I exercise control? <br><br>  Based on these questions, the delegation algorithm will be something like this: <br><ol><li>  The prologue.  Context description </li><li>  Explanation of the essence of the task (what?) </li><li>  Justify the choice of artist (who and why?) </li><li>  Define implementation plan (how?) </li><li>  Identify and provide authority and resources for execution (by what means?) </li><li>  Mark control points (when?) </li><li>  Make sure the subordinate is ready to perform the task (feedback) </li></ol><br><br>  <i>Note: Some items may be abolished or simply deleted from the algorithm, depending on the type of person you are entrusting with.</i>  <i>In a series of articles about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/144837/">Herrmann Dominantz Instrument,</a> I considered some aspects for delegation, adapted to the classification of personality types described by HDI.</i>  <i>I do not strive to give a universal algorithm for delegation, I set myself the goal to give the most complete set of knowledge that in interested hands will be a useful tool.</i> <br><br>  Understanding and management skills come with experience and years, or do not come at all.  If Bublik and the Reader do not want to fall under the second category, then in order to avoid the most frequent errors during delegation, you must remember and <b>always</b> follow the following rules: <br><ol><li>  Do not delegate in a hurry </li><li>  Try to comply with all six points of the algorithm. </li><li>  Always ask for feedback so that Bublikov and Ivanov are convinced that Ivanov correctly understood the task </li><li>  Always support Ivanova, or offer support. </li><li>  Do not forget about the timing and periodic monitoring.  Without discussing the terms you risk getting a result towards a ‚Äúbright future‚Äù. </li><li>  Transferring tasks and responsibility for it, do not forget to transfer and authorities for its implementation. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  Pareto rule, or not everything can be delegated </h5><br>  It would seem that such a delegation, and how it should be delegated, we dismantled.  But I consider it necessary to describe the actions that need or should not be delegated.  And the Pareto rule (it is 80/20) is here despite the fact that there are 80% - which a good manager must delegate, and there are 20% of tasks - which cannot be delegated. <br><br><h6>  Not delegated </h6><br><ul><li>  Strategy and Policy Development </li><li>  Questions of remuneration and rewards </li><li>  Employment and Firing Issues </li><li>  Goal setting </li><li>  Control results </li><li>  Employee Motivation </li><li>  Critical tasks (high risk) </li><li>  Confidential tasks </li></ul><br><br><h6>  Must be delegated </h6><br><ul><li>  Specific tasks </li><li>  Preparatory work </li><li>  Routine tasks </li><li>  Solving small issues </li><li>  Tasks that develop employees </li><li>  Other ... </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Praise </h4><br>  Write about the importance of such undervalued trifles as praise I decided after reading one translation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139783/">article</a> here on Habr√©.  Very pleased with the position of the management in this article, but it is in Zabugorje.  In our country, many managers believe that it is impossible to praise their employees, it either relaxes them or shows the softness of the manager.  Either they praise their subordinates in such a way that it would be better not to do this, and the subordinate, listening to such praise, is happy to fall / evaporate.  The right praise to the <b>right</b> person at the <b>right</b> time with the <b>right</b> words is one of the most effective and cheap motivating factors.  People are different, some people don‚Äôt need your praise for someone, they just need someone (without her, the employee feels undervalued).  The task of the manager is to ‚Äúkeep abreast of‚Äù the team / department, to be aware of internal processes and conflicts, if any.  and, <i>‚Äúget paid, because others score goals‚Äù (c) Casey Stengel</i> <br>  It was the lyrics, let's formalize a little and give a definition.  We have already found that praise can be used as a motivating factor.  With time, bagels will figure out whom they need, and whom they shouldn't praise.  But what should praise contain?  According to the author, praise should be: <br><ul><li>  Sincere </li><li>  Timely ("road spoon for dinner") </li><li>  Laconic </li><li>  Emotional </li><li>  [desirable] person-oriented </li><li>  Should not contain exaggerations </li><li>  Contain specific facts (for which they praise) </li></ul><br><br>  At this point, it‚Äôs necessary to put an end, since the author is not alien to all human and praise as well. <br><br>  All the names and situations described in the text are the fruit of the author‚Äôs violent imagination, all coincidences are random, no animal was harmed when writing the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285490/</a></p>
