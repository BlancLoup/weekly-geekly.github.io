    <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  In paragraphs 1-3 we consider what is directly related to the knowledge and skills needed in the main work. <br></blockquote><br><br><h3>  1. Compose.io - we write articles about databases </h3><br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> Node.js, MongoDB, PostgeSQL, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB, ETCD ... and English. <br><br>  <b>How much can you earn:</b> $ 200-500 per article. <br><br>  Compose became part of IBM and launched a crowd project - whoever writes a good article to their blog gets $ 200.  This money can be taken away.  Another two hundred can be put on the account in their system. <br><br>  Articles by different authors come in batches of 2-5 per week.  Every three months among the readers of the blog, a poll is conducted for the best article.  Its author can count on an additional $ 500. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c38/918/2c5/c389182c502d45c48d73d78c56858ae0.jpg"></div>  <i>No need to choose: a prize or money.</i>  <i>They will give both.</i> <br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> Compose responded to our inquiry that they are already working with several authors from Russia.  Application can be left <a href="https://www.compose.io/write-stuff/">here</a> . <br><br><h3><br>  2. WordCandy and SlickWP - Articles on Wordpress </h3><br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> PHP, HTML, CSS and English. <br><br>  <b>How much can you earn:</b> from 5 to 10 cents per word. <br><br>  WordCandy first pays 6 cents for each word in an article about WP.  If you write constantly and interestingly, you can raise the price to 10 cents per word.  A typical amount of material is up to 1500 words.  Materials appear in large thematic blogs - such as WPMU DEV, for example. <br><br>  SlickWP gives $ 100 for material from 1250-2000 words (5 to 8 cents per word).  Money is transferred to PayPal. <br><br>  One condition - you can not reprint the article anywhere.  Even on your blog.  About this - that all the rights you give them, Slick write directly: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08d/f99/a5c/08df99a5ca404b5696ff3e551901d524.jpg"></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Transfer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>‚ÄúIf the article is accepted:</i> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  You give SlickWP.com <b>all rights</b> as the exclusive publisher of the material.  We can change it as we like. </li><li>  You cannot reprint an article online <b>even on your website</b> . ‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  And further in the text.  In general, a great example of user agreement. </div></div><br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> on the requests, whether they work with the Russians, the guys have not yet responded.  Maybe just inhibited.  But, as they say, there are no such fortresses ... You can leave orders <a href="http://wordcandy.co/hiring/">here</a> (WodrCandy) and <a href="http://slickwp.com/write-for-us">here</a> (SlickWP). <br><br><h3><br>  3. uScript - we write widgets for sites </h3><br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> JavaScript and / or PHP <br><br>  <b>How much can you earn:</b> up to 70% for one sale (now a record of $ 11 per sale). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43f/2f2/26b/43f2f226b74c45248e0307bc6b032b1d.jpg"></div><br><br>  You write a widget for an online store or website on uCoz and upload it to the official store, independently setting the price.  Money - first 50, then 60, then 70 percent - comes from each sale.  Buyers are attracted to the site, money can be taken from the account once a month. <br><br>  Now the most expensive script costs $ 16, its author receives 70% of each sale.  In a month on his scripts are 10-30 buyers. <br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> for example, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/hetpe3b/" class="user_link">HeTpe3B</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/jacksonmihailov/" class="user_link">jacksonmihailov</a> .  In total, 15 developers work with the marketplace.  The names of the active contributors are <a href="http://uscript.pro/dev/ideas">here</a> . <br><br>  *** <br><br><blockquote>  Below are three options that are probably not related to your core competencies.  Rather, it is a monetization of the hobby and an additional source of income.  But we know for sure - techies use them. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  4. Airbnb - rent a house, be as a developer from Pskov </h3><br><br>  <b>How much can you earn:</b> your price for lodgers minus a commission of 3%. <br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> English, rules of service, be able to or learn to communicate.  And you should know when to stop. <br><br>  Of course, this has nothing to do with IT experience - this is about using Airbnb for its intended purpose, that is, for renting an apartment to foreign tourists.  We noticed that programmers, marketers, designers and other great people do it too. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f39/9e2/b61/f399e2b618ae48949f1ce39a3c4a4028.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Found on Google‚Äôs first page for ‚ÄúAirbnb Programmer.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  In two years, <s>anything can happen</s> in Russia, the World Cup will be held.  This is a lot of foreigners in 11 cities (here is a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583_2018">list</a> ).  So, it is possible at the time of the football boom to surrender your housing, and to, for example, roll yourself into the village of programmers. <br><br>  While there is just time to earn a reputation and experience in the service. <br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> programmers and designers who rent out apartments through Airbnb can be found, for example, by comparing their profile on a service with a profile in social networks.  And on TJournal there was a <a href="https://tjournal.ru/p/hostel-senoval">story</a> about a developer from Pskov, who made a whole country hostel. <br><br><h3>  5. Poker rooms - we study a terver before work </h3><br><br>  <b>How much you can earn:</b> winning minus 5-10% of the commission (for the tournament) and minus the share in profit if you take a crowd investment. <br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> ‚ÄúMathematics for the 5th grade + the basics of the theory of probability and combinatorics‚Äù (c) is my friend. <br>  You will also be useful: start-up capital, the ability to distribute attention between the screens and steel nerves. <br><br>  It is better to play in the evenings - especially on Sunday, this is the most ‚Äúfishy‚Äù day ( <i>fish</i> in poker is a slang term for weak players).  To be at a plus on the distance, you need to follow the schedule: to set a minimum of tournaments that need to play for a certain time.  And play.  For them, you need to analyze your statistics and find what to improve.  This is where the mathematical mindset comes in handy. <br><br>  If you show good statistics at a distance and growth, you can start selling shares in your future winnings - this will allow you to play at higher limits, collecting money for a share in the profit on special exchanges.  It sounds like a wonderful world of startups and investors - in fact, this is very similar. <br><br>  As a result, it is even possible to turn a game from a hobby into a main job.  My friend, a former technical support engineer, was able to go this way in a year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/8e6/41e/59b8e641e8414c7c9a3f0815310183b3.png"><br><br>  But we do not recommend writing bots and scripts for the rooms - they calculate, block the account and take the money.  Once on Habr√© even had an article about it. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/uteam/blog/279533/">in the comments</a> suggest that for the very organization of gambling in any form (including on the Internet) outside the gambling zones are fined.  So, we definitely do not recommend opening your casino with blackjack. <br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> write, introduce you to the former technical support engineer who makes $ 1000-3000 clean per month. <br><br><h3>  6. eBay, Etsy, etc.  - we collect and sell (or ‚Äúif your hands itch‚Äù) </h3><br>  <b>How much you can earn:</b> your price minus 3-10% of the sale (other commissions are possible). <br><br>  <b>What you need to know:</b> your hobby, an account with a good reputation (for a start - as a buyer), English, rules of service, how to get PayPal + punctuality, sociability and readiness to fill out papers. <br><br>  We thought to wind sensors for guitars, transformers for amplifiers or what else to do with our hands - this is the time, buyers from Europe and the USA actively take the same pickups from ours, not seeing the difference in price with their local manufacturers.  The average eBay commission on sale will be 10%. <br><br>  The main thing is not to overdo the ad design: for example, for a ‚Äúbold type‚Äù or an extended product gallery, you will be asked for another 2 to 4 bucks. <br><br>  Etsy takes 20 cents for posting ads and 3-5% from each sale.  True, specialized blogs about the site write that the best of all from Russia are panties sold there.  It cannot be understood, it can only be remembered. <br><br>  <b>Who to ask:</b> <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b69/4c8/1ec/b694c81ecd1244d29e41744e36622a48.jpeg"></div><br><br><h3>  And back about serious.  Some more sites for IT freelancers: </h3><br><br>  <a href="http://www.guru.com/">www.guru.com</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">www.upwork.com</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://programmermeetdesigner.com/">programmermeetdesigner.com</a> <br><br>  Plus, another <a href="http://www.makealivingwriting.com/websites-that-pay-writers-2015-79-sites/">77 sites</a> where articles are paid in dollars. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> All your options and experience dollar refineries in the comments are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279533/</a></p>
