Come, we are waiting for you!‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About Will Cable in the internet is not enough written, this post is just a drop in the ocean - my Friday story about money lost by will, disconnection from Ineta and how I butted with them, and perebodal-whether ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Situation: </h4><br>  For me, as for a programmer who works remotely, the Internet at home is as important as air <br>  I woke up early in the morning, and I get up very early: I am starting to work at 6 already, I normally downloaded Frew, entered a pass to access the hardware network key, and successfully authenticated myself in a remote network and dropped it off for 5 minutes from the computer.  How surprised I was when I returned - there was no Internet, well, it‚Äôs not in the first that the Will modems throw users out and they periodically ( <s>I‚Äôm lucky with the modem, it happens very rarely</s> ) to reboot.  Having rebooted the modem and the router, I did not achieve anything, it was still early, I remembered that the Will had never responded before 8 in the morning (caliper).  However, having decided to try my luck, I dialed the support number and was pleasantly surprised (this is +), the cute voice of the girl asked me ‚Äúhow can I help you‚Äù, then an approximate conversation: <br>  - I have lost the Internet, the modem gives the address, the hosts are cutting but the packets do not go.  do not tell me: what is the problem and when will the internet appear very important for me to work <br>  - second, you are disabled for non-payment <br>  - o_O, for what ?!  I pay from client bank regularly and I can provide bills <br>  - you have a minus, your system has disabled <br>  - girl, I can pull out payments from the client bank and provide <br>  - let's <br>  - OK, but I can somehow get an Internet first, at least briefly, otherwise how can I extend them? <br>  - you are turned off, we can not help (something like that) <br>  - damn, ok, what should I do now, why the system turned me off on the 23rd, when a shutdown occurs, by what criterion <br>  - the system turns off automatically at any time <br>  - by what criterion <br>  - so that the system does not disconnect, you need to deposit money to the account before the 1st <br>  - very interesting, I paid at the end of March, the will of the cable lost money, and your system disconnects me on the 23rd from the bay, tell me please! By what criterion does the system turn off in one or another number: 1st, 10th or some other maybe some limit exists? <br>  - the system turns off at any time ( <s>stuck chtoli</s> ) <br>  - I mean, I need to tell fortunes in the coffee grounds to find out when and how your system will turn off if I went to minus? <br>  - the system can turn you off at any time if you have a minus on the deposit ( <s>mda, it became clear that it is useless to communicate</s> ) <br>  - thanks for the "help", in general, you probably need to solve this issue through OZPP (Consumer Protection Department) and your office will be the same as last time to return me a penalty and money <br>  (about 3 years ago, he lived in another apartment and was also Will, "steal" 50 UAH for what I transferred on the 1st from a larger package to a smaller one and they were already stealing after I submitted an application, arguing: but we don't care (almost verbatim), We work this way. As a result, we swear, applications, but for the sake of principle, I‚Äôd get these 50 UAH back) <br><br>  As I wrote above, the Internet is like air for me, so I keep a backup channel on the side of the net. <br>  I connect, I try to log in to the statistics account: oh, yes!  Jboss has a rage and gives out errors, after several attempts within 5 minutes ( <s>you must have learned to monitor, you had to explain that there are such tools as monitoring</s> ) I went into the account: - 202 kopecks from hryvnias <br>  I went to the client bank, pulled out the bills, and called for Will support.  A young man picks up the phone: I introduce myself and explain the situation.  The voice immediately changes to dissatisfied ( <s>we have already managed to make out between each other - what a bad customer</s> ) <br>  - you can help me with something in this situation <br>  - you need to pay a minus <br>  - I have paid for everything, I connected an Internet backup channel and I have bills on hand <br>  - take these bills to the office, you probably did not transfer the money correctly <br>  - o_O, otherwise you cannot help me in any way ( <s>in the 21st century, on the outside, they don‚Äôt know that there is a scanner, email ...</s> ) it‚Äôs very important to me, I cannot work now and have financial losses, who will compensate them and why should i waste my time for your fault?  I transferred the bills as always (I <s>wonder if they ever saw the client-bank in their eyes and did they know about such a concept as a reference book</s> ) <br>  - drive up to the office with the bills ( <s>you would</s> write <s>these phrases and twist them, they do not answer questions persistently</s> ) <br>  - ok, what address to drive to <br>  ... <br><br>  This is pipets, I had to print out the bills, at the same time I went to the bank first - I assured that it was not enough that the Will would still bang into my head, and I had no desire to ride through the Friday traffic jams in Kiev and burn gasoline

      In the office of Will: oh, gloom !!!  queue to connect!  Yes, and what kind of people, but for less money, you can connect the dedicated line at home, almost everywhere (with rare exceptions) with unlimited, but grandparents don't know this (I cannot for other reasons, although I have 4re (!) Dip and 2 gigabit channels are connected to the house, as a result I sit on the most expensive package at Volya) <br>  In general, I made my way to the girl, I must say that she turned out to be an adequate and valuable employee, and quickly helped me by turning on the Internet and retaining the payment, making some comments in the system <br><br><h4>  Salt situation: </h4><br>  - keep your payments to the Will as the apple of the eye, what you paid for and the money reached, does not guarantee you that the Will will not lose them.  In my case, even the client bank is not a guarantee. <br>  - do not rely on the support of the Will, they are unlikely to help in any situation: I had a lot of such situations, got hold of my clients for idiots - ‚Äúrestart the computer, etc.,‚Äù when I call the words ‚Äúcut,‚Äù ‚Äútrail‚Äù, They don‚Äôt even understand how to ‚Äúhop‚Äù and ‚Äúfry‚Äù how their packages run ... <br>  - I spent 3 hours of my working time + gasoline + nerves: I ended up getting an Internet back, but on the account and at this moment the same minus on the balance sheet, is the Will ready to compensate this damage ?!  I'm afraid not" <br><br>  PS I have a thought to submit an application to OZPP, can anyone come across? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91930/</a></p>
