In short: a model with arches (game currency), announced for Russia, to put it mildly, caused a lot of controversy.  The Russian community drafted a petition asking them to use another monetization model in the Russian version. <br><br>  Today, I finally can tell you how it was and the current state of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69f/01f/208/69f01f20803b5574b283c96172376899.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The model was developed by XLGAMES specifically for foreign markets.  Russia was supposed to be the first country to test it.

      In June, we received a description of the model with arches, which was supposed to be ready by the fall of this year.  During the development process, significant changes were made to it, and the more or less final concept was ready in early September.  At this point, we talked about the model being launched in order to collect feedback from the clans that played on the Korean servers. <br><br>  The model has caused a lot of controversy.  The players pointed to the things that caused us to fear.  The community response was much sharper than we expected.  Here the effect of a large number of people enrolled in the PTA (at that time about 300,000 people) worked.  No new project on the Russian market has yet gathered such an audience before launch. <br><br>  We faced the following choice: <br><ol><li>  modify the model with arches </li><li>  launch korean model </li><li>  run both models (arches and korean) </li></ol><br><br>  The third option was dropped quickly enough, as it required the support of two versions from both sides, especially the efforts of our partners. <br><br>  The first option was clear, but we did not like it.  He was not well received by the community, and he remained very risky.  The variant required numerous iterations and long-term testing on our and Korean side. <br><br>  The second option was less risky, but in October 2013, our brunches were very different.  It was impossible to take the Russian localization and quickly transfer it to the Korean model, since the main developer resources required for this were busy working on updating the Korean version. <br><br>  Nevertheless, we tended to the second option.  According to initial estimates, such a transition should take about 6 months. <br><br>  We began to deal with server configurations and found an undocumented setting that allowed us to switch the model to Korean (except for some of the interfaces).  As it turned out, all this time, an unknown Korean programmer supported the compatibility of the Korean model and the system of arches in the brunch for our territory.  The prudence of this unnamed hero (we still think of how to thank him adequately) saved a lot of time. <br><br>  When we told our partners about this, they were surprised, and after checking the estimate of the timing of the transition to the Korean model was significantly adjusted downwards. <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  ArcheAge in Russia will be launched with an economic model that is used on Korean servers.  Now our partners are working on a version for our territory.  The main task is to remove the ‚Äútails‚Äù from the arches in the interfaces and make sure that everything works. <br><br>  Localization of the client for the closed beta test is ready, and we hope that even with the preparation of a large-scale update for Korean servers, we will be able to get a version for the PTA before the end of the year. <br><br>  Starting PTA is scheduled for the end of December. <br><br>  PS: What should I donate to a Korean programmer for an unplanned ‚Äúswitch‚Äù between versions?  We accept offers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203096/</a></p>
