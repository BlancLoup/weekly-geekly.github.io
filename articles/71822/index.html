  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WebHiTech: save the plight of the most important nomination! :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Colleagues!  Until the deadline for accepting applications for the technology-oriented competition of <a href="http://www.webhitech.ru/">WebHiTech-2009</a> sites, aimed at supporting the dissemination of modern web standards in RuNet, just over three weeks remain.  Let me remind you that WebHiTech is being held for the second time with the kind assistance of <a href="http://www.nic.ru/">RU-CENTER</a> .  And, I hope, will continue to be held annually. <br><br>  Not to say that applications would be received a little - we came close to the milestone of 120 put forward projects, which for the month with a tail, left behind, is not bad at all.  Another thing is surprising: this year our main, ‚Äútechnical‚Äù nomination is much less popular than two parallel ‚Äúhumanitarian‚Äù nominations.  The distribution of participants in the nominations at the moment is as follows: <br><ul><li>  "The best design solution" - 27 projects; </li><li>  "The best consumer qualities" - 20 nominees; </li><li>  "The best use of technology" - only 12 (!) Sites! </li></ul>  <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/nominees/">Last year, the</a> situation was the opposite.  For primers, the final distribution was: 46/40/55. <br><br>  By the way, with the current scenario, each of the technological nomination participants, for obvious reasons, has <em>about twice as much chances of</em> reaching the final and winning the competition than any of the participants of two neighboring nominations.  Therefore, choosing which nomination to nominate your projects, think well!  :) Where are you, the gurus of Internet technology?  Where are your great sites, created using HTML 5 and CSS3, or maybe created using XML and XSLT on the client side? .. (Ok, don't be afraid, XHTML 1.0 Strict is also very nice to us :).) Would you like introduce us and, at the same time, the general public with these projects?  <nobr>Awww!</nobr>

      Until October 30 inclusive, we will look forward <a href="http://www.webhitech.ru/nomination/">to your applications</a> .  Well, and under Habrakat - some details about the progress of the nomination and about various joint events with WebHiTech for those interested. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Well, let's start with the joint activities. <br><br>  Firstly, there is a non-zero probability that this year the WebHiTech award ceremony will take place in an expanded format, namely, together with the meeting of the participants of the <a href="http://web-standards.ru/">Russian wing of the</a> WSG ( <a href="http://webstandardsgroup.org/">Web Standards Group</a> ).  The format of the meeting, possibly co-organized by <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera Software,</a> is a kind of mini-conference lasting <nobr>2-3 hours,</nobr> in which several presentations will be made on various aspects of web development in the spirit of modern web standards.  In the evening, at the end of this mini-conference, the solemn ceremony of awarding the finalists and winners of the competition with a buffet table, easy communication and other amenities will begin directly.  All this magnificence will occur in the second half of November in Moscow - but the exact date and venue will become known later. <br><br>  Secondly, there is a <em>preliminary</em> agreement that, in parallel with the WebHiTech contest, another contest will be held - usability testing of sites announced for WebHiTech by the participants of <a href="http://userexp.ru/">UserExperience-2009</a> conference sponsored by <a href="http://www.loop11.com/">Loop11</a> .  Awarding of the winners of this second contest is planned to be held at the UserExperience conference.  Due to the fact that UserExperience will be held a little before the end of accepting applications for WebHiTech, only those projects whose authors <a href="http://www.webhitech.ru/nomination/">will</a> hurry up and <a href="http://www.webhitech.ru/nomination/">submit an application</a> for participation in the WebHiTech contest approximately before October 15 will be able to participate in usability testing.  Whether the usability testing of all projects announced for WebHiTech or only the nominees selected by the organizing committee will be affected is not yet defined.  Preferably to the first option.  But to be a nominee, of course, in any case more pleasant.  :) <br><br>  <nobr>Thirdly,</nobr> at the <a href="http://2009.russianinternetweek.ru/">RIW-2009</a> and <a href="http://userexp.ru/">UserExperience-2009</a> conferences, WebHiTech Lite mini-contests will be held with a high probability.  About what it is, tell, for example, these last year's photo stories: <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/press/8/">1</a> , <a href="http://2008.webhitech.ru/press/2/">2</a> . <br><br>  We proceed smoothly to some interesting details from the daily life of the competition. <br><br>  Let me remind you that this year we decided to radically reduce the duration of the nomination stage - from six months to two months, having sacrificed mainly the completely dead summer months.  Miracles in the world does not happen, and the total number of applications, I suspect, this year will be slightly less than in the past, but we, in fact, are firmly focused on overcoming the milestone of 200 nominated projects.  Last year we received a total of 286 applications. <br><br>  Like last year, about 50% of applications are pre-selected.  (Last year's figure - 141 nominees were selected out of 286 announced projects; the current figure of this year - out of 115 declared sites, 59 projects were allowed to take part in the competition, another 4 applications had not yet reached the scheduled discussion time.) by some non-essential fluctuations, this is such a world fundamental constant.  :) <br><br>  Well, the last.  In 2009, WebHiTech unexpectedly got a new, high mission - countering plagiarism in Runet.  The story, in brief, is as follows.  A project was announced for the competition, the design concept of which was, let's say, borrowed from another site, the creator of which, ironically, is also part-time author of several applications for WebHiTech (yeah, the world is cramped!).  Initially, it was decided to remove the project-clone from a distance, but ultimately a fairly deep redesign was carried out on this site, as a result of which the obvious similarity between the two projects was lost.  It seemed to us that the metamorphosis that had happened (as a result of which the desire to participate in the WebHiTech competition from the authors of the clone project outweighed the desire to ‚Äúlick‚Äù the design concept from their more independent creative colleagues) much more constructive than any penalties.  Evil, after all, has never led to good, even if this evil is directed in response to another evil ... It is much more pleasant for us to realize that, thanks to our competition, the plagiarists set foot on the path of correction.  I will not name specific names here - the selection committee of the competition convinced me that this is unnecessary.  In any case, people should be given a chance at correcting mistakes, unless, of course, these mistakes are made openly maliciously and systematically. <br><br>  On this vital note, and finish, perhaps.  I repeat for those who were able to finish reading this opus to the end, but have already forgotten what it was about at the beginning: we are <a href="http://www.webhitech.ru/nomination/">waiting for your applications</a> , especially in the nomination ‚ÄúThe best use of technology‚Äù! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71822/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71822/</a></p>
