Main claim <br>  The most distinct critics have been that Arc looks <br>  unfinished.  A couple of thousand lines of macros is all I did for <br>  few years of work?  Why I did not do applied tasks? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While I was thinking about these comments, it suddenly dawned on me <br>  how familiar were such reviews.

    <br>  When we launched Viaweb, it only caused grins from venture capitalists. <br>  capitalists and other "experts" in e-commerce.  There were only two of us and <br>  we worked in a regular apartment, in 1995 it didn't look so cool <br>  like now.  The project that we created, in their opinion, was not even considered <br>  software.  They understood software as <br>  large, monolithic program under Windows, and Viaweb - <br>  The first web application they ever saw looked like a regular website. <br>  Their attitude towards us became dismissive when <br>  they found out that Viaweb is not processing credit transactions <br>  cards (we didn't actually do it in the first year <br>  existence of the project).  Processing credit card transactions for them was <br>  the cornerstone of e-commerce.  Credit card transaction processing <br>  - it sounded serious and impressive. <br><br>  However, oddly enough, Viaweb defeated all competitors. <br><br>  When we launched Y Combinator, the reaction was almost identical.  Project <br>  seemed frivolous.  Then venture investment meant millions <br>  dollars invested in a small number of startups based on people <br>  who have proven their worth after months of serious <br>  business negotiations;  under the conditions described in the document thickness of <br>  thirty centimeters.  Y Combinator seemed insignificant.  Of course, <br>  it is too early to say whether Y Combinator will repeat Viaweb‚Äôs success, but judging by <br>  the number of attempts to clone our idea, many believe that we <br>  groped something interesting. <br>  I have no other indicator of success of my articles except <br>  number of views, but the reaction to them has changed from that <br>  when i was just starting out.  Then the reaction of the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">trolls</a> on Slashdot.org, if <br>  translate into human language, was about the following: "Who is this guy such <br>  to cover this topic?  Such a short article written by such <br>  in ordinary language can not say anything useful in a certain area, in <br>  while people with advanced degrees are writing thick books on this <br>  topic. "Now a new generation of trolls lives on <br>  new sites, they no longer ask "Who is this guy? .." <br><br>  People say about Arc the same as they said at first about <br>  Viaweb, Y Combinator and about my articles.  Why such a similarity?  Like me <br>  understood, the answer is that I have the same ‚Äúhandwriting‚Äù in <br>  all four projects. <br><br>  The essence of my method: I like to find (a) simple solutions (b) to no one <br>  noticed problems (c) that really need to be solved (d) <br>  providing solutions in as free a style as possible (e) starting with raw <br>  version 1 (e) and constantly improving it. <br><br>  When I first formulated these principles, it turned out to be practical. <br>  recipe for generating a negative reaction.  Although simple <br>  solutions are always better; they are not as impressive as complex ones.  People <br>  by definition, they consider non-essential problems <br>  notice  Providing a solution in a simple form implies that <br>  a person will have to break his head to understand it, and not <br>  just experience the thrill of the dazzling view of the complex <br>  solutions.  Starting with raw version 1 implies that everything <br>  initial efforts will be minor and incomplete. <br><br>  I, of course, noticed that people can not grab a new idea from the first <br>  times.  I thought that the reason for this in most cases is <br>  dumb mind, but now I understand that everything is not so simple.  As well as <br>  counter-investor <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22646/"><sup>[3]</sup></a> , everyone who follows the principles mentioned is doomed <br>  do what the average person seems wrong. <br><br>  This is the essence, as well as the counter-investor strategy.  Such <br>  strategy gives all the benefits that other people miss, <br>  trying to look impressive.  If you work on undetected <br>  problems, then the likelihood of finding some new things is much <br>  higher, because there are few competitors here.  If you provide solutions in <br>  free style, then you (and) do not spend the effort to make them look <br>  impressively (b) avoid the danger of deceiving yourself and your <br>  users.  The advantage of the ‚Äústart with raw version 1 and then <br>  improve it "is that the improvement solutions from the version <br>  the version will come from the outside, and quite unexpectedly. <br><br><br>  In the case of Viaweb, the simple solution was to keep the software <br>  software running on the server.  An unnoticed problem was <br>  automatic website generation: in 1995 all online stores were <br>  designed by hand, designers, but we understood that this approach is not <br>  give in to scaling.  The most significant part of the project was <br>  not at all processing credit card transactions, but generating a graphic <br>  design.  The mechanism for providing free-form solutions was me, <br>  who came to meet with potential customers in jeans and <br>  t-shirt.  And the raw version 1 was, as I recall, was less than <br>  10,000 lines of code, at the same time we launched the project. <br><br>  The use of such a strategy goes beyond programming, startups and <br>  writings of articles.  Perhaps this technique can be used for any <br>  creative activity.  And absolutely exactly that it can be applied. <br>  in painting: just this was done by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD,%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Cezanne</a> and <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5,%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C">Klee</a> . <br><br>  In Y Combinator, we rely on this technique, in the sense that we <br>  We encourage our startups to work in this style.  Under your nose <br>  There are always some new ideas, so always look out for simple <br>  things that are not noticed by anyone - later they will seem to everyone <br>  obvious.  Pay particular attention to the problems that <br>  got lost because of a general delusion, or because of trying to do something that only seems <br>  impressive.  Always look for the root of the problem before taking up <br>  decision.  And do not try to look corporate, the main thing is <br>  the product is what wins in perspective.  Also, run <br>  project as soon as possible, in this way users will let you know <br>  that it was necessary to create in reality. <br><br>  A classic example of this approach is Reddit <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22646/"><sup>[4]</sup></a> .  When Reddit was launched, <br>  it seemed that this project does not make sense.  Not loaded with graphics <br>  minimalistic design that did not even draw on the design.  But reddit <br>  Solved a pressing problem: show what's new.  As a result, the project became <br>  massive.  Now that Reddit already exists in people's minds, it seems that <br>  This idea was obvious.  People see reddit and think that it <br>  the founders were just lucky, but like other things like that, it‚Äôs just <br>  seems like luck.  Reddit's so hard rowed against <br>  the currents that the current has unfolded and now he himself carries them through the water. <br><br>  So when you see something like Reddit and think, ‚ÄúI would like to <br>  come up with something like that ‚Äù- remember: such ideas are around you.  But you <br>  ignore them simply because they seem wrong. <br><br><hr> <font><sup><b>[1]</b></sup> New Lisp dialect created by Paul Graham: <a href="http://arclanguage.org/">arclanguage.org</a></font> <font><br></font>  <font><sup><b>[2]</b></sup> A web application with which you can create your online store in a few minutes in a browser window.</font>  <font>Written in Lisp.</font>  <font>Later was sold to Yahoo, is now <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce/">here</a> .</font> <font><br></font>  <font><sup><b>[3]</b></sup> An investor who invests money contrary to general trends in the market.</font>  <font>In the original - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrarian">Contrarian investment</a> .</font> <font><br></font>  <font><sup><b>[4]</b></sup> News site;</font>  <font>rating of a news is determined by the users themselves, by voting.</font>  <font>( <a href="http://reddit.com/">link</a> )</font> <font><br></font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22646/</a></p>
