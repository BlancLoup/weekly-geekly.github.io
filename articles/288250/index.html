  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Regional Internet media: Part 2. What should be ready</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I continue to write about the features of the creation and work of the regional media.  I decided to clarify some more questions before going to the essence of media work, so the second part is called ‚ÄúWhat should be ready for.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Politics </h4><br>  As soon as you have a little significant audience, for sure there will be people who will offer you cooperation.  It is likely that you just want to use.  Regional political life is quite an interesting thing, and a significant part of politicians are not very convinced people.  They rush from the right to the left, from the opposition to the party of power, and so on.  <i>Personally, I do not see any fundamental difference between signs at the regional level.</i>  <i>"Orbit and Stimorol."</i> <br><br>  Whether to work with politicians and if you work, then how and with which is your personal choice.  But cooperation can also be completely different - from the publication of press releases, to becoming the mouthpiece of the fight against political opponents. <br><br>  We are open to dialogue when it comes to honest advertising.  As a result, we, at one time, were offered an interesting form of cooperation from the point of view of site development, which continues to this day - the competition of amateur journalism.  Due to this, people got an extra opportunity and incentive to speak out (including on topics unpleasant to the authorities).

    <h4>  Custom articles </h4><br>  Thousands of them.  For some, do not even offer money.  My advice to you is to not get involved.  If you were sent some kind of ‚Äúdisclosure‚Äù and it hooked you - clarify the situation and believe the facts before clicking ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù.  Believe me, some people's fantasy is phenomenal.  You won‚Äôt make much money on it, and you will ruin your reputation.  And you can get a lawsuit for defamation, which is likely to be completely in the case.  Almost all such articles are supported by one or another political force that wants to make a ‚Äúthrow‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  The temptation to use the media for personal use </h4><br>  This, of course, is not about advertising their projects.  Several times I had a strong desire to express my dissatisfaction with certain companies.  This temptation must be able to overcome, because  these personal complaints look rather pitiful and, unfortunately, often a person does not quite soberly assess the events of which he is a participant.  Personal experiences - personal blog. <br><br><h4>  Conflicts with readers </h4><br>  If you have comments on your site, situations will inevitably arise that require your intervention.  The only correct policy, it seems to me, is to follow the rules yourself.  Even if you do not like any comment, but there is no formal violation of the rules, it is better not to delete it.  If you don‚Äôt look at two people, 15% of whose comments are stably deleted, then in general, despite our apparent commitment, we have a freedom of speech reserve.  Comments, it seems to me, somewhat change the task of the media.  If in the print media, the media expresses their position, and the reader ponders it, then in the Internet newspaper it is enough just to announce the informational reason and not to stop the readers from discussing it, sharing alternative information. <br><br>  We have a prohibitively low number of bans, even though we do not hinder the re-registration and further communication of users.  In fact, we ban only for the obvious insults in our address.  This is an ideological moment, there were no more than five such cases in three years.  In general, bans, if only the registration on the site is not by invitation, is a rather stupid exercise and carries a symbolic character - a ‚Äúred card‚Äù, after which the player still does not interfere with giving the judge his teeth. <br><br><h4>  Conflicts with the "heroes" of news </h4><br>  Oddly enough, but mostly the claims of the ‚Äúheroes‚Äù are justified from the point of view of the law.  Somehow, several men "sawed" many millions on defense orders.  There was a trial.  Found guilty.  Gave real deadlines.  We wrote about it, and after a while a letter from a lawyer comes that he urges to publish a refutation of the fact that "Ivanov" <i>stole</i> money.  Indeed, the court found him guilty of not stealing.  We published a refutation, not forgetting once again to give a link to the controversial article itself.  People understand everything.  Having opened the media (even if it is not registered), words and phrases will have to be followed. <br><br><h4>  Certain fame </h4><br>  If your project goes uphill, then people will inevitably discuss it.  And maybe not only him, but you personally.  By this you just need to be mentally prepared.  Your media will most likely be read by relatives, friends, and acquaintances.  Be prepared for the fact that one of them asks for something to change, remove, correct, publish.  One must be able to refuse, although this is not pleasant. <br><br><h4>  Disputes between founders </h4><br>  If you are the sole leader, then you are not interested. <br><br>  We opened the site together.  Despite our friendly relations, our views are different.  On the one hand it interferes.  On the other hand, it helps not to make rash actions.  If you decide not to do media alone, then make sure that your partners are able to compromise and you can argue with them (and with you). <br><br><h4>  Illegal use of content </h4><br>  We use the license <a href="http://lenta.ru/info/licence.htm">tape</a> (BMF, etc.).  At least, this increases the chance that they will copy, but at least put the link.  In general, this is dictated by convictions. <br><br>  It's a shame when a competitor takes your photo, cuts off copyright, puts his own and publishes it, but such is life.  You can sue if you wish, wrote in detail about this zyalt, we have no such experience. <br><br>  Several times we have identified the brazen mass copy-paste of our articles, but none of these copy-pasters have achieved anything.  So I wouldn't waste my nerves on such people. <br><br>  Here are the main controversial and unpleasant moments with which we encountered and for which you need to be prepared.  Maybe colleagues will indicate something else from what we have not encountered. <br><br>  Published parts: <br>  Part 1. <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/120705/">Where to start</a> <br><br>  The approximate content of the following parts: <br>  Part 3. Filling the site with news.  Where to get, how to write, about what to tell. <br>  Part 4. Sale of advertising.  Banners, articles, prices, possible customers. <br>  Part 5. Promotion of the Internet newspaper.  Getting started, development. <br>  Part 6. What can be attached to the Internet newspaper.  Add-ons, etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288250/</a></p>
