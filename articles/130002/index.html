I saw him even more at the corner of my eye.  But how is it created? <br><br>  It all starts with an idea.  It happens that brainstorming is arranged, where only one is selected from the whole heap, but the best.  It happens, decides all the leadership.  But one way or another, this is the first and most boring stage.  After choosing an idea, the composition of the team that will implement it is decided, sponsors are sought.  Anime is actually quite an expensive thing - the cost of showing 52 episodes late at night on 5-7 television channels is close to 50 million yen (about 21 million rubles), and the display of the anime Fullmetal Alchemist at 6 pm cost 10 times more! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The following pair of steps are optional if the anime is drawn in a comic-manga.  Such anime in general, the majority, and it is quite justified.  By the fact that the manga was successful or not, you can find out in advance whether the anime will be successful, and just save some penny.  For the sake of fairness it should be noted that it happens and vice versa - manga is drawn on the anime.  For example, this was the case with <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLCL">FLCL</a> . <br><br>  The second stage is the invention of a common concept - who, how, what, and why.  Characters are invented, the main storyline, some first sketches are made.  As soon as this is all ready, the writers and artists begin their work.  A detailed script is written, characters and backgrounds are drawn, and then an approximate storyboard is made.

      Everything is usually drawn in the old fashioned way, with pencil on paper.  Characters are drawn in different angles and moods, in different clothes and with different objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/81c/221/efb81c221bb2d8121a58d1080054258d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/cd3/b37/343cd3b374f07f880b25c3f8f442eec1.jpg"><br><br>  Translation of these sketches into digital form can be done in two ways.  Or pencil sketches are covered with mascara or hard pencil for greater contrast, and then scanned: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7d/c39/c0e/a7dc39c0e832c9ab47189febe47655b7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11e/71e/ed0/11e71eed09bebe018d2235177510def6.jpg"><br><br>  Or, first scanned, and then add contrast to the tablet.  It turns out in general the same thing. <br>  After the characters are ready, the outline of the entire storyline is drawn.  This is also done in pencil on paper, with comments, at intervals of a second. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4b/f92/0ac/d4bf920acbf3d1bbf5c851f862a7e96f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/424/b7c/fad/424b7cfad55b6c54f457435f5fd9dd66.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/589/a4f/a72/589a4fa72bfb3c8b5af8e5ccbdc1ed94.jpg"><br><br>  Separately from all this, the background is drawn.  In this case, it often happens that he is drawn not from scratch, but from some photographs.  So do not be surprised if you see familiar places during a walk in Japan. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/d82/5a9/6bbd825a9ed744271469a8a03cc2db52.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/175/aad/3ba/175aad3ba628a96f720305b2de246d1c.jpg"></td></tr><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/449/03f/b71/44903fb71dd6d10c13c76b1406138f29.jpg"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/729/325/466/72932546661e7e7eb324f930f627a20b.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  However, the background can be drawn later, in the process, especially if it is distant and you do not need to draw shadows from the animation in detail. <br><br>  Finally go to the next part, finally connected with the computer.  This is where the biggest and hardest work begins - animation, coloring and layout.  First, the artists draw several frames of character animation, between the ready-made sketches of the storyline frames.  For television animes, usually 12 frames per second are drawn, but sometimes 24 or 8. This is done in the same way as before - the outlines are drawn on paper and converted to digital form.  This is really a hell of a work - imagine how much you need to draw for the 25-minute series! <br><br>  Then, other people (although maybe the same ones) smooth this animation so that everything looks natural and without jerks.  And finally, the third color this animation.  Besides all this, there are also effect artists.  They add all sorts of sparkles, stars and more.  As a result, after adding the background, an almost finished anime segment is obtained. <br><br>  The whole process is followed by the art director (animation director), who checks the frames, makes edits, and sometimes redraws something entirely with his own hands.  Therefore, this post is usually appointed one of the artists-animators, with great experience. <br><br>  It should be noted that recently the life of animators greatly facilitated the three-dimensional graphics.  For example, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">Makoto Shinkai</a> actively and very fruitfully uses it in his works.  But still, most of the anime is still drawn by hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faa/874/855/faa8748554dea1300fcf85b4bf9322fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/803/adb/3b2/803adb3b2f4cda716fcf796d463f1ce8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39a/237/dbe/39a237dbe3a496619313b56be8cada68.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1e/ff3/023/e1eff3023029d8f86d46a87bd610f064.gif"><br><br>  Then comes the turn of sound.  Actors-seyuu speak their cues and sing songs.  From the outside it can look very funny.  The majority of voices of anime boys are actually female - men have a lower voice and do not look like children‚Äôs, and for some reason nobody takes children for voice acting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/879/f3d/ab0/879f3dab08fe64abb8372b15d17dce05.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojg1FZBgly4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhglkbpuy9sRgNgvcZf0DqbMYpjFRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Voices are processed, additional sounds are superimposed ‚Äî rustling of leaves, walking, etc. Finally, background music is added, and anime production enters its final stage ‚Äî the show. <br><br>  How to get money from anime?  Advertising and selling attributes.  In the middle of the series on television put an ad unit.  Sometimes right in the anime draw the names of the sponsoring companies or their products (for example, all the characters use the phones of the same company).  Anime is published on DVD.  Produced numerous posters, figures and more.  Well, we just watch it. <br><br>  Sources: <br>  <a href="http://washiblog.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/anime-production-detailed-guide-to-how-anime-is-made-and-the-talent-behind-it/">Anime Production - Behind it!</a> <br>  <a href="http://ghostlightning.wordpress.com/2009/03/10/steps-in-anime-production/">Steps in anime production</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.dannychoo.com/post/en/25927/How%2BAnime%2Bis%2BMade.html">How Anime is Made</a> <br><br>  I apologize for any errors and inaccuracies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130002/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130002/</a></p>
