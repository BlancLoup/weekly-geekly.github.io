Update on Build 10536</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Another batch in Fast Ring for mobile Windows insiders has been released - 10536. Details under the cat. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99c/a10/08d/99ca1008de8b4c84944e11980655d476.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A small background to the emergence of a new build</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Insiders waited almost a month for a new build and managed to get Gabe on Twitter. <br>  Last Thursday a vote was taken - the result of which was to be the release of build 10536.1003 last Friday. <br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="641988501353967617"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  The essence of the vote was that Gabe was interested in insiders, whether to release a new assembly today or wait for the bug fix with the Store until next week.  Voting result: <a href="https://strw.pl/375839b3/results">strw.pl/375839b3/results</a> <br>  As a result, this assembly should have been accompanied by a bug, which in about 28.8% of cases, led to the crash of the Store when trying to buy an app or make an in-game purchase, as a temporary solution offered to buy apps from a PC or the web version of the Store.  But something went wrong, and on Friday, Gabe announced that the new build is being transferred to the next week due to the inability to upgrade from 10536.1003 to future builds. <br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="642356868975828992"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br>  The update was withdrawn at the last moment and according to Gabe - about 200 people managed to install it, if you are one of them, you will have to roll back to Windows Phone 8.1 to install the new build. <br>  Immediately after the weekend, an internal testing of build 10536.1004 was announced, in which bugs were fixed with the store and updated to the next builds, this build was made available to insiders that night. <br></div></div><br><h4>  First about the pleasant.  Innovations and fixes: </h4><br><ul><li>  On Twitter, Gabe reported that there are many improvements to the Edge in this build. </li><li>  Insider Hub - again present in the assembly. </li><li>  The mobile access point has been restored. </li><li>  Voice input has been updated to add speech recognition support for Japanese and English (India) languages. </li><li>  Corrected the update - now you can upgrade to 10536 directly from 8.1, bypassing build 10166. </li><li>  Fixed two-factor authentication when adding a Microsoft account on the phone. </li><li>  Fixed idle Quiet hours. </li><li>  The main screen is now loaded faster, without the eternal "Loading ..". </li><li>  The clock on the lock screen now appears without delay. </li><li>  Scaling maps fixed, now should work as intended. </li><li>  Updated Photos app - folders are now shown, running faster, higher and stronger, as usual with Microsoft. </li><li>  Single hand mode - now on all devices (Press and hold the Windows button so that the screen slides down halfway and you can reach the top elements on the screen).  Previously it was only available on devices with a screen of 5 ". </li><li>  Announced with the insider build 10527 for PC Feedback application Windows is now available in the mobile assembly. </li></ul><br><h4>  Known issues in build 10536: </h4><br><ul><li>  After restarting the smartphone, you will not see new notifications for incoming messages until you unlock the phone.  After this, notifications of new messages will come great. </li><li>  In the system settings, ‚ÄúzStorage‚Äù appeared, clicking on which leads to the departure from the settings. </li><li>  Uploading photos from the camera to OneDrive can be disabled, based on the previous settings, to fix this - make sure you are using the latest version of the OneDrive application, and also make sure that sending photos is enabled in the settings. </li><li>  Temporarily insiders cannot switch in the app from Slow Ring to Fast Ring.  The developers are working on it.  But if you still need to switch from a slow to fast ring, you must first roll back to Windows Phone 8.1 using the Windows Phone Recovery Tool, and do it on the old OS version. </li><li>  Additional languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor speech and keyboard will not be downloaded in the next day.  If you have already installed languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor speech and keyboards before the upgrade, they will remain. </li></ul><br><h4>  Important: </h4><br>  <b>Insiders upgrading from version 10512 will install 2 updates on their smartphones.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>First you need to fly the build 10514 and 10536.1000 in one update.</b>  <b>After installing them, you will receive another update 10536.1004.</b>  <b>This process will take more time than usual - but it will bring important fixes for build 10536, so make sure to install all the updates.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>When installing with Windows Phone 8.1, the build 10536.1004 will immediately load.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>On Microsoft's blog, Gabe turned to users of the Nokia Lumia 1020, who are unable to take full advantage of the capabilities of their camera, due to the lack of the Lumia Camera application on Windows 10 Mobile.</b>  <b>He says that the application will be available for download from the store in the late fall.</b>  <b>Owners of Lumia 1020, for full-fledged work with their camera, can either wait for his return, or roll back to Windows Phone 8.1.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Learn more about updating to the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/09/14/announcing-windows-10-mobile-insider-preview-build-10536/">Microsoft</a> blog. <br>  <b>PS:</b> Please note that many who update from 10512 complain about the loss of performance of the Messages, Phone and Contacts applications.  There is no treatment yet.  Resetting to 10536 leads to the loss of the WIndows message, as a solution to rolling back to Windows Phone 8.1 and reinstalling build 10536. <br>  <b>PS 2:</b> Assembly is also available on almost all phones with Windows Phone 8.1 through Windows Insider, but this does not mean that your phone has been added to the list of supported ones, according to Gabe Aul‚Äôs messages - this is an error and the phones are not guaranteed to work (there are reviews on the network updated HTC 8S and Highscreen WinWin), i.e.  may scorch the device. </div>
