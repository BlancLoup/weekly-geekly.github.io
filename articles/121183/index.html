Optimum is based on hardware and software solutions for automating the following activities: <br><ul><li>  GPS / GLONASS monitoring of transport </li><li>  GPS / GLONASS monitoring of mobile workers (GIS) </li><li>  field service </li><li>  equipment repair (MRO) </li><li>  inventory </li><li>  order picking (pre selling) </li><li>  trade with wheels (van selling) </li><li>  merchandising </li><li>  distribution management. </li></ul><br><br>  By 2011, the total number of implementations of the Optimum platform of the CDC group of companies reached 3,000, and the number of mobile employees covered by these implementations is about 300,000. Thus, the minimum total efficiency of Optimal platform implementations in the economy was about $ 2 billion annually.

      Since February 2011, CDC has conducted several test implementations of the Android version of the Optimum platform.  In June 2011, the Android version of Optimum is available to all customers of the company. <br><br>  The history of the implementation of the Optimum platform and the CDC group of companies is <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0B5RkPEZuQiPfYzJiYjgwMWYtYWNiOS00MDM3LWFjMjgtMTZhM2M2NDcwMGM0%26hl%3Dru">in the presentation</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Currently, the CDC group of companies is considering various versions of Android devices that will be offered to the partners of the CDC group of companies as part of their implementation.  Negotiations are underway on the supply of smartphones and tablet computers with Acer, HTC, Highscreen (Vobis Computer companies) and Huawei, and the use of branded tablets by the Russian operator Mobile TeleSystems (MTS) is also being considered.  The cost of implementing the Optimum technology platform based on Android in terms of a single mobile employee will not increase and will amount to the same $ 450-500 dollars, which now costs a single introduction based on Windows Mobile.  The preservation of the price level was made possible by the presence on the market of dozens of models of smartphones and tablets running Android.  Including models of the budget level, the cost of which does not exceed 10 thousand rubles. <br>  According to the plans of the CDC Group, from the second half of 2011 more than 70% of the new Optimum implementations will be carried out using devices based on the Android platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/45a/345/345/45a34534593800d6766ede9906c54bcc.jpg" alt="Hussein Al-Zari. President of the CC CC"><br>  The president of the CDC group of companies Hussein Az-Zari comments: <br><blockquote>  The market for corporate deployments over the past 10 years has been practically divided between Palm OS and Windows Mobile.  After the cessation of development and support of the first platform, the market went to the Windows Mobile platform 5.xx and above - its share in the last years reached 99%.  Until recently, Windows Mobile was the only open platform for mobile devices with high-quality developer support from Microsoft. <br>  However, over the past year, the mobile platform market has undergone significant changes.  The corporate implementation sector has faced a number of problems: the number of topical Windows Mobile 6.X smartphones has decreased to a minimum, while the widespread introduction of the Microsoft mobile platform Windows Phone 7 for the Russian corporate market is not yet relevant for a number of reasons.  The main of which is the software written earlier for Windows Mobile 6.X needs to be processed almost completely.  In addition, the first version of Windows Phone 7 has a number of serious limitations for the development and operation of professional corporate applications.  There is a failure both with the model range of devices and with the pricing policy: there are few devices on Windows Phone yet, they are quite expensive.  Unfortunately, our long-time partner, Microsoft has lost most of the corporate market in Russia.  It is hoped that the next versions of the platform will take into account the realities of life, but as time goes on and Microsoft will have to catch up with the new leaders. " <br>  Thus, the developers of software and hardware solutions for the corporate market have acutely faced the question of choosing another key mobile platform.  The CDC group is the first among developers of enterprise automation solutions using a mobile platform announcing the porting of its solution to Android. </blockquote><br><br>  The press conference was attended by representatives of manufacturing companies producing devices on the Android platform, each of which made a presentation of products already released, as well as scheduled for release in Russia, which meet the requirements of the Optimum platform.  Some of these decisions were presented at a booth in the hotel lobby. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/885/a60/0c1/885a600c1e5f0b48e07f05cd1cc55103.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/645/d24/b0f/645d24b0f7247647b5e2f442d857e40b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In particular, it was said that not only phones, but also tablets with a screen of 7 "are of considerable interest to the CDC, since such solutions are currently in high demand among customers. <br><br>  Presentations from Acer, Highscreen, Huawei and HTC, as well as a presentation by a representative of MTS, who offer a special tariff plan for CDC customers, are available <a href="https://docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0B5RkPEZuQiPfZTY4NGM3MDktZDIzMi00ZDRhLTg4YWEtZTM2ZWE2MjQ0ZjE3%26hl%3Dru">at GoogleDocs</a> . <br><br>  For example, Acer Iconia Smart spoke and demonstrated, which, according to a company representative, will be released in Russia in July and will cost about 20,000 rubles.  As for Huawei, as is known, this summer the company produces several devices under its own Ideos brand - X3 and X5.  In addition, this is the 7 "Ideos S7 Slim tablet. All these devices were presented at the stand and are guaranteed to be suitable for use with the Optimum software package. <br><br>  Ps By the way, HTC Wildfire was presented there (I was interested as the owner of ‚ÄúSpark‚Äù), at which this software complex felt quite comfortable, did not slow down at all.  The only negative - too small screen resolution does not allow you to comfortably edit the field. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121183/</a></p>
