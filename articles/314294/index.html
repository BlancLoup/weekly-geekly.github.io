      In the meantime, I also decided on the exact version of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX</a> and the very concept of literate programming.  Let me go back a little bit to the story of the "tangle" and "disentangle" utilities (Weave and Tangle).  In general, I think that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating what is called ‚Äúliterate programming‚Äù was the greatest benefit from the occupation of the print business. <br><cut><br>  I like to learn.  I do not just teach the computer, I teach the readers of my programs.  I hope that one day they will award the Pulitzer Prize for the most competent program, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f06/610/4c6/f066104c6b7e5e32b31acc0763ec2c64.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  I started this experiment because a friend of mine, Professor <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580,_%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4">Hoare</a> of Oxford, said: ‚ÄúDon, people don't even read computer programs.‚Äù <br><br>  The publishing house of Oxford University was interested in the publication of some computer programs, as examples of how they should be written correctly. <br><br>  And instead of some obscure files that people have to read, it would be a kind of literature, such as musical notation.  People publish symphony scores, and not just listen to them.  So why can't we publish computer programs?  And his idea stuck in my head, but at the same time it scared me, because the real computer programs already created are full of compromises.  A computer science professor could not allow this. <br><br>  You can write a small program and compare it with small gems, but when it comes to a large program, we can, of course, pretend that it is a jewel, but that would not be so.  And I don‚Äôt think that many program creators would be glad that other people read their work in the form in which it was available then.  And I began to think about how to write a program so that people like to read it. <br><br>  So, obviously, this idea of ‚Äã‚Äãliterate programming appeared, I found a format in which I could present the program to other people, moreover, I, as the creator of this program, could understand it better.  And so I got to this system, in which I could write a program in this programming language, then from this one program I created two more - one was converted from Pascal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB">web</a> services description language, and the other from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB">WEB</a> services description language into a document, which I could read thanks to layout, cross-references and understandable statements. <br><br>  This system is very pleased me.  I wrote programs in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWEB">CWEB</a> - this is the ‚Äúdescendant‚Äù of the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEB">WEB</a> system, and this gives me endless happiness to write programs in a form that I find most appropriate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7d/760/c2d/d7d760c2dbd2ab8717edbe16be0b538f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf">Donald E. Knuth: Literate Programming</a> <br><br><h2>  Learning about Symbolic Optimum Assembly programs (23/97) </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YSb02Xd20_E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  My family and I went to Lynwood summer camp for a week, which is located on the shores of Lake Erie.  And we were there again a couple of years ago to refresh our memories.  So, spent two weeks on the lake.  I played tennis with my uncles and stuff like that, but I also took with me a few examples of computer programs I had heard about.  And I had some free time that summer to familiarize myself with them.  And, in fact, these programs have had a tremendous impact on my future life. <br><br>  One of the programs was called assembler - it allowed writing programs using not machine language, but more symbolic.  It simplified a lot ... I mean, when I started writing programs, I wrote everything in numbers, and if I had to add a number in section 1 to a number located in section 2, then I had to write something in 20.0.0.1.  I had to write out all these numbers, drive them into the cards, and only then use them in my work - that's all I knew about programming at that time. <br><br>  But that program was an innovation for that time, and it allowed writing programs by a simpler method.  Instead of choosing the number for each section in the program, I could give it a name, and the device itself already determined what number corresponds to this name.  But in those days, computers could not cope well with letters, they were designed to work with numbers, but capital letters could be used.  With this assembler, you could use up to five letters per word. <br><br>  <i>( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/314294/">Note</a> from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/safinaskar/" class="user_link">safinaskar</a> : "This assembler allowed the use of labels")</i> <br><br>  I remember exactly how I used it for my tic-tac-toe program, and I had to figure out which five-letter word would define a certain part of the program.  And I remember with delight how I played tic-tac-toe, and how at the time of winning the program moved to the BINGO site.  I used this word of five letters B, I, N, G, O for this part of the program. <br><br>  Yes, I then learned about assembler and learned to encode.  I used it in my work, but at the same time I wondered: ‚ÄúHow does it work?  What was going on inside, and how did the word BINGO correspond with the number?  How did the machine immediately understand this? ‚ÄùI had a listing for this program called SOAP 2 from Stan Poly from IBM.  I myself also had a listing program called ‚ÄúIT-Internal Translator‚Äù - this is a new program that was created by 4 people at Carnegie, Carnegie Mellon University.  This translator used an algebraic language, not a machine language.  And this is long before Fortran or other high-level programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãappeared.  I'm talking about the years 1956,1957. <br><br>  And the point was that you could write X = A + B, well, actually it was impossible to write that way, because it was not possible to use the ‚Äú+‚Äù symbol, so we wrote X1, Z, X2, S, X3, where S denotes ‚Äú+‚Äù, and the letter Z was used instead of ‚Äú=‚Äù, and each variable as X1, X2, X3 or something similar.  But the topic is not less, you could enter an algebraic formula into the map, and then the device has already determined from this how to calculate A + B or what you need to do. <br><br>  Instead of marking with numbers or symbols, there were algebraic symbols.  And you could just transfer the program to a computer, and immediately the lights came on, and after a while you received the device with a computer programming language.  Magic.  I could not understand how it works at all, so I got a copy of the program they used to write this translator, and I got a copy of the SOAP program <br><br><h2>  The Internal Translator (24/97) </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5e6xMfrNp-s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I brought it with me and spent the nights studying and trying to figure out how the program works.  And yes, I managed ... First, I found out how the translator works, how exactly it translates the algebraic formula into instructions.  But then everything was done terribly.  There were mistakes in the program.  Each time sharing something, the creators hardly managed to complete it. <br><br>  I then turned to the SOPE program, the one from Stan Pauli - this program was accurate, incredible, as if you were listening to a symphony.  Everything was connected so harmoniously, and this code was simple.  I said then: "I would like to write programs like this guy does."  And that second code from other developers, it was bulky and clumsy.  "But I can write better than this." <br><br>  Therefore, I and several of my friends wrote an improved version and called it RUNCIBLE, because each program had to have an acronym at that time, and it meant something like ‚ÄúRevised Unified New Basic Language Compiler‚Äù. ) or something like that.  We had several reasons to call the program like that, but we wanted to remake that algebraic language, bring it into a more ordered form, and then we were able to improve the program a bit, and at the same time fit into the same 10kbyte. <br><br>  That's how I spent my first summer at the Computer Center.  And then, after the RUNCIBLE program was written, we also ... I also wrote the instruction manual for this program, and surprisingly, this instruction was used as a guide for students for the next year.  And I found myself in a rather unusual position: in one of the classes they used the very same book that I wrote when I was a second year student. <br><br>  And RUNCIBLE, we updated this program next summer, added a bunch of small things there, fitting them into 10kbytes.  But we still had a floating point and other things that had to be worked on ... Therefore, we again decided to make an improved version.  And so I wrote SOAP 3. You know, I liked the SOAP 2 program from IBM.  I wrote SOAP 3, which was based on SOAP 2, and later we used it as an assembler to improve the software.  And Kais allowed about a dozen students to write programs that would later be used by other students or faculties. <br><br>  Fred Way, the director of this program, was very shrewd, he trusted the students and allowed us ... well, we had a great time talking to each other about all this.  We also received the monthly magazine of the Association of Computing Machinery in 1958. Then we saw that people from all over the world published their ideas on how to write programs, and we then realized that we already know all these things and even more. <br><br>  So my second post, after Potrzebie System for Mad Magazine, was an article about RUNCIBLE: turning formulas into machine code.  I sent my article to the Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, which was only just beginning to be printed.  I was very naive then, did not understand how to publish in scientific journals.  Yes, I saw magazines, knew that an article could be sent there, but had no idea about the meaning.  The story itself was important to me, that's why I wrote. <br><br>  I considered myself a speaker, a representative of these guys from Case Computer Center, with whom I worked together on the creation of RUNCIBLE.  And I wrote an article about the methods that we used for RUNCIBLE, but nowhere in the article I mentioned the names of these guys, and I did not know that I would get the sum for these ideas, I just wanted to describe them. <br><br>  Only later did I understand all this, learned about the conventions.  And at that moment, I just wrote an article.  And we prepared this material correctly, when the article was already published, as part of my collected works a few years ago. <br><br>  <em><font color="#999999">Publication support - the company <a href="https://www.edsd.com/">Edison</a> , which develops an <a href="https://www.edsd.ru/sms-i-pochtovye-signaly-o-sostoyanii-na-valyutnom-rynke">alert for traders</a> , as well as makes a <a href="https://www.edsd.ru/sistema-ucheta-ehnergoresursov-i-vodosnabzheniya-goroda-sputnika">system of energy accounting and water supply for the cottage village</a> .</font></em> <br><br><h2>  Read more </h2><br><ul><li> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/312374/">Donald Knut: I sat in the back row and hunted jokes, and the teachers resigned and didn't often beat on the ass (1,2,3,7 / 97)</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/312154/">Donald Knut: ‚ÄúMy advice to the young‚Äù (93/97) and ‚ÄúFeeling the need to assert oneself‚Äù (9/97)</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/312750/">Surreal Numbers: I worked for six days, and rested on the seventh (40,41,42 / 97)</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/312796/">Donald Knut: How the ‚ÄúArt of Programming‚Äù was created (33,38,39 / 97)</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/313790/">Donald Knut: When will the fourth volume finally come out?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/313428/">Donald Knut: How I spent the summer with the computer, not with the girls (19,20,21,22 / 97)</a> </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of 97 videos with stories of Donald Knut</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLVV0r6CmEsFzeNLngr1JqyQki3wdoGrCn">Youtube playlist</a> <br><br>  1. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312374/">Family history</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312374/">Learning to read and school</a> <br>  3. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/312374/">My mother</a> <br>  4.
