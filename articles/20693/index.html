  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Results of democracy or "From the life of one Greek"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Extremely interesting trend. <br><br>  At one time, the ancient Greeks had a well-known social structure.  Namely - democracy. <br>  The Greeks were extremely proud of her, successfully used and very much loved to ostracize all sorts of high-ranking pests, in general, they extracted everything that was possible from her.  Then, however, the Greeks died out.  Maybe because of climate change, maybe old steels.  Maybe this happened due to the fact that too many barbarians were let in and they also became active users of democracy. <br><br>  Nobody knows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Subsequently, we all went through democracy at school, we know that this system is very good and useful for society.  Well, of course, everyone wants to be listened to.  The English colonists, too, apparently, studied in school, passed democracy, penetrated, and, therefore, in the newly open America, they introduced this system at the earliest opportunity.  However, a nuisance happened.  Excellent democracy at the beginning began to falter.  After all became equal, some dissatisfied became even more equal.  Then came those who were more equal than equals, and, in the end, the most equal were found.  They are, by the way, democracy there and now they are inducing.  But let's not pay attention to the shortcomings of the social system of unfortunate Americans.  All the same, a big deal did. <br>  And the heirs have spawned.

      When democracy came to one sixth of the land, only children, old maids, and students of some special projects believed in it.  And I don‚Äôt think that now there are more thoughtful fans of the Socialist Revolutionary Democracy Party.  And why, in fact, does democracy work so poorly? <br>  Without touching the institutions of equality and the complex hierarchy of the vertical of equality, one can say that two things prevented the universal paradise on earth.  Population and laziness.  It was good for the Greeks, 1000 people gathered in the square - here you have a statistically competent representative sample and almost 50% turnout.  And the Greeks themselves were, unlike today's, people with an active lifestyle and great lovers of shouting from the principle. <br><br>  What now?  And you know, I guess.  140 million people, and how many of them know what they want?  Lot?  And how many know what they want, not including the TV?  Less.  Well, let alone ask how many people are not too lazy to defend their position, we, out of politeness, will not. <br><br>  And finally, we approach the most interesting. <br><br>  What should our familiar Greek have to do in order to manifest a civic duty?  He had to wash himself, get dressed, get into the chariot (who is in the usual, who is in the gig with special signals) and arrive at the square.  In the square, democratic Greeks beat pots, collected shards, signed shards, and put them in an appropriate urn.  True, there were also cases with fake bulletins and the use of votes by illiterate residents.  But their number was so small that a single case was described in philosophical works, documented and used to form descendants. <br>  Let's go back, however, to the Greek.  Having done this whole procedure, he, tired but satisfied, went home to have supper.  Dinner, because the evening had already arrived.  And since the Greeks held meetings on the square not once every four years, but more often, then the time (and the strength), respectively, took much longer. <br><br>  What now?  And now we have electronic pots, auto shakers of shards and other things that facilitate the democrat's hard work, things.  Simply put, this is the Internet, where you can organize such ostracism and other useful procedures quickly, easily, conveniently and reliably.  As for the breeding of breeding sows at the Ventsy-Zarya state farm, and for the election of the Equal One.  And there you see, and the elections will become less necessary, and ostracism - more ... <br><br>  But. <br><br>  Something has gone wrong lately, and the state itself, with its own hands, diligently and consistently dumbfounded the staunch handful of idealist democratic democrats with new and new nails into the coffin of democracy.  The last, the most ideological admirers of the old social order, shamefully lower their eyes, looking at the television screens and the pages of newspapers.  Those who, first of all, noisily and merrily laughed at the manifestations of political paranoia, became practically invisible.  Tolley thought better of it, if it were, they thought. <br><br>  The formidable demon of democracy is intimidated, neutralized and practically exorcised from the body of society. <br>  And this is the moment when democracy can be introduced consistently and everywhere!  On such a scale, which have not been seen in sweet dreams even the most notorious Greek ostrakator!  What is it - a mistake of statesmen?  So, all is not lost.  Since the legislators have seriously taken up the Internet, can they understand its power?  Maybe the socket on the desktop is still waiting for us, with checkmarks in front of the names and resolutions? <br>  I doubt something ... <br><br>  And ideological ridicule paranoia I advise, nevertheless, to delve into the essence of what is happening.  And only then, with a pure heart and reasoned knowledge, speak out about. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20693/</a></p>
