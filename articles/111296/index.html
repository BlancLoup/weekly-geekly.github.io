  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Erasmus eyewitness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past, in 2010, I managed to get into the <a href="http://www.iamonet.de/">program of international academic mobility IAMONET-RU partnership Erasmus Mundus Action 2</a> and now, on the eve of the new selection, I matured to the post with a story about how it was with me, and some recommendations for future Erasmuses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Details about the program can be found on the <a href="http://www.iamonet.de/">website</a> , <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club1908947">and not only</a> .  Actually, I learned sitting in a cafe, from a friend who participated in a similar program <br>  The first dock pack needed to be prepared by the end of February.  The kit consisted of a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae">CV</a> (filled out on the site and downloaded), Application Form (issued in high school), Cover letter (in free form), passport scan.  I also wrote a research proposal - because  I applied for the graduate program (for masters and bachelors this is not necessary).  My documents were accepted and they said that I still need to bring 2 letters of recommendation from the professors of my faculty before the interview.  The interview takes place with a commission of representatives of members of European universities - participants of the program. <br>  When this commission arrives is decided by the representatives of the participating universities at the congress (in Moscow?) In early March.  And they decide every year in different ways, so the exact date is not known until a certain point.  This year my university was the first and the selection began on March 13. <br>  The interview took half a day.  In total, there were sixty people interviewed and in time everyone was given 15 minutes.  We visited the audience in groups of 3 people, sat down and answered questions.  Here, by the way, it is better to choose one‚Äôs neighbors for oneself in the background of which one can stand out (with knowledge of a language or something else). I myself didn‚Äôt do that and my colleagues came across with language skills much better than mine, which was why I was quite uncomfortable (although as a result, it did not affect the passage).  He asks the commission from each in different ways - they can ask about the goals of training, they can ask about hobbies, and they can ask to prove why they should take you and not the rest.  Pay attention to certificates and diplomas: the presence of TOEFL or certificates of this level is a big plus.  The main thing at this stage is to show them that you really want to go, i.e.  Confidence in the necessity of this program for you is one of the decisive factors determining whether they will take you or not. <br>  Following the results of the commission puts its notes on the summary.  There are only three - <em>A</em> , <em>B</em> and <em>C.</em>  <em>A</em> and <em>B are</em> sent to the competition further, <em>C</em> does not pass.  We have selected 2/3 applications. <br>  Further documents are sent to Europe, where the final decision is made.  The number of people who went from the university is also not constant and changes every year. <br>  The results became known only in August.  They invited only 5 people (this is very small, they used to go in groups of 20-25 people).  I passed with the condition of putting the TOEFL.  It is important not to relax and start collecting documents for a visa before the results come.  The fact is that to obtain a visa, you need an invitation from the university, a statement of financial support (proof of the amount of money needed to live in the country you are going to) and a certificate of a criminal record.  The invitation will be sent anyway, the statement will be made for 3 days, but a certificate of non-conviction will be done a month.  It is free and therefore it is better to start doing it in advance, before the time of receipt of the results.  Otherwise you may be late.  Like me. <br>  What the <a href="http://maps.google.ru/maps/place%3Fhl%3Dru%26amp%3BexpIds%3D17259,18167%26amp%3Bxhr%3Dt%26amp%3Bcp%3D13%26amp%3Bnewwindow%3D1%26amp%3Bum%3D1%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF-8%26amp%3Bq%3D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%2B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%2B%25D0%25B2%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%26amp%3Bfb%3D1%26amp%3Bgl%3Dru%26amp%3Bhq%3D%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%2B%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%26amp%3Bhnear%3D%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%2B%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%26amp%3Bcid%3D1576028131770940300">embassies are</a> swinging: all documents for it must be in Czech language.  It is worth noting that it is better to use a translator recommended by the <a href="http://mzv.cz/">embassy</a> (they can call and ask).  I transferred the local bureau and then had to redo it.  A long-term visa must be pre-recorded and recorded no earlier than two weeks in advance.  Visa is 2 months.  The result comes to the email left when submitting the documents.  As soon as the result came, you need to do Czech insurance (I was sent to the university where I‚Äôm going and sent) - it is necessary.  And do not buy tickets before you get your passport with a visa.  Not necessary.  I bought in advance, and in the end I lost the tickets because for ‚Äútechnical reasons‚Äù I could not get a visa for a week. <br><br>  Look like that's it.  Now I am writing this post already from Prague.  I think that since such a program is there, it means it should be used.  Dare! </div>
