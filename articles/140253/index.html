  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Theory or practice? What is more important?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the "Sandbox" section, topics often flash from the candidates for how the future specialist in the field of it-technologies begins.  Some give a list of programs from which they started, recalling the life stories of famous self-taught people in this field.  Others list their favorite disciplines at the institute, arguing with the first.  The goal of both is to find their employer, or to do a quality job for an existing one.  The latter is torn between two camps, trying to figure out who is cooler. <br><img src="http://gigaom2.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/153225000_698c62c38a.jpg?w=500" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is widely believed that it is possible to become a professional in the field of it-technologies on the basis of the university education department of applied mathematics and computer science and 90% of your youth spent in front of the monitor using the method of trial and error of a high-class specialist who forged you out.  And for advanced training it is quite enough to gossip on the forum with the gurus of modern technology, sign up for courses or buy a booklet on the topic.  The question is, is there any future for university IT education in Russia? <br>  The international career and education promotion company, QS, has published a world ranking of higher education institutions.  Applicants from Russia did not enter the top 100, taking 112th place (Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov). <br>  The average age of the senior faculty of the programming specialization is around 60 years.  These people create the necessary foundation for their extensive work experience, because  namely, domestic computing systems are in the missile attack warning system (SPRN) and in other modern Russian technology. <br>  The young team injects the ‚Äúfresh blood‚Äù necessary in the rapidly developing environment of it-technologies.  Because  most of them work as programmers or electronics engineers remotely, they have the necessary practice. <br>  During the first years of study, students have time to master mathematics, physics, electronics, circuit engineering.  Naturally, this knowledge is not given at the in-depth level, but they are necessary as a basis for understanding the functioning of computers and systems.  The university courses are structured in such a way that the previous ones are repeated in each new subject, relying on the fact that if the students did not complete their education, thanks to such repetitions in his head, he would still have basic knowledge.  Due to them, in further work, even in the newest technologies, he will be able to see and combine the familiar and studied components in a single picture.  And with the latest equipment in the institutes have always been a problem.  Especially in the regions.  Most educational institutions simply do not have enough budget funds for constantly updating modern technologies. <br>  Often, on the basis of training, employers complain that a university graduate has to be retrained in the workplace.  This is really necessary, the IT industry is developing so rapidly that a fairly conservative higher education cannot keep up with all the new trends.  Here the employer always has the opportunity to take in the staff of the national craftsman and retrain him, as well as a graduate.  Right at the workplace.  In the first case, the lack of a base.  In the second, lack of practice. <br>  Many employers solve this issue, actively engaged in training future personnel for their companies, already in the 3-4 year university. <br>  Violent disputes, is there any reason to spend money on education in the field of IT-technologies, continue.  Splitting into those who have already received it and those who have learned everything in practice with the minimum cost of finance and the maximum time for mistakes.  Both paths lead to positive results if a person is really engaged in business, and there are not enough terms to look better against the general background.  As a result, employers need specialists, universities need to increase the budget, students need work.  The chain is looking for a compromise between all three of its links. </div>
