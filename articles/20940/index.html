Despite the fact that it still has to be explained quite often, the circle of people breaking spears around the definitions of this term is narrowing.  Web 2.0 is one of those concepts that is intuitively captured, but does not lend itself to precise wording, but in any case, everyone agrees that speaking of Web 2.0, we mean a kind of modern Internet standard that is based on sharing with users of various content liability services. .  It should be noted that the existence of this standard is provided by technologies, which have already been created quite a lot, while all of them are closely intertwined and integrated with each other. <br><br>  It is when trying to attribute this or that technology to Web 2.0 or assess its impact on the standard and the most controversy arises.  At the risk of disagreeing the reader, we include RSS, XML, Ajax, widgets, a free categorization system (tags or tags), personalization of user space, user control of content, sociality (socialization), API, integration and complementarity of services (mash- up).

      The Web 2.0 platform appeared not so much an evolutionary as a revolutionary way.  This was discussed in the famous <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">article by</a> Tim O'Reilly, who is believed to have introduced the term Web 2.0 into the conceptual base of the Internet.  Back in 2005, analyzing a new phenomenon, Tim O'Reilly noted: ‚ÄúThe collapse of the dotcombards in the fall of 2001 was a turning point for the Internet.  Many decided that the concept of the web itself was excessively inflated, but, in fact, such ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù and, as a result of this, a drop in stocks are the inevitable satellites of all technological revolutions. ‚Äù <br><br>  Before we had time to realize and get used to Web 2.0, comments about the coming era of Web 3.0 have already appeared.  If we recognize the position of the revolutionary change of web platforms, then it is quite possible that Web 2.0 expects the inevitable collapse that once happened with Web 1.0.  Now, like several years ago, there is a constant investment in new services, some of which are bought for huge money.  However, the problem is that, apparently, very few people know the methods of effective monetization of many Web 2.0 ‚Äì resources.  At the moment, their advantage over others is in attracting traffic, but the ‚Äúgames‚Äù with the latter are already smelling something outdated and outgoing. <br><br>  However, among the experts can be observed and supporters of the evolutionary development of the Internet.  As a rule, these are people who have closely connected their business with Web 2.0 and do not even allow the thought of a new ‚Äúbubble‚Äù. <br><br>  One of these optimists is the director of Google Inc.  Eric Schmidt.  Speaking recently at the <a href="">Seoul Digital Forum</a> , he tried to answer the journalist's question about the meaning of the term Web 3.0, which Google corporation puts into it.  In response, Eric Schmidt joked about Web 2.0, calling it a ‚Äúmarketing term.‚Äù  After that, he said that Web 3.0 will become the platform of ‚Äúapplications assembled together.‚Äù  They will be relatively small and versatile to run on any device, be it a computer or mobile gadget.  In addition, these applications will work very quickly and spread ‚Äúvirally‚Äù (via social networks, email, etc.). <br><br>  Thus, today we can identify two possible trends in the development of the Internet: a ‚Äúsoft‚Äù transition to Web 3.0 through the evolution of web applications while maintaining user activity and a certain change of emphasis in the development of web technologies.  How the last can be realized is still unknown.  Maybe 3D-Internet is waiting for us, and maybe achieving the unity of user registration in various services in order to ensure greater security on the Web, who knows ... In any case, if Google‚Äôs top managers started talking about Web 3.0, it means that there‚Äôs still a wait not for long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20940/</a></p>
