  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of ways to withdraw electronic money in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  The topic is rather trite, since only we are not offered all kinds of exchangers and money transfer operators ... But still.  This article provides my personal experience and private subjective opinion regarding the existing options.  The article is not fixated on one specific system, various options are given. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  First, consider the "built-in" ways to withdraw money.  They are provided by the payment systems themselves. </h5><br>  <b>WebMoney:</b> <br>  Most ways to withdraw WebMoney require a passport.  No matter in what form.  Now we will study them in more detail. <br><br>  Withdrawal through money transfer systems: <br>  Withdrawal of funds through money transfer systems requires a formal, initial or personal passport - but <a href="http://perevod.webmoney.ru/">the system‚Äôs website</a> says that for owners of a formal passport it is <a href="http://perevod.webmoney.ru/html/DocCheck.html">obligatory to upload and verify passport data at OOO Guarantee Agency</a> .  Apparently, more and TIN will require.  Some do not have it for various reasons, including religious and ideological.  So these methods, which would be very convenient, can be used without obstacles only by ‚Äúcertified‚Äù ones.  The interest rate varies from 0.5% to 3%, it depends on the transfer system, the participating bank and the amount paid. <br><br>  WebMoney Bank Card: <br>  The method at first glance is very, very convenient.  R-rraz - and the money is already on the card, you want - cash out at an ATM, you want - to spend in the store.  WebMoney offers to issue a dollar bank card for you, allowing you to withdraw money from a purse.  Terms and prices are available <a href="http://cards.webmoney.ru/asp/default.asp">here</a> .  All prices are in dollars, rather big commissions, $ 10 for issuing, from $ 8 to $ 17 for delivery, $ 0.9 just for requesting a balance at an ATM, payment for servicing the card not even for a year - $ 4 per month!  And I doubt that ALL Russian ATMs are compatible with them.  In general, for the withdrawal of Russian rubles is not a good method.  At least not cheap.  And they can easily refuse to issue or require confirmation of passport data.

      Withdrawing money to a bank account: <br>  SWIFT and Western Union are not even considered expensive and time consuming.  To withdraw rubles to a bank account (for example, to Sberbank on a book, or on a card of any bank), passport details and the TIN in the Guarantee Agency are again required, or you need to have a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù certificate. <br><br>  Postal transfer: <br>  The "guarantee agency" has already gotten bogged down, so why should it be a stump, good, they are not alone in this market.  If you send via InfoConnection, everything will work out.  But the amount of transfer must be at least 1000 rubles.  I sent it like this: <a href="http://www.ifc.ru/post/">go to the InfoCommunication site</a> , fill out a questionnaire, see a commission (from 1000r take 54r), confirm that we are transferred to the webmoney merchant, pay, rejoice. <br><br>  Transfer to HandyBank (and to the card!): <br>  <a href="http://www.handybank.ru/">HandyBank</a> is an interesting hybrid of an Internet payment system with a ruble ‚Äúwallet‚Äù and a Maestro bank card that does not contain a stamped name and is issued upon registration in the system.  In order to get an account there and get a set from a card, password and a disk with a protection key (electronic digital signature for payments through <a href="https://binom.dzetta.ru/">the system‚Äôs website</a> , authorization via Java, authorization via SMS with a one-time password is possible) now you need to call a courier or visit their branches, but before these boxes were distributed in supermarkets and in CafeMax, and it was enough to fill out a questionnaire and give them a passport is not required.  In the user's HandyBank system, a 5-digit Handy-number (‚Äúaccount number‚Äù as a matter of fact) and a 4-digit Co-number are identified, which saves you from remembering long account numbers.  You can replenish HandyBank through EleksNet terminals. <br>  The "Guarantee Agency" again frightens its checks, but in my case, it beautifully brought HandyBank to the "left" card.  Although they <a href="http://cards.guarantee.ru/">write that Handy should be issued to the same person as the WMID</a> .  In my case it worked, although it did not match. <br>  Having replenished, you can withdraw money from an ATM or pay for their purchases.  There are very few ‚Äúnative‚Äù ATMs of the system, but the rest are not very ruinous. <br><br>  Exchangers: <br>  Then how lucky.  Fees and conditions depend on the owners of exchangers. <br>  There are also unofficial exchangers that expose under a certain percentage without any documents and other things.  Sometimes (if it is really reliable) this is a real option.  Just look, so that you don't get a fake and not be taken by surprise. <br><br>  <b>Yandex money:</b> <br>  It's a little easier.  There is no certification as such; identification by passport is needed not by everyone and not always. <br><br>  AlfaBank Bank Card: <br>  The method is very simple, inexpensive (2%) and extremely convenient.  Transfer from account to card usually occurs within a few seconds.  Full of AlfaBank offices and ATMs, the most convenient AlfaKlik TV bank ... <br>  One problem is that AlfaBank itself has very not weak rates for servicing bills and cards ... It was from last year‚Äôs 90 rubles a month (!). <br><br>  RDB Bank Card: <br>  The way is not bad.  We make any card <a href="http://bank-open.ru/">in the RBR bank (now renamed ‚ÄúOPENING‚Äù)</a> and link it via an ATM to the Yandex.Money account.  The commission for withdrawal is 3%, the limit for withdrawal is not more than 5,000 (five thousand) rubles per day and not more than 30,000 (thirty thousand) rubles per calendar month.  For example, RBD VISA Classic card - the tariff for service is 600 rubles per year.  Everyone is good, but only PayPal did not haw it.  There are a lot of ATMs of RBR, I liked the service in the bank, there is a free telebank and free SMS-notifications. <br><br>  Money transfer via CONTACT: <br>  Hurray, you can withdraw money without passport identification - just fill out a questionnaire - and within 1-2 business days after submitting the application you can already receive a transfer at the selected point.  You can transfer money not only to yourself, but to any person.  The only negative is the commission.  The commission will be 4.5%.  Of these, 3% is the Yandex.Money commission and 1.5% is the CONTACT system commission, but not less than 60 rubles. <br><br>  Output to a bank account: <br>  Again, identification is not required, just fill out a questionnaire and wait for the withdrawal of funds to an account in any Russian bank (you must have an account in advance).  The commission will make from 3%, and it is necessary to wait from 3 to 7 working days. <br><br>  Exchangers: <br>  All the same as in the case of WebMoney. <br><br>  <b>RBC-Money:</b> <br>  The former RUPay offers several ways to withdraw money, one of which may interest not only the users of this system, but more on that a little later.  Identification is voluntary, filling in the fields on the site is enough, as obtaining a ‚Äúformal‚Äù certificate of WebMoney.  Authentication extends user authority. <br><br>  RBK BANK Bank Card: <br>  The system offers a free issue of an RBK MasterCard bank card (getting a cash machine in an office in Moscow, also in Moscow, it is one, but there is a preferential withdrawal at 2% at Master Bank's ATMs).  The card is issued for a year, the service charge is NOT CHARGED!  Those.  The card is really absolutely free.  The withdrawal of funds to this card is made from the system site at 2%. <br><br>  Post transfer: <br>  Processing for three days, commission 3% + (1.3%, but not less than 12 rubles, additional service of delivering the transfer to the house 1.5%, but not less than 10 rubles, excluding VAT) <br><br>  Via CONTACT: <br>  Processing within 24 hours on working days, commission 5% + (1.8%, but not less than 75 rubles) <br><br>  To a bank account (or card): <br>  Processing 3-5 business days, commission 3% + 20 rubles. <br><br><h5>  And now a few "tricky" ways to withdraw money </h5><br>  As they say, there are subtleties everywhere. <br><br>  <b>To a bank card (you can not over):</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.oceanbank.ru/html/card_special">"OCEAN-Bank" invites everyone to receive a bank card by mail</a> , after filling in the data on the site.  It is not obligatory to go to the office and carry documents. <br>  So, we fill out an application, we get a card (not for yourself, but for friends, acquaintances, anyone across Russia).  And then we <a href="http://www.platezh.ru/info/reg_out.htm">go to their payment server</a> , register the received card and get the opportunity to replenish it with a simple payment through the merchant. <br><br>  <b>Through the exchanger and RBC MasterCard in Moscow:</b> <br>  The method only seems tricky and expensive, in fact it is PROFIT. <br>  The algorithm is as follows. <br>  1) Register with <a href="https://rbkmoney.ru/">RBKMoney</a> , fill out an application for receiving an RBK MasterCard card. <br>  2) Get the card in the office in Moscow.  Do not forget that the card is free - neither for release nor for service will not have to pay.  In my case, they did not send a notification that the card was ready - I had to call and check if it was ready. <br>  3) Once received the card, we wait 24 hours until it is tied to an account in RBKMoney - so that you can withdraw money to it.  I had to kick the caliper, they braked it. <br>  4) <a href="http://www.menyala.ru/">Go to the exchanger "Menala.Ru</a> . <a href="http://www.menyala.ru/">"</a> <br>  They have a very long time free WMR exchange and not only for RBKMoney.  And if they register with the discount system - then the exchange will be even more profitable for you - they gave you 1p WebMoney, received 1p15 RBK or even more. <br>  5) Change your WebMoney to RBK. <br>  6) We display the received RBK RUR on the RBK Money card. <br>  7) We cash at their ATM for free - or at other interest rates. <br>  8) PROFIT! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65498/</a></p>
