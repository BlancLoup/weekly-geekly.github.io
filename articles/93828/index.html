  <section class="page js-page"><h1>open production - the motivational aspect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I continue to describe the idea of <b><a href="http://fly17.habrahabr.ru/blog/93646/">open production</a></b> from various sides.  In previous topics I tried to describe my point of view on the <b><a href="http://fly17.habrahabr.ru/blog/93649/">economic</a></b> and <b><a href="http://fly17.habrahabr.ru/blog/93651/">social</a></b> aspects of the phenomenon, perhaps it was more correct to start not with them, but with motivational ones which theoretically explain the disposition of people to such formations. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thinking a little secret for anyone that there was such a psychologist and thinker A. Maslow, who came up with a very folding theory of motivation, which, by the way, could be expressed more than briefly - as a pyramid (apparently because of its clarity and simplicity, it is used everywhere, from sociology and philosophy, ending with issues of advertising and PR).  Just in case I bring it here: <br><img src="http://walw.ru/images/poved_img_17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Maslow worked closer to the beginning of the 20th century, life was then worse and the size (width) of the pyramid steps then, perhaps, reflected the social division of society in quantitative terms.  There were many hungry people, they shot everyone in a row, etc.  Now, I think, the demographic aspect is gone (I hope), and the size of the steps, perhaps, reflects only the sequence.  The general meaning of the idea depicted in the picture is as follows: for the emergence of needs in the following steps, satisfaction (or compensation) of needs in the lower steps must be achieved.  In the words of popular wisdom - the fed does not understand the hungry.  Thus, first, the needs related to the satisfaction of the needs that ensure the vital activity of the body must be satisfied, then the issues are solved so as not to get a club from around the corner, and the most interesting thing begins, which is now relevant.  All needs above level 3 (although the need for affiliation can also be met in social communities that support open production) can and should be met in the process of open interactions.  Respect and recognition by the community is the capital and at the same time the impetus that accumulates in the process of creating the opening of its intellectual property.  By the way, by assumption (that in the head at the present moment regarding the project) respect, recognition, reputation should be relatively easily converted into the intellectual efforts of other members of the community.  By the way, Habr corresponds to this principle quite well, with the only difference that for the system of support for open production, articles (topics) should be replaced with practical questions, tasks of making design decisions, tasks of determining the space of possible solutions, etc.  The greater the recognition, the more attention the task attracts, the higher the chances of completing the project in which this task is set, the greater the reputational dividends of the community member who solved (helped in solving) the task.  As a result, we have a positive feedback loop, which in turn increases the value of the community as a whole.  The issue of moral satisfaction is self-evident, to dwell on it, I think it makes no sense.  With cognitive needs, everything seems to be also obvious, the exchange of intellectual property (its abundance), the practical orientation of activity towards the result, etc.  - all satisfied.  Aesthetic needs.  It is a little more complicated here, but for purely hypothetical reasons, the realization of these needs should ensure the necessary degree of reflection in the community, local self-organization, a high level of the internal culture of the community.  Everything that should prevent an excess of entropy and anarchy.  At the top of the pyramid is self-actualization - in fact, according to Maslow, the ideal for which one should strive, goal and meaning ... A beautiful idea, even a conscious movement in this direction should make life better, and the economic and social components should contribute to this.  Maybe the article turned out to be a little pretentious, but in the process of writing it, the mood has clearly improved, I hope reading at least someone will be able to cheer up.  Spsb. </div>
