How does our sun work?  What is the other side of the black hole?  What causes galaxies to move, and in general, where are the boundaries of our universe, and are there other universes, UFOs, and what happens there?  What is the physics of all these natural phenomena?  I didn‚Äôt really want to go into the tedious formulas and calculations of theoretical physicists, since I believed that complex things can be explained in simple words.  Hoping to get a little closer to understanding such large-scale processes, I reread many popular fiction in this direction (Michio Kaku, Brian Green), studied the special theory of relativity (STR), the theory of superstrings, tried to understand where such concepts as neutrinos, dark matter, dark energy, what are the reasons for entering data terms?  And what was my surprise when I found so many obvious errors and shortcomings in all these questions / answers, as well as a fundamentally new approach to explaining these phenomena, that I would like to share with you if it will be interesting to you. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  A bit of history ... </h5>

So, the first who put forward 2 well-known postulates about the constancy of the speed of light in a vacuum and the isotropy (homogeneity) of the universe was the French physicist Henri Poincare, who together with Hendrik Lorenz created the theory of relativity, sending it to the patent bureau.  The theory itself even preserved mathematical transformations bearing his name - the Lorentz transformation.  And Einstein appropriated this work to himself by stamping his name.  At that time there was a terrible scandal in the scientific world about this!  Einstein wanted to write his name in history by receiving the Nobel Prize for stolen labor.  But Poincar√© and Lorenz were able to defend their position, and the Nobel Committee was unable to award the Nobel Prize to Einstein for the SRT.  But as everyone knows, Einstein still has a Nobel Prize, but for what?  For the discovery of the second law of the photoelectric effect (1905), which by the way is a special case of the first law of the photoelectric effect.  Plus, the photo effect was discovered by physicist Aleksandr Stoletov in 1888-1890.  After these events, it is really worth taking a fresh look at a famous photo of a famous physicist. <br><br>  And one more thing about which few people know.  His name is Dayton Miller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41d/9c8/ca5/41d9c8ca5e201b3142813790b3668081.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wikipedia speaks of him as a negative of the theory of relativity "Einstein".  I think many people disagree with this theory, but it was he who, in fact, pointed out a fundamental error in this theory.  We all know the experience of Michelson-Morley, who conducted an experiment with an interferometer that "confirms" the isotropy of space. <br><br>  But almost no one knows that in the interferometer used in the Michelson-Morley experiments, the light traveled a total of 22 meters.  In addition, the experiments were conducted in the basement of a stone building, almost at sea level.  Further, experiments were conducted for four days (July 8, 9, 11, and 12) in 1887.  These days, data from the interferometer were taken as much as 6 hours and there were absolutely 36 instrument turns.  And on this experimental base, like on three pillars, the confirmation of the ‚Äúcorrectness‚Äù of both Einstein‚Äôs special and general theory of relativity holds.  What did Dayton Miller do?  Miller <a href="http://www.anti-relativity.com/Miller1933.pdf">published</a> in 1933, in the journal ‚ÄúReview of Modern Physics‚Äù (Reviews of Modern Physics), the results of his experiments on the so-called ether wind, over a period of more than twenty years of research, and in all these experiments he received positive results in confirmation of the existence of the ether wind.  He began his experiments in 1902 and completed them in 1926.  For these experiments, he created an interferometer with a total mileage of 64 meters.  It was the most perfect interferometer of that time, at least three times more sensitive than the interferometer that A. Michelson and E. Morley used in their experiments.  Measurements from the interferometer were taken at different times of the day, at different times of the year.  The readings from the instrument were taken more than 200,000 thousand times, and more than 12,000 turns of the interferometer were made.  He periodically raised his interferometer to the top of Mount Wilson (6,000 feet above sea level ‚Äî more than 2,000 meters), where, as he had supposed, the speed of the aetheric wind was greater. <br><br>  For clarity, I would like to give some explanation.  The ethereal wind recorded in impeccable experiments of D. Miller and the change in propagation of radio waves, depending on the direction, are one and the same.  Different terminology, but the same meaning.  Thus, these experiments irrefutably prove the heterogeneity of the Universe and, thus, the falsity of the first postulate used by A. Einstein in "their" special and general theories of relativity. <br><br>  On the one hand, there are Michelson-Morley experiments, which lasted as much as 6 hours, for four days, with 36 turns of the interferometer.  On the other hand, the experimental data were removed from the interferometer for 24 years and the instrument turned whiter than 12,000 times!  And, despite the fact that the D. Miller interferometer was three times more sensitive!  Here is what the facts say.  But maybe A. Einstein and Co. did not know about these results, did not read scientific journals and therefore remained in their own delusion ?!  Well knew.  Dayton Miller wrote letters to A. Einstein.  In one of his letters, he reported on the results of his twenty-two-year work, confirming the presence of the ether wind.  A. Einstein responded to this letter with skepticism and demanded evidence, which he was given.  After that ... no answer.  Again, you can look at the photo Eshtein new. <br><br>  And also: In the experiments conducted by Dr. Lijun Wang at the NEC Research Institute in Princeton (NEC research institute in Princeton), surprising results were obtained.  The experiment was that the light pulses were passed through a container filled with specially treated cesium gas.  The results of the experiments turned out to be phenomenal - the speed of light pulses turned out to be 300 (three hundred) times greater than the permissible speed of the Lorentz transformations (2000)!  In Italy, another group of physicists from the Italian National Research Council (Italian National Research Council), in their experiments with microwaves (2000) received a propagation speed of 25% more than the permissible speed of A. Einstein ... <br><br>  The story is certainly interesting, and as a result, the scandals of the intrigue of the investigation, but how the universe works, how everything works there is still a mystery ... It only remains to fix this or that phenomenon and guess what the causes of these events are.  For some reason, the answers of modern physicists, let us say, why galaxies move are responsible, because this influence of dark matter and energy does not give complete satisfaction.  One gets the feeling that I do not understand something or they are silent about something ... but what?  And then I came across one book that gave me an understanding of why stars are born and die, how planets are born, what is on the other side of the black hole, where are the borders of our universe, and what is beyond the borders? <br><br><h5>  Space heterogeneity </h5><br>  The space is indeed heterogeneous, and there are many natural phenomena to this.  Consider for example radioactivity: <br>  Radioactivity is a phenomenon in which an atom becomes unstable, its decay occurs, as a result of which energy is released, and a more stable atom or atoms is formed.  Instability arises when a given atom absorbs a photon.  When a photon is absorbed, an electron transitions from one allowed orbit to another.  But why, when a photon is absorbed, one atom becomes unstable and decays, while the other remains stable?  Recognized as radioactive are transuranium elements whose atomic weight exceeds two hundred and thirty-eight AU.  and having a complex structure of electron orbits.  The decay of such atoms could be explained by their complex structure, which is disturbed by the absorption of a photon and from a steady state becomes unstable, with the result that the atom disintegrates.  Everything, it would seem, is fine, if small BUT would not interfere again.  Not only transuranic elements are radioactive, but also isotopes of all other elements.  Curious is the fact that, for example, hydrogen isotopes are radioactive ‚Äî deuterium and tritium, with an atomic mass of two and three AU, while the gold atom is the most stable, with an atomic weight of almost one hundred ninety-seven AU.  In this and similar cases it is impossible to explain the stability and instability by the complexity of the structure of the organization of atoms.  The paradox and seemingly insoluble contradiction reappears.  Everything would be so, if we proceed from the assumption of homogeneity of space.  But if we assume that space is non-uniform - a contradiction and absurdity disappear. <br><br>  It can be said that space, in any area, has different properties and qualities (let's call it the dimension of space), respectively, and the matter that is there manifests itself (or does not manifest) differently depending on the given conditions (dimension). Matter shows itself only when the properties and qualities of matter are identical with the properties and qualities of the dimensionality of space.  But the dimensionality of space can change (twist), and then matter cannot manifest itself if before that it manifested itself. <br><br>  Curvature of dimension (change of properties and qualities) of space: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46b/898/aa5/46b898aa5efc9ab1c190406750859d4f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And at the moment, let's deal with matter.  If space is practically and theoretically unlimited and its properties and qualities change continuously, then matter is finite.  The finiteness of matter is due to the fact that it has specific qualities and properties that have their limits and, consequently, are finite.  Space and matter interact with each other, and, the interaction is mutual.  Therefore, when an infinite quantity with continuously changing properties and qualities ‚Äî space ‚Äî interacts with a finite quantity with certain properties and qualities ‚Äî matter ‚Äî their interaction occurs in that region of space where the properties and qualities of space and matter are identical to each other. <br><br>  The merger of two forms of matter in the zone of curvature: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e37/790/597/e377905974a4d9b927e9f79d682e385b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The merging of forms of matter A and B in the zone of curvature of space, and the formation of a substance of type AB  This substance is qualitatively different from the forms of the materials forming it, a new quality arises from the old qualities.  Moreover, the fusion of matter occurs in a limited volume, where the parameters of the forms of matter A and B are identical. <br><br>  And if we assume that there are many types or forms of matter, each of which differs from another by its properties and qualities partially or completely, and these forms of matter "overlap" in space with continuously changing properties and qualities, then the distribution of these free forms of matter will occur space, according to the principle of identity between the properties of space and forms of matter.  There is a process similar to the process of separation of a mixture of liquids having different densities.  Over time, all the mixture fluids will be placed in layers one above the other, more dense liquids (and, consequently, heavier ones) will move down the vessel, and less dense ones (and, therefore, lighter ones) will settle closer to the top.  If enough time passes, then there will be layers of liquids with different densities in one vessel.  And if you dye liquids of different densities in any color, for example, the densest ones dye red, and, as the density of liquids decreases, dye them, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue and violet colors, as a result After the mixture of these liquids with different densities calms down, multi-colored layers of liquids will appear in the vessel in decreasing order of their density - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue and violet. <br>  Liquids with different densities are also matter, having differences only in their one quality, density. <br><br>  It so happened that our Universe, where we live, consists of seven primary matters (matter clearly manifests itself in rainbow and music).  Those.  Above us is the universe of eight forms of matter, and below us of the six forms of matter.  These space-universes form a single system, like a layer cake, each layer of which is qualitatively different from the other.  At the same time, each adjacent layer of this cake has, in its ‚Äúmosaic‚Äù, one substance more or less. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ace/4b7/a52/ace4b7a52acf6f793d794c250958c7b7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  All these layers are in constant motion and interaction with each other.  The result of this interaction between neighboring universes is the appearance of stars and ‚Äúblack holes‚Äù in the contact areas. At the same time, where the space-universe is in contact with another, which has one more substance in its composition, a star appears, and where one less matter - ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/fa9/837/961fa983772e91f8d0e837108e373e9b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Thus, a system of spaces formed by the synthesis of substances of one type is formed.  The type of matter determines the quantization coefficient (separation) of the dimension.  (let's call it Yi).  The coefficient Œ≥i can take very different values.  Even changing it to an insignificant value leads to the fact that the matter of our type cannot merge in the substance (degenerate).  With a different value of Œ≥i, conditions arise for the fusion of matters of a different type, other than this, together.  This leads to the formation of a qualitatively different system of spaces ‚Äî another matrix space is formed.  Each matrix space is non-uniform.  These oscillations of the dimensionality of the matrix space lead to the fact that in some of its regions there is a closure with other matrix spaces that have the same dimensionality in these regions.  There are zones of overflow from the matrix space with one coefficient of dimension Œ≥ into the matrix space with another.  And if, in the case of the formation of stars and ‚Äúblack holes,‚Äù everything was determined only by the amount of matter forming space-universes in the closure zone and, moreover, matter was of the same type, i.e.  were quantized by the dimensionality factor Œ≥, then, when matrix spaces are closed, there are zones of matter flowing with different coefficients Œ≥i, different types of matter that cannot be compatible under any conditions.  In the zone of closure of two matrix spaces, a zone of synthesis of matter of this type may appear, or a zone of decay of these matters.  In one case, a center of formation of space-universes arises with a given type of quantization of the dimension of space, the superanalog of a star. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/684/98f/5d1/68498f5d165fc531d419b293510583cf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  L'1 is the dimension of the first matrix space. <br>  L'2 is the dimension of the second matrix space. <br>  L'12 is the dimension of the zone of closure of matrix spaces. <br>  ŒîL1 is the oscillation range of the dimensionality of the first matrix space. <br>  ŒîL2 is the oscillation range of the dimensionality of the second matrix space. <br>  In another case, a center of decay of space-universes arises with a given type of quantization of the dimension of space (a super analog of the ‚Äúblack hole‚Äù). <br><br>  Over time, the excess concentration becomes critical and begins to interfere with the influx of matter into this zone, which leads to the instability of the dimensionality of this zone.  A super explosion occurs, in which, an excess of synthesized forms of matter is ejected from the zone of closure, and, at the same time, oscillations of dimensionality occur within each of the matrix spaces. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/205/980/4bb205980465952125efbc02d7730a11.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In these zones of internal oscillation of the dimension of the matrix space, the process of formation of spaces-universes begins, from which the systems of spaces-universes (metaverse) are formed in the zones of internal oscillation of the dimension of space. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a0/3c2/736/8a03c2736be3788c8d2ba32e4762b28c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Naturally, the amplitude of the internal oscillation of the dimensionality of the matrix space increases with distance from the zone of closure of the matrix spaces.  And this leads to the fact that in these zones a different number of forms of matter of this type can merge together.  Moreover, the farther from the center of the zone of closure of the matrix spaces, the greater the number of forms of matter can merge and form a substance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1a/cac/6f3/e1acac6f31ffa67d769ab33851fef7bf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  1. The zone where there are no conditions for the fusion of matter. <br>  2. The zone where two forms of matter can merge. <br>  3. The zone where three forms of matter can merge. <br>  4. The area where four forms of matter can merge. <br>  5. The area where five forms of matter can merge. <br>  6. The area where six forms of matter can merge. <br>  7. The zone where seven forms of matter can merge. <br>  8. The zone where eight forms of matter can merge. <br>  9. The area where nine forms of matter can merge. <br>  10. Area of ‚Äã‚Äãclosure of matrix spaces. <br>  11. Metauniverse. <br>  12. Zones of deformation of dimensionality. <br><br>  The two forms of matter merged together, in the first zone from the center, form a metauniverse from one space-universe.  Three merged forms of matter form in the next zone a metaverse from three spaces-universes.  At the confluence of four forms of matter, a metauniverse is formed from seven spaces-universes.  The merger of five, respectively, gives twenty-five.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The merger of six - sixty six. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the confluence of seven - one hundred nineteen, eight - two hundred forty six, nine - four hundred fifty nine spaces-universes, forming the metaverse, in the corresponding zone of internal oscillation of the dimension of the matrix space. The number of possible space-universes included in the meta-universe is determined by the formula for the number of combinations of materials that form the substance of the space-universes. </font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/de0/45d/773de045d9cd24968ae342a74570968a.jpg" alt="image"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1. Zone of heterogeneity of space. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2. Space-universes, which are formed within a single zone of heterogeneity of space. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MnCmn = n! / M! (Nm)! (formula for mathematicians) </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2‚â§m‚â§n</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">where: n - the maximum number of matters of this type of quantization of the dimension, with a quantization coefficient Œ≥i, which form the space-universes in this zone of internal oscillation of the dimension of the matrix space. Most often, the number of space-universes that make up this metauniverse is less than the maximum. And, the farther from the center of the zone of closure of the matrix spaces, the greater the difference between the possible and the actual number of spaces-universes that form this metaverse.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The farther from the center, the more ‚Äúfree places‚Äù. The fact is that the conditions for quantizing the dimensionality of a given zone, the fluctuations of the dimensionality are only necessary conditions for the formation of space-universes. This condition becomes sufficient only when the necessary mass of matter gets into this zone of internal oscillation of the matrix space for the synthesis of these space-universes. Although the mass of matter ‚Äúejected‚Äù from the zone of closure of matrix spaces during a superburst, is a huge, but always finite value. This mass is sufficient for the formation of a finite number of spaces-universes. After a super-explosion, the zone of closure of the matrix spaces decreases, which leads to a decrease in the mass of incoming matter. Over time, this process comes to a certain, balanced level. As a result of a superburst,a system of metaverse universes is formed, which we conditionally call a first-order superspace, which is formed by the merging of nine forms of matter.</font></font><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/82b/dab/4aa/82bdab4aafeeb6ffee05b3435add8259.jpg" alt="image"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1.
