Many who have heard about him - went to twitter.com, read the description, asked themselves the question ‚ÄúAnd I need this?‚Äù And left :) I was not an exception.  After registering, I poked a lot, even tweeted something, found nothing useful for myself and left. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A month after that, I thought.  How so?  If it is so useless - why do so many people use it?  So I began to seriously study this issue. <br><br><h2>  So why? </h2><br>  Spent a little review and ... Eureka!  It turns out there is such a thing as follow.  I have seen it before, but did not give it meaning.  But everything is quite interesting here.  There is a group of interesting people who use Twitter.  They inform each other about their achievements, thoughts, activities, and others can respond to their messages.  But what is great is that you can simply take and gradually join any group! <br><br>  ICQ communication, email correspondence - things where you have to answer, keep up a conversation, etc.

      Twitter does not commit to anything.  You write, who are interested - can answer.  You read - you answer only what is interesting (if you have something to answer). <br><br><h2>  How to join? </h2><br>  To start using twitter, of course, you need to register :), and then follow interesting people. <br><br><h2>  follow? </h2><br>  Twitter has its own terminology.  There are people who receive your updates (followers me / followers) and there are people whose updates you receive (following me). <br><br>  follow will not translate, otherwise it may not be clear. <br><br>  To receive anyone's updates - you need to go to his page and click follow.  To see addressed to someone, you must follow the one who writes and the one who receives :) <br><br><h2>  Where to find interesting people? </h2><br>  If Habr is an interesting community for you and you like people, then many (most of those who are in top rated) have twitter accounts.  You can try your luck and open the page <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter.com</a> (Nickname), for example, <a href="http://twitter.com/bobuk">http://twitter.com/bobuk</a> . <br><br><h2>  I found a couple of interesting people, what next? </h2><br>  Now you can see who they follow + who follow them.  Among these people, you can choose interesting ones (based on their records) and repeat the procedure with new people until it is enough (until you have time to read their updates). <br><br>  After that, some people will follow you, and you can write your messages not only for yourself. <br><br><h2>  Customer </h2><br>  Of course, you can use the web interface (twitter.com), but it is much more convenient to use various twitter clients. <br><br>  I saw them a little, but still recommend: <br><br>  1. Twhirl - client for under Adobe Air.  It seems to be supported in Windows / Mac. <br>  2. TwitterFox - I use it.  This is an extension for Firefox. <br>  3. They also say that TwitBin is good, but I have not tried it.  For example, <a href="http://twitter.com/myVision">myVision</a> uses it. <br><br>  DO NOT recommend: <br><br>  Twitux is a client for Linux.  I did not like at all. <br><br><h2>  Cleaning </h2><br>  Twitter certainly should bring you useful, interesting information, so from time to time you have to get rid of various boring personalities - unfollow them. <br><br>  This was my personal experience using twitter.  Maybe I have not noticed a lot of things, but so much the better. <br><br>  By the way, you can follow <a href="http://twitter.com/mdevils">me</a> :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25183/</a></p>
