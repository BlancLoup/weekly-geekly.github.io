  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Canon mobile printing: direct connection to devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The time has long passed when a smartphone was exclusively a means of communication and entertainment.  Now the mobile device is a full-fledged, or almost fully-fledged, business tool.  And such developments as, for example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/icover/blog/271504">Windows Continuum</a> , the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/289879">latest version of</a> iOS 11 for iPad or <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/287518">DeX technology</a> in the new Samsung Galaxy S8 say that pocket gadgets are becoming a real replacement for desktop PCs and laptops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c9a/d60/235/c9ad60235f614866933c54c0effbb7f3.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, probably, the mobile revolution has not yet happened, but working smartphones and tablets began to be used much more frequently and more efficiently.  Consequently, the paradigm of using printers has changed: the majority of new corporate printers and Canon MFPs support working with mobile solutions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even ordinary smartphones and tablets (especially using external keyboards) have made it possible for us to work productively with text documents and spreadsheets, take notes and make changes to presentations (or create them right on the run), receive and send corporate correspondence, edit photos and work with databases.  However, why are we telling you all this, you already know everything perfectly well.

      However, not so long ago, the use of mobile devices caused big problems with integration into the internal work network.  This and the relatively limited technical capabilities of the printing devices themselves did not allow the use of mobile printing in full - most of the printing tasks still had to be solved through a desktop computer. <br><br>  At the moment, mobile printing technologies have made great strides, including thanks to the efforts of Canon‚Äôs engineers and developers.  Printing the necessary documents from any gadget on an office printer, sometimes even without connecting to the corporate network, in many companies becomes commonplace.  And analysts predict further growth in the mobile printing sector. <br><br><h3>  What can Canon offer for its devices today? </h3><br>  If you try to answer this question in a few words, any scripts for printing on office printers and Canon MFPs from virtually any mobile device.  Thanks to the powerful capabilities of Canon PRINT Business and uniFLOW Mobile Printing, it is no more difficult to implement this scenario than to start printing from your office PC.  In our today's post we will consider the first of them. <br><br><h3>  Canon PRINT Business </h3><br>  Canon PRINT Business technology is supported by most modern printers and MFPs from Canon's imageRUNNER series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/317/228/f5e/317228f5e14d46e28b43722e8ddd6916.jpg"><br><br>  If the tablets or smartphones are on the same network as the printers listed above, their owners will be able to do everything the same as the users of stationary PCs: print, scan, manage the operation of the multifunction printer.  In addition, scanned documents can be immediately sent to an email address. <br><br>  In order to take full advantage of Canon PRINT Business, just install the application of the same name from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Djp.co.canon.oip.android.opal%26hl%3Dru">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/canon-print-business/id576292561%3Fmt%3D8">AppStore</a> .  For devices running on Android, you need to install another component - Canon Print Service (we will tell about it a bit later). <br><br>  After installing the application, the user simply selects the type of connection on the device itself: through the network environment or directly.  In order not to configure the connection manually, QR codes with all settings are displayed in the Canon Mobile devices menu on Canon printers.  In addition, the desired printer can be found through the application itself. <br><br>  To work with documents in the application provides a full file manager.  All that remains for the user is to find the directory containing the documents to print, select the desired file and click "Print". <br><br>  In the preview window that opens, by clicking on the appropriate fields, you can select a different printer, and also set print options, including the number of copies, size, page range, modes ‚Äî color or monochrome, single or double-sided. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bb2/d5e/cbf/bb2d5ecbfee84774b1bc922ead7f2e4b.jpg"><br><br>  For a more detailed print setting that matches all the capabilities of the multifunction printer, the user can log in to a remote user interface, similar to what we see when working from a computer. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMobile‚Äù document scanning is not complete without personal interaction with the printing device, however, it greatly simplifies the process of sending scanned copies to a smartphone or tablet.  One touch of the mobile application (launching the script) and one click on the MFP (launching Scan for Mobile) - and the user receives the document on his mobile device. <br><br>  To interact with the devices running on the Android OS (4.4.2 and above), you can use the Canon Print Service technology already mentioned.  It works through a separate application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.canon.android.printservice.plugin&amp;hl=ru).  Of course, the full set of settings described above for the PCL and PS drivers will not be available, but the most important parameters ‚Äî the number of copies, paper size, sheet orientation, color mode, and the range of pages to be printed for a multi-page document ‚Äî can be set.  The same application will help to print documents and images on devices from other lines of Canon printers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/511/3b9/bb1/5113b9bb122f47bb96f44af6afb9e85e.jpg"><br><br>  Recall also that many models of Canon printers have NFC or Bluetooth LE support.  Therefore, working with them will be even easier and more convenient. <br><br><h3>  AirPrint and Mopria standards support </h3><br>  It's no secret that Apple devices are highly popular with ordinary users.  However, for many organizations, mobile devices and computers from Cupertino are a corporate standard.  The easier it will be for them to set up printing thanks to AirPrint support. <br><br>  Tablets, smartphones or computers from a US manufacturer will automatically receive all network settings and find all printing devices on the network.  Therefore, it will be enough for the user to enter his data once and click the ‚ÄúPrint‚Äù button in the program menu to create a new task.  No additional drivers or programs need to be installed: the print settings will be available in a standardized interface familiar to iOS and macOS users. <br><br>  A similar standard for wireless printing exists for Android devices: most modern gadgets support Mopria technology.  Like many Canon proprietary solutions, it allows mobile technicians to automatically recognize printers within the same Wi-Fi network.  For less modern Android devices or devices that do not support this technology, there is a print service plug-in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.mopria.printplugin%26hl%3Dru">Mopria Print Service</a> .  By installing it from the Google Play app store, the user will get basic print management capabilities on any compatible printing device. <br><br>  In this post, we covered all the possibilities of mobile printing on Canon devices by simply connecting to a wireless network.  In the next article we will talk about the technology uniFLOW Mobile Printing, which will allow you to create print jobs from anywhere in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373759/</a></p>
