  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Our mobile future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The number of models of PDAs, mobile phones and communicators in the world is constantly growing.  Today they must be a kind of all-in-one device.  It would seem that technology and human thought do not stand still - produce and sell.  However, in order for your product to become successful, this is not enough.  As they say, a person "eats" with his eyes. <br><br>  This principle of successful promotion in the market of various mobile gadgets first occurred to Aaron Marcus at the turn of the 70s of the last century.  He was the first to understand that the user interface is the main thing, which requires constant improvement in order for the consumer to receive at least satisfactory, and, as a maximum, a positive experience of using a particular product or service. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After studying physics and philosophy at Princeton, Marcus began studying graphic design as a student at Yale University back in 1966.  Then he began to study programming.  This educational base, coupled with knowledge of the principles of the work of visual means of communication, helped him to become the first professional graphic designer by 1967.  In 1982, Aaron founded Aaron Marcus and Associates, Inc.  (AM + A), which became the first company to specialize in user interface design and information visualization.  In the early 90s, after seeing the future in global computerization and internetization, Marcus‚Äôs company completely switched to design market-oriented projects for companies of all sizes and forms of ownership, including manufacturers of mobile devices and communicators. <br><br>  The basic principle underlying the design of any modern mobile phone or PDA by Aaron Marcus, is the identity of the user, his vision of his own "I".  Imagine that user self-determination is the center of a flower, where petals are a necessary set of functions and capabilities:

      1. Self-improvement.  This will include such parameters as the safety of the device and its impact on health, educational functions and the so-called ‚Äúactive lifestyle assistant‚Äù (various built-in stopwatches, calorie counters, etc.). <br>  2. Relationships  These are ways to communicate with strangers (number identifier), friends (SMS, MMS) and society. <br>  3. Entertainment, which includes games and multimedia. <br>  4.Business.  The ability to use the gadget for business purposes. <br>  5.Information.  The device must be a means of obtaining various types of information: reference, organizational, business. <br><br>  It was this functional set that formed the basis for the development of a new generation Mob-I mobile device for Samsung.  As part of this project, a study was conducted of users and how they use not only the mobile phones and handhelds themselves, but also stickers and paper to write notes.  The main task was to create a smartphone, convenient for both the student and the minister.  The product was supposed to ‚Äúmake‚Äù a personal long-term relationship with the user, become his loyal friend and helper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f8d/602/4e6/f8d6024e6efe095d6b737a843fd0704d.jpg" width="185" height="298" alt="Samsung" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The design specification describes the device as easy to handle through adaptive menus.  It is able to respond to the natural behavior of man and is always aware of his whereabouts.  The result of the project was the prototype device shown in the figure on the left. <br><br>  The finished prototype was presented to Samsung.  It allowed potential users to see smartphone features such as receiving an electronic coupon when entering the supermarket or displaying calls depending on location.  The device has features such as compiling a list of instructions through voice commands and creating notes during a telephone conversation instead of your favorite yellow stickers. <br><br>  Considering the previous experience of studying user behavior and own developments, Aaron Marcus sees the mobile device of the future with the following set of essential attributes and characteristics: <br><br>  1. Today, the number of languages ‚Äã‚Äãactively used by users is 37, and it continues to grow.  So in the near future, the usual PDA will be able to write a message not only in the usual English or German, but also try Arabic script or Korean characters. <br>  2. The main requirements for a new generation of devices are their mobility, the ability to be both a working tool and entertainment. <br>  3. The device should support at least such technologies as: GPS, SMS, WAP, Bluetooth, GPRS, MMS. <br>  4. Globalization of the interface and the use of information and visual standards.  That is, the interface of any communicator should be clear to both the Chukchi from the Far North and the Bedouin from the deserts of Arabia. <br>  5. How often we run around the office in search of a charger just for the Nokia n-th model! .. The mobile phone of the future will be able to use different power systems. <br><br>  In February, Aaron Marcus, a real guru of everything connected with the development of user-oriented interfaces, thanks to the Edu-itonline training center, will visit Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kiev with author's seminars.  In three capitals, he will talk about current trends in user interface design, research results of mobile phone users, and will reveal 12 myths about mobile interfaces.  As always, Aaron will provide his speech with many examples from personal experience and colorful presentations. <br><br>  You can learn more detailed information and submit an application for attending seminars on the site <a href="http://www.edu.it-online.ru/education/guru-academy/marcus/%3Futm_source%3DHabr%26utm_medium%3DMobile">Edu) itonline.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18164/</a></p>
