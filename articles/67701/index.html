      We would like to clarify the previous answer given to you.  Having such an opportunity for ASUS clients in fulfilling all the necessary procedural conditions is an undoubted part of the ASUS policy. <br><br>  All details of the return procedure itself are available on our official website: <a href="http://support.asus.com/service/service.aspx%3Fno%3D575%26SLanguage%3Dru-ru">http://support.asus.com/service/service.aspx?no=575&amp;SLanguage=en-ru</a> <br><br>  If during your previous appeal you did not receive a response that corresponds to our policy described on our official website, and this question is still relevant for you, please contact us. <br><br>  We will offer the most convenient solution for this issue. <br><br>  Thank! <br><br>  And we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused. <br><br>  Best Regards, <br>  Service Quality Audit Manager <br>  ASUS Technology PTE.  Limited <br>  <a href="http://support.asus.com/">support.asus.com</a> <br></blockquote><br>  It pleasantly surprised me - I submitted this request a year ago.  So I decided to share this information with you. <br>  Clicking on the link in the letter you can download documents for the implementation of this operation, as well as find out how much you really get back for one or another version of Microsoft Windows. <br><br>  For those who just want to be, here are the extracts from the documents: <br>  <b>How much money will be returned?</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  List of license types </th><th>  Refund amount </th></tr><tr><td>  License Windows Vista OEM (Home basic) Russian version </td><td>  $ 20 </td></tr><tr><td>  License Windows Vista OEM (Home Premium) Russian version </td><td>  $ 33 </td></tr><tr><td>  License Windows Vista OEM (Business) </td><td>  $ 48 </td></tr><tr><td>  License Windows Vista OEM (Ultimate) </td><td>  $ 77 </td></tr><tr><td>  Windows XP Home Edition ULCPC Russian </td><td>  $ 6 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Conditions</b> : <br><ol><li>  Request a refund of the cost of the Operating System is possible, provided that ASUS products are purchased in Russia.  At the same time, the consumer presents: a copy of the invoice indicating the amount paid for the ASUS product, the recovery disk from the delivery, the ASUS product (for withdrawal of the COA Certificate of Authenticity Label) and the completed application (Appendix 1). </li><li>  The application is accepted for consideration by an authorized service center when it is submitted by the user <b>no later than seven days from the date of purchase of ASUS products</b> and only in the country of purchase of the products, subject to the return of the components required to return the cost. </li><li>  The refund application of the Operating System will be rejected under the following conditions: <br>  a.  The user has already registered an installed copy of the software with Microsoft. <br>  b.  Certificate of Authenticity (COA) label is damaged. <br>  c.  The recovery disc is opened or the integrity of its packaging is broken. <br>  d.  There are no documents confirming the date of purchase, or the seven-day period has elapsed since the acquisition of ASUS products. <br></li><li>  The user agrees not to use Microsoft Windows afterwards without acquiring the appropriate rights. </li><li>  ASUS will not provide support / warranty for self-installed software. </li><li>  ASUS is not responsible for the self-installed software and its compatibility with hardware. </li></ol><br>  <b>Procedure</b> : <br><ol><li>  The user needs to contact an authorized ASUS service center and provide the above documents and the device itself to remove the Operating System and COA label from it. </li><li>  After carrying out the operation of deleting the Operating System and the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) Label by an authorized service center, an authorized authorized service center reimburses the user for the pre-installed Operating System </li></ol><br><br>  Probably, they do it with <a href="http://www.fas.gov.ru/news/n_24601.shtml">reluctance</a> , but I still respect the company, which after so much time still respond to the user's request.  Yes, and can return the money for the pre-installed OS. <br>  I think it's worth trying :) although the money is not that big for ‚Äúmy‚Äù Windows ($ 33).  It remains only to find a service center in my city and deal with the item highlighted in bold type.
