Such major players as AWS, Microsoft, IBM, HP, Oracle, as well as many small data centers and providers of managed IT services are already operating in the South-East Asia cloud technology market.  Recently, Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud were created in Singapore to attract customers from Southeast Asia.

      ‚ÄúWith Alibaba and Google entering the cloud storage market, IT managers will get a wider choice of services, and this is beneficial for those companies that are able to develop a cloud model, whether it‚Äôs full company immersion into the cloud or the introduction of a hybrid cloud model,‚Äù said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-scurfield-751474">Rick Scarfield</a> , president of NetApp APAC. <br><br>  According to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-cocks-0380711">Andy Cox</a> , technical director at Dimension Data Asia Pacific, the entry of cloud storage providers into the region‚Äôs market will most affect small and medium-sized enterprises.  ‚ÄúLooking at some of the leading suppliers of traditional data warehouses in the market, one can see that their growth is limited by the market, and the number is rather small,‚Äù he noted.  ‚ÄúThe transition to cloud, hyper-scale vendors such as Amazon and Microsoft Azure, as well as new market participants such as Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud, will have a significant impact on small and medium enterprises.‚Äù <br><br>  Cox suggested that a full transition to cloud data warehouses is generally considered too risky for industrial enterprises because of critical applications or sensitive information, such as in the financial sector, health care, or the public sector, as well as concerns security and lack of data independence associated with cloud platforms. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn this regard, small and medium-sized enterprises will mainly move to storing data in the cloud, especially after there are more new applications in the cloud,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúFor example, start-up companies use the services of cloud providers to run their applications without the need for infrastructure.‚Äù <br><br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-serrano-2864721">Paul Serrano</a> , chief propaganda specialist at Nutanix (Asia, Pacific Countries and Japan), said: ‚ÄúSince in 2017, the information technology departments of enterprises will evaluate open access cloud solutions and in the field, they will probably conclude that open access solutions are better suited for flexible workloads, that is, loads with no specific requirements. ‚Äù  But, according to him, for many companies, the transition to the cloud open access solution may be premature. <br><br>  According to <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3FcontainerId%3DPRF004164">Prabhitha Shithal Dkruz</a> , a senior market analyst who conducted research at IDC, organizations in Asia / the Pacific and Southeast Asia are not rapidly moving to cloud technologies.  ‚ÄúOrganizations in Southeast Asia are taking cloud technologies rather slowly,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúThe market for Southeast Asia is less developed, and its conservatism has so far limited the introduction of AWS, Google, and Azure companies, mainly by their individual work operations, and local cloud providers should further increase their potential to the level at which they will be adopted. large enterprises. <br>  But according to Dkruz, with the entry of companies such as Alibaba Cloud and Google Cloud to the market, customers will move a permanent, secondary workload to the cloud infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  Alibaba has succeeded in China </h3><br>  In accordance with the semi-annual IDC analysis of the public cloud environment in the first half of 2016, Alibaba became the second leading cloud service provider in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan), overtaking Microsoft and Google.  "However, Alibaba‚Äôs success is limited to China, and the absence of a vast partner ecosystem outside of China means that the company will not have a significant impact on the market, except for the impact on Chinese companies operating outside of China and companies in Southeast Asia operating in China - noted Dkruz.  - The realities of the corporate market have pushed Alibaba into the background along with its partners, which occupy a leading position in joint activities.  In order to gain corporate market trust, Alibaba needs to build a partner ecosystem to match its competitors. ‚Äù <br><br>  But <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishchal-khorana-7299044">Nishchal Khorana</a> , director of cloud technologies and a data center in the Asia-Pacific region of Frost &amp; Sullivan, does not see such limited prospects for Alibaba Cloud.  ‚ÄúFrom a long-term perspective, it is important to note that the cloud data storage market in the countries of Southeast Asia is very sensitive to the price of securities, allowing Alibaba Cloud to act as the main supplier in the region, given its aggressive pricing strategy,‚Äù he said. . <br><br>  However, according to Khoran, it will take some time before Alibaba Cloud succeeds.  ‚ÄúIndonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines are fast growing cloud infrastructure markets in Southeast Asia with infrastructure as a market service, which is projected to grow from 40 to 50% per year from 2015 to 2022.  While Alibaba Cloud and Google are in a favorable position to exploit the growth of cloud storage markets, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure will hold a leading position in the near future due to their steady presence. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Will the market for traditional storage systems decrease? <br></h3><br>  According to Khoran, the growth of traditional data storage systems will decline as cloud models strengthen with increasing focus on enterprise security, and enterprises will gradually move to an individual, publicly accessible cloud or hybrid IT model. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn general, the traditional data storage market will remain relatively stable, with no significant decrease over the coming years,‚Äù said Cox, Dimension Data. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-woo-b510b577">James Woo</a> , director of information technology at Farrer Park, a real estate company in the health care and hospitality industry, said: ‚ÄúI doubt that the traditional data storage market will decrease, as organizations will need time to reorganize their infrastructure to work with cloud data warehouses.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Transition to a hybrid model </h3><br>  According to Dkruz from IDC, organizations in South-East Asia are still "in unplanned stages of development of the IDC structure depending on the situation."  She added that the heterogeneous state of the Asian region means that not all countries will follow the same pattern; some countries may be faster than others to make cloud storage solutions for more complex use cases. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe current cloud adoption system is limited to backup, data protection or disaster recovery,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúWith a large number of features and attractive prices, cloud storage can be a tempting proposition for many organizations, but different legislative, cultural, and political implications make cloud computing unprofitable for governments in Southeast Asia that promote internal cloud solutions.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330966/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330966/</a></p>
