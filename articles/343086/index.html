Partial allocation of roles </h4><br>  A familiar programmer is now in search of work.  He regularly attends interviews and shares his impressions: <br><br>  <i>- How is the average process of hiring a technical employee now?</i>  <i>Yes, just like in the 18th century - on paper.</i>  <i>Only then did the manufacturer and the engineer discuss business exclusively, while modern IT companies copy elements of Google-style HR and at the interview offer tasks about spherical horses in a vacuum, trying to create a spiritual noise environment.</i>  <i>This fashion trend is especially sad in HR.</i>  <i>And before that there was a fashion for NoSQL, when the ‚Äúmonolith of SQL Server‚Äù became almost a dirty word.</i>  <i>Bad trend.</i>  <i>Need to save the industry!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Of course it is necessary.</i>  <i>Monolith saved without us.</i>  <i>We will save the business process of hiring staff in IT.</i>  <i>Are you a fan user?</i>  <i>Let's pay tribute to the professional respect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Wiegers">Karl Wigs</a> .</i> <i>

    </i>  <i>- Of course I will.</i>  <i>And you - you will be a business analyst, reengineering this business process.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- That's agreed.</i>  <i>I like interesting interesting analytical tasks.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>- Who does not love them.</i> <br><br><h4>  Identification and prioritization of business process goals </h4><br>  <u>The purpose of hiring</u> is to find an employee who is able to most effectively solve the company's current tasks within its technological stack.  <u>The goal</u> is to minimize costs. <br>  <u>Note:</u> in a significant part of organizations, the sub-goal is mistakenly put in the first place, focusing on automating the work of an HR specialist and raising his qualifications. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  AS-IS Scenario (ideal) </h4><br>  A resume is sent to an HR specialist: it finds it on its own, the robot finds it, the candidates send it.  If HR sees keywords, it sends a resume to a manager.  The head gives the go-ahead, HR agrees with the candidate about an in-person interview.  In-person interview: manager, lead programmer, HR, candidate.  1 hour.  The decision on the outcome of the conversation. <br>  <u>Clarification:</u> such a wide range of interviewers at interviews is rare - after all, Agile principles are actively beginning to be used beyond the boundaries of development. <br><br>  The main disadvantages of the current functioning of the business process: a large percentage of false positives (interviews without recruitment), a lot of time and qualification efforts of the staff conducting the selection. <br><br>  <i>User fan: ‚ÄúImpromptu in engineering is good during brainstorming.</i>  <i>And then the interview on the quiz seems.</i>  <i>Question answer.</i>  <i>Question answer.</i>  <i>Some difficult-high incomprehensible goal put the interviewers, testing engineers in such fantastic conditions.</i>  <i>As if astronauts choose.</i>  <i>For thoughtful, painstaking work, which makes up the bulk of the engineer‚Äôs tasks, we need slightly different skills.</i>  <i>Vector shot down.</i>  <i>Well, what useful interlocutor wants to know about the candidate, asking the question: "What is i +++++++++ 1?".</i> <br><br><h4>  Logical Investigations </h4><br>  To achieve the main goal of the business process, it is necessary for the candidate to identify the presence of practical skills in the core (key - at the discretion of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">decision maker</a> ) areas of the company's technological stack.  In my opinion, the most effective thing is to issue a test task covering the fragment of the technological stack formed above.  The complexity of the tasks is commensurate with the current technical tasks of the company.  By the result of the execution, you can immediately estimate with good accuracy how much value a candidate can create right now. <br>  The presence of a test task also reduces the requirement for the qualifications of HR and technical specialists conducting the interview.  In my opinion, a sufficient level - one technical specialist of an average link. <br><br>  <i>User fan: ‚ÄúOoo, here's what you need!</i>  <i>Simple and functional.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Business analyst: ‚ÄúWait, I haven't finished yet.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Fan User:?!</i> <br><br><h4>  Scenario TO-BE (ideal) </h4><br>  After a brief phone call, HR sends the candidate a test task.  The candidate fulfills it and sends the result.  A company technician checks it (15 minutes).  If you approve, then HR invites the candidate for an in-person interview with a middle-level technical specialist. <br><br>  Scenario interview: <br><br><ul><li>  discuss the result of the test task (15 minutes); </li><li>  impromptu task: similar subjects, but from the current tasks of the enterprise, provide 15 minutes of silence; </li><li>  discuss ideas and ideas on impromptu (15 minutes). </li></ul><br>  Total - in one hour one technical specialist of an average link will make a decision of good quality.  And the candidate is already a bit in the production process. <br><br><h4>  Investment, income, risks </h4><br>  I estimate investments in implementation in one hour of work of a mid-level specialist - on the development of test tasks. <br><br>  I believe that the TO-BE business process is more efficient in the light of the main goal and sub-goals compared to AS-IS.  Achieving the sub-goal is a side effect, which is doubly pleasant. <br>  According to the results of the introduction of a new version of the business process, there is the potential to reduce the time to complete tasks and their range for both company specialists. <br><br>  Risks of not implementing: <br><br><ul><li>  competitors will bypass, find employees faster and create more value; </li><li>  A company with increased hiring times for new employees generates lost profits on several fronts. </li></ul><br>  <i>User fan: ‚ÄúI have no words, cool.</i>  <i>Like Sherlock Holmes - the case for one pipe.</i>  <i>Well done!"</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Business analyst: ‚ÄúYes, we are great.</i>  <i>But the main thing is to bring the idea to the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE,_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">decision makers</a> .</i>  <i>It would be possible to introduce somewhere else - an interesting task.</i>  <i>After all, this is only a skeleton, I still have a few ideas.</i>  <i>Listen, HR is not needed here at all, it can be replaced ... "</i> <br><br>  <b>The exact formulation of the goal brings the automation nirvana closer.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343086/</a></p>
