Someone has moved, someone periodically comes on business trips - but, in one way or another, the cadres of the Russian Internet market are growing Novosibirsk.  Today I want to continue the format of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2520%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8/">thematic hubstreams</a> online, and talk about one useful project in an interview with its creator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96e/60c/258/96e60c2585bd5bd8dc08b6af505aa46d.jpg"><br><br>  Habr reads a lot of Muscovites, and most of them - Muscovites are not by birth, and like all newcomers, we are faced with the fact that sometimes there is simply nowhere to go and nothing to do other than work.  It is not surprising that the newcomer also tried to give an answer to this problem - the founder of the service of organizing thematic meetings of the <b><a href="http://aloha-club.ru/">Aloha Club</a></b> Vladislav Larionov.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>- Hello, Vlad.</b>  <b>Tell me first, who are the founders of the project, at whose expense is it supported?</b> <br>  - Hello.  The founder is me, Vlad Larionov, I am 21 years old.  The site is funded with our money. <br><br>  <b>- Ours are whose ones exactly?</b> <br>  - My own.  Initially, I spent about 20,000 rubles on promotion.  The main part of users came on the advice of friends. <br><br>  <b>- This money went to the development?</b> <br>  - No, my good friend from the Novosibirsk Academgorodok was developing the site.  The money went to a small banner advertising in VKontakte.  In April, we had the highest rates - 1800 offline visits to our meetings per month.  While the record is not broken. <br><br>  <b>- How did the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãAloha?</b> <br>  - The idea came at a time when I felt that I had fallen out of my usual society, since I moved from Novosibirsk to Moscow.  After that, I decided to make a tool with the help of which any person who has become detached from society could come every evening in Moscow to a place where you would be happy and where, at the same time, you can do your favorite thing - play chess, speak English, discuss movies and so on. <br><br>  <b>- Well, and how, the features of this site were useful to you personally?</b>  <b>Do you go to Aloha events?</b> <br>  - On Aloha, I found people dear to me, as I still manage to preserve some of the quality of meetings and the audience.  For example, the most popular meetings now are neither ‚Äúgoing to the club‚Äù, but, for example, a ‚Äúmeeting of business ideas‚Äù or a ‚ÄúFrench cinema meeting‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>- How do you earn / plan to earn?</b> <br>  - On the commission from the organization of paid events - if you want to place a paid event, then pay us the price of one ticket, regardless of how many people come.  I also plan to make money from coffee shops and other places where meetings are held.  In a month we have about 1,000 visits in Moscow, we can bring this audience to some specific coffee shops. <br><br>  <b>- Are there plans to expand to go beyond Moscow?</b> <br>  - There are ambitions, but the quality of the meetings falls without direct control, so for now attempts to open a branch in St. Petersburg and Kiev have not been crowned with success.  Looking for reliable people in the field.  We have, so to say, an online offline business. <br><br>  <b>- It is clear why take part in such meetings.</b>  <b>However, the whole movement on the site is, by and large, tied to those who initiate these meetings.</b>  <b>But why become the leader - the topic is not disclosed, what should be the motivation of the user?</b> <br>  - I met the following motivations of the leading a) leadership training;  b) love to be the center of attention;  c) they want to interest people with what they do themselves;  d) want to open their courses / trainings in the future. <br><br>  <b>- Yes, it seems to be true :) I myself organize meetings of the format that you describe.</b>  <b>I found places, collected people, negotiated with the administration, etc.</b>  <b>Tell me, as an independent organizer, why should I use your service next time?</b> <br>  - We have an audience, we have a base of places where you can hold meetings (you will see this when you open the meeting), after the meeting you will be overwhelmed with assessments and anonymous comments that will allow you to analyze yourself and your actions.  Karma is given to people only after filling out online questionnaires after meetings on the site. <br><br>  <b>- You insist that a certain person should be responsible for each event.</b>  <b>Why not introduce the concept of ‚Äúinstitution‚Äù when meetings are organized not by a specific person, but by a bar, restaurant, museum?</b> <br>  - The psychology is such that when two people answer, no one answers. <br><br>  <b>- I had in mind a little different, in any institution there is always a responsible person - the administrator, manager, director.</b>  <b>Nobody knows their names, but they exist.</b>  <b>They could use "Aloha" to create events like "The bookstore is such and such invites ..."</b> <br>  - This is our plan.  We are now concentrating precisely on meetings that guys hold for the soul, not for money, but we plan to aggregate events of major players in the future, such as afisha.ru, as well as from specialized resources such as events at Habr√©.  In fact, all these types of events (concerts, get-togethers, dates) solve the same problem, and we will gradually deal with other types of events.  Now I have begun work on the mydaytrack.com service, which, in its own way, also solves the problem of organizing shared time spending. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄîWhat are your future plans?</b>  <b>Are you going to move on the social network, make mobile applications, for example?</b> <br>  - Just made an <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/app2699318">application for VKontakte</a> , but it needs to be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>- Who are your competitors?</b>  <b>What are the prospects of this market, in your opinion?</b> <br>  - Privacy in megacities increases, so that the audience increases.  American equivalent (although there are many fundamental differences between us) - meetup.com <br><br>  <b>- What are these differences?</b> <br>  - We have everything under our brand, and we also have an important gaming component - ‚Äúkarma‚Äù, which people affix to each other in questionnaires after they come home from meetings.  It delays =) <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúFrom the Russian analogs of <a href="http://aloha-club.ru/">aloha-club.ru</a> known to me, I know <a href="http://www.edimgovorim.ru/">www.edimgovorim.ru</a> - what do you think about this project?</b> <br>  - Maybe something will come out for them, but the future is not behind this.  People increasingly need spontaneity.  Many interesting meeting and dating services are based on Foursquare, the future in geo services, in which everything will happen on the fly. <br><br>  <b>- No plans to attract investment, participation in start-up events?</b>  <b>What does the project need now for growth?</b> <br>  - We participated in StartupPoint and won, we found the same enthusiastic people.  So far, I‚Äôm not sure which way is best to develop the project, but I don‚Äôt want to make another plank of events, I want to create a ‚Äúmoving house‚Äù on my own. <br><br>  <b>- OK thanks.</b>  <b>Perhaps there is something more important that you would like to add?</b> <br>  - At some stage, we had a burning issue with premises for holding meetings in Moscow and other cities where the club had branches.  The issue of renting is very unpleasant for Moscow.  I want to see more development in this direction and I want to see in the future at Aloha their own places where you can chat, meet, listen to training, etc. <br><br>  <b>- And finally, what do you expect from this publication on Habr√©?</b> <br>  - Aloha has spawned many interesting clubs in Moscow, organizations that are currently engaged in this or that interaction of people offline (hustle, mafia, speed dating).  Get connected! <br><br>  <a href="http://aloha-club.ru/aloha_events/">Upcoming events Aloha</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS</b> This is an experimental format for stories about interesting projects in the form of interviews.  Write whether to continue. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> And tomorrow - the next, twelfth already, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/137400/">Moscow habrestrecha</a> .  There will be an opportunity to talk with Vlad and present their own projects.  Come on in! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137226/</a></p>
