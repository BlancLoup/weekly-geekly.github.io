  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fund</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are people with interesting projects, but the problem is that it is very difficult to find funding for them, because the investor needs a so-called exit with a profit and as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, nowadays, a strategy to make projects for the mass consumer is very popular, when there is a high probability of recouping costs.  Making projects for a narrow group of users is not profitable and few people will agree to invest them.  There are examples when original and interesting projects could not recoup the costs.  And in the end, either they were reincarnated for the mass consumer, or they completely fell into the abyss. <br><br>  I have long thought about these problems and came to the conclusion that you can try to solve them by creating a fund for each project.  In two weeks I sketched the implementation, under the wing of GetDone, but then somehow I didn‚Äôt have time to write about it.  But now it has appeared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fund is designed to find authors and teams with interesting ideas and raising money for their implementation.  Profit from the project is put on the last place, and even in all is not required.  When you finance a project you like, then consider how to pre-order a disc that will last a year or more / less.  Including with the probability of being lost on delivery ... <br><br>  The goal will appear not to chop up as much dough as possible from the mass consumer.  And create an interesting product for a narrow group of users.  Let's skip off and get, for example, more games at a level similar to Fallout even if it is more expensive than for a mass player, albeit without cool 3D effects, but in the end it will be interesting to play.  Or simple programs created for specific users, not overloaded with functionality with the desire to cover as much of the market as possible (I was horrified when I put the latest version of Nero on my brother ...).

      We will choose for ourselves what to finance and what not.  Based not on how much the project chops up the dough, but on its interestingness and usefulness for us.  And we ourselves will direct the development of the project, actively participating in its development - from advice, to helping the authors with some resources. <br><br>  If you publish your project for financing, register on <a href="http://getdone.ru/">getdone.ru</a> and <a href="http://getdone.ru/fund/form/project/new">create a project</a> .  Describe in detail what you want to do, current developments in this area, and what you are (you can do this in the profile and portfolio of a freelancer).  If you are a team, register the team and create a project on behalf of the team.  At a minimum, we need to describe the first stage of development, for complex projects there should be at least two (demo version and release).  Next, send the draft from draft to moderation, where we will discuss it and eventually decide on the publication of funding. <br><br>  In-time and after moderation, you can create a vote in which registered users can take part, or only those who financed the project. <br><br>  All transfers go to my WebMoney (through ROBOXchange.com) or a bank account, and developers will receive money through me, without commission.  However, if you want to directly transfer money to the developers, use the ‚ÄúOther‚Äù payment method on the project funding form. <br><br>  I will try to provide additional support for projects in the fund that have reached the funding stage.  Advise on creating a web representation for user feedback.  Throw some ideas.  I will launch advertising in communities and forums (this is still in development). <br><br>  No need to criticize the implementation much - it was done on the knee in two weeks.  When I bring this idea to people, when there are authors with interesting and real projects, then in a short time the qualitative implementation will be made and the project will be released for independent sailing from under the wing of GetDone.  I also wonder how people will accept it, maybe I will give up everything and take it right there for the new implementation. <br><br>  Do not remain indifferent if you also like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa foundation.  Post a link to this text where you see fit.  Give the link to people who want to make a project, but cannot find investors or simply decide to take the first step.  And just help me to work on the foundation, if you have free time for this. <br><br>  Let's decide for ourselves what has the right to life and what is not, without giving these important decisions to the incubators and investors? <br><br>  PS With the coming of you :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48220/</a></p>
