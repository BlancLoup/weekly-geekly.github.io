Acquaintance will take place on the example of comparison with the currently popular <b>Role-based access control</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When a company consists of one person, there are no internal secrets in it.  The only employee available to any actions and any information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6d/0c9/0fe/a6d0c90fe4f24ac28dc8f96bd93bb0e1.png"><br><br>  If the company is successful and the volume of work grows, then a moment comes when one person stops cope.  And then new employees are hired at the company.

There are several approaches to its solution, but the most common today received control based on roles (role-based access control, RBAC). <br><br><h2>  Role-based access control (RBAC) </h2><br>  The essence of the approach is to create roles that repeat business roles in the company, and assign them to users.  Based on these roles, the ability of the user to perform an action is checked. <br><br>  If business rules are one-dimensional and all actions can be broken down by roles (accountant, manager, administrator, etc.), this approach will be sufficient.  Then one role will correspond to one business rule. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/eea/eb3/9c3eeaeb31264bf9ba8195f4eb1e705e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e56/b1b/131/e56b1b131fbd40778880deddcae6b976.png"><br><br>  But business rules are inevitably complicated and become multidimensional.  This leads to the fact that one attribute (role) for expressing business rules becomes insufficient and other attributes (city, country, branch, day of the week, owner, limit, etc.) are added. <br><br>  To cope with this complexity, it is necessary to create additional roles, the number of which is equal to the number of different combinations of all attributes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/087/ac1/41f/087ac141f2a54a218d421a2d08ed888d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6b/e82/880/b6be82880b7f4f5bb438c07f4a946800.png"><br><br>  Each time you add a new attribute value, you will have to add new roles.  That is, if a branch ‚ÄúG‚Äù appears, you will have to add new roles, such as ‚ÄúAdministrator of branch‚Äú G ‚Äù,‚Äú Manager of branch ‚ÄúG‚Äù, ‚ÄúAccountant of branch‚Äú G ‚Äù, etc., then assign all new employees to all roles  All this gives rise to a lot of routine manual labor. <br><br>  In addition, there are other problems: <br><br><ul><li>  one business rule is ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù among many roles and becomes unobvious, which complicates the understanding of such a rule and its support; </li><li>  the explosive growth of the number of roles begins, which makes it much more difficult to manage them. </li></ul><br>  And business rules that use attributes whose values ‚Äã‚Äãare not known in advance and are calculated in the course of work cannot be expressed in general using a role model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e08/b59/225/e08b59225d394d6bbc7ad17cc9f7af6e.png"><br><br>  There are also business rules that restrict access not to actions, but to data.  Such business rules are also impossible to express using the role model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/456/384/360/4563843604c74c35b453c260791031ae.png"><br><br>  To implement support for such business rules, you will have to use other tools, which only increases the cost and complexity of implementing and maintaining an access control system.  It turns out that as soon as business rules become multidimensional or require data control, the role model not only does not solve the current problems of access control, but also creates new ones. <br><br><h2>  Attribute-based access control (ABAC) </h2><br>  To cope with unsolvable problems within RBAC, another approach was created based on attributes. <br>  The main difference of this approach is that each situation is evaluated not from the point of view of the user's role and the action he wants to perform, but from the point of view of the attributes that relate to them. <br><br>  A business rule is essentially a set of conditions in which various attributes must satisfy their requirements. <br><br>  You can explicitly select several categories of attributes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a8/5c7/03b/9a85c703b2834ba696f2c47d38819d11.png"><br><br>  To perform the authorization, the values ‚Äã‚Äãof all attributes are taken at the time of the rights check and compared with the expected values.  Fulfillment of all conditions provides access to the resource. <br><br>  Simple rules are described by simple terms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e9/034/2a8/5e90342a8c8d49ee86a90e85be333baf.png"><br><br>  Multidimensional rules in this model do not become more complex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1cb/49f/e1a/1cb49fe1ac844c0bb3782538d7643f22.png"><br><br>  When adding new attribute values, the conditions of the business rule will not change.  That is, if a branch ‚ÄúG‚Äù appears, there is no need to change anything in the business rule.  All that is required is to add to the necessary employees the value of the attribute ‚ÄúBranch‚Äù - ‚ÄúBranch‚Äú G ‚Äù. <br><br>  Thus, ABAC avoids the problems that appear in RBAC: <br><br><ul><li>  the business rule is not ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù on the system, which makes its understanding and support quite simple; </li><li>  there is no explosive growth in the number of conditions, which simplifies their maintenance. </li></ul><br>  But most importantly, ABAC solves problems that cannot be solved with RBAC, since there are no restrictions on the complexity of business rules in this approach.  Business rules of any complexity, including the use of previously unknown attributes, do not create new problems and are simple to maintain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0c/5f1/bf2/c0c5f1bf268e42e99048fcc7d4e2da17.png"><br><br>  It is convenient to use business rule views as a set of conditions for filtering data.  Some of the conditions can be calculated even before accessing the resource, and the remaining conditions become a filter for selecting data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ad/5a7/a38/7ad5a7a3820340a39a1a7b3e7486b197.png"><br><br>  The first three conditions can be checked before accessing the data.  And the last condition can be used as a predicate to get only authorized data. <br><br><h2>  ABAC versus RBAC </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2b/fb8/e3b/d2bfb8e3b9f448f482ddb49e6fab796f.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the comparison, RBAC is well suited only for implementing simple business rules.  With the increasing complexity of the rules, the expediency of using RBAC decreases due to the growing cost of supporting the access control system, and starting from a certain level of complexity of the rules, this approach does not work at all. <br><br>  ABAC, in turn, does not limit the complexity of business rules.  Thanks to a more comprehensible business and compact expression, this approach allows not to increase the cost of support when implementing more complex rules, and also makes it possible to provide access control not only to actions, but also to data. <br><br>  PS: Today for ABAC there is a standard XACML, which is actively developed and used.
