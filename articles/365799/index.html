And today we will talk about <b>cashback</b> . <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/banderolka/blog/253446/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/012/1c2/62e/0121c262eadd4da5afba02e917ee0d50.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Cashback in English - refund.  Actually, the whole point is precisely this - you just get back some of the money for the purchase.  To do this, you do not need to do something special - just go to the online store for the link special aggregator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most popular cashback sites:

    <ol><li>  <a href="http://www.mrrebates.com/%3Frefid%3D441983">Mr.Rebates</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://www.ebates.com/rf.do%3Freferrerid%3D7Cvnl5s5xSJ15%252Fhe0tM7qA%253D%253D%26eeid%3D26471">Ebates</a> <br></li></ol><br>  In addition to them, there are other services, but in this article we will discuss exactly these two giants.  Ebates, by the way, has already entered the Russian market, so now we can safely consider both the Russian version of the site <a href="http://www.ebates.ru/referrer%3Freferrerid%3DMih44SJbLwE%253D%250D%250A">ebates.ru</a> and the American <a href="http://www.ebates.com/rf.do%3Freferrerid%3D7Cvnl5s5xSJ15%252Fhe0tM7qA%253D%253D%26eeid%3D26471">ebates.com</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff8300">What is the catch and why does someone voluntarily return the money?</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82a/ea8/b00/82aea8b005c7bb93ba2ea06486a91d23.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In short, the head of everything here is marketing, or rather that its area where shops, in order to increase sales, pay money to attract new customers to their partners ( <em>in this case, cashback services</em> ).  Thus, sites like rebates and ebates earn money by telling you about the best deals, coupons and discounts.  And if you make a purchase in a store due to their recommendation, they receive their reward.  Well, so that you do it systematically, and even were grateful, they share part of the reward with you. <br><br>  Therefore, the scheme here is completely simple and transparent: went to Ebates&gt; found the store you want with a certain percentage of cashback&gt; switched to it from the Ebates site&gt; bought what they wanted&gt; the store received its reward and shared it with you.  This is what cashback looks like, if you really explain it on your fingers. <br><br>  Profitable?  Of course.  But for some reason they use it criminally little, while the interest return is sometimes very serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fa/88e/c6a/2fa88ec6a5964e4fb5cd831fa37ec41a.png"><br><br>  Please note that cashback is valid for all products ( <em>unless otherwise indicated in the conditions</em> ): new, old and even discount! <br><br>  An illustrative example that we usually cite when talking about cashback: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Here we take the cool sports store Backcountry, which also accepts Russian cards, and sends goods to the addresses of mailforwarders without any problems.</i>  <i>In it, you will always find a good assortment of legendary Canadian down jackets Canada Goose.</i>  <i>For them, for a minute, according to the manufacturer, there are no discounts (unless the store becomes generous on its own initiative).</i>  <i>And there are these jackets decently: in the region of 700-900 dollars.</i>  <i>And if you bought such a down jacket today, you would save 70-90 dollars, even though ‚Äúthere are no discounts for these down jackets‚Äù.</i>  <i>And all because Ebates today returns 10% from any purchase on BackCountry</i> . </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fd/105/b03/8fd105b03d0541eda9127bb956cf5029.png"><br><br>  Having formed the habit of purchasing abroad, it is good and useful to find various really interesting ways to save money. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff8300">What cashback service to choose?</font> </h2><br>  If you buy a lot and often, you can choose everything at once;  if rarely, it is worth staying at one thing.  Why?  Here we get to one important aspect: the order of payments for all such sites is unusual. <br><br>  By registering, you will receive your account and an account where all the funds paid by the store will be collected.  They can be withdrawn only after a certain time.  Each service has its own policy in this regard.  At Ebates, for example, a payment can be received 4 times a year, and the minimum amount for withdrawal is $ 5.01 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/879/84e/816/87984e8162eb4e938c9fc2c536c43095.png"><br><br>  And there are no pitfalls or traps here - if you have not withdrawn the money, they will lie and wait until the next time. <br><br>  Cashback can be obtained either by PayPal or by check.  The latter option is suitable for those who want to use this money to pay for the shipment, because we cash such checks without commission and credit the money to the user's balance. <br><br>  The technical side of the issue and recommendations in Russian are described <a href="http://www.ebates.ru/help/trouble-shooting">here</a> . <br><br>  As a conclusion, it remains to add that getting a cashback in the West is the usual daily habit of any adequate person.  This saves and stimulates sales.  If you live in Russia or any other CIS country, or indeed anywhere, this does not mean that you cannot use all the advantages of foreign online stores and services.  Today, purchases in America and the full use of all the additional services-helpers are available to everyone!  So ask for your legitimate cashback from all the stores where you shop, and save on it. <br><br>  Enjoy the shopping! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365799/</a></p>
