  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oracle Specialization: MUK Learning Center presents authorized training at Oracle University</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As part of the partner status of Authorized Oracle University Reseller, TC MUK was able to provide authorized training to Oracle University outside Ukraine.  The MUK Training Center actively provides the entire range of Oracle University programs.  Now it is possible to offer authorized Oracle University trainings not only in Ukraine, but also to extend training courses to all regions of presence, which include Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan (subject to the purchase courses on how to acquire certificates OU Learning Credits). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb1/734/122/bb1734122c704a789ca2ee4e61d88e07.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Learning formats </h3><br>  Oracle University Reseller is part of the Oracle University Education Services Sales Program.  It provides qualified organizations with the right to sell Oracle training products and courses.  <b>Oracle University's</b> authorized <b>reseller</b> , which is the TC MUK, distributes all training programs that are available in several formats. <br><br>  The basic and most familiar training format for most people is <b>classroom training (ILT)</b> .  The advantages in this case are in-person communication with a professional instructor and trainings conducted according to the schedule of the training center.  In addition, classes can be held on the basis of the Oracle classes or at the customer‚Äôs premises.  At the end of the course, those who completed the course receive a certificate.

      A distance learning format is possible - <b>Live Virtual Classes (LVC)</b> .  Virtual classes with an instructor are not tied to the venue.  The schedule provides for more than 60 courses per week, with available training schedules in several time zones.  The user gets full access to lab environments 24/7, as well as technical support 24 hours a day before and during class.  The choice of reading language between Russian and English is possible.  The advantages of this option are the availability for remote regions of other countries, the absence of travel expenses, as well as the minimal risk of cancellation of the course. <br><br>  There are also a number of so-called DIGITAL formats.  For example, an interactive course video - <b>Training on Demand (TOD)</b> .  It provides access to more than a hundred cuses in various areas and topics, as well as to laboratory environments.  These are high-quality classroom course video recordings with search, pause, rewind and playback options.  Communication with the instructor is carried out via e-mail.  Of the important advantages of this approach is accessibility anywhere at a convenient time and no risk of cancellation of the course. <br><br>  Another option is the portal of expert knowledge of the product areas of <b>Oracle University Learning Streams</b> , which is regularly updated and replenished content.  Video courses are conducted by experts from Oracle.  Thematic webinars are held monthly on the portal.  In addition, there is the possibility of adding content on a new and interesting topic on request.  Technical experts are available on the portal forum to answer your questions.  Training materials are available in different languages, in different time zones and on various products.  This format makes it possible to create your own training plan and schedule. <br><br>  You can also get an unlimited subscription to training - <b>Oracle Unlimited Learning Streams (ULS)</b> .  It provides 12 months of unlimited access to all recorded OracleTraining On Demand courses and to the Oracle Learning Streams portal with constantly updated short video courses on the most current Oracle areas.  Such a subscription provides the possibility of live online communication with leading Oracle instructors, as well as a dedicated laboratory environment for practical exercises.  In addition, a monthly course report will be received (for at least 5 users). <br><br>  It is also possible to subscribe to training for <b>Oracle PaaS / SaaS</b> customers <b>- Oracle Cloud Learning Subscription (CLS)</b> .  As in the above options, there are video courses and presentations from leading experts of Oracle.  This subscription option has several advantages: <br><br>  - PaaS Database: how to use all the capabilities of the DBMS in the Cloud environment, set Options, optimize Database management; <br>  - PaaS Java: how to quickly create and deploy an application, how to deploy a Java application in the Cloud environment; <br>  - SaaS: a complete set for IT professionals and video courses for users; <br>  - Materials for any type of user (Administrator, Architect, Developers, Business User). <br><br>  The CLS subscription is designed for at least 5 users and can be purchased both as part of the ULS and separately. <br><br><h3>  Oracle University (Learning Credit) </h3><br>  The purchase of one or several courses can be arranged using the certificate of <b>Oracle University (Learning Credit)</b> , which is valid for 12 months and will allow you to plan expenses for a year.  The certificate can be flexibly used on any product courses from the Oracle timetable.  In addition, it can be used to purchase: <br><br>  - classroom courses at a convenient time (on the basis of authorized training centers); <br>  - Customized courses for a client authorized by Oracle (Private Event); <br>  - distance courses (Live Virtual Class); <br>  - interactive video courses with laboratory (Training on Demand) and access to libraries of experts Learning Streams; <br>  - Unlimited Learning Subscription (Unlimited Learning Subscription); <br>  - Subscription to courses dedicated to work in the Cloud Learning Subscription environment (PAAS / SAAS); <br>  - vouchers for passing exams for obtaining a certificate OCA, OCP, OCM. <br><br>  Thus, it will be very convenient to manage training at the expense of monthly informing about the status of the account and about the courses completed.  The certificate of Oracle University (Learning Credit) must be used within 12 months.  The minimum order for a certificate is 1000 USD </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308768/</a></p>
