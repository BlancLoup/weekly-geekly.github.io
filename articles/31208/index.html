  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Top 5 Ways to Build a Beautiful Life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>1. Do not give in to dear desires</strong> <br>  We will always be haunted by the temptation to forget about our future in order to satisfy our desires and dreams right now.  We all have a desire to buy a new expensive device, to spend an unforgettable and financially independent evening in the city, or to take a loan for a luxury car, which we now cannot afford. <br>  Enjoy the simplest pleasures of this life and put off as much as possible.  Dear things can not give rise to a long-term feeling of happiness and security, and careful spending money will give you more rest and positive in the long run. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>2. Make your money work</strong> <br>  Saving is great, but in order to get the most out of your savings, you need to make your money work for you.  The right investment decides whether you will go on a well-deserved vacation at 60 or 40 years.  According to Trent's research, if you start investing 20% ‚Äã‚Äãof your income in an S &amp; P index at 20, by the age of 40, the percentage will be equal to the current salary.  That is, you can leave work without loss of income! <br>  Wise investing is the surest way to financial independence, although not many understand this or use this knowledge.  I will definitely devote more attention to this area, both in my personal life and on this blog. <br><br>  <strong>3. It's never too late to learn.</strong> <br>  To be happy, you need constant growth.  The best way to develop is to learn throughout your life.  This does not mean that you need to strive for a doctoral or spend 2 hours every day reading books.  Self-learning can be anything outside the comfort zone.  It is important to be open and look for fresh ideas and perspectives.  Education is growing gradually.  It may seem that the crumbs of knowledge that you receive do not mean anything, but over time these crumbs form together and form a wiser, better, more interesting person. <br><br>  <strong>4. Develop a personal long-term relationship</strong> <br>  Imagine that you have everything you want.  Will you be happy without someone to share it all with?  Personal relationships with friends and family are the greatest source of happiness in our lives.  Do not forget about them. <br>  To always be happy, you need to take time to develop and enjoy personal relationships.  Without people you can take care of, you will feel worthless, regardless of the success you have achieved.

      <strong>5. Always aim for your main dream.</strong> <br>  Even when your life is not perfect, you can always slowly move towards the realization of your cherished dream.  Generally, if you do not aspire to something, you stagnate and degrade.  When this happens to me, I begin to feel like a victim, cornered by my own life.  The best way to get rid of it is to move towards the goal. <br>  It is impossible to control everything in your life, but striving for a goal gives us something good, which you can focus on and lays the foundation for future success.  No matter what stops you or keeps you now, get out and start to do something at last.  As Lao Tzu said, even a journey of 1,000 miles begins with one step. <br><br>  <strong>And as a supplement, 6. Be fit</strong> <br>  You have only one body.  When it collapses, you can't do anything about it.  Engage to shake off rust.  Avoid frequent use of harmful substances and junk food.  At first it may seem like a terrible denial of your own desires, but later you will understand that good health is worth the past victims. <br><br>  Source <a href="http://www.pickthebrain.com/blog/top-5-ways-to-build-a-wonderful-life">www.pickthebrain.com</a> <br><br>  Copy on my blog: <a href="http://ie-x.blogspot.com/">ie-x.blogspot.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31208/</a></p>
