Know why the generations Y and Z are not very interesting money, how to run content that employees of the company will appreciate, create a career website on their own, and also follow the analytics.  Know and be able to see trends, and more - ask them!  And this is only part of the theory and practice of recruitment marketing, which we want to talk about today -&gt; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fad/40a/12d/fad40a12d68446aeafec7c153e81c25d.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What is recruitment marketing? </h4><br>  As mentioned above, this is an employer brand promotion strategy.

      In general, when it comes to recruitment marketing, this implies the entire process of attracting, engaging and retaining a candidate until the moment of response.  Although it seems to us that the technologies necessary also for subsequent communication with the candidate and in the process of passing the selection may also be involved.  In general, we are working on the creation of such a universal <a href="https://potok.io/">solution</a> .  And we have something to say. <br><br>  It turns out that the same marketing tools that use online stores, or, say, fashionable services and some advanced banks, should be used to promote the brand of the employer.  Let's try to figure out which of these technologies and approaches to attract potential candidates can be really useful in the field of recruitment and how to start applying them in practice? <br><br><h4>  Mobility </h4><br>  We put mobility in the first place, because almost none of us can imagine a world where you cannot buy tickets electronically from your smartphone, plan a day, chat with friends, order a taxi or even dinner.  Why, then, is the smartphone still not even for large companies an obvious tool by which candidates can find out more about the company and send their resumes? <br><br>  Simply put, it's time to make recruitment mobile.  To create career-adapted websites of companies adapted for mobile devices, to give a convenient form for response, into which it will be possible to upload all the necessary information.  More than 80% of candidates in the west already use mobile devices for job search.  Why, then, does a career site with a form for the response of one very famous company in Russia still look like this (in the picture on the left)? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dc/38a/ce2/8dc38ace237a426ebd545d4a689fcec5.png"><br><br><h4>  Social media </h4><br>  Social networks can be great helpers in the implementation of mobility in the response process.  Millions of candidates are sitting on FB from smartphones and if they suddenly see a vacancy in the tape, it is likely that they will immediately want to respond to it. <br><br>  <b>For social networks created hundreds of convenient tools.</b>  <b>And technologically everything is much simpler, you don‚Äôt have to discover America.</b>  <b>Arm yourself with the following:</b> <br><br>  1 / Crossposting - use the tools to simultaneously publish a job on the VK company page, on Facebook, and also on Linkedin (there is such a function in potok). <br><br>  2 / Analytics - each social network has the ability to view a variety of analytical reports (coverage, likes / reposts, age, gender, device, which come from).  Collect this information and use it in the future to better understand the audience and post vacancies and posts only in those social networks where involvement is greater. <br><br>  <i>Offtopic: we, by the way, in <a href="https://potok.io/">potok</a> , monitor the source of attraction of each candidate.</i>  <i>We know exactly where he saw the vacancy and responded.</i> <br><br>  3 / Illustrations <br>  If you do not have the opportunity to jerk the designer all the time, so that he draws a beautiful illustration of the vacancy, but still you want everything to look presentable, take matters into your own hands.  For this, there are many applications (Canva, for example) or a service that was created specifically for creating informative images for a job - <a href="http://dreampo.st/">Dreampo.st</a> .  This is also our business (the service will soon move to potok). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/515/584/bf0/515584bf01b54d0bb3ba97b958e40d06.png"><br><br>  4 / Employee Engagement <br>  If we start to create a program of advocates of the brand, then use social networks.  Publishing interesting content you can involve employees.  Those will share it, which means that more and more people will know about the company and that you really are market experts.  Loyalty and interest in the brand of the employer increases, and employee engagement grows.  Profit! <br><br>  There is a very cool Western startup that just creates a platform for the brand‚Äôs advocate program (and there are many of them, but as an example we‚Äôll give one).  It is called PostBeyond - in the system you collect content that is interesting to employees, see what they like.  They share articles, some materials and other things with friends in social media. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21f/3c1/21f/21f3c121ff5f41618be52d6a31075799"><br><br><h4>  Brand uniqueness </h4><br>  It is also important to learn from companies that lead a well-thought-out marketing company to intelligently distribute sources to attract an audience.  For example, minimize the number of intermediaries between you and potential candidates.  Do not sell the company only through third-party resources (work sites), and also find your channels of communication with candidates.  For example, create your own career site.  Or at least an adaptive job board right on the company's website. <br><br>  This will allow you to again more accurately monitor the sources of attracting candidates, that is, rely on data when making decisions, reduce costs, and also understand the needs of your audience, its interests and formulate a more attractive message from the company's employer brand.  Career site can also become a full-fledged page with a description of all the capabilities of your company, growth in it, a story about employees, current vacancies and so on. <br><br>  If you doubt that such in Russia may be relevant or in demand, take a look at the career sites of the following Russian companies: <br><br>  See what kind of (not hinting at anything: D) <a href="http://holy.rocketbank.ru/">Rocketbank</a> career site! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c4/896/949/8c4896949c034abcb07935ad663f9b48"><br><br>  But Out of Cloud has a very human approach in general, it's nice that you can write HR to everyone everywhere.  In general, <a href="http://hr.outofcloud.ru/">Out of Cloud</a> promotes the employer brand perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2be/8b9/d1a/2be8b9d1a3b24140aa983967c4715947.png"><br><br>  The <a href="https://rambler-co.ru/jobs">Rambler has a</a> huge job board, and this page was probably created for this.  At the same time it is convenient to respond to vacancies and you can learn a little about the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/6e9/f7b/d2c6e9f7b4e84ee38adc3a1a26ab7255.png"><br><br>  Our top Russian career sites can be found <a href="http://blog.potok.io/7-career-sites/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>And the last thing about career pages: it</b> is not at all necessary to spend a lot of money on their creation.  You can use constructors that are available for a minimal fee online, or try to create your own career site directly in Potok - we have specially created a <a href="https://potok.io/">constructor</a> that meets all the needs of companies.  All vacancies created by you on the platform will also be published here, candidates will be able to respond and get acquainted with your company. <br><br><h4>  Trends </h4><br>  Marketing is in general entirely a story about trends.  So if you want to attract as many cool and interesting candidates as possible, you also need to follow them.  And ‚Äúice is melting between us‚Äù, and jokes about Pepsi - everything can be used and can not be postponed until tomorrow.  This also applies to your communication with candidates.  Never delay the answer to the candidate for later.  Do not ignore letters.  Set up an answering machine for those who do not exactly suit you, sort the candidates, lead the database correctly, because this is your power and strength - candidates loyal to you are always needed.  So feedback needs to be adjusted.  Well, for this, of course, it would be time to abandon Excel, and find a really convenient system. <br><br><h4>  Automation </h4><br>  It will probably sound trite, but advertising is the engine of progress.  And from it many important technologies grow.  It is possible to call automation as a general and a kind of uniting all the technologies described above, approaches.  Whether it concerns the simplification of the publication of vacancies, communication with candidates or the creation of illustrations for vacancies.  The approach to recruitment marketing should be comprehensive.  Hope for systems that can offer you a range of services that meet your needs.  This is what we strive for.  Because we know that recruitment is a complex of complex tasks, in which, in addition to technology, there is a lot of human and this is important.  To test our system, <a href="https://potok.io/">potok</a> , you can at any time.  We will give you access to evaluate all the capabilities of the recruitment optimization system, which also has the tools to promote your employer brand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326446/</a></p>
