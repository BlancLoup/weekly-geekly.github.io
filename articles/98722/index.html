How do you?  I'm surprised that you were able to come to work, thinking of Missy, who is now cold, scared and lonely ... maybe she lies on the side of the road, her hands are on the machine, and she thinks: "Shannon, where are you?" <br><br>  Although I have two projects that I need to complete during the day, I, of course, will give up everything and do everything possible to contribute to the early return of Missy. <br><br>  David </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 9:37 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  Yes of course thanks.  I know that you don't like cats, but I really worry.  I will leave at one o'clock today. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 10:17 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  Shannon, I never said that I do not like cats.  Once, when I was invited to a party, I bought a pair of expensive shoes.  They were two sizes smaller than mine, but I wanted them so much that I decided to wear them without socks and cut my toenails very shortly.  Since the party was only a few blocks from me, I decided to go on foot.  After the first quarter I stopped feeling my legs.  Arriving at the party, I stumbled upon a guy named Stephen, who splashed rum with Coca-Cola on his white T-shirt from Wham!  labeled "Choose Life".  He has hit me.  An hour after the incident, Stephen sat down in a chair already occupied by a cat.  The surprised cat began to scratch and growl, forcing Stephen to jump out of the chair.  Slipping on the carpet, he hit his forehead against the corner of the column, as a result of which he received an open wound five centimeters.  From shock, the cat defecated, leaving Stephen with a damp brown stain on his beige trousers.  I liked this cat. <br><br>  Announcement, as you requested: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/63/89/6389f6dd3fcd2dd3594b08cb4a1e4e22.jpg"></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 10:24 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  Yes, thank you, but this is not at all what I need.  It looks like a movie poster.  And why is Missy's picture so small? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 10:28 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  Shannon, this is a design trick.

Can you make an announcement, please?  I am very worried about this and spent the whole night in tears.  It seems you think it's funny.  Can you please enlarge the photo, correct the text and make everything colored, please.

I do not go down and do not tell you how to send letters, go to Facebook and look out the window.  I forgive you this mistake, because you are undoubtedly occupied with thoughts of Missy, who is trying to get home through busy intersections or that has fallen into a drain that is slowly filling up with water.  Once I spent three days in a well, but it was just fun. <br><br>  I made the amendments to the announcement that you requested: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5c/73/5c736b5953781baef83a659b6122428c.jpg"><br><br>  David </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 10:59 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  This is worse than the previous one.  Can you make it so that you can see Missy‚Äôs photo in full?  And remove the stupid text that I miss Missy.  I just want to say that she is lost. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 11:14 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c2/d2/c2d20f7cdf3ad3fd936879c5aadd3df9.jpg"></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 11:21 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Announcement <br><br>  Yes, can you make an announcement or not?  I just want a photo, the word "lost", a phone number where it was lost and her name.  Not like a poster for a movie or something stupid.  I need to leave earlier today.  If it was your cat, I would help you.

Once I agreed to look after a friend's cat for a week, but after he brought it to me and explained the concept of cat litter, I kept the cat closed in a cardboard box in the shed and forgot about it.  A week later, when my friend came for his cat, I pretended that I was not at home and sent a box to him by mail.  Apparently, I pasted few stamps, and he had to pick it up from the post office, paying $ 18. <br><br>  I corrected the ad: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/31/e93141725a25b5e8c8c8f984970d4634.jpg"><br><br>  David </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 11:47 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Aaaa <br><br>  This is not my cat.  Where did you get this photo?  This is an orange cat.  I gave you a photo of my cat. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 11:58 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Ahhh <br><br>  I know, but this one is sweeter.  Since Missy may well have already grasped any of several violent ends, then perhaps you could have a better cat.  If someone calls and says: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt see your orange cat, but I found a black and white one with broken hind legs, don‚Äôt you want it?‚Äù, You can politely refuse and save on expensive treatment. <br><br>  I knew a guy who had a basset hound without hind legs after an accident.  He had to walk with a small cart on wheels.  If it was my dog, I would ask to cut off all the legs and replace them with wheels with the possibility of remote control.  Neighboring kids would pay me for the ride.  If I did the same with the horse, I could ride it to work.  I would call her Stephen. <br><br>  David </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 12.07pm <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Ahhh <br><br>  Please just put the picture I gave you. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 12:22 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Ahhh <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/05/2a058e7456b3005c88a0f9f7bc25fbd7.jpg"></blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <strong>From:</strong> Shannon Walkley <br>  <strong>Date:</strong> Monday, June 21, 2010, 12:34 <br>  <strong>To:</strong> David Thorn <br>  <strong>Subject:</strong> Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Ahhh <br><br>  I did not say that there would be a reward.
