  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to resolve 8 service scenarios</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At first glance, ‚Äúscenarios‚Äù in customer service is the antithesis of exceptional service, and customer service has more in common with flexible communication than with a cold lifeless script.  But as artists carefully prepare improvisation, so customers plan a wow solution in delicate situations in advance.  Proper service is based on schemes and algorithms.  We will describe some of my favorite answers to the difficult questions of clients, not just tested in battle.  Use and feel free to correct them in the support process. <br><br><h3>  1. When you do not know what to answer </h3><br>  Do not panic if you do not know the answer.  The challenge is to find the right solution, not the perfect one.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm all new here,‚Äù forget it, it‚Äôs not interesting to hear.  Instead of signing helplessness try this: <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <i>Does the fare include free paper reports?</i>  <i>Great question, I'll check now</i> ! </blockquote><br>  Show that regardless of whether you know the answer or not, by all means find it.  Then urgently call a friend <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/e9a/4c4/04fe9a4c42234ac9a3927e3e42dec612.jpg"><br><br><h3>  2. When the item is temporarily out </h3><br>  Specialists of online stores do not like to report that there is no product in stock.  After that, the dialogue does not bode well - the customer is offended and buys from another store.  But there is a way not to spoil the mood of the client.  The secret is in positive thinking language.  Try saying that the product will appear at the end of the month.

      <br>
      <b>Compare:</b> <br><table><tbody><tr><td><blockquote>  We can not provide the goods until the end of the month, all this time it is not available for order: ( </blockquote></td><td><blockquote>  Your size will appear next month.  I will order this jacket for you right now, and we will send the parcel as soon as it arrives to us :) </blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Find in the templates and answers the particle ‚Äúnot‚Äù: ‚Äú <i>I can‚Äôt, we don‚Äôt have ...</i> ‚Äù - and ruthlessly delete.  The customer is concerned about the decision, so focus on what you <i>can</i> offer. <br><br><h3>  3. When a customer needs to be redirected </h3><br>  In the top of the hated phrases from the support service: ‚Äú <i>Please wait, we will transfer your call</i> ‚Äù.  Annoying.  The feeling that they were letting go of their hands and that they would have to stop repeating their story once. <br>  Ideally, get rid of this phrase.  Review the IVR scheme so that customers get right where they can get help, or give more authority, product knowledge, and first-line support processes.  What to do if switching is not avoided? <br>  <b>1. Call the reason and the ‚Äúaddress‚Äù.</b>  Hearing that the problem is transferred to the expert is already easier. <br><blockquote>  <i>Now we will solve this problem.</i>  <i>I will transfer you to a specially trained employee of department X (general lawyer, accountant, senior sales manager), he will definitely help you</i> . </blockquote><br>  <b>2. Tell the colleague a brief problem</b> and only after that transfer the call.  Do not waste client time.  Each additional effort in finding a solution - to call, tell, wait, tell again, find the contract number - reduces his mood and loyalty to you. <br><br><h3>  4. When asking for a feature that will never work </h3><br>  Customers often have ideas about how to use or improve your product, but you see the development of the product in its own way, and the last word is yours. <br>  If a client asks for what is at odds with your road map, have courage and refuse.  <i>‚ÄúYes, we will see!‚Äù</i> - gives false hope, in the end, the truth will become clear in a few weeks and stabs with disappointment.  Do not be fooled by the mass exodus of customers, just because you say no to their ideas about new features. <br><blockquote>  <i>We appreciate you taking the time to share ideas.</i>  <i>But now X is not exactly what suits us, we have no immediate plans to implement it.</i>  <i>But we are planning to add other useful features - Y, Z. If something changes, we will first of all let you know.</i> </blockquote><br>  Thank for the advice, gently but firmly refuse and sell the new features as an alternative. <br><br><h3>  5. When asking for the ‚Äúonly‚Äù exception </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/085/d7d/c5e/085d7dc5e0ef4a10872b9e498008b0f4.jpg"><br>  <i>Maybe somehow agree?</i> <br><br>  What to do when you really can't say yes?  Once I stayed in a hotel with friends who were allergic to wool.  We watched in horror as the couple begged to leave the cat, despite the strict ‚Äúno animal‚Äù rule. <br>  ‚ÄúPohaaaaluysta, let Barsik stay!‚Äù - and stuff like that.  If the hotel employee had surrendered, it would have turned into an even bigger problem than one upset customer.  The girl decided the situation brilliantly: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Mr. and Mrs. X, it is important for me that the clients' requests be satisfied, but I am afraid that it is impossible to break this rule.</i>  <i>This will affect the safety and comfort of other customers and may ruin their vacation.</i>  <i>Let me make a couple of calls, maybe there are hotels around where you can stay with Barsik?</i> </blockquote><br>  An excellent answer to the stupid request - you might think someone does not know that the hotel with animals is impossible.  Learn to say ‚Äúno‚Äù, because bans do not appear just like that, explain the causes and consequences of the ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù.  In an awkward situation, when you refuse a request, demonstration of sympathy and readiness to find an alternative is the best way to anesthetize the injection of a refusal. <br><br><h3>  6. When something is wrong with the goods </h3><br>  That feeling when you exhale, press the ‚Äúpay‚Äù button, you look forward to delivery ... but the goods in the box are defective. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/983/f68/a9e/983f68a9e469435189ad11292298df96.jpg"><br><br>  In the answer we achieve three goals: we empathize with a dejected customer, we explain the cause of the problem and give a clear and immediate solution + compensation for his suffering. <br><blockquote>  <i>We are so sorry that this happened, we imagine how disappointed you are.</i>  <i>Forgive us.</i>  <i>Perhaps this is a ridiculous mistake in production.</i>  <i>We will send you a new product absolutely free, and for the next purchase we will give a 50% discount, what do you say?</i> </blockquote><br>  Offer an alternative, perhaps the client will simply want to return the money.  Proceed from what the client expects and what will be the solution <i>for him</i> . <br><br><h3>  7. When it‚Äôs time to say goodbye to a customer </h3><br>  One of my favorites is how to end the conversation.  This is not closing the sale, here you need to make sure that you have completed the mission.  Recall that the average business hears only 4% of dissatisfied customers.  Do not replenish this sad statistics, throwing customers with an unsolved problem. <br><br>  For the customer's happiness, show three important things: <br><ul><li>  You need to help him </li><li>  You will continue to seek a solution. </li><li>  <i>The client</i> determines when the problem is solved. </li></ul><br>  End the conversation like this: <br><blockquote>  <i>Fine!</i>  <i>I'm glad we were able to sort it out and help you.</i>  <i>Maybe you still have questions, I will answer with pleasure.</i> </blockquote><br>  The client may be shy and leave with another unspoken problem.  <i>‚ÄúI am happy to help‚Äù</i> - a small detail that relaxes and shows the client that he is not a burden, but your work is a joy to help you. <br><br><h3>  8. When the customer is angry and yells </h3><br>  The best support agents as the lightning rods incur the ire of the customer.  Sometimes this anger is unjustified, and sometimes the client is outraged in the case.  In any case, it is difficult to talk with them, but doctors of telephone sciences know the method for dealing with this type of customer: <br>  <b>Apologize sincerely and sympathize.</b>  <i>‚ÄúForgive us‚Äù</i> - necessarily.  Customer expectations did not coincide with reality, and your company is to blame.  The client is waiting for support and confirmation of what is entitled to anger.  <i>‚ÄúI understand how offensive it is, you are very disappointed</i> ,‚Äù say the customer‚Äôs feelings in order to weaken them. <br><br>  <b>Take responsibility.</b>  You are a company representative and are responsible for its failure.  The client needs someone to share with, because it makes no sense to be angry with a faceless company.  <i>‚ÄúWe are to blame, forgive us.</i>  <i>But I am here to help and correct this situation.</i>  <i>What do you think if we do this ... ‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  <b>Solve the problem.</b>  With an angry customer, the actual <i>fix</i> will most likely take a tenth of the entire support process.  Replace the product or issue a refund - five seconds.  Make sure that you managed to correct the emotional state of the client. <br><hr><br>  Finally, let me remind you of the universal rule: in any incomprehensible situation, use logic and proceed from the interests of the client.  Add your own versions of standard situations and solutions to your comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298408/</a></p>
