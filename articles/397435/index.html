What is it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  DigiFabster is a cloud platform that allows you to automate the processing of orders in any 3D print bureau.  For customers, this is a platform for calculating the cost of their order for 3D printing. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      In the conditions of the growing market of 3D printing services, customers and companies providing these services have a lot of time and effort to miscalculate and clarify all the details of the order.  This platform may be of interest to 3D print shops, engineering bureaus, prototyping services, fab labs and jewelry companies. <br><br>  <b>What it is?</b> <br><br>  The system is a bundle of 2 elements: <br><br>  Widget, which is located on your site. <br><br>  Your personal account on digifabster.com, where all your data, information for the calculation of cost, delivery, and the like are stored. <br><br>  The client works with the widget, the model is loaded into it, the material is selected, the method of delivery and payment is selected. <br>  The data is taken from the personal account of the service provider on the program website. <br><br>  For different printing technologies there are different profiles of materials, and, accordingly, a different method of calculating the cost, for example, by model size, by printer printing time (it will be necessary to set the print speed of the printer). <br><br>  Now there is support for all key 3D printing technologies, templates and profiles for evaluating a variety of printing parameters (such as speed, area, layer height, volume) in the cost structure.  All 3D models go through several error checking algorithms, which allows to give a corrected model at the output or to display the cause of the error, for example, wall thickness, too large size and wrong geometry. <br><br>  <b>How to work with him if you are a client?</b> <br><br>  If you want to quickly calculate the cost of printing, look for an icon or button of this type on the website: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/75c/384/86c75c38400648b39db2b7fd4e88ae92.jpg"></div><br><br>  After clicking, the widget window opens, you can upload your model in the format of STL OBJ, WRL or ZIP archive with the model and texture.  Or you can load several models at once. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bb/b97/db2/5bbb97db25764e4bafa4487d141a11c9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Click next and go to the next window, here you can choose the material you need and the number of parts, each material may have several price variations, for example, with different fillings.  In the case of an obviously incorrect miscalculation, or if your model has flaws due to which it cannot be calculated, you can click on the manual check button and your model, your data and comment will be sent to the post office of the 3D printing service, wait for feedback. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/e95/d84/d5ce95d84784463e97309eefef4af519.jpg"></div><br><br>  After you have selected the desired number of products you can go to the basket. <br>  Here you can see what these products are and how much you have chosen.  And also add your comment to the order. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d3c/0f7/f53/d3c0f7f5387341b18037e5d5783b3cab.jpg"></div><br><br>  The next step is to place an order, here you need to enter your data and select the method of delivery of goods offered by the service provider. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/628/d33/f53628d3399544adb3cbee232a4b624c.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the last window you can immediately pay for the order. <br><br>  After that, the operator will contact you to confirm the order and you will only have to wait for its implementation. <br><br>  <b>How to use if you sell services?</b> <br><br>  If you are a service provider, Digifabster will help you automate the acceptance of applications and reduce the burden on your managers.  The main work will go in your profile on the site. <br><br>  The menu with sections looks like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b0/8c3/fe1/4b08c3fe18334082a71d4fabc2556b4c.jpg"></div><br><br>  Let's walk through the sections: <br><br>  Personal Info - Your account name and password to it. <br><br>  Get started - A short tutorial on how things work. <br><br>  Company - information about the company, mail, telephone, as well as delivery options, minimum order size, and connected payment systems. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/812/1bb/742/8121bb742a474120877a991650c058d2.jpg"></div><br><br>  Materials - Main section, your materials and pricing options are customized here.  There is a set of templates for various printing technologies.  All major technologies are now available. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/430/19c/ffb/43019cffbd684e788ef9ae2babbca129.jpg"></div><br><br>  Clients - In this section, all clients that loaded models into your widget, their email addresses, the time when the model was downloaded and a link to the loaded models are displayed. <br><br>  Orders - This section is similar to the previous one, but here are only fully completed orders submitted for execution. <br><br>  Models - In this section, you can see all the models loaded on your system, the date of loading, and who downloaded them, the models are stored in memory for some time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee2/385/1fc/ee23851fc92a4e9a9f9a4c9f0bf7fd16.jpg"></div><br><br>  Install widget - Here are the links to install the widget on your site. <br><br>  Billing - This section shows your tariff plan. <br><br>  Test upload - Here is a widget for testing the operation of Digifabster. <br><br>  The main section is, of course, Materials - here are the templates for most of the materials and printing technologies. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/408/e90/3e1408e907a94ec1a2c53d43d7cc2f0c.jpg"></div><br><br>  For each material there are many options available. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/195/2a7/708/1952a770872d4fdf8b220ef74441f23f.jpg"></div><br><br>  After setting up the material, you can immediately check whether the settings are specified by loading the 3D model into the Test upload section. <br><br>  <b>Development</b> <br><br>  The company began its development from the Russian market (3DPrintus.ru company) and DigiFabster maintains support for the Russian language (for widget and customer letters), along with 9 other languages.  Now the company has 2 offices - in New York and Munich and focuses its work on the markets of North America and Western Europe. <br><br>  One of the features of the system is continuous development. <br><br>  The company has many customers from all over the world. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88e/8f9/a2b/88e8f9a2bf69482c8b9696d0c8a24c93.jpg"></div><br><br>  Now the service has serious plans for development, in the summer a new material management system will be launched, which will contain a database of printers and materials, which will allow for much faster settings.  Also, several new parameters for SLA, MJM, PolyJet technologies will be added. <br><br>  Additionally, an integration module with email accounts will be added, which will allow faster processing of a stream of letters containing 3D models or links to them and quickly work with billing and communication with customers, the number of supported formats will be increased. <br><br>  Also in the future it is planned to integrate calculations for the markets adjacent to 3D printing, such as milling, plastic molding. <br><br>  <b>Total:</b> <br><br>  During testing, the Digifabster system proved to be a rather interesting solution for receiving orders. <br><br>  Customers can use it to quickly calculate how much it will cost to print their product.  Service sellers reduce the load on their managers, orders are processed faster and everyone is happy.  The main disadvantage is that while the widget can only be effectively used by people who are sufficiently literate in printing technology, they know what they want and represent what the technology can give them. In other cases, after a preliminary assessment, the client still contacts the manager and the miscalculation of the order, the selection of the desired technology is the person involved. <br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/396/101/f91396101d2b4579bb273636bc6283fd.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/%3Frs%3DCM_review_digifabster_GT"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e7a/3b7/925e7a3b7e02499e833866f3b09f7674.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397435/</a></p>
