      This cute epplopodny case (top) is not for retail and is called <a href="http://www.psile.com/index.php%3FID%3D2">Nexus Psile</a> .  If there are someone among habrayusk who can organize a retail sale of this miracle - I would say thank you.  And not only me. <br><br>  It‚Äôs impossible to compare everything at once, so I‚Äôll have to be selective in choosing models.  Models will be relatively few - 6 pieces.  If you take more - the size of the review will grow and it will become more difficult to navigate the page immediately. <br><br>  The main criterion that guides people (in this case, I) when choosing a housing for a home media center is its appearance.  With a high degree of probability, the building will stand in a prominent place and fit organically into the interior of the room.  Beauty criteria will again be determined by me, and they may not coincide with yours (although I want to believe that they will coincide).  I tried not to hurt the manufacturers and choose the most decent of the available.  Of course, it did not work out, since SilverStone turned out to be exceptionally prolific. <br><br>  So, the list of cases under HTPC: <br><ol><li>  <b>CFI Group CFI-A8989</b> </li><li>  <b>Aopen S150</b> </li><li>  <b>Chenbro ES30068</b> </li><li>  <b>SilverStone SG06B</b> </li><li>  <b>SilverStone LC12B</b> </li><li>  <b>SilverStone PT06B</b> </li></ol><br><br><h4>  CFI Group CFI-A8989 </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7b/f7f/c17/f7bf7fc178de5570080a079609f24d84.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Very nice case for HTPC from the company CFI Group.  In principle, quite normal Taiwanese PC case manufacturers.  The segment mini-ITX cases they have represented only two models, one of which we are currently considering. <br><br>  The case is available in four colors - black, white, red and gray.  On the front panel is a standard set of two USB 2.0 ports and audio connectors.  Large blue power button and a connector under the drive. <br>  The steel case assembly and without filling weighs 2.6 kg.  Inside they hid: 1 compartment on 3.5 ", 1 compartment 5.25" and power supply unit on 150W.  As an additional cooling fan 80x80mm is used, which, according <a href="http://x-memory.ru/reviews_detail.php%3FELEMENT_ID%3D2306">to the X-memory review,</a> makes quite a lot of noise.  The case also has space for an expansion card (TV tuner, Wi-Fi, sound or video card).  General dimensions of the case (WxHxD) - 200x166x303mm <br><br> <a href="http://img160.imageshack.us/i/cfi2.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b00/bb6/fbc/b00bb6fbc109b65651f847eca074692c.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img35.imageshack.us/i/150467thickbox.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e48/a36/0f5/e48a360f5fbdd8d2d7e543457d7d60bf.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img199.imageshack.us/i/150466thickbox.jpg/"><img src="http://img199.imageshack.us/img199/5371/150466thickbox.th.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img160.imageshack.us/i/dscf4035.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87e/dc8/c21/87edc8c21892823f06e15caeb77513b1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The case may not be suitable for those who strive for minimalism ... and those who do not like the bright blue LEDs on the front panel.  The case quite comfortably fits a full-size BD-DVD-CD drive, although I would, on the manufacturer's site, choose a slim solution. <br><br>  The average retail price for the device - <b>1700r</b> .  In my opinion - very worthy for such a pretty body. <br><br><h4>  Aopen S150 </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/907/5f9/0ac9075f9da8d09231071013aeb20dd3.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  This case is slightly smaller in size, but with the same large power button.  On the Russian-language website of Aopen (http://aopen.ru), mini-itx format systems are proudly called ‚ÄúThe system of a small form factor slightly‚Äù.  The company has a diverse collection of cases for such systems, in which there are options for all applications. <br><br> <a href="http://img440.imageshack.us/i/s150interbig.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65a/8d3/0d7/65a8d30d7bbfc280738a975fe0cb6497.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img160.imageshack.us/i/aopenminiitxs1503.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ee/d50/63d/8eed5063dca9c05b5a7a827ff5841c0c.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img35.imageshack.us/i/aopenminiitxs1502.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52e/c44/6f4/52ec446f4dbd94380814106ad7f4b8d3.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img440.imageshack.us/i/s150interbig.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65a/8d3/0d7/65a8d30d7bbfc280738a975fe0cb6497.jpg"></a> <br><br>  On the front panel, under the decorative plugs, hides a standard set of connectors for USB 2.0 and sound, as well as an optional card reader. <br><br>  The walls are made of steel with a thickness of 1 mm, and the approximate weight of the product is 2.5 kg.  Approximate - because the body got into the list of goods, the weight of which the manufacturer forgot to indicate on its website.  If someone is interested, he indicated the internal volume - 6.78l. <br><br>  Body dimensions are (WxHxD) - 200x106x320mm.  In the case you can find: a standard power supply unit for 150W, a standard 3.5 ‚Äùbay and a slim 5.25‚Äù bay for an optical drive.  The rear panel contains a compartment for a low-profile expansion card, so you can forget about top-end video cards. <br><br>  Approximate retail price - <b>3300r</b> .  It is not very clear, however, whether the card reader is included in the price. <br><br><h4>  Chenbro ES30068 </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6de/770/3aa/6de7703aa7196c9c16d98c8086dd2a60.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Here came the turn of the most interesting of the buildings under consideration.  There are generally all around LEDs, half of which show the activity of hard drives. <br><br> <a href="http://img381.imageshack.us/i/chenbro3.jpg/"><img src="http://img381.imageshack.us/img381/9820/chenbro3.th.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img25.imageshack.us/i/chenbro4.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0a/904/5e5/a0a9045e5664ce796c29ef3534a5f4f0.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img160.imageshack.us/i/chenbro2.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3d/c13/520/a3dc13520392d81da079227e737bad1f.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img393.imageshack.us/i/chenbro5.jpg/"><img src="http://img393.imageshack.us/img393/2464/chenbro5.th.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The manufacturer of the case is positioned as an excellent basis for a home server.  On this occasion, the case was even awarded with two 3.5 ‚Äùcompartments with the possibility of cold replacement.  The technology is simple - the disks are screwed to the sled, and the sled clicks into the case.  In the case there was also a place for a 2.5 ‚Äùsystem disk, only it will have to be screwed in the old manner. <br><br>  But under the expansion card there was no place in the case, why - a mystery.  It means that we can expand the capabilities of our media center with additional functions only through USB ports, which is not at all ergonomic. <br><br>  The body is made of steel, 0.7mm thick, but due to the complex internal structure it weighs under 4kg.  The internals are cooled by two fans - 60x60mm and 70x70mm.  Standard power supply - 150W.  Dimensions (WxHxD) - 140x260x260mm. <br><br>  If the absence of a connector for an expansion card does not frighten anyone - the case can be found for <b>4000r</b> . <br><br><h4>  SilverStone SG06B </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6b/66e/bc4/c6b66ebc4d0a042ffd21d82a3e70ce1f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  We turn to the second half of the review, which was occupied by immigrants from the company SilverStone.  This company has a huge number of models of mini-ITX cases, but all of them are in many ways similar both externally and internally.  The case is available in two colors - silver and black, in the best traditions of the genre.  To improve ventilation, there are nets on the top and side walls. <br><br> <a href="http://img25.imageshack.us/i/silverstonesg06b2.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d41/bc3/eb6/d41bc3eb6253a7e253243159399ad78d.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img440.imageshack.us/i/silverstonesg06b3.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ea/fc9/27e/9eafc927e4e4f2d5720a64a7d8a15a35.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img29.imageshack.us/i/silverstonesg06b4.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82d/2fb/928/82d2fb92805cbd5a9b451bbdfb3d792c.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img29.imageshack.us/i/silverstonesg06b5.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/468/53e/0c6/46853e0c6cbde42aa4d9de98b707228a.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The body under consideration is the embodiment of the ideas of minimalism.  Almost perfectly flat steel brick with slightly rounded corners.  The manufacturer positions this case as ‚Äúserious‚Äù, equipping it with a 300W power supply unit with SFX and two slots for expansion cards.  Apparently it is expected that the buyer will install a system with a powerful processor or a hefty video card.  IMHO, 300W is hardly enough weighty video card, and it will not succeed to replace it (thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/standov/" class="user_link">standov</a> for the remark) <br><br>  The case is equipped with a slim optical drive and a 3.5 ‚Äùhard drive.  The system is cooled by a 120mm fan, weighs 3.72kg and has dimensions (WxHxC) - 220x177x286mm. <br><br>  A serious body and is more serious competitors - <b>4800r</b> . <br><br><h4>  SilverStone LC12B </h4><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/710/506/cd47105066b704dcb9d1d7c524250982.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The second body of the company SilverStone looks almost like the first, only smaller in size and made of aluminum.  The purpose of the LC12B is a compact media center, without any frills.  This is understandable by the low-power external 120W power supply and the absence of space for expansion cards.  The input for the power cord is a compact jack, allowing you not to spoil the aesthetics with a thick power cable. <br><br> <a href="http://img363.imageshack.us/i/lc12v2.jpg/"><img src="http://img363.imageshack.us/img363/1889/lc12v2.th.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img25.imageshack.us/i/lc12v4.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b7/629/bf3/8b7629bf36c13c21e9c79e1eb5512bfd.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img381.imageshack.us/i/lc12v5.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/595/b3b/e91/595b3be912831a74a310f7e84745cd56.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Unlike competitors, it also has a FireWire connector on its front panel, in case there is a mini-ITX board, with its support.  Traditionally, inside you can put a thin optical drive and a 3.5 ‚Äùhard disk. <br><br>  Dimensions (WxHxD) - 184x97x288mm.  The material immediately affected the weight, the body is the lightest seen in the review - 1.3kg.  Probably, the hope for the heat-conducting properties of aluminum made it possible not to use fans in the case. <br><br>  In general, it is quite a good case for HTPC with passive cooling.  The truth is <b>6400r</b> . <br><br><h4>  SilverStone PT06B </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1be/4a8/1ce/1be4a81ce1be5ced567d480aea38ce63.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only representative of flat cases in the review.  For those who like to put multimedia devices in a TV stand.  The model is in principle a complete analogue of the LC12B with the exception of shape, material and the presence of an expansion slot.  The walls of the case are made of steel with a thickness of 1mm.  Expansion slot is located horizontally, there is a fee-riser included. <br><br> <a href="http://img25.imageshack.us/i/pt06inside.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72f/a27/5ea/72fa275ea6457d5ce6edef6b9622ebc2.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img29.imageshack.us/i/pt06sfront43.jpg/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f85/2ab/d98/f852abd98efbe7e621ad62dc53ea8bf9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  By the way, the power supply in this and the previous model, manufactured by FSP Group companies.  Information on the power supply unit for the rest of the buildings did not come across to me, if someone has it and if it doesn‚Äôt make it difficult - share it in the comments. <br><br>  The general dimensions of the body (WxHxD) are 345x55x255mm.  The body weighs 3.4kg.  Inside is a standard slim optical drive and a 3.5 ‚Äùhard drive. <br><br>  You can buy it for <b>6500r</b> .

It‚Äôs a pity, of course, that we didn‚Äôt manage to see cases with LCD screens and other beauties.  I will not summarize the results of the review, everyone may like something different. <br><br>  In the relatively near future, I will find strength in the second part.  In it, I would like to consider the case of a small form factor without compartments for optical drives with priority to passive cooling. <br><br>  <b>upd: Thanks for the karma, moved to Iron.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68139/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68139/</a></p>
