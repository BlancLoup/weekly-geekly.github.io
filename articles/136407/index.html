  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcements on CES: Smartphones, tablets and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9a/f00/afc/e9af00afcf79515f1a2e3e3f45a3f624.jpg" align="right">  Having decided to begin to devote another review of Lenovo's new products at the American CES show to tablets, I ran into one insurmountable problem: at least three January announcements did not fit into this category at all, although they would not be related to the usual ‚Äúpersonal computers‚Äù.  Therefore, today I will talk about the main new devices that can not be accurately attributed to computers in their classical sense.  Among them - a tablet with a keyboard dock and just a powerful ‚Äútablet‚Äù with a FullHD display, a unique laptop-transformer, a 55-inch TV based on Android, as well as a prototype smartphone based on Intel platform. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Android + TV</b> <br>  The 55-inch Lenovo K91 TV is perhaps the most logical expansion of the range of devices for a company with experience in the manufacture of computers, monitors and tablets.  If you combine the first, second and third, and add a huge display with support for 3D - just get a TV.  K91 is not a realization of the idea of <a href="http://www.google.com/tv/">Google TV</a> , instead Lenovo offers its own shell based on Android 4.0 and a number of network services, including Video On Demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efb/8fc/5ff/efb8fc5ffbe656326380818322e7b6b1.jpg">

      TV itself also differs for the better from many analogs due to the extremely high refresh rate - up to 240 hertz.  This provides a better picture in 3D and a very smooth image in all other modes.  The TV is controlled by the usual remote control or joystick, there is also an experimental implementation of voice control.  Add to this the built-in 5-megapixel camera and support for video calls and get the realization of the future of 2015 from one famous movie: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fba/895/38d/fba89538dff9724ed84cf142dd73c6d3.jpg"><br><br>  Flying machines, alas, are not going to release yet :) The Lenovo K91 TV has already gone on sale in China, and it will most likely be available worldwide.  The terms, alas, are still unknown, which is understandable: such a device necessarily requires the support of local network services. <br><br>  <b>IdeaTab S2 10 - a tablet with a keyboard dock</b> <br>  For a start, note that Lenovo tablets are now branded as IdeaTab, not IdeaPad - this is the name left for custom laptops.  The 10-inch S2 10 was one of the first tablets on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8960 1.5 GHz processor, made using 28-nanometer technology.  The device will work with Android 4.0 and its own graphical setting Mondrian UI.  The weight of the model will be slightly less than 500 grams! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/180/28e/7cd/18028e7cd29151536efa1591216bb28d.jpg"><br><br>  Together with the tablet, it will be possible to purchase a keyboard dock with a larger touchpad and a built-in battery.  The combination of tablet batteries and a docking station provides a total of up to 20 hours of device operation.  Like the Lenovo K91 TV, the IdeaTab S2 tablet will first go on sale in China, after which it will be announced in other countries.  By the way, in the same series a seven-inch version is also planned with a clever technology of transferring the image to the screen of a large TV without wires. <br><br>  <b>Lenovo S2 Smartphone and prototype smartphone on Intel platform</b> <br>  Another new product on the latest dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon is the Lenovo S2 smartphone, which is a logical continuation of the Lenovo Smartphone.  The predecessor of this device with a 3.8-inch screen never went on sale outside of China, but the company intends to show an updated version in other countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a5/391/158/6a5391158f0245f6d6f61815c2bb8684.jpg"><br><br>  The second Lenovo smartphone, noted at CES, has not yet been announced in all its form, but is perhaps of the greatest interest.  This is a prototype of the Lenovo K800, built on the base of the next-generation mobile platform, Intel Medfield, the heart of which will be the 32-nanometer 1.6 GHz Intel Atom processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b9/4e0/8d8/9b94e08d88a9570ac61f387b0d04aeb7.jpg"><br><br>  The Intel company on the market of Android-based devices can still be called a novice, but devices like the K800 promise to be interesting: a powerful, yet economical, x86 platform in a smartphone will offer better performance for ordinary users, and virtually unlimited possibilities <b>for</b> those who like to dig out of hardware "Dopilivaniya files", up to the installation of the desktop version of Linux.  The key parameter for any smartphone - battery life - has not yet been disclosed, so we are waiting for news. <br><br>  More photos of the device are in <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/10/lenovo-k800-intel-medfield-smartphone-hands-on/">this</a> Engadget review. <br><br>  <b>Laptop-transformer IdeaPad Yoga</b> <br>  In the previous article, I talked about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lenovo/blog/135893/">hybrid ThinkPad X1</a> , in which Lenovo engineers tried to combine the power of the Intel Core i5 desktop processor and the efficiency of the ARM platform.  IdeaPad Yoga views this idea from a different angle.  In fact, it is an ultrabook with an Intel Core processor and a touchscreen display, with one important detail: the display hinges are made so that the laptop can be opened 360 degrees, turning it into a tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/910/998/7ad/9109987adc511b1ea0e100d729aef0ab.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard at the same time turns out to be ‚Äúon the bottom‚Äù of the device, without at all interfering with the work with the touch screen.  This approach, in contrast to, say, a rotary display in a ThinkPad X220 Tablet, allows you to reduce the dimensions of the device, keeping the minimum thickness of the laptop.  It should be understood that the weight of the novelty will not be ‚Äútablet‚Äù - remaining within one and a half kilograms - but you will get a full-fledged laptop running the upcoming release and focused on using Windows 8 touch screens. The model is equipped with a 13.1-inch screen with a resolution 1600x900 points and 10-point multitouch. <br><br>  Laptop IdeaPad Yoga will be available in the second half of 2012, the cost in the United States will be about $ 1,200. <br><br>  <b>Charged tablet with FullHD-screen</b> <br>  A quad-core processor with a frequency of 1.7 gigahertz, a FullHD + screen, a biometric sensor - in general, a laptop with such a configuration would not be ashamed to show friends.  Only we are not talking about a laptop, but about a 10-inch tablet, with minimal dimensions and weight.  The IdeaTab K2 tablet should come to replace the K1 tablet currently being sold, but so far it only exists as a prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40e/24a/49d/40e24a49d54510508f40f7d11e5bd123.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet is built on the basis of the platform NVIDIA Tegra 3 with maximum performance, but at the same time quite economical in terms of battery consumption.  The model is equipped with an IPS screen with a ratio of 16:10 and an impressive resolution of 1920x1200 pixels!  Another interesting detail is the powerful built-in audio system with four speakers (quite good progress compared to the quiet ThinkPad Tablet!).  The case of the model is made of metal, the screen is covered with protective glass, and a fingerprint scanner is provided on the back panel.  Note also connectors HDMI, full USB and SD card slot.  On the appearance of such a device on sale, we will inform you after the official announcement, but now you can be sure that the tablet will turn out to be one of the most powerful in the industry, but not cheap. <br><br>  More photos of the tablet - in a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/01/08/lenovo-lepad-k2010-ideatab-k2-hands-on/">review</a> on Engadget. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136407/</a></p>
