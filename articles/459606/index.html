Despite this, every day I read news about the forced deletion of publications and blocking accounts in popular social networks. <br><br>  Do social networks consciously take responsibility for my publications?  Will this behavior change in the future?  Can a social network give us our content, and what changes are required for this in social networks?  How will possible changes affect the IT market? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Different goals of the social network and forum </h2><br>  Social networks appeared as the development of forums, and they, in turn, were created to attract and retain people on the website of the company that owned this forum.  A person had to remember the name of this company, this site, and return to it again.  Therefore, the forums kept the moderator staff: it was the content that was associated with their firm, and it had to be clean. <br><br>  Social networks no longer retain the subscriber, as they are already well known.  They live at the expense of highly targeted, personalized advertising. <br>  For a social network, it is important to identify the interests of the account and, in accordance with them, show it the most suitable advertisement.  The task of leaving a person on this site, as was the case with the forms, is no longer relevant, the person returns to Facebook as it is, because of the unique set of services that the largest social network provides.

      I recognize this coexistence as completely mutually beneficial. <br><br><h2>  Responsibility and property </h2><br>  ... but for some reason, like the ancient forums, all social networks without exception still take responsibility for the texts that are in it. <br><br>  Weapon makers are not responsible for the killings.  Car manufacturers are not responsible for drivers.  Even parents at some point cease to be responsible for their children, and the landlord is only in the most extreme case and very indirectly responsible for the consequences of the actions of the tenant.  But the social network, for some reason, is responsible for the content.  Why? <br><br>  In all cases, the sale of property takes place, which means the transfer of responsibility, and the birth of a child also means taking responsibility for it for the next eighteen years.  Everywhere reigns (should) market self-regulation, and only Facebook keeps its subscribers for small children, and still can not let them go.  Maybe they are waiting for the very first accounts to turn twenty-one? <br><br><h2>  Exclusive social network rights to content </h2><br>  Well, why social network exclusive rights to my content?  It either leaves it as it is or blocks it.  Social network does not edit my articles.  What is the point in owning my content?  I can transfer part of the rights to the publication, but ownership - why?  After all, the owner is responsible.  And this is an incredible cost to follow such an uncountable number of publications.  The question is, do they have to do it, or do they want to do it? <br>  I can not explain why you need ownership.  But if it is not needed, then why do they keep it?  Give your social networks to people. <br><br><h2>  Multiple sites as social network cells </h2><br>  Imagine that instead of one social network, there are many different sites, each of which represents one or more social network accounts.  One large social network is divided into many cells connected to each other.  The ownership problem is solved: the owner of each site is responsible for its content, and has all the functions of a social network right on its own site.  The social network is responsible for the technical part of the question, can show its advertising, and provides only the engine. <br><br><h2>  Self-regulation in the field of content moderation </h2><br>  The social network no longer needs any moderation functions.  Let government services and public organizations do this, if they need it.  And it will appear. <br><br>  I see it this way now: the World Court satisfied the claim of the public organization of the Independent Society of Moderators Facebook For the love of the Motherland to the owners of Internet resources to individuals such and decided to cancel registration of such domain names on the Internet. "Optionally, with the payment of a fine to activists of sexual minorities and confiscation of the search engine cache in favor of law enforcement. <br><br>  This is all the way it should be, and sooner or later it will be.  Without a passport can not register a domain.  On your domain porridge - you answer.  Completely market, self-regulating, reliable structure. <br><br><h2>  The reason for the introduction of new technologies </h2><br>  Well, but all this, apparently, the case of some future technology?  Everyone thought about how to combine social networks and what a breakthrough it would be.  I have never fired because nobody needs it.  Who needs to blur the control over an immense advertising audience? <br><br>  I'm talking about something else, how to remove an army of hired moderators from at least one social network, stop making social networks make excuses for content that is not produced by them, stop paying fines, sue, tolerate reputational costs, and, as a result, receive a decrease in capitalization?  After all, the rejection of ownership of content promises profits, and as soon as it comes to money, big money, everyone starts to move right away. <br><br><h2>  The principle of operation of a distributed social network </h2><br>  But how to implement it?  How to combine heterogeneous sites into a single system?  So that there and the search worked, and the message immediately reached, and even advertising was shown? .. <br><br>  Very simple.  I will even say more, it has already been implemented.  More than ten years ago. <br><br>  Everyone, of course, knows a site like Mamba.  It is the largest dating network.  But few know that you can start your own Mamba, completely free.  To do this, you need to perform two simple steps, register on the Mamba website as a partner, and configure the NS records of your domain for the IP addresses of Mamba. <br><br>  Of course, you remember how in the days of the boom of dating sites, there were dozens of them, but somehow everyone was more or less suspiciously similar to each other.  So, all these sites are two or three bases with such affiliate programs.  The point is that you are promoting your dating site at your own expense, the general base of the questionnaires is growing and this is good for the integrator, and you get quite a lot of money if the paid features are bought from your site.  In my opinion, it was at least 30% of each purchase - a very good percentage. <br><br><h2>  Technical implementation of multi-domain social network cells </h2><br>  We were distracted, but we saw that the described scheme is not something that is realizable, but it has been working for a long time.  A person registers a domain with his own real name.  Directs this domain to a social network (of course, special one-button services will appear for this).  Anyone who visits this domain sees a normal page on Facebook or contact.  But now all the articles that are written on this site are quite definite authorship of an individual or a company owning a domain, which are responsible for the content. <br><br><h2>  Self-regulated moderation on social networks and development of a connected services market </h2><br>  An unwanted comment appeared on the site?  Remove it yourself.  Article is shown on several sites-accounts and a comment is marked as undesirable by several owners according to a certain criterion?  Removed automatically.  No time to monitor your site?  Please, ZAO Postochist and other organizations provide services for moderating the content of social networking account sites.  Organizations provide legal services in advising on the legality of placing content on account sites.  At GitHab there are several free projects of automatic moderators, but elite services are provided by firms using only highly qualified moderators with a philological and legal higher education at the same time (!). <br><br><h2>  The development of new areas of activity and the economic effect of a simple solution </h2><br>  Fake accounts will die on their own: keep these accounts will become too expensive.  The content will be much better, the size of social networks will decrease a lot, but you will be sure that every person who is there is responsible for his words.  And a few more important moments. <br><br>  There will be new areas of activity that will open new jobs in the IT field, and a lot.  The practice of blocking websites through a world court will legitimize this process and will spur the development of the judicial system.  The market will require cheap automatic moderators, and this will give impetus to the development of artificial intelligence in the field of text understanding.  Yes, now it is also developing, but with the launch of account sites it will become widespread, since it will concern absolutely everyone.  And this, in turn, will affect the quality of the search ... And for very, very much in life. <br><br>  The domain name market will rise very strongly, and there will be a widespread transition to IPv6.  Who will take to calculate the economic effect of such a simple solution? <br><br><h2>  Private technical issues multi-domain social network </h2><br>  Let's go a little further and solve some private issues.  Well, a person is logged on to his site, but if he logged into another site account, then this is a different domain, and he will not be logged in there? .. Cross-domain queries have long ceased to be taboo.  Google tracks you even on different computers, do you notice that the same advertisement is being shown to you both at home and at work? .. <br><br>  When a person owns a site, he can do anything on it.  But in the case of sites-accounts, it does not affect the design of the site, can not personalize it.  And if, on the contrary, to give the site to the owner on the hosting and give him the opportunity to connect the social network as a module, who will guarantee that he will not block the display of advertising? .. <br><br><h2>  Distributed social network account site templates </h2><br>  I have long wanted to use the Contact site as a content manager of a regular site, but I don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt change anything at all in appearance.  There is a lack of a github site. <br><br>  Sites accounts will provide site layouts that will be loaded through the control panel account.  On Contact, in the very germ, there is already a semblance of this function. <br><br>  The site templates will provide special places for advertising.  If such places are not indicated in the downloadable template, the site template will not be accepted for publication.  Of course, you can load different templates for different pages, and add static pages.  Or maybe not necessary, maybe it will be possible to place the main site on the second-level domain, and the site account - on a subdomain.  Probably, there will be some variation of both.  For example, a large site account can only be placed on a second-level domain. <br><br>  The emergence of sites accounts almost completely destroy the market of site management systems.  And I will not say that it is bad. <br><br><h2>  Implementer </h2><br>  It is clear, to implement the described, you must be at least a contact.  It is necessary not to launch a new network, but to slightly change the behavior of existing ones.  Technically small changes.  We need only the will and finances.  Who will take? .. <br><br><h2>  State regulation </h2><br>  Over time, social networks themselves will provide domain names to choose from, and regular accounts will be a thing of the past.  After that, you can not register an account without a passport.  Since this provides strong regulatory opportunities, government services will grasp this idea, and after this the process will become irreversible. <br><br><h2>  The black market and the rise of the overall level of responsibility and security </h2><br>  Of course, this will generate the corresponding sector of the black market.  The sale of illegal mobile numbers will be complemented by the offer of fake account sites.  But it will also have a positive effect: since the person is aware of the responsibility for the content, he will begin to think more about the security of his data, which in general will raise the level of security on the network. <br><br><h2>  Further cyclical development </h2><br>  Naturally, it is possible to predict an increase in volumes in anonymous methods of communication.  Will there be a new alternative Facebook?  It is unlikely that none of the companies will want to take on such responsibility.  Social networks will be divided into sectors controlled only by the internal community. <br><br>  But this will not lead to decay.  Firstly, for the Internet there will be freely distributed social networking engines that will set a new standard in their construction.  And secondly, the development of technology will lead to the emergence and spread of a fundamentally new communication environment, which will be based on new protocols, and it may even be not quite the Internet.  Or not at all the Internet. <br><br><h2>  Terminology </h2><br>  The following neologisms were born during the process of writing this article: <br><br><ul><li>  "Site account", or siteacc </li><li>  one-button service, </li><li>  multi-domain social network, </li><li>  Public Organization "Independent Society of Moderators" </li><li>  confiscation of the search engine cache. </li></ul><br>  Perhaps, in a certain number of years, some of these words will become as widely known as now social networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459606/</a></p>
