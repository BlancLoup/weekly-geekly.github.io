    <h4>  Forecast # 1: Convergence is the motto of digital marketing this year. </h4><br>  You have already seen, and will see the convergence of marketing and IT platforms created for business.  This trend will be relevant in the future.  Blurring the boundaries between publishers (print and electronic media), brands and marketing agencies. <br><br>  Project Curve, created by Getty Images.  Verizon experiment with Sugarstring news site.  Red Bulletin, which is maintained by Red Bull.  These are all large-scale content projects, developed by companies for their own promotion.  More and more brands are discovering the power of personal communication with their audience.  Form their own audience, without the involvement of other media. <br><br>  On the other hand, electronic and print media create content for brands on their own, as in past times (when journalists wrote ads for their newspapers). <br><br>  For example, the Tribune Publishing publishing house (which owns the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers) bought a stake in the Contend content agency, which develops premium content for global brands.  Onion Labs, The Onion's internal publishing agency, has created some really cool campaigns. <br>  Cond√© Nast, publisher of Vogue magazine, Vanity Fair and GQ recently hired a content director and launched an online store of branded content, which erases the line between editorial and advertising publications. <br><br>  Advertising and marketing agencies are now more than before under pressure from the media and brands.  In this difficult situation, agencies will seek to get their own piece of cake, selling ideas and creativity.  An example of this is Anomaly, which made a project for EOS cosmetics.  Also interesting is the case of the 37signals company, which went from a web-studio to the developers of the Basecamp service. <br><br>  The flow of information, of course, will be huge.  But this is only for the benefit of content creators of all kinds listed above.  They get a loyal target audience with which to work.  For example, conduct research on consumer preferences.  Test products or services, achieving a better understanding of products and quickly getting feedback. <br><br>  With all this, you need to remember about the most valuable resource - people.  Brilliant marketers, copywriters, designers, analysts, they create unique content. <br><br>  Crucial for marketers will be the ability to navigate a large flow of interconnected data, to understand how to build relationships with the audience.  This is very important for teams that want to understand and be successful in all elements of digital marketing: content, technology, analytics, and strategy. <br><br>  That is why such attention is paid to studying the audience, stimulating interactivity and building relationships. <br><br><h4>  Forecast number 2: What old has become new in content marketing and social media </h4><br>  Of course, the elephant in the room is mobile Internet.  This is an obvious trend. <br>  Everyone will focus on those things that have already appeared in 2014. For example, the large screen sizes of mobile devices (a mix of a smartphone and a tablet).  On such devices it is more convenient to look at the content and use the social.  networks. <br><br>  I would also like to say that the old one, which is again in fashion, is attention to niche audiences, highlighting narrow segments.  Take, for example, podcasts.  They were popular in the early 2000s.  Of course, this is not the first thing that comes to mind, if we talk about the mobile Internet. <br>  However, podcasts are a great way for content marketers to quickly get to a small but loyal audience and build friendships with it. <br><br>  Those who are not ready to create their own content can find existing podcasts that are interesting to their potential audience and place their ads there.  Often, visitors perceive such advertising more loyally (following the example of a good old radio). <br><br>  I would also not lose sight of the print media.  There is more and more content on the Internet.  Marketers will be harder to stand out among competitors and reach out to their target audience.  As well as customers will not be easy to find reliable sources of information. <br><br>  Print media can quickly gain confidence by providing readers with independent information.  Such media can easily find their loyal audience, engaging in dialogue with users and then sending them to the sites for detailed information.  By the way, links to sites in other offline media (for example, on radio and TV) live much less. <br><br>  And finally, integration.  This is similar to the "rapprochement", which is mentioned in the forecast number 1.  Users, unlike marketers, see communication channels differently.  They just want to get information from the sources they are used to.  Therefore, you have to deliver the content to them, wherever they are.  Through mobile devices, newspapers, e-mail newsletter and social.  network.  Incidentally, this is another example of the ‚Äúold-new‚Äù; we wrote about such things back in 2010. <br><br><h4>  Prediction # 3: SEO is getting harder, but (hopefully) with fewer pitfalls <br></h4><br>  I would not say that SEO is dying, but there are more and more doubts about its effectiveness.  Someone thinks that search engines are constantly improving their algorithms.  Encouraging these marketers to post better content, reducing the value of various technical tricks. <br>  However, due to constant changes, marketers are increasingly skeptical of SEO.  Understanding that it is possible in two accounts to lose high positions of promoted words. <br><br>  As one marketer said, taking off from the first page of the search: ‚Äúit‚Äôs as if I had a store on the main street, and in one night, the city moved, and my store was on third street.  My attendance has plummeted. ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, concerns about the secrets of search algorithms are not the latest news.  For example, I found articles for 2008 in which it was stated that long lists of key queries no longer work.  But, I think, now, the majority of specialists are at a crucial stage, due to the constant changes in search algorithms. <br><br>  Marketers will try to do their job better by distributing traffic sources. <br>  Finally, in SEO, there is a growing trend when more and more content appears that is hidden from search engines.  This refers to the increase in the number of applications and the growth of the mobile Internet.  Applications seem to create autonomous content planets that exist separately from the big world wide web.  Where can not get the search engines for indexing content.  Accordingly, the information will not be reflected in the search results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286628/</a></p>
