  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How can the humanities become a programmer?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started writing this post two months ago even before the post cycle ‚ÄúYou want to be a programmer, become one.‚Äù  I read the comments on the articles, rewrote the article.  Ultimately, taking into account all the comments from people who are convinced that some special brains are needed for programming, my answer to them is: ‚ÄúFor not wanting to do anything, any excuse will fit.‚Äù <br><br>  So how do humanities learn to program? <br>  Answer.  It is necessary to follow the principle: "The eyes are afraid, the hands are doing." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/335/f3c/f19/335f3cf1926cdd9b40e67c71df786ed3.jpg"><br>  <i>Picture to attract attention.</i>  <i>Replaced with a cat, the previous one resembled an inflamed brain.</i> <br><br>  Further you will find a collection of useful tips that helped me.  A few words about the author: I am a humanitarian who graduated from the Faculty of History. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introductory word </h4><br>  Imagine a historian who decided to write a book about the famous battle.  The first thing he does is collect all known facts.  Second, he analyzes the material received and draws conclusions.  What did the man who became a programmer do?  In fact, the same thing that made the historian who wrote a book about the famous battle.  The same and similar process. <br>  The basis of any intelligence are comparison and sorting operations.  Any knowledge that we gain, first of all, we try to organize them into some kind of hierarchical scheme, at the subconscious level.  And when knowledge is already ordered, we try to start using it. <br>  This means that a person can learn any area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge from archeology to astronomy.  It all depends on two factors: <br>  1) Personal desire <br>  2) And how much time you are willing to spend on it.

    <h4>  What language to learn? </h4><br>  You can start with several.  You need to find one that you enjoy.  The one that you understand, from which there will be no rejection. <br>  This is a benefit.  Sometimes in one language you can find the necessary explanations, which the authors forgot to add in the language that you liked. <br><br><h4>  You have chosen the language, what about the rest? </h4><br>  You are afraid that you are learning a non-fashionable language, or that will go out of fashion and then you will not be needed with this non-fashionable knowledge.  Do not be afraid of it.  The main advantage that you get when learning at least one language.  You restructure, you learn to think like a programmer.  You get the concept of how things work.  With this experience, you will not be difficult to learn a new language in a very short time. <br><br><h4>  Find a thick tutorial </h4><br>  What textbook to read?  Find all the tutorials you can find.  Start reading all at once, there will definitely be one where everything is told in great detail.  Do not hesitate to books: "We study in 24 hours", you are left to yourself, who are ashamed?  Do not try to read the right books, because they are correct in the opinion of your friend.  Maybe this correct book is understandable only to your friend. <br><br><h4>  How to remember all this? </h4><br>  And do not need to remember.  Just beat the examples from the books and see how it works.  If you cram hard, your brain will start to hate it.  It is necessary to study a subject in quiet conditions.  Tell yourself: "Let me try it, nothing terrible will happen." <br>  Below you will read how to remember everything. <br><br><h4>  Record working snippets </h4><br>  Have you driven the code, started it, is it working?  Write it down.  I use <b>docs.google.com</b> to do this to access from anywhere.  There I distribute everything into folders, each document is an example of a small code.  Every time I appeal as a crib.  In the end, you will reach a level where you remember everything. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c8/3a0/ee0/3c83a0ee08720f593a3a895e2feb86e0.jpg"><br>  The basis of this method is the usual note-taking material.  Deploying svn, as recommended by programmers in the comments, will become a stumbling block for the humanities, which may stop it forever. <br><br><h4>  Write the right decision </h4><br>  Suppose you fought over the solution of a problem.  You decided it, write down the code of the work program with a detailed description of what the problem was and how you solved it.  According to the law of meanness, the next day, when you decide to improve the code, you will break your working solution and then you will be puzzled for a long time, but how did it work yesterday? <br><br><h4>  Make a mistake </h4><br>  If you find a small working example that runs without errors, then make a mistake on purpose.  Write down what error the debugger will show you, how it will be called.  This will come in handy in the future when you write a more serious program and encounter an error. Having experience, you will immediately understand where to look.  Do not be afraid to experiment.  Improve code, make changes.  This leads to an understanding of the subject being studied. <br><br><h4>  Type code </h4><br>  When reading a textbook, such a situation often arises.  You are shown the code, you see it for the first time, but you understand how it works and read on.  There is a great danger in this.  Type the code from the book and make it run.  While you drive it, your brain uses different departments, from receiving information to transmitting it for use in the musculoskeletal system (hands, in this case).  What does it mean - the information passes through different parts of the brain.  And therefore it will be perceived differently.  The real case, while you are reading, you say to yourself: ‚ÄúYes, of course, it works like this,‚Äù and after dropping in and running the performance, seeing the result, you exclaim: ‚ÄúEureka!‚Äù.  That's why the written information is remembered better than the one you just read. <br><br><h4>  Warnings </h4><br><br><h4>  Despair </h4><br>  From time to time, you will be visited by despair.  You will receive thoughts that there is too much material, you cannot study it.  Elementary fatigue.  In such cases, just open the tutorial and watch it for 10 minutes, scroll through the different sections.  The benefits of this action will be such that even in this case, your brain will remember the material.  Subconsciously, imperceptibly to you.  One day you will encounter a problem and suddenly remember for yourself what seems to have seen its solution on page 536. <br><br><h4>  Bad documentation </h4><br>  Sometimes nothing is clear from the documentation.  Because the author speaks several languages, he has a lot of experience, it seems to him that he writes quite understandably, without going into details, without even giving examples.  Be prepared for this, it will constantly meet.  Sometimes it helps to read an example from another programming language.  For example, the shared library is used in two different languages, in a different language the community is bigger, the documentation is better.  But it is important for you to understand the principle of operation.  Read how it is done in another language, gradually understand how to find a solution in your language. <br>  It often happens when the documentation is written by a stray programmer from another language.  He himself did not understand the details and confused others. <br><br><h4>  Your friends and acquaintances </h4><br>  Among your friends there are people who will ask you this question: ‚ÄúWhy do you study programming?‚Äù. <br>  I was quite surprised by this question.  Think of some moronic excuses for them to get behind.  For example: ‚ÄúI want to find a job as a programmer.  The average salary of a programmer ... blah blah blah. " <br>  What is most interesting, after some time, when you achieve a serious result, for some reason this will not impress you at all.  I do not know what it is, envy? <br><br><h4>  Guru from the Internet </h4><br>  ‚ÄúGuru‚Äù in any forums sometimes say something about coders, beginners get scared, ask questions: ‚ÄúHow not to become a coder?‚Äù.  You should know that when you learn to program seriously, you will have so much optimism, you will feel like such a superhero that you will talk like a fighter pilot.  Soon, you will also start writing something on the forums about Hindus and cattle coders. <br><br><h5>  Well, the last </h5><br>  How long will it take you to study?  If you spend 10 minutes every day, then six months later you will notice that something can already be done.  And in two years you will be able to look for a job.  And maybe even earlier, it depends on you. <br><br>  All the best, thank you for reading.  I am sure that the article will help someone, just as innocent motivating articles helped me in my time. <br><br>  Update 1: Judging by the comments, some ran over the article.  And some questions are caused by inattention.  About 10 minutes is also said under the heading "Despair".  The essence of 10 minutes, so that a person does not quit studying when he has no strength.  Otherwise, if you give yourself a week of rest without touching the material, then the second and the third will follow after the week ... <br><br><h4>  Personal experience </h4><br>  Asked to add personal experience.  Education began with the language TurboPascal in school, I liked the language.  But there was no computer at home.  After school, I entered the university, at the history department, where I also had success.  At the faculty of applied programming, I could not enroll, because I could not pass the exams in mathematics. <br>  After university, after finding a job, I bought a computer and tried to study Delphi.  He set himself a task, as some wrote in the comments, but as it turned out, Delphi could not cope with it.  At this my training stopped.  The next attempt was made a few years later.  I decided to pounce on several at once: Delphi.NET, Php, C, C ++, C Sharp, ObjC, Assembler, Python, Ruby, Perl, Javascript, Java. <br>  Result: Python went very well.  Other languages ‚Äã‚ÄãI know a little.  But now it has become much easier to study them, since there is no previous fear and uncertainty. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151091/</a></p>
