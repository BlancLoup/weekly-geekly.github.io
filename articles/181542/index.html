This smartphone is not without flaws, but against the background of gloomy monotonous "shovels" it looks very impressive and contrasted ... perhaps, only the stripes on a zebra and an ice-cold shower during the switching off of hot water are more contrast.  In addition to jokes, this is the first smartphone since the HTC HD2, which irresistibly wanted to own, <s>but for some reason it was unfairly bypassed on Habr√©, although not, something was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/htc/blog/181105/">written</a></s> .  I'll tell you a little about him, sit back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/066/d25/931/066d25931db76b5b307c32956258f70f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not one dozen smartphones went through my hands - some did not linger for several days, others I put under a pillow for six months.  The most remembered (and lasted) is just HTC HD2 - a gloomy knight in armor ‚Äúfor aluminum fine grinding‚Äù, who survived all devices, made a lot of flashing and operating systems (starting with WM and WP, ‚Äã‚Äãending with various variations of Android) and recently left to a well-deserved retirement ‚Äî she rolls around the world in a friend's car, acting as a navigator. <br><br>  Since then, I have not come across any particularly interesting devices.  If we talk about HTC, Desire HD seemed like an ‚Äúawl on soap‚Äù, Sensation simply didn‚Äôt impress, and One X was made on Tegre for some reason ... I didn‚Äôt even want to watch non-flagship devices - the processor was from the past, memory was greedy, the camera is lousy.  But the worst thing - all the models were without raisins, covered with a layer of indifference and indifference of the manufacturer.

      At the beginning of 2-13 years, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.  ‚ÄúReally, did someone in HTC hear my prayers!  A top-end device, a sane battery, an excellent design and the absence of a bad number of megapixels in the camera! ‚Äù- don't think that I'm trying to find an excuse for a 4-megapixel camera, although, you see, these crazy races have already reached the point of absurdity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/879/ef2/426/879ef2426669740e0d5f59ce99156cde.jpg"><br><br>  HTC One is the first smart since the days of HD2, which wanted, like the most beautiful girl in the university.  As you already understood, as a result, everything turned out for us, we live together for more than a month, soul to soul;) I will not tell intimate details - you can turn to <a href=""><u>Yandex.Market</u></a> , where more than 40 reviews are written about this smartphone.  And at the same time read the reviews, so as not to think that I am inventing something here. <br><br>  The theater begins with a hanger, the draft board - with the agenda, and new devices - with the box.  The flagship device originally from Taiwan is packaged in a kind of thin Mac Mini.  Packaging in the form of "brick" began to go out of fashion - manufacturers realized that they were reluctant to build houses of them, so they began to produce other building materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/375/fe8/a64/375fe8a64f7e0d878061d73c457a728f.jpg"><br><br>  But what remains depressingly constant is the contents of the boxes: a smartphone, a wired stereo headset, a charger and USB wiring.  Eh, where did the times go with boxes that do not close on covers, docking stations, extra batteries, thirty-three books with instructions? !!! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1bd/bd9/404/1bdbd9404dc1f463adb11b7530de79aa.jpg"><br><br>  Design.  Design ... Design is a subjective thing, some people like it, some don't.  But I was happy as a child when I first saw One.  Neat strict lines, excellent exterior in both light and dark design, metal is not like Samsung.  On the other hand, the motivation of the creators of the fourth galaxy can also be understood: the plastic collapsible case is a classic, simple, cheap and reliable, however, my HD2 had a metal removable battery cover and in fact somehow kept everything, no one died. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8d/7b7/cb4/a8d7b7cb44c38f823b60962a4d1c46a0.jpg"><br><br>  Here is another approach to the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa monolithic body.  It is completely cut from a single piece of aluminum, with all the technological holes, grooves, grooves, and everything else.  Strong Unibody-case, there is simply nothing to get loose and creak, everything is monolithic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/967/ae7/ee0/967ae7ee03ba70360ddb4b6052637c30.jpg"><br><br>  At some point, it even seemed to me that this smartphone was released by the company ... well, well, it seemed;) Although <s>millions of flies cannot be mistaken,</s> Apple followers wrote somewhere themselves, saying the front of the new HTC One is exactly the same their old iPhone 5 behind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/151/819/27b/15181927bcbcc8a76bf4f85435477264.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fe/275/c31/6fe275c31acad976a2531df04183df20.jpg"><br><br>  There are two body colors to choose from: black (anodized) and silver (as it is).  I chose gray because I <s>finally decided to switch to the bright side,</s> it is not so easily soiled, and the black color is already fed up with it.  But in general, the choice of colors could borrow from some Nokia Lumia: Gunmetal Gray, say, Amber Red some, or even Sapphire Blue - such tricks would definitely be found by its audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bc9/206/c42/bc9206c425502e44b3844da71724bd21.jpg"><br>  <i>Photo taken from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/htc/blog/181105/">the HTC blog.</a></i> <br><br>  Almost the entire front side is covered with Gorilla Glass 2, whose properties do not need to be presented (it doesn‚Äôt scratch with a knife, so does the nail, but the ruthless jeans pocket will cover the whole glass with micro scratches for a year; in general, I am a supporter of matte film - not scratches against, and aesthetics for).  Glass and metal ... oh, it is better to hardly think of something;) By the way, there is information in the network about a possible marriage (protruding glass), pay attention to this when buying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/025/64f/36b/02564f36bde783216fae9d0d98561fbe.jpg"><br>  <i>Pay attention to the completely non-protruding volume change button.</i>  <i>What, do not see her?</i>  <i>=)</i> <br><br>  On the front side, the device is almost symmetrical (to the touch): there are a Dackface camera (2.1 Mp) and two sensors (lighting and approximation) on top, as well as a status LED, which is hidden by a neat dot in one of the sieve holes of the conversational speaker.  Below is just a microphone and the same mesh, which hides not only the microphone, but also ... the second speaker!  So here is the ‚Äúhonest‚Äù two-channel sound: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/40b/8ea/283/40b8ea283a5dc33719b38f054e4b2410.jpg"><br><br>  For this business, even a new trademark was invented - Boomsound (in addition to Beats Audio) - the sound is quite loud, you can easily voice even a spacious office open-space.  The quality is also not bad, although I prefer listening to music through headphones rather than through speakers (the standard headset is also quite good for myself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a0/480/d95/3a0480d95f2787c54afe1c94bf0b6aea.jpg"><br><br>  But with the management once again namudri.  Earlier, HTC refused hardware buttons, and changed the order of the touch buttons, now they have come up with something new.  Already noticed the touch buttons at the bottom of the screen?  No, you didn‚Äôt seem - there are really two of them: ‚ÄúBack‚Äù and ‚ÄúHome‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d3/dc3/ec8/0d3dc3ec86d2c06e63aea9bcbd32b6d0.jpg"><br><br>  Where is the much-needed Menu button?  But there is no it - I guess what the company's engineers were guided by when they introduced such an anti-social solution into the final product.  And to fix this, apparently, it will not work.  But on the other hand ... it's all a matter of habit - I have been using the device for a month now and sort of doing it somehow - in landscape orientation, on the contrary, it‚Äôs convenient that you can press the device with your thumb without fear of accidental pressing. <br><br>  The left is unusually empty - there is only a slot for a micro SIM card.  On the right - similarly, only the engraved two-position button for volume control.  By the way, by the way, there are also questions ... why is she so indistinct?  Feel it almost not find, and if found, sometimes it is not clear, pressed it or not.  And I thought that the Nexus 4 uncomfortable buttons, yeah ... In general, another flaw, but again ... the volume ... so how often do you change it?  If I change it, it is only when I listen to music with headphones - the regulator on the wire. <br><br>  The power button also decided to make fun of the user and moved to the left side of the upper end, which is why it is convenient to press it except with the index finger of my right hand (I'm right handed).  Well at least that the device is not quite gigantic in size and allows you to control yourself with one hand, without interception.  But still it would be better if the power button was in the old way, on the side ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/992/108/e02/992108e02a9ca0d464368acc96f05bd7.jpg"><br><br>  But there is one interesting feature of the power button - it is also an IR port at the same time!  No, for the transfer of pictures and polyphonic melodies in the corridors there is all the necessary arsenal of wireless interfaces, the port is useful for controlling home equipment.  In the standard software arsenal there is the TV application, which displays the schedule of TV broadcasts for many channels (Russia, unfortunately, is not supported there yet) - there is a built-in ability to control various equipment (TVs, consoles and home theaters) - many models are preinstalled devices, although my noname-TV there, of course, was not there.  It does not matter - he added it in the manual mode, ‚Äúhaving trained‚Äù the necessary commands (the smartphone tells you which button to press on the remote, and then it ‚Äúcatches‚Äù the signal and winds it on the mustache). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b30/5b4/6de/b305b46de88448bafeaae1bd6f97299e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0eb/02b/316/0eb02b316aa2087827b5bfb2b4c3576d.png"><br><br>  As a result, only the condo took part in the uprising of cars, the rest of the home appliances were tamed.  Unless getting to these "remotes" inside the application is inconvenient - I will be grateful if someone tells you the same software (you can pay). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b4/98a/f1d/1b498af1dd3f2fcb2336618a40854afb.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom there is a microUSB-connector, which serves not only to charge or connect the device to the computer.  You can plug in the HDMI wire for an extra money (equal to the cost of the MHL adapter), and also (via another adapter) a regular USB flash drive or a digital camera (USB On-The-Go with support for FAT / FAT32 / NTFS file systems, and maybe some more).  The last feature is quite useful - you should pay attention to it if you do not have enough internal memory.  Yes, yes, the HTC One is also in trend - there is no memory card slot, and there is not much internal memory.  In Russia, only the 32-gigabyte version of the smartphone is on sale (Europe has more luck, you can find 64 gigabytes), and only about 25 are allocated for user data. The Chinese are most lucky - in their version there is not only a slot for a memory card, but also a place for second sim card!  By the way, smartphone buyers are provided with a nice bonus - 20 GB in a Dropbox account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2e/2a8/144/e2e2a8144e7619808c7ae0ebdb2a664c.jpg"><br><br>  From the back side everything is smooth and beautiful.  Behind thin plastic strips are hidden antennas of cellular communication and networks of the ‚Äúnear range‚Äù, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and even NFC (Android Beam works, but here‚Äôs the number of trips, at least on the blue ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù travel card, Yandex.Metro does not show) .  In addition to the plastic strips and 4 MPx "eyes" of the camera on the back there is nothing more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c91/f5a/17e/c91f5a17e11f5984f2f3170cca56ad79.jpg"><br><br>  I deliberately set aside a couple of paragraphs of text about the screen, which, in my opinion, deserves a separate (or main) praise.  The Super LCD3 display, which has a diagonal of 4.7 inches, is no longer a ‚Äúsmall‚Äù 4.5-inch screen, but at the same time a non-giant 5-inch screen.  People call it the golden mean, although something tells me that a 5-inch screen would also fit in perfectly here - pay attention to the half centimeter frames around the perimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2c/145/a03/b2c145a03fd7aafb2aa60790c555cf59.jpg"><br><br>  But the coolest is the rest of the display, such as the resolution (1920x1080 - like a giant TV in your home!), Maximum viewing angles, an excellent margin of brightness, natural color reproduction and overall speed.  Pixels?  I beg you, they are not in sight.  The density of the points is 469dpi - no one has a more accurate indicator, in my opinion.  And, in contrast to the interpolated megapixels in the cameras, here the whole charm of the screen is visible to the naked eye.  In short, the screen is great, and HTC still has such juicy pictures pre-installed ... !!! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/618/d74/de3/618d74de3ca13ea4b3cc08f3c28c784a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a6/852/ad4/3a6852ad43f95becc3a41ac11a901edf.jpg"><br><br>  What do we have in the end?  A month later, the device did not lose its presentation - it is still a stylish and practical metal case with a smart screen.  I got used to the size right away - the smartphone is convenient both in one hand and in the pocket of jeans. <br><br><h1>  Iron </h1><br>  Inside the device, too, all grown-up.  Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 about four cores with Krait 300 architecture, Adreno 320 video core of the second generation, 2 gigabytes of RAM - yes it only turns on in 6 seconds!  This device simply does not know what ‚Äúslow down‚Äù it is, and the word ‚Äúslow‚Äù is hardly understood.  Clicked - done, svaypnul - the animation is perfectly smooth, opened the application - launched instantly.  On everyday actions, One is two times faster than an iPhone, OS usability has long been not exactly ‚Äúequal‚Äù, but moved to the stage ‚Äúit is not yet known who is better off‚Äù.  Personally, I am not a fan of iOS (bribes, perhaps, their ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù), since many UI solutions and interactions with the system are not obvious and are a legacy of the limitations of the first versions. <br><br>  So, something we digress.  Performance.  Anyone interested here equestrian indicators benchmarks?  Unfortunately, asking before the post is published will not work, so here are the pictures, they will say everything for me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/10c/19c/b68/10c19cb68911c583f5e971a5b2705bde.png"><br><br>  As you can see, the device confidently bypasses even the most powerful decisions of the past year - Nexus 4 and Optimus G (although their performance already seemed excessive and sufficient for a couple of years ahead).  There is nothing to say about the other models.  With the new flagships, it is already slightly more difficult, but here One did not hit the face with dirt: maybe it scored ‚Äúparrots‚Äù less than the ARM-15 processors, but in reality you will not see any lags on the One, while Friendly Galaxy S4 periodically produces microfreezes.  Although, rather, it is the merit of Samsung's software curbwrappers, rather than hardware. <br><br>  There are no problems with games, of course.  I am not a special fan of mobile toys, but you can play some races or ‚Äúpigs‚Äù in public transport, but DeadTrigger‚Äôs all there is not mine.  Productivity with head is enough to produce a 1080p image with 30+ FPS, and who wants, can see this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-3LHujyhTxw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgKMZe33FkqdyPwF3tea3jVOrcxbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Interestingly, EA ever think of porting the first NFS Underground to mobile devices?  Eron-dong-dong, yeah. <br><br>  We talked about the stuffing, now the burning topic has come - the battery.  For once, HTC didn‚Äôt greedy: an impressive 2300 milliampere * hours were hidden inside (the biggest indicator for the entire One device line of the same name) - the device works from morning to evening, like all modern smartphones.  But even with such a great desire, such a battery can be discharged in a few hours, having twisted the brightness to the maximum, downloading a 3G movie and playing in Asphalt 7. However, you can just as well plant a nexus, a galaxy, an iPhone, and even 60 Amp car battery. <br><br>  If to sum up very briefly: it does not slow down, autonomy - like all modern devices, 1 day.  No, well, what did you want from the device, at the cost of twenty thousand rubles?  Well this is the flagship;) <br><br><h1>  About software </h1>  At the time of writing the article on the smartphone it seemed to be the most current software, namely: <br>  - Android version 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) <br>  - HTC Sense 5.0 <br>  - Firmware 1.29.401.12 <br><br>  It's hard to say something new about Android itself - it has been studied along and across, it is this version that is currently being installed on most modern smartphones (while in some models it‚Äôs not 4.2 the first day).  On HTC One (as well as on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175897/">HTC Butterfly</a> ) they also promise an upgrade to 4.2 ... but ... well, you understand) So, if that - do not say that I am to blame for everything. <br><br>  But HTC Sense is the latest version here, the fifth one is only for HTC One <s>and Michael Jackson</s> .  The first thing that catches the eye is an attempt to join the trend of flat Windows 8 and modern Android trends: most of the elements from the once embossed and gradient became monochrome and lost all volume.  Flat design, or whatever it is ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/564/8ed/051/5648ed0518857bc84875ac35e96738c9.png"><br><br>  True, while some icons seem to be heterogeneous in execution (here it‚Äôs not even about third-party applications, but about pre-installed ones), but in general it looks very, very cool.  A few years later, this shell remains my favorite - one of the best rework of the Android stock.  The same Samsung still can‚Äôt get rid of motley Asian clothes with a bunch of ryushkas (despite the fact that the functionality is quite good), and LG ... get ideas from Samsung and paint on them with ugly icons;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/13d/39f/825/13d39f82585bb24901dc00fbb7ca12c1.png"><br><br>  In the fifth version all icons, switches, clocks and weather information are redrawn.  The design has become cleaner and, if not strict, then at least more neutral - under the sharp edges of the device itself - that's it! <br><br>  At your disposal are many widgets (the usual white clock on the whiteboard and the weather has not disappeared), and the main menu finally has a full-time ability to group applications (with the ability to display them in alphabetical order or by activity, as well as change the grid - 3x4 or 4x5 ).  If the applications are not grouped, then they can be scrolled with an endless ribbon down.  At the very top of this menu there are also hours and weather, which can not be removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/428/5a4/fe9/4285a4fe972cc85d6492b70ce816ce12.png"><br><br>  Another ‚Äúlocked item‚Äù is the application shortcuts on the lock screen, they cannot even be changed.  With the rest of the lock screen, you can change it as you like ‚Äî display only the weather watch, music control buttons, a photo album, or something else. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c1/cff/db9/5c1cffdb989d48b4b7c84dfa222b791e.png"><br><br>  Initially, three desktops are preinstalled, one of which (on the main <b>page</b> , where the Home button leads) displays something called <b>BlinkFeed</b> .  At first, I thought that this was some kind of regular news aggregator ... and it turned out that way.  The debut of a kind of thing, which I have not found any particular use, despite its very pleasant appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37e/004/19d/37e00419db93d53e2af2a9cd6b44efb3.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ee/106/5f1/1ee1065f169e5746e63488cf8adf8e8e.png"><br><br>  At the moment, for Russia, there are news (pre-reformatted and shrinking to save traffic on HTC servers) from the sect of selected sites, such as RIA Novosti, Vesti, Gazeta.ru, Reuters, Euronews, Avto.Mail.ru, Nomobile.ru ... Uh, HADB WHERE? !!!  And there is no Habr.  As well as the ability to specify any arbitrary resource.  I don‚Äôt know, don‚Äôt know ... as for me, it‚Äôs better to read a twitter feed or an RSS feed, but you can‚Äôt even remove this thing from your desktop.  Here it is. <br><br>  I liked how you solved the problem with low-grade images that you assigned to contacts (more precisely, which were compressed by Google itself at one time).  If such an image is present during a call, a mesh filter is superimposed on the photo, which hides image defects, while leaving the caller's photo recognizable. <br><br>  Otherwise, in terms of pre-installed software is pretty clean, not trash.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The file manager is still not bundled, but the task manager has changed a little: if in the previous version of Sense (I saw it on HTC Butterfly) there was an awkward carousel (I had to try hard to catch the right application there), now the task manager caused by double pressing the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button and represents a 3x3 static grid. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0f/0a6/e2e/c0f0a6e2ee479fb52e386b9cdcac378e.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In more detail about the innovations and capabilities of this shell, you can read </font></font><a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/120031-htc-sense-5-review"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">here</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but as they say, it is better to see once:</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qSwZ_egj1w0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwNG_xsvgwKYcsrMENPYy_ZcNHEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Camera </h1><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Are you still here? If yes, then I propose to discuss about the most controversial element of the smartphone - the camera. Specifications of the serial sample are as follows: 4-megapixel BSI-sensor with a matrix size equal to 1/3 ', a wide-angle lens with an equivalent focal length of 28 millimeters and a viewing angle of 88 degrees, aperture f / 2.0 and an optical stabilizer. A separate processor is responsible for removing information from the module: HTC ImageChip 2. The main chip is just the increased pixel size of the matrix - 2 micrometers, while in most other mobile matrices it is smaller. They say that in this case more light falls on it ... wow, how many copies were broken in discussions of the "ultra-pixel" matrix, which they decided to put in One. Some shouted that ‚Äú4 megapixels will laugh‚Äù, others - ‚ÄúHurray,finally less noise and more light sensitivity ‚Äù- we can continue in the comments;)</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But you can discuss endlessly, and the camera, nevertheless, takes photographs, which in the first place should be seen, and not described in beautiful words. Here, see the examples of photographs in full: </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you can see, Nikon and Kenon‚Äôs actions can sleep well :) The camera cannot be called ideal, although I have only a few significant comments to it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Under ideal shooting conditions, the quality of frames (picture clarity) is excellent, although it is slightly inferior to the fourth (and maybe even the third, you need to look) galaxy, fifth iPhone and Sony's flagship device - the pictures are too contrasting, while the detail of small details is sometimes not enough . But the frames are obtained with normal colors, without any special shoals with white balance, and autofocus clings exactly to the object for which you want.</font></font><br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9217/30575835.1/0_b9fab_6e5daf88_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/948/518/cba/948518cba18897bb7a56e0a5762f4b11.png"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9230/30575835.1/0_b9fad_3547efcd_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1a/35d/251/d1a35d251545df8d2e28b5471acba07e.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9169/30575835.0/0_b9fa4_6c9e73f0_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/025/378/26f/02537826fe80ceb0313cbe8b1fa410a7.png"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9106/30575835.1/0_b9fa8_5530c06d_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b2/e87/cb0/1b2e87cb037406fe3bac1f2bfd3e85b4.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6706/30575835.0/0_b9fa0_6fd2f0e2_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ff/001/2e2/2ff0012e2d005e3066fa3040f2500e05.png"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9230/30575835.1/0_b9fb0_d0815d7_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ed/68e/471/2ed68e4717937431aaf8f8aae5a3d3c4.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6715/30575835.1/0_b9fbc_e4db3455_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/046/c85/20c/046c8520c55d379ffbebc578fefe3f1d.png"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6714/30575835.1/0_b9fbd_64888abc_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ba/992/30b/8ba99230b2ae34bdfe17bf7ae8f09cf1.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6720/30575835.1/0_b9fbf_7dc01e6e_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f4/d20/571/4f4d20571c23490a1bdfba619f8342e8.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c61/1c0/297/c611c02971796257cf83294d6d50f32c.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6714/30575835.1/0_b9fc3_fca1141e_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/044/f8c/5a9/044f8c5a92c123f83999a81d32149493.png"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9229/30575835.1/0_b9fc2_2827b75_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/319/a66/ead/319a66eadfab8f788f3c6edd4b399d89.png"></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The stabilizer saves from the tremor, about the sensitivity of the matrix in HTC did not lie. A separate item like the ability to shoot HDR-photos. I used to have this abbreviation caused inner fear - what should be done 3-4 frames from a tripod (not breathing), then in some tricky way (one of the lessons in the network) to put these photos ... and then, it would be possible ... something hitherto unseen ... In HTC One, the principle of operation is the same, only it does everything by itself and at the touch of a button (along with the creation of an ordinary photo). The result is that photographs are ‚Äúdrawn out‚Äù from the state of ‚Äúsky and silhouettes‚Äù or ‚Äúphotos and black objects‚Äù into quite acceptable frames: exposure correction works with a bang, details appear in dark areas, light and overexposed images are corrected in the right direction. Compare the results of normal and HDR mode:</font></font><br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6717/30575835.0/0_b9f9e_99b75d72_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f6/971/499/9f6971499da43716ab53c9f9e48462c4.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9226/30575835.0/0_b9f9d_42563eee_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e4/71e/354/2e471e35409725b7c25523604f41db67.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6719/30575835.1/0_b9fb1_5602b038_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e97/cfd/b33/e97cfdb3325d624d829f6eba3f24ad6b.jpg"></a> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6716/30575835.1/0_b9fb2_f4c963fc_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c5/d91/1df/6c5d911df118f3888d4c768c811eaaaa.jpg"></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Is that what to do "day" in the dark, as does the Nokia Lumia 920, HTC One does not know how. But, apparently, there was no such task ... it turns out to be darker (lighter than on the iPhone), but the situation is more or less natural (albeit with noises). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition, HTC wrote down a special </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Zoe</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> photosoft </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, which knows how to create magic no worse than David Blaine - make people disappear, manage time in a photo, pretend to be photoshop, and in general it is one of the best mobile photo editors. Here I, of course, lied a little, but you really do not plan to edit photos on your phone? And in vain, because one photoshop is at least as HTC One, and here everything is free for you.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They started the camera - you can press the shutter button in the old manner (it‚Äôs a pity that there‚Äôs no hardware button for this thing) and get a photo right there. But what if the shooting conditions are uncomfortable? For example, do people run around in the frame, drive cars, etc.? In this case, you can go into the above-mentioned Zoe mode in one click: after trying to create a photo, you will have ... as many as 20 full-size photos (by the way, each weighs 1-2 MB), while in the gallery they will be grouped into a video. A kind of serial shooting, for which you do not need to climb the menu ... and at the exit at least one frame so fit.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a built-in photo editor that allows you to edit some basic things. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, remove red eyes, ‚Äústroke‚Äù the skin (by adding warm tube blur, vaguely reminiscent of the ImageNomic Portraiture plugin), change the face geometry (it works!), Lighten-darken, crop in every way, apply effects (there are about 10 of them) and all sorts of there is a framework.</font></font> Beauty! <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I did not try to shoot panoramas, because I have not met anything beautiful yet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But yesterday, for the sake of interest, I tried the function from the train window - do not take it to heart =) </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are many other examples of panoramas in the network, it seems to be working. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if something does not suit you, you can always use a third-party utility from the Play-market. </font><a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/d5c/album/344611/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All photos are in full size</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .</font></font><br><br> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9230/30575835.1/0_b9fb3_a6612f89_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/383/b7a/b36/383b7ab368eca84eb4419adf55f45e83.jpg"></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><br><br> <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/d5c/album/344611/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font><br><br><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In comparison with competitors </font></font></h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Talking about the HTC One, it is impossible not to mention the competition. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But I will say in advance: they for the most part do not excite me. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">My friends have all of the following (but it‚Äôs not easy to collect everyone at once in one space-time point), I tried ... therefore </font></font><s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">holivar stuffing, in</font></font></s><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> short, then:</font></font><br><br><ul><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Sony Xperia Z</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> - a stylish and featured thing, but with a defective screen (TFT TN) and a battery. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Waterproof properties - who really need them? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For 10 years I haven‚Äôt had any problems with any of the smartphones under any of the showers, and I wouldn‚Äôt swim in the pool with any kind of phone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The standard interface is also very sad.</font></font><br><br></li><li> <b>LG</b>       ,  Nexus 4  .
