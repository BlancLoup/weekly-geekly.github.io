  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPad for young parents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many can be heard about the scope of tablet computers.  And what they are, and that the poor we used to have one laptop and phone with us dragged, and now we carry a tablet for some reason.  At the same time, the majority agrees that lying on the couch or reading news over morning coffee from such a device is truly a pleasure.  I personally have already accumulated a lot of areas and reasons for using the tablet, but I want to write about this in more detail.  I think it will be more useful.  First of all, it will be a question of software for iOS - since this is exactly the experience.  Probably for the android, too, there is something. <br><br>  So, when you have a baby in your arms, and you, most likely, his mother, then combining manipulations with him and with the computer at the same time will not work.  But one of your hands is regularly free.  The simplest example is during feeding.  You can, of course, watch TV in parallel (which, however, distracts the child and annoys), but if you need something on the Internet: read a book or look through a magazine, then, as practice shows, it is the tablet that will fit perfectly. <br>  These are questions of convenience and comfort.  There is also a special software that may well be useful to young parents.  It is not so little, but, as usual, there are really few useful things.  But also applicable in our realities (software tied to American children's online shops immediately disappears, for example), even less. <br><br>  And yet, what turned out to be useful: <br><a name="habracut"></a>

It draws bright, you can‚Äôt call it fractals, patterns and spots on the screen that the child sees, also sees in 2 months in practice.  And sticks in them.  Is watching. <br><br>  Attention takes about 10-15 minutes, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_query%3Dbaby%2Beinstein%26aq%3Df">Baby Einstein</a> does not cling for such a long time.  I do not know how much it really develops, but it distracts the child from the demand for attention - for sure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7fe/561/1b2/7fe5611b294507cbfd8fd7f509ab7799.png" alt="image" align="left">  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/baby-connect-track-log-share/id326574411%3Fmt%3D8">Baby Connect</a> <a href="http://www.baby-connect.com/">www.baby-connect.com</a> ($ 4.99) The application is more serious.  There are both for iPhone and for iPad. <br>  It is, of course, for pedants, but science is useful.  In fact, this is tracking of all kinds of activities and passivity of the baby.  How many slept, how much ate, weight, etc.  etc. <br><br>  Done very well, has timers, builds graphs, shows dynamics, and more.  In general, a pleasant and useful thing, if you are really ready to use it and record everything.  Helps to answer questions from doctors during examinations.  (the screenshots are clearly visible, it is worth seeing) <br><br>  More, unfortunately, I found really useful applications for the little ones and their parents.  I would be glad if there will prompt. <br>  Closing the topic, I want to say a few words about the indirectly related application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d6/85c/fcf/7d685cfcfd183c9ab1d4c2e1bcd69165.png" alt="image" align="left">  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calorie-counter/id405722266%3Fmt%3D8">Calorie Counter</a> ($ 1.99). <br>  As the name implies, it is designed to keep track of what and how much you have eaten.  Will show the rate of both calories and vitamins and other substances.  Allows you to enter activity (training), and keep records of changes in weight and volume of the body.  Everything was done very well, and I looked at a dozen analogs, from free to fairly expensive.  This, in my opinion, is definitely the best for a number of criteria.  By the way, it seems, it was done by our compatriots, but there is no direct mention.  Among the shortcomings, and noticeable, is that the version for iphone I personally have through the dropbox with the version for ipad it syncs badly and is buggy. <br>  What is the connection with the topic of the post?  Here, in general, obviously.  After the birth of the child is the issue of weight loss and bring the figure to normal.  Yes, and follow the diet is very important (what was eaten yesterday, the baby did not get milk, as there with min. Substances and vitamins in the diet).  In general, it may well help and be just as useful. <br><br>  Well and the last - iPad perfectly copes with a lamp role at night.  Light dim, directed.  Far from being necessary :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116261/</a></p>
