      <strong>For free</strong> <br>  Do you often ask the phone to call?  They approach me with such a question with enviable periodicity.  Most often, these people have the following goals: <br>  Girls to start a conversation and meet. <br>  Some comrades in order to make a completely unimportant call. <br>  They are asked to call another network in order not to waste their money. <br>  Urgent calls when a person really needs to call somewhere. <br><br>  I allow to use the phone only in the latter case.  Since I have long been the owner of a rather unusual phone model, incidents happen with enviable periodicity.  The main problem is that people do not know how to open it.  If the mood and conscience allow, then you can mock a little.  One day, the girl didn‚Äôt master the principle of opening the phone and said, "Okay, I‚Äôd better go ask someone else." <br><br>  <strong>Boy, what are you with?</strong> <br>  Late evening.  Dark.  I get home.  A comrade of a suspicious type approaches me.  I think: "Either ask for a smoke, or ask if there are seeds."  But no. <br>  - What time is it now?  - The guy asks a simple disgraceful question. <br>  - 23.15 - I answer without feeling a trick. <br>  - Right? <br>  - Right.  - I calmly turn around and move on. <br>  On the way, two assumptions were born: perhaps he really wanted to know the time, but on a leading question I can assume that the phone was expected to get out of his pocket.  But having estimated the coolness of the mobile phone, one could both ask to call and smoke. <br><br>  <strong>Spam</strong> <br>  2am. <br>  Comes SMS "Where are my bagels?".  ‚ÄúFuya ce‚Äù, I think and send ‚ÄúShip oranges in barrels‚Äù, turn off the phone and go to bed.  After that, a few days there is a correspondence is not clear with whom it is not clear what  Especially liked the content of one of them: "Phone (the name of the girl is missing) 80297". <br>  I'm leaving for a couple of months in Russia.  I buy a local sim card and start to mock in response.  At the other end of the wire is a complete misunderstanding of the issue. <br>  In the end, it turned out that the classmate accidentally left a piece of paper with my phone number.  Accident it or a setup - I do not know. <br>  Conclusion: do not leave anywhere your coordinates.  Overwhelmed with spam. <br><br>  <strong>Beautiful room</strong> <br>  My friends gave me a beautiful number on my birthday.  Everything would be fine, but sometimes someone calls to find out if the number is free, sometimes just to chat. <br>  I also came to the conclusion that some auto parts dealer has a number that looks like my and inattentive fellow citizens are now eager to buy brake pads, headlights, etc. from me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18897/</a></p>
