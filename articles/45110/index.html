Yesterday, two interesting news stories appeared on the network regarding espionage activities in the US. <br><br>  The first concerns, albeit somewhat indirectly, virtually any Russian from several sides at once, and by venerable analysts is already regarded as one of the most serious precedents in espionage since the Cold War.  But, I come to the point: the former head of the security department of the Estonian Ministry of Defense, Herman Simm, was arrested on September 21 this year on charges of transferring secret information to Russia.  This information, secret, related to the developments of Americans on cyber security and the protection of NATO from "hacker attacks". <br><br>  How could this happen?  Chronology of events: it is believed that Hermann Simm was recruited by the Russian special services twenty (sic!) Years ago, and therefore by the time of his arrest had reached such a high chair that it allowed him to gain access to a lot of secret information.  ‚ÄúThe cyber defense center‚Äù of NATO began to take shape in Estonia, as in one of the most advanced in terms of information technology countries of the Alliance (after a DoS attack on some state websites of the country, which, according to the Estonian government, was carried out by a group of Russian intruders after dismantling the monument Soldier-liberator ").  The official opening of the Center was scheduled for 2009, but, due to current events, the future activities of this structure are now in big question. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The second news does not apply to IT, but it affects space and China.  A Chinese-born Chinese physicist, Shu Quan-Sheng Monday, was brought before a court in the Arms Export Control Act, there will be a small pun that you will notice.

      68-year-old US citizen (who is a native of China) is credited with espionage and the transfer of the results of scientific activity to the government of his native country.  More specifically, the matter concerns the development of the fuel supply system, which Shu was engaged in from 2003 to 2007.  In particular, in 2003, the above-described comrade illegally exported a document with an unimaginably long title: ‚ÄúCommercial Information, Technical Proposal and Budgetary Officer - Design, Supply, Engineering, Fabrication, Testing &amp; Commissioning Filters and Instruments.  In short: this document contained schemes and plans for building tankers for storing liquid hydrogen, intended for launching ships (and rockets) into orbit, as well as ‚Äúvarious specialized cryogenic equipment‚Äù. <br>  Why the document on fuel tankers is proceeding in the case of exporting weapons is known only to God and the American special services, but I would not be surprised if in the coming years China will build an autonomous rocket station in orbit. <br><br>  <a href="http://norfolk.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel08/bribery111708.htm">FBI press release</a> , in FBI language. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/security/2008/11/18/cyber_defence_centre.html">Planet</a> via <a href="http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/7wANvRv8VWg/article.pl">Slashdot</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45110/</a></p>
