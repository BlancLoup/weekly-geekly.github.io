  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The vicious circle of viruses.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever wondered why there are so many viruses under Windows, and under Linux or Mac OS there are practically none?  Do you think because of the low popularity?  Nothing like this is a vicious circle, which gave rise to the system win9x. <br><br>  I do not want to scold now the corporation that made the product called Windows, and here it‚Äôs really ***** it was <strong>only before the</strong> advent of NT systems.  In the NT systems introduced division into the rights of users, which in principle <strong>could get</strong> rid of the <strong>problem of viruses</strong> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  But people preferred to sit under the administrator‚Äôs rights, mistakenly assuming that their rights as the computer‚Äôs owner are violated under a normal account, but this is not so. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Due to the fact that everyone began to sit under the administrator, as well as the fact that these rights were not in systems prior to NT, the skilled hands of programmers who had imagined themselves to be professionals and who had not tried to study the architecture of the operating system began to write different programs, not thinking about the rights, and those that were written, did not think to correspond with the new architecture. <br><br>  But many people heard the words ‚Äúcan‚Äôt sit under the administrator‚Äù and tried to do it, but they didn‚Äôt succeed, because most of the programs do not work under a regular user, so they didn‚Äôt understand why they still need to do it, and continued to sit under the admin , and programmers continued to write wrong programs. <br><br>  But the majority of viruses could not do anything from a normal user, so I see this as the main problem of Windows. <br><br>  Here is such a vicious circle of Windows. <br><br>  With this, I want to make an appeal to Windows programmers, make the right programs, namely: <br><br><br>  For the absence of these problems, I love Linux, in it all the programs are adapted to work not as root. <br><br>  But the Windows product has the right to life if the attitude to the creation of programs changes. <br>  A bright and popular example of a <strong>wrong</strong> program: qip2005, fortunately in infium, the author provided for the normal saving of settings. <br><br>  <em>Dedicated to Linux haters who think they know Windows far and wide, but continue to sit under the administrator.</em>  <em>I don‚Äôt know why, but I didn‚Äôt understand it myself until I moved to Linux :)</em> <br><br>  PS Sorry for the poor design, this is my first post in Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28658/</a></p>
