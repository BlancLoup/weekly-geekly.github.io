  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quality that kills</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <em>The writing style may seem confusing.</em> <br><br>  If you start with too high a quality and start from the wrong end, it will kill the project, because we consider the purpose for which resources are allocated as a project.  Even if you have a large investor, your patience will be your resource. <br>  - <br>  Quality and perfectionism is a parody of fruitful work on oneself.  Because good work begins to bear fruit as soon as it begins. <br><br>  An idea that can only work with excellent starting parameters is not an idea, but shit.  If you have a really good idea, it will start working as soon as the project framework and its vital organs begin to work.  Therefore, to begin to implement your project, practicing the method ‚Äúsplit into segments, modify each segment to an ideal state, and then combine it all at once‚Äù - a spherical horse in a vacuum.  Because you will have to convey everything so many times that the very improvement of individual parts from the very beginning of the project loses its meaning.  So this separation is abstract and exists only in your consciousness.  And this is disastrous for development.

      Today, humanity has a modern car that has a modern wheel.  They developed in parallel.  From the point of view of the person of the beginning of the century, they are ideal.  If we decided to create such a wheel and would work on it from the beginning of the century as a separate project, we would not have our wheel today. <br><br>  Nature would never have thought of working on a birch bud before the appearance of the birch itself.  Every good invention is only a virtual point in general evolution, which has, among other things, a wave nature. <br><br>  Every good project must go through an evolutionary process that is always one and the parts that go through successive stages cannot be divided.  If you want to divide everything in this way, think up for your stages docking APIs that will act as artificial fixation points, the ‚Äúanchors‚Äù of the project, changing the configuration of which you can organically manage the development.  strictly speaking, each API is a description of a certain configuration and will be simultaneously a target for one project, and starting data for another.  In this case, you can develop at the same time, having a guarantee of compatibility of the results at the junction. <br><br>  Why is quality ruining?  Thus, we come to the most important thing.  A project is a bag of resources on which it is written, to what result it should turn.  Resources are always finite, and pray that this end will be happy.  Sooner or later the point will come, which you designated on your earlier graphs with the Latin letter G, and in the later ones, you may have started using its Russian antonym.  So, if the rivet department makes the rivet ideal, which is even 20% better than planned, spending 20% ‚Äã‚Äãfor the sake of a good cause (who will argue?) Resources in the form of 20% exceeding the allotted time and money, for simplicity expressed in clean energy, will not get less charismatic neighbors from the department that deals with, for example, the cooling system. <br><br>  I‚Äôm not saying that airplanes are falling more often because of this, I just want them to stop fighting with bad quality only with the help of quality improvement;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13288/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13288/</a></p>
