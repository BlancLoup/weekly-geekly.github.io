Based on the super-popular series of films, games and other works of mass entertainment of Japan, this game became a reminder of the whole era of the 90s, when the world without exception "went crazy."

      For those who do not know, we will explain.  <b>Pokemon Go is a multiplayer mobile game for iOS and Android platforms, created by Nintendo, The Pok√©mon Company and Niantic.</b>  <b>It uses augmented reality technology.</b>  In short, the mission of the game is to find the so-called Pokemon (English: ‚Äúpocket monster‚Äù - ‚Äúpocket monster‚Äù) from the surrounding reality, collect the collection and ‚Äúpump‚Äù the characteristics of each of the characters.  The technology, in fact, is identical to the one announced in the Google Tango project, which we wrote about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/byyd/blog/303480/"><b>earlier</b></a> .  The reality on the screen of your smartphone is completely transformed into the playing field, not limited in space.  Actually, the development of avid gamers has attracted the opportunity to combine real and virtual reality.  In addition, enjoying the passage of levels in the game, you can simultaneously stay in the fresh air, burning extra calories and solving the problem of insufficient physical activity, so relevant for the modern generation. <br><br>  The whole described situation is just the tip of the iceberg.  Its main part is the growing popularity of smartphones as gaming devices around the world.  This statement confirms the facts from the Facebook survey, which we mentioned at the beginning of the article. <br><br>  So, smartphones have overtaken dextups, tablets and consoles in terms of use as a game device.  Mobile games are beginning to actively reach an audience of women, parents and passengers.  In parallel, they offer significant opportunities for generating profits. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúTraditional single gaming has faded into the background.</i>  <i>Now, mobile games are starting to capture an ever-growing audience that has not previously been involved, ‚Äùthe</i> report says. <br><br>  <b>In 2016, mobile gamers around the world will generate a total of $ 99.6 billion. For the first time, this figure will exceed the level of income from personal computers, which is $ 36.9 billion.</b> <br><br>  To investigate the type of user interaction with mobile games, Facebook conducted a survey among consumers over the age of 18 in 12 countries: North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. <br><br>  We give some figures from the analysis. <br><br>  <b>Widespread mobile gaming</b> <br><br>  The study showed that on average, 71% of consumers use smartphones for gaming, 64% use computers, 34% use tablets and 26% use consoles. <br><br>  This data can help marketers draw conclusions about where and how consumers play games on mobile devices, and to what extent advertising messages aimed at different types of devices at different periods of the day, day can improve the degree of communication with a potential client.  It should be borne in mind that mobile gaming requires less time and a greater level of spontaneity (when the user has entered the elevator / transport / is waiting for a queue at the escalator, etc.). <br><br>  The main indicators in this paragraph is the characteristics of gamers, depending on the reason for being in mobile games.  <b>45% play while waiting, 44% - while traveling in transport or travel, and 21% of consumers play ... ... at work!</b>  Quite a curious application for employers. <br><br>  The survey also showed that players from emerging markets are 1.8 times more likely to use a smartphone as the main game device compared to gamers in developed markets.  In addition, gamers in emerging markets spend 16 minutes more on each game session. <br><br>  <b>The changing "face"</b> <br><br>  Changing the portrait of a typical gamer.  More and more women are involved in the process of mobile gaming.  On average, 47% of mobile gamers are representatives of the beautiful half of humanity, 53% are men. <br><br>  Women prefer puzzle games based on strategies, activities, and card games.  Men are not indifferent to sports games, puzzles and games with a choice of characters (RPG). <br><br>  The active distribution of mobile games also attracts the category of parents, who make up 43% of all users.  The peak of game activity in this audience falls in the evening - obviously, the time after the working day or before the children go to sleep. <br><br>  The survey also revealed some differences between those users who willingly spend money on mobile games, and those who prefer the free version.  Those who choose monetized games will remain loyal to the game with a much greater probability (2.7 times) than fans of free versions.  They are guided, as a rule, by feelings of community and co-involvement in the game process.  2.9 times more such devotees will pay for mobile games. <br><br>  The data also reveals the important role of social media in the distribution of mobile games - 68% of users play mobile games through social networks. <br><br>  <b>New family traditions</b> <br><br>  If we talk about the distribution of the family budget, then 83% of purchases in mobile applications accounted for the purchase of games for children. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn new family traditions it has become the norm when children and parents are connected by mobile games.  This is a field of common interests of two generations ‚Äù- is summarized in the report. <br><br>  In mobile gaming, a large proportion of consumers are parents who are looking for educational and educational games for family and children, which can be played by representatives of different generations. <br><br>  As you can see, the trend in the proliferation of smartphones is gradually switching to all areas of the life of users.  If before, consumers used mobile devices, first of all, to quickly obtain the necessary information, now the entertainment function of such devices is becoming clearer. <br><br>  In this case, marketers need not stay away from global trends, but actively use the possibilities of mobile advertising in games and applications.  Communication with potential customers at this level will allow for the most targeted and effective interaction and gradually increase the level of trust in the brand. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr14072016"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305656/</a></p>
