  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I want my Luna Park with Fortran and C</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another title for this note may be ‚ÄúWhy I‚Äôm no longer interested in being a Russian MVP in the Visual C ++ nomination.‚Äù  The first association that a reader may have is that I no longer care for my obsolete language.  Such associations make me very sad.  C ++ is very much alive.  Unfortunately, in Russia many people do not know about it and are confident that the whole world has been programming only in C #, PHP, Python and other modern languages ‚Äã‚Äãfor a long time.  This is very strange, and I feel lonely in this desert.  About this will be my article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  C / C ++ / C ++ 11 is very much alive </h2><br>  Discuss and confirm this, I do not see the point.  It just is.  I mentioned some of the arguments <a href="http://www.viva64.com/ru/b/0148/">here</a> .  Or here's another small note ‚Äú <a href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php%3Furl%3D872">The C programming language has again become the most popular among developers</a> ‚Äù and a label from it: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c93/19f/c68/c9319fc687a3da1c46d96d91e77df5a4.png"><br>  But most importantly, there are conferences in the world devoted to the C ++ language.  I emphasize.  Not a couple of reports at the conference is dedicated to the C ++ language, but the entire conference.  For example, there was such a <a href="http://www.adcpp.de/Sessions.aspx">two-day conference</a> .  Or, for example, <a href="http://meetingcpp.com/">this conference</a> is planned.  At adjacent conferences, C ++ language is also given considerable attention, and non-children's reports are considered in the spirit of " <a href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php%3Furl%3D874">Modern static security checking of C / C ++ programs</a> ".  In general, there is life, and life is active. <br><br><h2>  Fortran is very much alive </h2><br>  By the way, Fortran is also very much alive.  True, those who use it, do it quietly and not publicly.  From this, an impression is created on the Internet that the use of Fortran is some kind of necromancy. <br><br>  Did you know that the most effective programming language for mathematical calculations is still Fortran?

      The reason is that Fortran is perfectly able to simultaneously handle arrays of data (matrices).  And now, many programmers only have distant plans to switch from Fortran to C ++.  This will happen when matrices appear in C ++.  This someday may well happen.  Intel is promoting this theme in the C ++ Standardization Committee. <br><br>  I will say one more thing.  According to rumors, Intel is making much more money on users of Intel Fortran compilers than on programmers using Intel C ++.  Here is such a "dead" language ... <br><br><h2>  And what about Russia? </h2><br>  What is happening in Russia is not clear.  There are outstanding developers involved in the development of complex C ++ and Fortran projects.  Similarly, there is.  On the same Habr√©, a lot of articles are devoted to just C ++ development.  That is, C ++ programmers are there, interest in the language too. <br><br>  But with the conferences held in Russia, some kind of garbage happens.  They upset me.  The fact that there are no conferences about C ++, I generally keep quiet.  But even just reports on C ++ are extremely few.  And now most of them are devoted to C ++ just as a special case of programming for phones and tablets. <br><br>  More or less about C ++ can be heard at Intel conferences.  But even there, C ++ is considered not as an independent topic, but as an opportunity to make an effective program for Intel processors. <br><br><h2>  MVP Visual C ++ in Russia </h2><br>  I managed to become a Russian MVP on the subject of Visual C ++.  It is symptomatic that I am alone in this nomination.  I understand that Russia is a small country in terms of population and we have few MVPs.  But still somehow strange.  In the private group for MVP, which are connected with the C ++ language, there are heated discussions and correspondence.  For some reason I suspect that in other countries it is not at all one MVP that has a C ++ theme. <br><br>  Actually, DevCon 2012 upset me completely. I understand that the main theme is Windows Phone and Windows 8. However, I pinned some hopes on the conference and planned to communicate with people.  I was naive. <br><br>  For all the time, only ONE person approached me to talk about C ++.  With that, with this man I first met by chance during lunch.  Epic fail. <br><br>  Of course, there is nothing particularly surprising.  Microsoft promoted newfangled things.  Enthusiasts came to hear about them.  C ++ was presented at the conference with just a couple of minor reports. <br><br>  It amazes me more.  Since there was practically no C ++ programmers even at DevCon, what kind of Russian conferences do they attend?  Ay, where are you?  You are there!  There are many C ++ developers and Fortran programmers from academia.  Where is everyone?  After all, surely you also want to share experiences on the topic of C ++.  As I understand it, there is no such exchange now, there are no conferences, nothing. <br><br><h2>  I want my Luna Park </h2><br>  I would be happy to organize a conference on C ++ and Fortran.  It is a pity that I do not have money and other resources for this.  Unfortunately, such an event can organize only less large office or union of small ones. <br><br>  Perhaps I am a dreamer, but I think this could be a very interesting event.  I think a lot of programmers are starving for C ++ / Fortran, not seeing suitable conferences for themselves.  I think there are people who are ready to make interesting reports.  And do not go far.  You could try to call: <br><ul><li>  Those wonderful programmers who write in the blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ABBYYTeam/">ABBYYteam</a> .  As I understand they have a unique experience on the topic of how not to get into a puddle with errors and security.  Without knowing the subject matter, it is impossible to write such pearls as " <a href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php%3Furl%3D767">Overwrite memory - why?</a> ".  It is very interesting to learn more about their experience. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php%3Furl%3D876">Dmitry Vyukov</a> could tell a lot about synchronization problems in parallel computing.  And also about the tool <a href="http://www.viva64.com/go.php%3Furl%3D875">Relacy Race Detector he created</a> . </li><li>  The topic of interviews is always very popular.  I think the author of the post " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/117996/">Popular questions at a C ++ interview and answers to them</a> " could interest many people by developing this topic in the report. </li><li>  The author of " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/136283/">I do not know Sy</a> " could play with the participants of the conference in "find a mistake." </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/olekl/">Alexander</a> could make an interesting review of static code analyzers. </li><li>  You can find other people with interesting topics, both on Habr√© and other parts of the Internet. </li></ul><br>  Hopefully, over time, there will be a company that wants to organize a conference not about newfangled tools, but about industrial programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C, C ++, C ++ 11, Objective-C, Fortran) and related tools.  I'm still in the bushes until better times. <br><br>  Such a company could be, for example, ABBYY or 1C.  They like, both under the force and useful.  It is useful in that it is a good way to acquire information about many C ++ programmers.  And as I understand it, they are very popular there. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  No conclusions.  He told about his sadness to you.  It became easier. <br><br>  I hope this article will serve as one of the little kicks, towards those who organize conferences.  Let them see what is interesting to people.  Suddenly, and in our country will begin to discuss serious programming, and not just fashion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147129/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147129/</a></p>
