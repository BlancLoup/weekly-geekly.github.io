The latest addition of ML.NET adds value to the entire system.  The main goal is to introduce and develop your own Artificial Intelligence for the model and get the most suitable setting when creating applications. <br><br>  In general, ML.NET machine learning is designed to use and create common tasks that include regression, classification, recommendation, ranking, clustering, and anomaly detection.  Not only that, but also the additional support of the open source ecosystem makes it popular thanks to the integration of infrastructure with deep learning.  One of the companies is currently working on the compatibility of the entire system with use cases that work with different scenarios, such as sales forecast, image classification, mood analysis, etc. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Updates for ML.NET 0.11</b> <br><br>  There is no doubt that the upgrade to 0.11 took a new turn during the development phase.  It improved overall functionality with Microsoft technology associate, which helped dot net thrive.  There are various timeframes that ML.NET 0.11 works on, such as: <br><br>  <b>ONNX</b> is a compatible and open platform that helps describe the network structure so that you can use different frameworks, such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn and xgboost for another environment, which in this case is ML.NET.  In addition, the whole concept was known as Microsoft.ML.ONNX Converter, which was converted from Microsoft.ML.ONNX.  Whereas, the name Mmicrosoft.ML.ONNX Transformer has been assigned to Microsoft.ML.ONNC Transorm.  This makes it easy to distinguish between ONNX transformation and transformation. <br><br>  Another deep learning scenario, along with a machine learning structure, concerns TensorFlow.  The image classification model is supported in ML.NET using the TensorFlow model in the previous form.  The latest release in Microsoft app development for 11.0 adds value to the model system.  This will work well with a model's mood analysis, also called text analysis.  All that it depends on is the code that the installation will work on. <br><br>  <b>ML.NET 0.11 recent changes</b> <br><br>  There are a number of differences between the settings in version 0.11 and 0.10. <br><br>  Here is a list of major changes: <br><br>  <b>1. Community</b> <br><br>  No doubt the dot net community is one of the largest in Google.  All of them provide several samples for working with software.  However, they are not available from Microsoft and they do not support all this.  But they support common patterns and demonstrations by the ML.NET community for URLs and a brief description of the best blogs and repositories.  In addition, community examples work great on the page. <br><br>  <b>2. Production Planning</b> <br><br>  The main thing in the ML.NET application is its influence on the work.  Engineers work closely with the platform at the planning stage, followed by a common average flow.  This implementation is easily performed on the system to make the application successful.  In addition, potential and demo applications work well with the home page to get the proper flow to work.  This forces the Microsoft channel to work on it with precision and a chore of work. <cut></cut><br><br>  <b>3. Feature Contribution Calculation</b> <br><br>  Microsoft technology associate is working on the concept of the FCC, which helps to predict the model as influential.  The forecast helps to save general individual data and even specific information for the mark in order to determine the functions that are listed.  This gives an estimate of the model to obtain an accurate result according to the generated data. <br><cut></cut><br>  The type of initial concept is important for the FCC workflow for attributes and functions in order to get the proper flow to it.  It also helps with historical data to analyze features with important aspects.  It is also important to know the estimate, because perhaps this will reduce the performance of the model in the case of more functions.  Therefore, every positive and negative aspect is of great value to the whole system. <br><br>  <b>4. IData View</b> <br><br>  This is the moment that was present in version .10., However, in version 0.11 there are certain differences.  This component offers compositional and efficient table-based processing that makes prediction and machine learning easier.  In addition, dimensional data can be easily processed by the machine even in the form of large data sets.  This is a big plus, and now the image will be more accurate. <br><br>  Such processing of a single node helps in the distribution of common data, which can be distributed among data sets according to membership.  NuGet and standalone builds are also enhanced, which helps in developing Microsoft applications at every stage. <br><br>  <i>Conclusion</i> <cut></cut><br><br>  Now is the time to master the latest version of ML.NET.  All tutorials, documentation and tutorials are available online.  In addition to this, you can find code samples.  This will simplify the task. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444846/</a></p>
