    <h2>  A tangle of wires and bulky home acoustics cabinets - what to do with all this? </h2><br>  Hi-Fi class speakers have long ceased to be a luxury item and have become an indispensable attribute of a modern home.  Being a full-fledged element of interior design, acoustics can become its harmonious continuation or completely destroy its perception. <br><br>  Take care of this preferably at an early stage of repair.  To do this, even there are specially trained people who can give advice on the installation of equipment, based on information about the size, shape of the room, finishing materials and interior. <br><br>  One of the most common problems that worries our customers is wires.  The fact is that the windows of most stores do not show all the technical nuances that can arise with the direct use of audio systems. <br><br>  The buyer sees beautiful photographic materials and simply forgets about such trifles as cable management.  Of course, there are wireless systems on the Hi-Fi and Hi-End equipment markets today, but they also work from the network, so there is no way to get rid of all the wires. <br><br>  There are many solutions to this problem.  For example, there is specialized furniture, which provides a convenient location of "iron" and the possibility of laying the cable in the hidden walls of furniture.  In this case, the manufacturer of such furniture takes into account all the nuances, up to the possible heating of the equipment. <br><br>  In most situations, this approach allows you to reduce the time for preparatory work, not to make walls, and the most important thing is to arrange the audio system so that it not only sounds good, but also looks decent. <br><br>  Today it is not customary to show off bulky equipment as it was fashionable in the 80s.  People think primarily about ergonomics and efficient use of space.  Some <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/cat-6.html">solutions</a> can be easily ordered and built into the interior, but in certain situations it is worth consulting with a specialist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/091/ab8/242/091ab82422424e6abe1ae16aaddbe00d.png"><br>  <i>/ <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/installation/">Ready projects of Audiomania</a></i> <br><br>  If we continue the topic of convenience, it is worth noting a huge number of hardware management solutions using smartphones and tablets.  We in Audiomania use a system called Bitvise, which solves the necessary tasks and does not cause inconvenience in customization. <br><br>  Such systems provide enough flexibility to adapt the controls to your own design.  The system works via Wi-Fi, and we can turn on music from anywhere in the house. <br><br>  Thus you can work with the management of the entire home theater system, and if you do not want to buy specialized furniture, you can move all the equipment to another room.  Such a room can be quite compact, the only condition is sufficient ventilation. <br><br><h2>  I have my own restaurant, but the old acoustics from the house looks strange.  What am I doing wrong? </h2><br>  Unfortunately, very often the owners of bars, restaurants and cafes do not pay enough attention to the acoustics of the room.  There is a myth about expensive professional equipment, so people often buy home or car audio equipment and use it for other purposes.  As a result, it quickly fails, because only professional equipment is designed for a long permanent load. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPeople are trying to reinvent the wheel.  Probably, they are guided by the fact that professional equipment, and the word ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù always scares everyone, will be worth more. <br><br>  Professional speaker systems that are designed for voice and background music are cheap, ‚Äùsays <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/timshick/">Timofey Shikolenkov</a> , director of marketing and business development in Audiomania. </blockquote><br>  In this case, it is worth thinking about the conditions of the environment in which the system will be used.  For open air need waterproof and frost-resistant speakers.  Here it is necessary to consider the class of protection from moisture.  It‚Äôs one thing if it‚Äôs about the open veranda of a restaurant, and another if it‚Äôs about a sauna with a completely different level of humidity. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThere are very interesting and beautiful landscape solutions.  It is necessary to carefully read, for which application they are, external or internal.  If the column looks like a beautiful pebble, it does not mean that it can be put on the track.  We need to see what class protection from moisture. <br><br>  If it is assumed that the column will be placed in the lowland, then the equipment must be of the appropriate class, or it is necessary to reorient and move the column to another place.  In principle, nothing will change, plus or minus half a meter is not very important, and the system will delight you and guests for much longer, ‚ÄùTimofey shares his experience. </blockquote><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e62/552/88c/e6255288c078493d84045afc5029e3b2.jpg" width="400"></div><br>  <i>/ <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/vlagostojkaya_akustika/visaton/visaton_frs_10_wp_8.html">Visaton FRS 10 WP / 8</a> columns are made in plastic cases with integrated protective mesh, which gives them a neat appearance and good moisture resistance.</i> <br><br>  Design and installation of professional audio systems require appropriate knowledge and experience.  Therefore, if you are worried about the comfort of guests and the image of your establishment, you should contact a specialized company. <br><br>  Home system here just does not fit.  For the background sound, as well as periodic voice announcements, so-called ‚Äúbroadcasting‚Äù equipment is usually used.  Sometimes it is called "100-volt."  Abroad there is an established term - "public address". <br><br>  Such systems allow you to transmit sound over distances up to several hundred meters.  If in traditional Hi-Fi systems it is necessary to pull a separate cable to each column, then in the case of ‚Äúpublic address‚Äù systems this is not required.  You can connect as many speakers in parallel as you need. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzJLbhKkNpQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Special <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/multiroom_player/">multiroom players</a> , <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/microphone/">microphones</a> , and other sound sources can be used as a sound source.  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/miksher_usilitel/">The mixer amplifier</a> , to which the speakers are connected, amplifies the signal supplied to it and, if necessary, distributes it. <br><br>  You can have a separate outdoor veranda with your own music or a VIP room where no alerts will sound.  When choosing an amplifier, it is recommended to consider a small power reserve so that it does not work at the limit. <br><br>  <i>PS Additional reading on the topic: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/282058/">What you need to know about modern audio systems</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398879/</a></p>
