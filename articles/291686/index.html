More and more machines interact with each other, and companies have at their disposal vast amounts of new information.

      The industry's potential is enormous: the McKinsey Global Institute <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/in_the_news/all_things_online">predicts</a> that the Internet of Things can accelerate the global economy in the amount of $ 2.7 to $ 6.2 trillion annually until 2025. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The success of this new ecosystem will depend on a reliable cloud infrastructure that manages all sensors, devices and data.  More and more companies <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/13790/" title="IBM invests in its own IoT division">are striving to integrate</a> existing infrastructure for IoT devices by accessing public and hybrid clouds to manage and scale their systems.  Correct cloud offerings <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10552/" title="Startups can grow faster if their roots are in the cloud">will allow</a> companies to store and process data collected by IoT for future use. <br><br>  However, the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/13746/" title="IDC Research Company Announces Smart Market Growth">speed of introducing IoT devices</a> introduces a large number of new problems that will need to be addressed as the business accelerates to cloud technologies. <br><br>  Indeed, the size of the IoT sector itself creates external attacks of unprecedented scale by the rapid proliferation (proliferation) of connected devices.  Such changes, the lack of standardized protocols and platforms, represent a new potential headache for the IT industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/7af/064/dcf7af0647ce4aeb8bc8617aa8bb6ac9.jpg" alt="bruce"><br><br>  Anything that is controlled by a computer can be hacked or <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/14900/" title="How annoying apps spend Android users data">compromised by</a> someone.  In order to imagine such a development, it is not necessary to be a desperate pessimist or paranoid.  Everything can go wrong and deliberately and no.  For this class of devices, vulnerabilities have already been found and widely reported in the press.  Hacking smart TV, electronic droppers, pacemakers, electronic systems of cars and other equipment is news only for people who are not really interested in the topic.  With a trillion devices involved, the network becomes especially vulnerable, which causes well-deserved concerns. <br><br>  Moreover, the vast majority of devices that are not phones, laptops or tablets do not receive automatic updates, and in many cases, the end user cannot update the device firmware at all. <br><br><h4>  Let's try to highlight the most important IoT problems that require a quick solution: </h4><br><ul><li><h4>  Standardization of protocols and interfaces </h4>  This is generally an eternal problem in IT.  Remember at least how many mines are broken on the battlefields for the standardization of html and css.  I am silent about the battles of the telecoms that had died away. </li><li><h4>  Vulnerabilities and other security issues </h4>  It's one thing when a smart watch goes crazy, and another when a portable pacemaker.  In my opinion, the most real problem of the sector.  How many scholars will try to hack such devices just for fun is unknown.  What kind of security will need to use too.  And if you imagine a botnet of hundreds of millions of household and not very devices?  Imagine how millions of dummies, refrigerators and fitness trackers show off the server at the command of a smart toaster?  Of course, now this is still <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/51290/uspokoytes-kiberterrorizma-ne-sushhe/" title="Calm down: cyber terrorism does not exist [Computerra]">far away</a> , but not in such a distant future. </li><li><h4>  Network collapse </h4>  Today, networks still cope with data flows and telecoms are intensively developing them, but what if information flows increase hundreds of times?  So far, nothing cooler than fiber optic lines has not yet been invented, and this technology also has its limits.  Okay, still transport routes, there seems to be still more or less, and there is always a dead ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù? </li><li><h4>  Data Centers and Computing Capabilities </h4>  Rapidly increasing data flow creates the dual problem of processing and storage, which must be addressed by data processing and storage centers.  With this, everything is not so bad, after all, Google has been keeping an eye on our world for a long time, but it‚Äôs not for nothing that the term <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/15558/" title="Big data. Breakwater preparation">‚Äúdata tsunami‚Äù appeared</a> . </li></ul><br>  Thus, the solution of the problems of the new sector falls entirely on the shoulders of the IT industry.  These are, of course, growing pains that promise to be part of another transitional stage in the history of disruptive technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291686/</a></p>
