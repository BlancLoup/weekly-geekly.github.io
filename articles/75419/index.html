A lot of training hours, a lot of homework, all sorts of tests, tests and exams do not allow to sleep well.  But each problem has several solutions, including educational ones.  The following services will help you, my dear student, to really facilitate your learning. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/8682/dropbox.jpg">

      Surprisingly simple and useful service that allows users to quickly share the necessary files.  Although one snag is still there - you need to somehow persuade your classmates to install the program on their computers.  Believe me, this is the most difficult stage of working with the program, lazy comrades prefer to sit in contact, rather than do at least something to learn.  And then everything is simple - after registration and installation, a shared My Dropbox daddy is created on users' computers, the files in which become available to all users of the program.  The benefit for everyone is obvious - you can always find the right lectures, books, textbooks, tasks for labs or workshops. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b><a href="http://www.evernote.ru/">Evernote</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/6403/evernote.png"><br><br>  Usually in the head of a typical student there is complete chaos, the aforementioned service can streamline it a little.  The program can systematize all the interesting and necessary material.  Ideas, thoughts, ideas, links, rss-feeds, articles, etc. - Evernote will remember everything.  At any time, you can save information using any device connected to the Internet, and then access it again and use it at your discretion.  You can work with the service from anywhere: from a computer, laptop, smartphone, except from a payphone. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://desktop.scribbler.ru/">Scribbler Desktop</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img81.imageshack.us/img81/1139/scribbler.jpg"><br><br>  It looks like a normal desktop, created for storing, sharing and working with files.  It has most of the functions of a regular desktop, in addition, it has been washed down with an mp3 player and a radio.  You can register the entire group on the Scribbler (again, the most difficult phase of the work) and use the Desktop to share files.  The limit on file size is 1.5 gig.  You can also interact with files through the <a href="http://scribbler.ru/developers">API.</a> Previously, I have not seen such services in runet, so <a href="http://desktop.scribbler.ru/download/file/1866">here‚Äôs a video</a> from the development team that demonstrates the main features of the Desktop. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/">Remember The Milk</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/4835/rememberthemilk.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, this is a regular organizer, but unlike a paper colleague, this service will remind you of all upcoming events.  You do as you usually do: make a note in the organizer, close it, and you forgot everything forever.  Remember The Milk can send you text messages with notifications, can write to ICQ, to e-mail, to Skype, Google Talk and many more where.  So you and your short memory will surely be satisfied. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.xmind.net/">Xmind</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img524.imageshack.us/img524/4319/xmind.png"><br><br>  Service to work with Mind Map'ami.  Literally translated as a map of the mind, literary - a scheme of thinking, although there is still no exact translation.  Wikipedia believes that the mind map is a way of depicting the process of general systems thinking with the help of diagrams.  Simply put, you will build a diagram of your thoughts, which will allow you to cope with the huge flow of information, plan your time correctly and find solutions to complex problems.  The very scheme of thinking looks something like this: <img src="http://img264.imageshack.us/img264/3169/mindmapl.jpg" alt="Image Hosted by ImageShack.us"><br>  But in your case, the thought card will look different, in accordance with your thoughts, desires and goals. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google docs</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img175.imageshack.us/img175/5514/googledocs.png"><br><br>  Working together on labs, spurs and other educational materials - students of past years are really jealous of the current generation.  Each makes its own amendments, comments and additions.  The first creates a report on the lab, the second - complements it, the next one does something else - this is how all the necessary materials are created.  Simple, fast, useful.  And again, the main problem - lazy classmates.  Although smart people immediately see their benefit from the use of this service, well, let the cattle really get out of their way. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google reader</a></b> <br><br><img src="http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/8969/rssy.jpg"><br><br>  With it, you can read all the interesting you rss-feeds.  In principle, any rss reader will cope with this task, but I chose Google Reader.  Why?  I just have a Google account, I did not have to register to use this program.  That's all, as always everything is extremely simple. <br><br>  Everything is much easier than it seems.  The main thing - to use all the features to the fullest.  Found something interesting for yourself? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75419/</a></p>
