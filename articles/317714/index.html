  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Immigration with the Crimea to Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Inspired by reading immigration on Habr√©, I decided to tell the story of one very extraordinary move from one country to another. <br><br><h3>  From where to where </h3><br>  I will not describe the reasons for immigration, there are many points of view on this topic, let's leave it beyond the scope of the article, but regarding the direction - everything is simple - from Ukraine to Russia.  Although it is customary to write about the fears and thoughts that haunt leaving the homeland, this does not apply to our situation.  There were no particular fears, there were no strong hopes, there was a feeling that everything that happens is not real.  Awareness came as immersion in the new reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08e/642/75f/08e64275f4b219965168b5b256a590fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Immigration process </h3><br>  "Relocation" took at least six months.  It was a strange period, it was very difficult to evaluate the pros or cons of the new state, it was only difficult to find a job.  The majority of Ukrainian companies have curtailed and left the peninsula, in rare cases, offering employees a move to the mainland while maintaining their positions.  Russian companies were in no hurry to occupy the vacated niches.  In short, life has paused to the soundtrack of bright promises of prosperity and a happy future, sounding from all regional and federal channels.  It is strange that local entrepreneurs lost time and waited for the arrival of major players, not trying to occupy niches on their own, thereby strengthening their position in the region.  Perhaps the southern - a relaxed-lazy mentality did not allow to make decisive actions.

    <h3>  IT direction </h3><br>  The already underdeveloped direction in the Crimea simply perished as a species.  No, I didn‚Äôt fall asleep by turning off all energy-consuming processes, namely, they died.  Everyone who was involved in the IT world faced a choice: go to Ukraine, or get Russian citizenship and go looking for work in Krasnodar, Rostov, etc.  The lack of a banking system, sanctions, the meager number of vacancies in the region did not allow staying at home.  Only a few remained: which families kept or who worked on freelancing and were able to adapt to an unstable banking system. <br><br>  At that time, I was to become a father from day to day, and my attitude to the Crimea did not allow me to leave my native land.  At first I was interrupted by orders from freelancing, putting money on the card, without being able to cash it.  A couple of gas stations were saved in Simferopol and Auchan, which allowed the refrigerator to be filled by paying for purchases with a card.  In other stores, my card could only cheer sellers.  I had to be on duty several times at gas stations, pestering customers with a request to pay for their fuel with a card, and pick up the cash for themselves.  After three or four months, representative offices of Russian banks began to open, which allowed for a little exhalation. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt imagine that I could work from home, but the situation and the sense of responsibility towards my family were hopeless for me. <br><br>  The second major problem in the way of any freelancer in the Crimea was the quality and stability of the Internet connection and the energy situation.  The Internet or the light could disappear for a day and it has already ceased to amaze.  Each time, stipulating a time with the customer had to warn and lay a couple of days (per week) in case of force majeure.  Surprisingly, customers from Europe and America were quite at ease with my location.  They were interested in the situation and accepted the deadlines.  Mobile communications in the region also left much to be desired, but this had little effect on work. <br><br><h3>  check in </h3><br>  Regarding the official registration: to obtain citizenship and the status of individual entrepreneurs turned out within a month after the transition to Russia, thanks to the consultations of friends from Moscow.  It was useless to consult local tax authorities, but all procedures were fairly quick and painless, which could not be said about other services (passport offices, FMS, pension, etc.), their premises more resembled the stereotype about American supermarkets in black friday.  Queues, crowds, screams, fights. <br><br>  Regarding the tax system as a whole, if we compare what was and how it became: <br><br>  The first thing that catches your eye is the forced exit from the shadow of most enterprises.  In Ukraine, working in the shadows was the norm, companies engaged in cash-outs, unless they were not advertised on TV.  Everyone knew it and suited everyone.  Perhaps, forced life by law and in white is the main irritating factor for businessmen and entrepreneurs in the Crimea so far. <br><br>  The second difference is the difficulties in taxation, reporting and accounting in general.  In Ukraine, there was an accessible and understandable single tax system that allows you to register as a private entrepreneur (similar to private entrepreneurs in Russia) and pay a monthly fixed tax of 200 hryvnia (600 rubles for those times) regardless of profit (only annual income was limited).  Cash discipline and the ability to work with cash were much easier and more loyal. <br><br><h3>  Adaptation </h3><br>  More than two years have passed, a lot of things had to be endured, which is now remembered with a smile, and at that time it scared the cold sweat.  Last year‚Äôs famous black out, when the whole Crimea was left without a light for almost a month, already caused only mild discomfort, on the other hand - so many romantic dinners by candlelight, so much time spent with the family, so many visits to the Crimea did not happen to the Crimea. . <br><br>  The situation with IT is getting better; the corresponding section of vacancies on popular sites is already pleasing with diversity.  And specialists from other regions of Russia often began to respond to the position of developers.  As of today, I am the head of a small development team in the Crimea, which is part of one Moscow IT-company. <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  You can somehow relate to the status of the Crimea, to its problems with service and prices.  For me, Crimea has always been an amazing place where you could sit in the office until 18:00, and have dinner with your family at the seashore at 19:00. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> At the request of readers: <br><br>  In Ukraine: earned ~ $ 1500, spent on renting an apartment $ 200, for food + walking ~ $ 800. <br><br>  Now: earning ~ $ 2,000, for food, for a family it takes ~ $ 600 (thanks to the optimization of the wife), the apartment is its own, but in the market it is only $ 400- $ 500. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317714/</a></p>
