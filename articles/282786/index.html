However, many analysts do not exclude the possibility that we are on the verge of a second digital revolution. <br><br>  However, the recently passed Earth Day prompted us to consider the issue more broadly - it was an excellent opportunity to study how the Internet of things, and even more likely the industrial Internet of things (M2M - machine-to-machine), that is, wireless transmission of data and information between devices and objects, can have a beneficial effect on our lives and will contribute to sustainable development and environmental protection on our interconnected planet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c49/6ce/d47/c496ced470af443383ced4d1f83768dd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Gartner forecasts, by 2020 there will be about 25 billion smartphones, smart watches, wearable electronics, cars connected to the network and other devices with network access on the planet.  But what else, besides enhancing business efficiency and many different benefits for health and living standards, does the Internet of Things bring?  What role can it play in the ecological future of our planet and, for example, in protecting endangered species?

      Experts predict that in the next few years, the cost of sensors will drop sharply.  In addition, new wireless technologies with lower power consumption and increased range, such as Long Range Radio (LoRa), will be widely adopted.  All this means that, thanks to the Internet of Things, many new opportunities are opening up to environmental and environmental organizations, in particular, the ability to track changes in global development indicators and to measure Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with high accuracy. <br><br><h2>  Problems of sustainable development and M2M technology: how new technologies help beekeepers to get out of the crisis </h2><br>  In the course of numerous discussions and debates about the prospects of applications that use machine-to-machine interaction (M2M), it turns out that projects aimed at preserving sustainable development and protecting the environment can fully unleash the true potential of IoT revolution - and use the opportunities to solve the most pressing and pressing problems in industry, agriculture and environmental protection. <br><br>  In view of the foregoing, it should be noted that today there are a number of very interesting ideas related to the application of IoT in the field of sustainable development, and already ongoing projects using M2M technology, which should be discussed separately.  For example, in Gemalto, we are working on a curious M2M project that aims to help solve the global crisis in the beekeeping industry with the help of much-needed agricultural innovations. <br><br>  The population of bees in Europe and America has been rapidly declining in the last decade - beekeepers from all over the world report this sudden trend.  For example, in the United States, the number of colonies of bees has decreased by 90% since 1962, due to the use of pesticides, insufficient activity of bees in the wild, as well as the spread of diseases and parasites.  In many ways, the disappearance of bees is associated with the spread of the Varroa destructor tick, which carries viruses that can instantly destroy entire colonies of these insects. <br>  If the decline in the population of bees continues at the same pace, by 2035 these insects may disappear from the face of the Earth.  The disappearance of bees not only threatens with the loss of honey, but also threatens the yields of fruits, vegetables, berries, nuts and some cereals.  Pollination of many plants and, therefore, their yield is completely dependent on the activity of bees.  One bee colony can pollinate about 3 million flowers per day. <br><br>  To help solve this problem, we started working with Eltopia, a company specializing in technology for the agricultural industry.  In particular, they have developed a pesticide-free technology that uses the Internet, which helps destroy the Varroa destructor ticks in bee hives.  The MiteNot project, led by Professor Marla Spivak from the University of Minnesota, uses the Gemalto Machine-to-Machine Interaction Module (M2M) and software developed by Eltopia for the agricultural industry.  This project is designed to prevent and stop the decline of the global population of bees using the "smart hive framework," which automatically controls and regulates the temperature in the hive. <br><br>  The essence of the technology comes down to the fact that beekeepers place a flexible printed circuit board in a hive so that it can accurately track when the bees sit in a honeycomb and begin to print honey.  Previously, it was at this point that the female Varroa destructor mite laid eggs in the hive, but now, thanks to the wireless connection via our M2M module to the BeeSafe application developed by Eltopa, the temperature in the hives can automatically increase until the unfertilized mite eggs are destroyed without causing any harm to bees. <br>  The MiteNot hive frame is one of the best examples of how IoT and M2M innovations can be used to protect the environment.  The new frame is made of renewable resources - made of corn starch, covered with wax and, according to the developers, completely resembles and serves as a traditional frame.  For beekeepers, it‚Äôs enough to install the old MiteNot framework in the hives, and with the help of the Eltopia BeeSafe application, they will be able to track and change the parameters of 32 individual elements in the hive. <br>  The MiteNot frame is biodegradable, non-toxic and does not contain pesticides.  ‚ÄúThe MiteNot project promises to be one of the most successful and effective solutions to this problem in a very long time, perhaps even in the entire history of the fight against this tick,‚Äù says Professor Spivak. <br><br>  Reducing the global population of bees can fundamentally change the future of food security on our planet: bees pollinate more than two thirds of the one hundred most important crops that are food for about 90% of the world's population.  The disappearance of bees would have absolutely devastating consequences for the whole of agriculture. <br><br><h2>  The green future of IoT applications and interconnected planet </h2><br>  The Internet of Things has enormous potential and is able to help humanity in creating a truly environmentally friendly, sustainable and interconnected planet.  At present, there are already numerous projects in the world designed to monitor the state of the environment and prevent all kinds of accidents and environmental disasters - including initiatives to measure water levels and prevent floods, to monitor the state of protected tropical forests in order to prevent illegal deforestation, as well as close monitoring of the status of populations of endangered species in order to prevent their extinction. <br><br>  As you know, deforestation can be found by noise and flying chips.  However, in Brazil, in the rainforests of the Amazonia, they invented a new, noiseless way to warn the authorities about illegal logging using a text messaging service. <br><br>  The rainforests, covering 5.5 million square kilometers, are home to about 10% of all animal species in the world, however, since 1970, the Amazon rain forests have lost about a fifth of their area.  Even in 2012, when the rate of deforestation reached its minimum value, more than 7,500 square kilometers of forest were still destroyed. <br><br>  Nearly 63% of all rain forests in Amazonia are located in Brazil, and the government of this country actively invests in various projects aimed at minimizing illegal logging.  One of such initiatives is to photograph the forest from space.  This technique has proven itself to identify large-scale illegal deforestation areas, but black loggers can easily bypass such control simply by cutting down the forest in many small areas. <br><br>  Today, as part of a pilot program, trees in the protected zone of the Brazilian rainforests are equipped with devices with a cellular communication module, called Invisible Tracck.  This device was developed by Cargo Tracck, a company specializing in the development of solutions for chasing and tracking, and uses Gemalto Cinterion technology to implement machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. <br><br>  The Invisible Tracck device is equipped with a BGS2 communication module (this is the world's smallest GSM-module LGA installation module, designed for M2M solutions that require voice and high-speed GPRS).  If an illegal activity is detected, this module sends an alert to the Cargo Tracck rapid response center with information about its location.  The module operates at a distance of 30 km from the base station.  Upon receipt of such a signal, Cargo Tracck experts inform the Brazilian authorities, in particular, the environmental protection agency, that one of the trees on which the device was installed is moving somewhere. <br><br>  The first difficulty was to design a device that would work without breakdowns in the most difficult conditions of the vast forests of the Amazon: 2.3 years of precipitation falls on average in a year!  Yes, you were not mistaken, meters! <br><br>  So, the task is completed: a highly reliable device has been created that can work for more than a year without recharging, which uses the new Radiation Exchange Data technology, which allows to increase the reception area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe device even with a weak signal. <br><br>  But most importantly, the Invisible Tracck device is very compact.  By its dimensions, it is not more than a deck of cards, and it is difficult to detect it without a careful examination of the tree.  The creators of the device are hoping that it will stop the lumberjacks from trying to smuggle illegally cut trees. <br><br>  Living ecosystems are essentially complex networks, and it is here that low-cost wireless technologies and long-range IoT sensors come to help us monitor these ecosystems, analyze their livelihoods and manage their development.  M2M communications allow environmental organizations to recognize all kinds of risks and threats to the environment much earlier than was possible before and to take the necessary measures to avoid such threats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/090/aaf/11c/090aaf11c8d44eee817da3fe0239f8f1.png"><br><br>  Such types of initiatives are irrefutable evidence that IoT is already actively used in a number of critical environmental projects.  IoT provides enterprises, legislatures, environmental organizations and other interested parties with tremendous opportunities to create more intelligent and much more useful solutions from an environmental point of view. <br><br>  In other words, the upcoming boom of intelligent IoT devices and M2M networks, which is expected in the next few years, will have a significant impact on the environment and will contribute to the development of many more interesting, innovative and useful initiatives in the field of sustainable development - starting with network-connected homes and intelligent traffic management systems and water supply in a smart city, and ending with new large-scale environmental projects using M2M technologies.  One way or another, the Internet of Things will play an important role in the ecological future of our interconnected planet. <br><br>  <b>We invite you to the nearest Gemalto webinar to appreciate the role of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that we and our devices create every day:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Data, the new oil: Find out what it means for your organization</b> (‚ÄúData is like new oil, and what it means for your company.‚Äù) <br>  Time: May 5, 2016 (Thursday), 1PM CET <br>  Reference for participation: <a href="http://www6.gemalto.com/e/51442/webcast-6319-198941/66j2j3/299788842">www6.gemalto.com/e/51442/webcast-6319-198941/66j2j3/299788842</a> <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282786/</a></p>
