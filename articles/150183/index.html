  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forecasting the effectiveness of internet marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  In the course of writing a term paper on the topic of Internet marketing, I did not find the models proposed earlier for predicting the useful effect of using Internet marketing, and as a result I developed my own forecasting model. <br>  The use of Internet marketing in the first place (the decision was a consequence of the analysis of other factors) depends on the following indicators: <br><a name="habracut"></a>  1. - The degree of monopolization of the industry in which the organization operates.  The rule follows from this: <b>the higher the competition - the higher the use of internet marketing by the organization.</b>  Of course, there are exceptions.  <i>An example would be grocery, shoe, etc.</i> <br><br>  2. - The specificity of the industry itself market.  The concentration of companies using Internet marketing is directly dependent on the type of industry.  It is obvious that: <b>the more the company is compatible with the IT industry, the higher the level of use of Internet marketing.</b>  Let's say it is easier to sell things through the Internet that are not necessary to touch and measure for their purchase: <i>programs, CDs, cars, vouchers, home appliances, computers, etc.</i> <br><br>  3. - Innovation.  One of the most important factor in the organization‚Äôs focus on Internet marketing is the company's innovation.  <b>The higher the innovation, the higher the likelihood that the company will use Internet marketing.</b>

      4. Target audience of the global network.  Because  The target audience to which the methods are directed, Internet marketing is directly dependent on the target audience of using the Internet.  <b>The closer the target audience of the organization to the target Internet user, the more often the company uses Internet marketing.</b> <br><br>  5. The level of customization of the product or service.  This factor is the last, due to the fact that the impact on the degree of use is not constant and direct.  But often: <b>the more a product or service is customized, the higher the use of internet marketing by the company.</b> <br>  Based on these factors, you can make a visual diagram of the degree of influence of each factor.  For this, we will take vivid examples of each of the factors: <br>  1) Gazprom - an energy company <br>  2) Apple is a computer innovation company. <br>  3) H &amp; M is a popular youth clothing store. <br>  4) Daddiesbordshop - the famous store selling boards and related products (USA, Portland). <br><br> <a href="http://imglink.ru/"><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/24-08-12/4f5ac66bac001326b0a5da74d74630be.jpg" alt="image hosting"></a> <br><br>  The study found that the graph gives us a clear notion of the degree of use of Internet marketing based on the 5 factors described above.  The larger the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pentagon, the more attention is paid to the Internet marketing company.  The formula for determining the area of ‚Äã‚Äãa polygon is used to quantify this indicator.  Due to some circumstances, the area will be calculated using the triangulation method. <br>  To determine the area, we take for the maximum value of each scale - 10. We divide each figure into triangles and calculate their areas using the formula: <br>  <b>S = 1 \ 2ah.</b> <br>  Therefore, the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe pentagon can be written as <br>  <b>S = (S1, S2, ..., Sn)</b> <br>  where n is the number of the triangle of which this pentagon consists. <br>  The maximum possible value of 172 is the use of each of the factors by 100%.  For this particular case, we received: <br><br>  Organization% ratio <br>  IDEAL - 172 - 100% <br>  Gazprom - 4.62 - 2.75% <br>  Apple 129.37 - 75.21% <br>  H &amp; M - 61.50 - 35.75% <br>  Daddies - 109 - 63.37% <br><br>  This method allows you to predict the degree of importance of using Internet marketing and the success of the marketing mix in the global network.  Based on the data obtained through factor analysis, the organization‚Äôs management is able to decide for itself whether companies need to add internet marketing to their marketing tools.  Its main advantages are: <br>  1 - visual impact of factors <br>  2 - the ability to predict the importance of internet marketing <br>  3 - designations of factors that are worth paying attention to if your organization is already engaged in internet marketing <br>  4 - sufficient ease of calculation <br>  5 - flexibility of the distribution of factors and its subsequent customization. <br>  To determine the viability of Internet marketing is proposed to introduce a scale: <br><br>  No. Meaning What to do <br>  1 0-10% For organizations of such importance, in the sphere of the Internet, it will be interesting to promote a brand and create a positive PR <br>  2 11-25% Organizations with values ‚Äã‚Äãin this range will be interested in promotions, SEO, branding, creating a positive PR and creating a personal website. <br>  3 26-50% Organizations that have values ‚Äã‚Äãin this range will be interested in promotions, SEO, a small piece of media marketing, branding, creating a positive PR and creating a personal website with a forum and more detailed information about products and services. <br>  4 51-70% It will be interesting for organizations that have values ‚Äã‚Äãin this range to conduct promotions, SEO, media marketing, branding, creating a positive PR and creating a personal website with a forum and more detailed information about products and services with the possibility of acquiring on-line, use SMM. <br>  5 71-100% Organizations that have values ‚Äã‚Äãin this range will be interested in conducting promotions, SEO, media marketing, branding, creating a positive PR and creating a personal website with a forum and more detailed information on products and services with the possibility of acquiring on-line, using SMM, using all possible internet marketing tools. <br><br>  Thus, having analyzed oneself through the prism of this method, the top management of an organization can easily say whether they should be engaged in internet marketing or not. <br><br>  This evaluation method is not ideal for determining the rate of use of internet marketing by a company.  It is worth noting that today it is the only one of the developed methods for predicting the use of Internet marketing.  For more accurate information requires a detailed analysis of the market and possible factors affecting the use of Internet marketing.  The possibility of increasing the factors, as well as changing the type of scaling, depending on the strength of the influence of the factor. <br><br>  <i>Thanks for attention.</i>  <i>I will be glad to criticism - maybe I missed something.</i> <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150183/</a></p>
