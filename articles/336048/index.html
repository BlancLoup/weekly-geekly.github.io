  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Omnicanality: 7 tips marketer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Marketing develops after communications.  Both major brands and small companies are adopting the opportunity to communicate with the audience, soft involvement.  All sorts of communication channels are used for this, but at the same time, there is a strange fact: the majority of buyers are ready for omnichannel better than marketers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3fa/930/346/3fa93034633d4bd7bd6c9cea08d8eb28.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infobip/blog/323084/">written</a> about omnicanality more <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/infobip/blog/323084/">than once</a> , but the topic continues to be as important as it is not completely understood.  Recall that omnichannel is a way of communication between a company and a consumer, in which all communication channels are integrated, and for the customer it does not matter how they are connected with him - he communicates with the brand as a whole, and not with ‚Äúphone support‚Äù or ‚Äúdepartment e-mail ‚Äù, acting autonomously and often giving conflicting information. <br><br>  Today's consumer is at least technically completely ready for omni-channel.  This is a demanded model of behavior when, for example, he visited an offline store, then on the Internet he compared your prices with the prices of other sellers, then made a purchase online, and then asked additional questions or solved the problems by email.  And this is just one of hundreds of possible scenarios.  A business must be ready for any development of events and it has every opportunity to get in touch with the client, at almost any stage of its funnel.  Below are a few tips on how to organize an omnichannel in marketing. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <b>1. Put yourself in the shoes of a client.</b> <br><br>  Regularly try to independently evaluate the entire path of your client.  Try to place orders, communicate with support, ask questions.  Let it be done by both internal employees and independent external testers.  Watch carefully for everything that does not work as we would like, and correct it. <br><br>  <b>2. Measure everything</b> <br><br>  The use of ‚Äúbig data‚Äù (big data) is more popular than ever.  And there is every reason for this - the more information you have, the more chances you have to make the right decision based on the right analysis. <br><br>  <b>3. Segment your audience</b> <br><br>  Having collected a certain array of data, you can divide your customers into conditional groups, highlighting the specific behavior of each of them.  Accordingly, each will need its own approach. <br><br>  <b>4. Build a proposal based on real-world scenarios.</b> <br><br>  Do not try to sell everything to everyone.  Look at the history of purchases of a specific customer, imagine that he would want to buy the next time.  Big data analysis is quite capable of making such predictions.  Offer the customer exactly what interests him. <br><br>  <b>5. Do not limit the use of real scripts only advertising</b> <br><br>  Having detailed information about the client, as well as about his purchases and history of communication with the brand, the support service will be able to more effectively provide him with the necessary assistance, while quickly finding a common language with him. <br><br>  <b>6. Do not ‚Äúlock in‚Äù on one communication channel.</b> <br><br>  Today, most consumers can start making a purchase, for example, from a smartphone, and complete it after two days from a laptop.  Such is the rhythm of modern life.  Make sure that by returning to you from another device, the client will be able to complete the job without any problems. <br><br>  <b>7. Do not wait for tomorrow</b> <br><br>  Start introducing omnicanalnosti need today.  Consumers quickly get used to comfortable models and perceive their absence as a problem in your company. <br><br>  Omnichannel is not as difficult to implement as it seems.  And the result can change for the better the most important indicators of your growth. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336048/</a></p>
