  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not only a folding phone: Samsung has updated the entire line of wearable devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcb/656/4a9/dcb6564a95e1f490d61d1ddba6daeeea.jpg"><br><br>  In the past few days, news about new smartphones introduced by Samsung has not disappeared from the pages of the media.  We are talking about several models of the S10 and, of course, about the Galaxy Fold, a smart device for almost $ 2000 (in Europe, and at all 2000 euros). <br><br>  The corporation has updated not only the smartphone lineup, but also wearable gadgets in the Galaxy family.  Information about this appeared a few days before the presentation, and the news is very interesting.  Thus, the company released the new Galaxy Watch Active, Galaxy Fit tracker and Galaxy Buds headphones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Madrobots recommends: <a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/garmin-vivoactive-3-music/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DSamsung">Smart watch Garmin Vivoactive 3</a> </blockquote><br>  As for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/02/samsung-refreshes-wearable-line-including-new-galaxy-watch-active/">headphones</a> , these are wireless devices that can work for about 6 hours on a single charge.  Like IconX, the headphones are charged in their own cradle, which gives another 7 hours of work.  By the way, the difference Buds from IconX is the ability to wirelessly charge the cradle itself.  Battery charge can be recharged from any of the Galaxy S10 models.

A digital assistant (the capabilities of which are modified) is built into the functionality of the headphones.  So users of the latter can send messages, answer calls, change tracks, and perform many other functions using Bixby (or without it).  If desired, you can switch to Google Assistant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7a/95e/a9a/f7a95ea9a6088803bc9582d7a6f6a951.jpg"><br><br>  Wireless connection works via Bluetooth 5, the company decided to implement a new wireless standard in all its devices, where there is a wireless communication module. <br><br><h3>  And something else </h3><br>  Of course, Samsung would not be Samsung, if it had not updated the lineup of its smart watches and trackers.  So, the corporation introduced the Galaxy Watch Active, a smart watch that runs on Tizen OS.  Their geometry has practically not changed, remaining the same as that of the Galaxy watch.  But now there is no rotating metal rim. <br><br>  Previously, it was used as an additional (and quite convenient) tool for interacting with the clock, along with the touchscreen.  Now this idea was left focusing on minimal design.  True, there are still two physical buttons.  As before, the watch is dustproof, impenetrable, plus relatively shockproof. <br><br>  Galaxy Watch Active is an excellent tracker, they track user activity throughout the day, just like Gear Sport did.  The watch has a built-in heart rate monitor and GPS. <br><br>  Inside - Exynos 9110 processor, 4 GB of memory, 768 RAM, NFC and a 230 mAh battery.  The watch supports wireless charging, not only from the charger, but also from S10 smartphones.  The developers said that the watch is capable of tracking blood pressure, but it is not yet clear how this is implemented. <br><br>  If the user does not need smart watches, then Samsung offers a fitness tracker (which, of course, has a clock function).  The Thacker is called Galaxy Fit, a continuation of the entire Fit line, and moreover quite good.  The gadget has a touchscreen with a diagonal of 0.95 inches, a heart rate monitor and NFC.  According to the developers, the battery capacity is enough for a whole week of work. <br><br>  The smart watch and tracker have a tool for tracking stressful situations - gadgets track them by a number of parameters, including rapid breathing. <br><br>  Headphones from Samsung will be available on March 8 at a price of $ 129 (in Europe, probably more expensive).  Hours will go on sale on the same day at a price of $ 199, and pre-order can be done already on February 21.  Galaxy Fit will start on sale May 31 at a price of $ 99. <br><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DSamsung"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qq/g0/i7/qqg0i7eriq4febfjqqehire4fnw.png"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3DSamsung"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/1y/yw/bv1yywjgl2_cbtzvvtk4rup2jz8.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441390/</a></p>
