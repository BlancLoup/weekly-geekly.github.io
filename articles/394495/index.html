      The book of New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper has gained great popularity and has been praised by readers around the world.  Digital Gold is in the list of the best business books of 2015 in the Financial Times ranking.  In it, the author talks about how the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a Bitcoin payment system, initially interesting only to a small group of enthusiasts, gradually attracted the attention of the whole world.  The most unexpected characters take part in this story: a Finnish student and an Argentine millionaire, a failed physicist who became an online drug lord, playboy twins who condemned the head of Facebook, special agents, US senators, and of course, the founding father himself of Bitcoin, known by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. <br><br>  The book is not overloaded with technical details and is designed for a wide audience.  Read the introduction and the first chapter <a href="http://www.dialektika.com/PDF/978-5-8459-2079-9/intro.pdf">here</a> .  You can buy the Russian edition version on <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/135325988/">Ozon</a> or <a href="http://www.combook.ru/product/11292341/">Combook</a> .  <a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062362490/digital-gold">The original</a> book: Digital Gold: Bitcoin and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money is available at most western stores. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn 1994 it was very difficult to know who exactly would be the big players on the Internet in the future.  The companies that were large at that time disappeared with time, and most of the large companies have not appeared for a long time.  That is why I wrote this book as a history of technology.  This is an attempt to look at how Bitcoin found itself in its place and who played an important role in this, ‚Äùthe author explains. </blockquote><br><h4>  2. Bitcoin.  More than money </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/34989628/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/577/049/c01/577049c0144d45a38d7fe3a91f69198a.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  Posted by: Alex Fork <br>  Number of pages: 280 <br>  Year of release: 2014 <br><br>  Alex Fork is the chairman of Blockchain.community, an association that promotes technology in Russia.

Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies </h4><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Bitcoin-Unlocking-Digital-Cryptocurrencies/dp/1449374042/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c14/e4d/7e4/c14e4d7e4c2a4c21a81f3e4e84ad3649.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  By: Andreas M. Antonopoulos <br>  Number of pages: 298 <br>  Year of release: 2014 <br><br>  Andreas is a member of the boards of directors of several bitcoin startups.  He founded his own Bitcoin business in London, New York and California, launched several Open-Source projects.  He has extensive experience in various companies as a technical director, director of IT. <br><br>  His book does not teach the development or earnings of digital currency, it only helps to understand the principles of the blockchain on the example of the Bitcoin payment system and other cryptocurrencies. <br><br>  The first two chapters of ‚ÄúMastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies‚Äù describe key concepts about digital currency and the fundamentals of cryptography and are more focused on inexperienced users, investors, and business leaders who want to better understand Bitcoin.  The remaining parts contain a description of the technical details of Bitcoin with examples of business cases and are intended for professional developers, engineers, system administrators and other technically savvy people who want to understand the work of a popular network.

Blockchain Revolution: How the Technology Behind Bitcoin is Changing Money, Business, and the World </h4><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Revolution-Technology-Changing-Business/dp/1101980133/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/895/3fa/301/8953fa3018a943a898af68209b5f2be9.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  Authors: Don Tapscott, Alex Tapscott <br>  Number of pages: 324 <br>  Year of release: 2016 <br><br>  The book "Blockchain Revolution" is written by a father and son, Don and Alex Tapscott.  Don is the CEO of Tapscott Group and one of the most influential theorists of the United States, known as the author of the books Wikinomics, The Digital Economy describing a new economic reality, and a dozen other popular writings on technology, business and society.  Alex Tapscott is the CEO of the Northwest Passage Ventures venture fund, which specializes in the development of blockchain projects. <br><br>  Blockchain Revolution describes the blockchain usage scenarios in everyday life.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe book is that the technology of the distributed registry can not only affect the development of the global financial system, but also contribute to the development of copyright-related business.  For example, musicians, writers, designers will be able to receive royalties directly to their digital wallets. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe purpose of the book is to demonstrate to companies, industry and society as a whole opportunities for successful development, competitiveness and social justice.  This is a book about how the second generation of the Internet (based on blockchain technology) can change civilization for the better, ‚Äùsummarize Tapscotta. </blockquote><br>  The authors also plan to release a set of infographics on the main topics of the book: ‚ÄúBlockchain and the music industry‚Äù, ‚ÄúBusiness models of the blockchain‚Äù and ‚ÄúOvercoming obstacles‚Äù.  Graphic materials will be provided to users who pre-order the book. <br><br><h4>  3. The Age of Cryptocurrency: How to Cope with the Blockchain </h4><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Age-Cryptocurrency-Blockchain-Challenging-Economic/dp/1250081556/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a9/18b/882/3a918b8821004dfebaddaf2af50c75ed.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  Authors: Paul Vigna, Michael Casey <br>  Number of pages: 384 <br>  Year of release: 2015 <br><br>  Michael Casey and Paul Vigna are journalists from The Wall Street Journal.  Casey already has two books on his account: ‚ÄúChe's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image,‚Äù which became, according to American critic Michiko Kakutani, one of the best books of 2009, and ‚ÄúThe Unfair Trade: How Our Broken Financial System Destroys the Middle Class ".  For Vigna, this is also not the first experience, in 2013 he published the book ‚ÄúBig Brother and Cellphone Girl‚Äù. <br><br>  In The Age of Cryptocurrency, Casey and Vi√±a attempted to dispel fears, such as the instability of the Bitcoin exchange rate, its anonymity, non-state currency provision, etc.  Journalists explained the origin of cryptocurrency, its functions and told what you need to know in order to navigate the new economic reality. <br><br>  Michael Casey and Paul Vi√±a cautiously note that, despite the increasing public awareness of cryptocurrency, it remains a niche product.  However, they are in favor of turning bitcoin into a mass phenomenon, especially in those regions that until recently were cut off from the modern financial system, such as Afghanistan, some countries in Africa, Central and South America. <br><br>  After the authors finished work on the book in 2015, they decided to write it in the blockchain.  This was the first major publication placed in a distributed registry. <br><br><h4>  4. Blockchain: Blueprint for a New Economy </h4><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blockchain-Blueprint-Economy-Melanie-Swan/dp/1491920491/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa9/e7d/ee1/fa9e7dee1ef04e5b9a0adb554f1fea38.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  Posted by: Melanie Swan <br>  Number of pages: 152 <br>  Year of release: 2015 <br><br>  The author of the book, Melanie Swan, is a professor of philosophy, the founder of the Blockchain Institute, an independent organization that studies how to use a distributed registry.  Swan decided to write this book when she realized that blockchain is a technology that goes far beyond digital currency, smart contracts and automated decentralized applications, and that blockchain means a completely new era of the Internet.  In it, the author talks about the work of the decentralized digital registry and describes three ‚Äúgenerations‚Äù of the blockchain ‚Äî 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 ‚Äî the bitcoin blockchain, the smart contract contracts blockchain, and the so-called ‚Äúblockchain of all‚Äù ‚Äîthe system in which information about any object. <br><br>  As Melanie herself says, of course, this is not a bitcoin for dummies.  The book will be useful to anyone who wants to understand the principles of the distributed registry and the possibilities of its use in real life.

What do you think? ‚Äù, To which he replied:‚Äú I don‚Äôt know anything about bitcoin, let's talk about it later. ‚Äù  Phillips, as a passionate fan of new knowledge, immediately began to study cryptocurrency.  He got so carried away that 2 years later he became one of the few qualified business consultants in cryptocurrency and released his own Bitcoin business directory ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide‚Äù, in which he collected the information he received and 15 years of experience with public reporting and business.  Kirk is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).  He launched several businesses, including <a href="http://invizibiz.biz/">invizibiz.biz</a> . <br><br>  Bitcoin will change the financial sector, as the Internet has changed the scope of trade.  He will set new rules for the global business, create conditions for organizational transformations and screening out those players who are not able to adapt to the new conditions.  We are on the threshold of a new, exciting "era" that comes once in 500 years, the author writes in his book. <br><br><h4>  6. Value Web </h4><br> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ValueWeb-Fintech-Blockchain-Technologies-Internet/dp/9814677175/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d76/663/f5b/d76663f5b9c442f28256e3ff8e292176.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  By Chris Skinner <br>  Number of pages: 424 <br>  Year of release: 2016 <br><br>  Chris Skinner is best known as an independent columnist for financial markets at <a href="http://thefinanser.com/">theFinanser</a> and chairman of The Financial Services Club, a European forum he founded in 2004.  Skinner is the author of DigitalBank and a dozen other books.  Value Web is his most recent work. <br><br>  The next generation of the Internet, the Internet of Things, cannot work without the Internet of values ‚Äã‚Äã(Internet of Value or ValueWeb), a network in which information about all tangible and intangible values ‚Äã‚Äãis stored.  You can build it with only 2 components - a mobile device with Internet access and blockchain technology.  And what will the ValueWeb generation bring to financial institutions, government and society?  The book answers this question.  Value Web will help you get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future, where money transfers and non-money transfers occur instantaneously, via mobile and digital networks. <br><br><h4>  7.

Bitcoin: Money Without Borders </h4><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Without-Borders-Payments-Philanthropy-ebook/dp/B00OGMSJ0Q"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f8/a89/511/3f8a895114ef46dcbdd583ede7cb72ed.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  By Yvonne Jenkins <br>  Number of pages: 51 <br>  Year of release: 2014 <br><br>  As the author himself writes, ‚ÄúBitcoin: Money Without Borders‚Äù is a brief and objective guide to the use of bitcoin, in particular, how you can use digital currency in combination with social media, such as Facebook, to increase your income or donations. <br><br>  The author omits the history of the creation of Bitcoin, does not clarify the principles of his work and avoids terms such as hashing, mining, etc., arguing that knowledge of the terms will not bring tangible benefits to a business or a charitable organization.  Instead, the author immediately goes on to analyze the problems of the modern financial system.  Today, more than 2.5 billion people do not have access to financial services, Jenkins writes, and asks: "Can bitcoin or other digital currencies fill in the gaps in the banking system?"  The author also explains why he is confident that cryptocurrency will be widely recognized, how the world will come to a new financial system, open and inclusive, how micropayments can be used in business or charity, why the price of digital currencies will skyrocket. <br><br>  From the annotation it follows that the book is designed for managers and business owners, as well as for leaders of charitable and non-profit organizations. <br><br><h4>  2. Making Profit with Bitcoin </h4><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Profit-Bitcoin-Alex-Harsen-ebook/dp/B00L28WVY2"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f91/318/567/f913185678a04b688f0f2c15266cd351.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></a>  Posted by: Alex Harsen <br>  Number of pages: 67 <br>  Year of release: 2014 <br><br>  This book contains real stories of successful work with bitcoin, stories about what opportunities cryptocurrency opens for business and ordinary users in everyday life.  The author notes that some of them are certainly an example of random luck, but most of them are stories of people who made a conscious decision to use Bitcoin as payment.  These people are my heroes, the author writes, because they help promote Bitcoin as an alternative to traditional payment methods. <br><br clear="left"><br><h5>  3.
