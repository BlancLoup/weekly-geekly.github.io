All these mountains of dirty dishes, heaps of scattered things and anecdotes in the style of "women wash dishes after a meal, men - before a meal" and stories about animals in a tea mug, in fact, quite common thing.  Before my wife, I practically lived there. At the same time, I still managed to go through weekly checks of rooms in a hostel, organize parties, cook something and not get poisoned.  And also I searched and found the necessary thing in my ‚Äúcreative disorder‚Äù.  My ‚Äúcleaning need sensor‚Äù was already included when it was impossible to walk in the apartment, but then the apartment shone with cleanliness. <br><br>  Since the men's holiday has passed, and I hope you have noted it exquisitely, most likely after this unlimited work it will be necessary to bring order.  Since there is no information anywhere about the male point of view on cleaning, I decided to share a few tips on cleaning and generally keeping the apartment / house clean.  A kind of Home GTD. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Washing dishes </h4><br><img src="http://impic.ru/uploads/2013/2402/61423574_106758.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The most that neither is daily and probably one of the most unpleasant parts of cleaning is washing dishes.  Several Life Covers on this topic.  Probably all of you know that the next day to wash the dishes is very difficult: the mud has dried, stuck and generally it is difficult to tear off.  What to do?  The most important thing: too lazy to wash the dishes immediately after a meal?  Then at least put in the sink and fill with water!  Water is an excellent solvent and being ‚Äúapplied‚Äù to the dishes, when still preventable, will help speed up the washing process at times! <br><br>  After a party in the case of mountains of dirty dishes, you can easily save yourself the next day by soaking the dishes at night in a basin with hot water and dishwashing liquid or ordinary soda (soda is generally a great thing!).  The next morning, sometimes it is enough to just rinse with running water.  If the dishes really doofig - soak it in the bathroom.

      Further, using all the same magical power of water, you can speed up the process and ordinary washing.  Place the dishes in such a way that the water from the tap, draining, ‚Äúdrenched‚Äù as many pans-plates-spoons as possible, start by washing the most simple objects - cups, forks-spoons, saucers, then when you reach the pans, you can already it is easier to wash them; the water flowing from the tap did half the job. <br><br>  Hot water washes significantly better than cold, so it‚Äôs better to use a slightly higher temperature force, of course, without burning it.  You can wear rubber gloves, then you can not be afraid of hands, use hotter water and do not touch the nasty things that inhabit the pan, for example :) <br><br>  Dishwashing liquid is a good thing and it is better to buy ‚Äúmore expensive‚Äù means, but remember that you should drip it onto the sponge just a little and rinse at least 2-3 times.  Slow poisoning of the body by any nonorganic remaining on the dishes did not lead anyone to good.  If there is no dishwashing detergent, use ordinary soda. <br><br>  If there is no hot water and you warm it up in a saucepan, then start by washing the least polluted things so that you do not have water in the fat and leftovers from the very beginning, but stay clean longer. <br><br>  Plastic dishes - this, of course, is the way out) But it is absolutely non-ecological, inconvenient, ugly, expensive and illogical. <br><br>  Well, sobssno too lazy to bathe - buy a dishwasher (though you will have to dump about 10,000 rubles or so).  Only for at least 9 people, not a desktop one for 6, this is very small and you will not cram pans.  Plus, it saves water, and you can wash it in the evening or before the morning at a reduced rate.  Well, or get the dishwasher in the form of a female subject) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/134/0c6/d4b/1340c6d4b2c202fa3e52febeb5c5d539.gif" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  House cleaning </h4><br><img src="http://impic.ru/uploads/2013/2402/80236987_143771.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  If you have a mess in your apartment-room, you can, of course, refer to the possibility of finding anything in it, as well as no need to waste time on cleaning (all efforts on the code!), But guests, a girl, a mother can come to you , the owner of the apartment (underline the right), and it can be extremely necessary to put it in order.  And in general in a clean room it works better, the struggle with entropy does its universal work.  So what to do? <br><br>  Here the task falls into several stages.  Cleaning on the shelves, tables, beds, bedside tables, dusting, vacuuming, washing the floor. <br>  Here, in the first place, it removes what literally ‚Äúclimbs into the eyes.‚Äù  Sometimes it may be a small thing, but lying in a prominent place.  Everything is scattered on the shelves \ cabinets \ bedside tables (I hope you have room for all this?) But on the whole, the advice here is this - no junk!  Throw it away, give it to your friends, or give it to a charity better than anything you don‚Äôt wear or ‚Äúmaybe would like to wear, but later‚Äù, all kinds of books read at one time, newspapers and magazines, CDs, gifts you don‚Äôt need, never used home appliances , souvenirs, etc. <br><br>  If a souvenir is dear to you as a memory, then not the souvenir itself is dear to you, but its ‚Äúimage‚Äù, the memories associated with it.  In order not to lose them, you can do an ingenious thing - take a picture of it and write it in the file name, why is it dear to you?  ‚ÄúIn the days of doubt, in the days of painful thinking,‚Äù just go to this folder and dive into the memories.  Of course, there are things that are very dear to you.  But I think you at least do not throw them with all sorts of junk?  Buy a few large packages and throw away everything you need to think about for more than 10 seconds. <br><br>  Actually, the cleaning goes from the upper tiers to the lower tiers, so as not to soil everything that has already been removed.  Clean the surface of everything, take a cloth and wipe the dust.  If you think that you don‚Äôt have it, because ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt see the same‚Äù, just slide your finger across the back surface of the table and everything will immediately become clear.  All this dust climbs into your eyes, gets into the food, because you probably also eat at the computer quite often ?!  ;) soiling clothes, and just looks unattractive.  And still lives in it dust mite <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dust mite</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Here is this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cd9/c23/47b/cd9c2347bcea52d1209f7f5f5db9ceb3.jpg" alt="image"><br></div></div><br>  So it's better to destroy this reptile at least once a week. <br><br>  The main hint: do not want to sweat with dust - spray all surfaces with antistatic.  Dust will accumulate much less, it will all fall to the floor. <br><br><h4>  Vacuum cleaner </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cce/86b/41d/cce86b41d405f33ab888e0a8a96e218f.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  A vacuum cleaner is a great thing indeed.  It is inexpensive and allows you to combine cleaning in the house with listening to music (and indeed music greatly helps the cause) and easy fitness.  Powerful models (choose on a Yandex.market on an indicator of power of absorption, but not energy consumption!) Swallow everything within a radius of several tens of centimeters.  In general, we put everything that hinders the movement higher or remove from the room and forward. <br>  Look at the brushes that come with the vacuum cleaner.  So it will be possible to clean them also dust from tables, upholstered furniture, curtains, hard-to-reach places (my favorite word combination)).  Also very useful turbo brush.  Which literally knocks out dust and dirt from carpets and furniture.  And take a cyclone or with a nozzle-cyclone, greatly add to the aesthetics of the discarded garbage and will not discourage the hunt for it ( <a href="">here, for example, powerful, with a cyclone and inexpensive</a> ). <br>  If reluctance to bathe - take as an assistant robot, though they are still very expensive. <br>  By the way, the vacuum cleaner is also useful for more compact storage of things.  Use ‚Äúvacuum‚Äù bags (a vacuum cleaner blows excess air out of them) for clothes and save 20-30% of space in the closet. <br><br><h4>  Floor washing </h4><br><img src="http://impic.ru/uploads/2013/2402/29915481_311944.png" alt="image" align="right">  Not mandatory, but highly desirable part of the completion of cleaning.  Because it nails the remaining dust, removes adhering dirt, and, in general, spreads the fragrance and freshness in the house.  The weapon of the proletariat is a mop.  But throw out the old sticks with a cloth wrapped around it.  Use modern mops with a platform that can be ‚Äúsqueezed out‚Äù without removing it from the stick.  Less zapar and faster process.  Change water as it gets dirty.  Also on the mop you can play Guitar Hero :) <br><br>  And finally, open the windows and thoroughly air.  A room or apartment will be transformed! <br><br><h4>  Washing and drying </h4><br><img src="http://www.purpleeagle.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Legs-and-man-in-washing-machine.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  Everything is simple: a normal washing machine + sorting things + good laundry detergent = clean things and a clear conscience. <br>  A washing machine copes with almost any task, the main thing is to learn several programs: 60 ¬∞ cotton for bed and towels (to kill all the same ticks), 40 ¬∞ cotton for most of your clothes, 40 ¬∞ synthetics - for faster washing and synthetics proper, 30 ¬∞ or the program "hand wash" for any delicate synthetics. <br><br>  Labels look at clothes.  In addition to these groups, it is necessary to separate 2 groups: light things and dark things and wash them separately.  Bright and completely new things better washed separately or at low temperatures.  Jeans need to turn out, even on jeans tips can be read <a href="http://getwear.lifehacker.ru/2013/02/18/getwear-jeans-care/">here</a> <br><br>  Means for washing are also different, but two are enough: for colored things and for delicate washing.  I recently liked concentrated Japanese Lion gels.  They need to be there literally 20 ml, and wash well. <br><br>  Well, do not pursue high speed, especially if the machine is not new.  600 rpm is enough for most things, at 800 rpm it will be a bit more dry, you will not notice the difference between 1000 and 1200, and the risk of damaging the thing is great.  And of course, the more delicate things are, the lower the revolutions.  But when choosing a program, the machine usually puts it all on its own.  If the powder is poured over and dofig foam - put an extra rinse, or after washing, put things again on the rinse and spin. <br><img src="http://impic.ru/uploads/2013/2402/367199_99406944.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  It is better to dry on the street on a rope (of course, if your house is not near the highway).  What could be better than smelling things fresh!  If there is no rain or rope in the street, dry it on the balcony or at least in the bathroom.  Buy a clothes dryer if everything doesn't fit.  And hang, immediately straightening things well, do not be lazy!  This will significantly save you time for ironing (yes, more often than not it will not be needed at all)! <br><br><h4>  Ironing </h4><br>  The secret of success is the right board and the right iron. <br>  Spare no money on the board, look a few in the store.  The main parameter is height.  If your height is under 2 meters, then with a standard board you simply kill your back and hate ironing.  But she is actually very meditative and quite possible under the favorite series or program. <br>  Choose the right <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D3%25F2%25FE%25E3">temperature on the iron</a> : <br><br>  o Kapron, nylon, polyester 60 ... 90 ¬∞ <br>  oo silk, artificial silk, wool with lavsan 100 ... 130 ¬∞ <br>  ooo wool, cotton, flax with lavsan, flax 160 ... 200 ¬∞ <br><br>  Iron, of course, is desirable with steam, spray and steam blow.  Moisturizes and smoothes the fabric, so the process takes less time.  Watch the video on the Internet, how to iron shirts and other things.  For example, here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rWTBPpRQ_c4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjtg2whh_jzatMHqP6Vg2f1fZ4fag" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  How to quickly fold a T-shirt: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/kT6FefQEznM&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjRYU_tbYJR3cDu6vfHTyPvoTv1lg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Here 10 minutes of training will help save hours on practical application! <br><br>  That's all.  I would very much like to continue the topic and hear the cleaning tips from the masters. <br>  If the article evokes a response, next time I will share my recipes for cooking simple, inexpensive, and, most importantly, tasty dishes.  So that, firstly, they could feed themselves not only dumplings, sausages and macaroni (and especially doshirakami), but also delicious homemade food, and secondly, to delight their present and future women on March 8. <br><br>  Successes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170499/</a></p>
