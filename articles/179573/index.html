Since in the corporate blog of the company Intel at Habr√© so the news did not appear, I decided to write about it myself.  Details under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, what I've been waiting for has finally happened - Intel announced the second phase of its <a href="http://perceptualchallenge.intel.com/">competition</a> for applications using the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/166529/">Intel Perceptual Computing SDK</a> .  This is the phase, not the second round.  That is, the one who did not participate in the first can participate in this phase.

      The main differences regarding the first phase: <br><ol><li>  Larger prizes.  If in the first phase it was possible to win a maximum of $ 20,000, then in the second it is $ 100,000 + $ 50,000 for marketing and development consultations. </li><li>  More demanding application requirements.  In the first phase, it was enough to send a video demonstrating the operation of the application, and in the second you need to send the application itself, it will be tested and evaluated by Intel employees themselves (however, the video and the docks also need to be sent) </li></ol><br><h5>  Few numbers </h5><br>  I will not retell all the rules of the competition, I will focus on the main thing.  Let's start with the secret - with the prizes. <br><h6>  Prizes </h6><br><ol><li>  <b>Grand Prize</b> : he is the only one for the whole competition.  Prize size: $ 100,000 + $ 50,000 for marketing and development consulting </li><li>  <b>First Place Prize</b> : the first place for each category of applications (total categories 4, respectively, the first places also 4).  Prize size: $ 75,000 + $ 12,500 for marketing and development consulting </li><li>  <b>Second Place Prize</b> : out of three for each category.  Will give $ 10,000 </li><li>  <b>Third Place Prize</b> : 20 third places per category.  Will give $ 5000 </li><li>  <b>Profile form prize</b> : 10 prizes for those who better filled out the project profile (before July 17) and eventually sent a working demo application to the end of the competition.  Give 1000 $ </li><li>  <b>Early submission prize</b> : also 10 prizes to those who will send the final demo of the application before August 6 (one week before the end of the contest).  Give 1000 $ </li></ol><br>  do not forget that about 30% of the amount eats tax: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About tax</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Excerpt from the rules of the competition: <br><blockquote>  For all non-US winners, it‚Äôs not necessary to make a difference. <br></blockquote></div></div><br><h6>  Deadline schedule </h6><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Stage </th><th>  Start </th><th>  Ending </th></tr><tr><td>  Idea submission </td><td>  May 6, 2013 </td><td>  June 17, 2013 </td></tr><tr><td>  Judging &amp; Loaner Camera Fulfillment </td><td>  June 18, 2013 </td><td>  June 25, 2013 </td></tr><tr><td>  Early Profile Form Submission </td><td>  June 26, 2013 </td><td>  July 17, 2013 </td></tr><tr><td>  Early Demo App Submission </td><td>  July 26, 2013 </td><td>  August 6, 2013 </td></tr><tr><td>  Final Demo App Submission </td><td>  July 26, 2013 </td><td>  August 13, 2013 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  A small explanation of the stages: as far as I understand, until June 17, you just need to register the project, add its description.  Then, on June 26, the first key moment will already be - according to the descriptions, 750 so-called finalists will be selected, those who will be admitted to the next stages.  Only one of these finalists can receive a prize (117 prizes in total, if it is not difficult to count, so if someone has already become one of the 750 finalists, then the chance to get at least something is quite large). <br><br><h6>  Categories </h6><br>  When registering an application, you must select one of four categories for it.  The boundaries of the categories are rather blurry.  Judge for yourself (I did not dare to translate their descriptions - the chance to distort the original message is too great): <br><ul><li>  <b>Gaming</b> : Games have been driven by technology and innovation.  This is an entirely new game mechanic.  The Perceptual Computing SDK. </li><li>  <b>Open Innovation</b> : Think outside the box.  Think beyond the wires!  It makes it possible to choose the SDK from the SDK.  You only once imagined. </li><li>  <b>Creative user experience</b> : (for example, subject recognition or facial analysis or 2D / 3D object tracking) or even a single usage mode.  Create an interaction that is memorable and innovative for the user. </li><li>  <b>Productivity</b> : Create a way to do things faster, better, and easier.  Select this category if you‚Äôre using your computer‚Äôs ability to learn how to use it.  It is an ability to accomplish a task. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  FAQ </h5><br>  Also I decided to translate from the FAQ.  I hope it will be useful to someone (but, of course, it is better to still read the original). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Free translation, retelling FAQ</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>Q: Why should I submit an idea?</b>  <b>Can I provide the application right away?</b> <b><br></b> <br>  A: Intel is looking for the best of the best, so we are looking for the most innovative ideas that use the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK.  If you are already working on something, give a link to it in the ‚ÄúVisual Support‚Äù column.  Provide everything you have, and you may become one of the 750 finalists who will receive the Creative * Interactive Gesture Camera Kit and the chance to get a cash prize. <br><br>  <b>Why give your address?</b> <br>  You need to provide your mailing address when only when you submit your idea.  We use this address to automatically send you a camera (Creative * Interactive Gesture Camera Kit) if you enter the number of 750 finalists. <br><br>  <b>Can I send a finished application if I am not included in the finalists?</b> <br>  Not.  Only those who are in the finalists can send their applications. <br><br>  <b>What is a ‚Äúdemo app‚Äù?</b> <br>  In the previous phase of the competition, we requested only application prototypes.  However, in this second phase, we are already considering demo applications.  We expect that the demo application will be more combed, that the quality will be the level of the release candidate.  In terms of functionality, the demo is not required to be able to do the same as a full-featured application, but it should demonstrate the main functionality of the application. <br><br>  <b>How many ideas can I submit for the competition?</b> <br>  The number is not limited.  Register once and you can send several ideas. <br><br>  <b>How many ideas will be selected for the final?</b> <br>  We will choose up to 750 applications finalists.  A user can have more than one idea selected to the finalists. <br><br>  <b>Who has the right to participate?</b> <br>  The competition is open to any developer under the age of 18 and located in one of the following countries: United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada (excluding Quebec), South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, France, Spain, Belgium, Japan, China, Russia , India, Israel, Taiwan. <br><br>  <b>Can I work as a team?</b> <br>  Yes of course.  We encourage both individual development and team development.  For team development, one of the team must register, and if the team wins, he becomes responsible for distributing the prize in the team. <br><br>  <b>Can I send an existing application?</b> <br>  Yes, we strongly recommend sending applications that are honed in the market conditions.  However, we need to know exactly how your application will change thanks to the addition of Perceptual Computing features. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to send an application that participated in Intel contests earlier?</b> <br>  Yes, you can send applications previously participating in various contests from Intel.  However, in the description of your idea you need to indicate how you are going to develop or expand your application in the current competition. <br><br>  <b>Can I participate on behalf of my company?</b> <br>  Yes.  Please tick ‚ÄúI am submitting on behalf of my Company‚Äù and enter the company name.  The prize will be awarded to the company if this option has been chosen. <br><br>  <b>How will applications be evaluated?</b> <br>  Applications will be evaluated as soon as the deadline for submission of applications.  They will be evaluated according to a number of criteria, but this is not a complete list of criteria: the degree of perceptual computing use, usability, functionality, creativity, how convincingly the application usage scenarios are shown. <br><br>  <b>Does my application ownership of Intel?</b> <br>  Not.  The application remains the property of the developer, but Intel reserves the right to demonstrate and promote the idea and / or demo version of the application. <br><br>  <b>Is my personal data safe?</b> <br>  Yes.  Intel takes privacy seriously. <br><br>  <b>Where to get the SDK?</b> <br>  SDK can be downloaded: <a href="http://www.intel.com/software/perceptual">www.intel.com/software/perceptual</a> . <br><br>  <b>Do I have to use the SDK to participate in the contest?</b> <br>  Yes.  Using the Intel Perceptual Computing SDK 2013 is a prerequisite for demo versions of the application finalists.  Check out the SDK before sending us your idea. <br><br>  <b>Do I need a camera to participate?</b> <br>  You do not need a camera to send an idea.  Finalists will receive a camera to complete their demo versions of the applications.  The capabilities of the camera are described here: <a href="http://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/325946/creativelabs-camera-productbrief-final.pdf">software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/325946/creativelabs-camera-productbrief-final.pdf</a> <br><br>  <b>I'm a finalist, can I keep a camera for myself?</b> <br>  The finalists will receive a camera from Intel as soon as they are selected.  If you have been chosen as a finalist, you can keep the camera for yourself if you send a demo version of the application. <br><br>  <b>Why can not all countries participate?</b> <br>  We work hard so that the maximum number of countries can participate.  Problems arise because of compliance with the rules of the competition and the laws of various countries, as well as problems with the certification of Creative * cameras in various countries. <br><br>  <b>What if I have more questions?</b> <br>  Visit our forum: <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-perceptual-computing-sdk">software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-perceptual-computing-sdk</a> <br></div></div><br><h5>  Results of the first phase of the competition </h5><br>  The list of works received prizes in the first phase of the competition can be found here: <a href="http://software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/perceptualshowcase/">software.intel.com/sites/campaigns/perceptualshowcase</a> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Video demonstration of the three best works of the first phase</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nGG3NK1tQRU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyaPx28ZkxM0OCIXLeV8Ul0iWTBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/HT4eevGbSfY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgWYyxVgSDY2ioftzNXvwOxK1OagA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUqhcI_4nWo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500001,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhinxtw1kHYZLkFepRSDagLn4RDQWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br>  I believe that in the second phase many of the winners of the first phase will participate. <br><br><h5>  Related Links </h5><br>  The official site of the competition: <a href="https://perceptualchallenge.intel.com/">perceptualchallenge.intel.com</a> <br>  Competition rules: <a href="https://perceptualchallenge.intel.com/static/docs/terms_and_conditions.pdf">perceptualchallenge.intel.com/static/docs/terms_and_conditions.pdf</a> <br>  Article about Intel Perceptual Computing SDK: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/166529/">habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/166529</a> <br>  Article about the start of the competition in general and the first phase in particular: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/166759/">habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/166759</a> <br><br>  Ps.
