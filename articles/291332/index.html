And at the same time I will bring the mission of my company (so that there is no advertising, I will not disclose the name).  So, interested - please read!

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I have long thought what unites successful companies, and whether their success is a regularity, and not an accident.  And every day I approached the answer, to the solution of an important question - what is characteristic of all successful firms?  Yes, this is a mission, or rather, its presence. <br><br>  As I wrote in my article, the mission should be defined at the first stage of development of the company.  But he did not specify that the mission should be declared in this case - that is, it was announced (published) to the public. <br>  Having defined the mission of your company, you acquire an unlimited amount of funds for sale.  But from words to deeds - I will give examples of real firms, and in the end I will tell about my own. <br><br>  <b>1. Google Mission</b> <br><br>  What is the first idea that comes up with the phrase ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs mission‚Äù?  Giving people information?  A good option, but not complete.  Make each of us comfortable life?  Not bad either, but rather vague.  Here is the information from the official website of Google: <br><blockquote>  Organize all the information available in the world, making it accessible and convenient to use. <br></blockquote><br>  We see that Google is committed to the organization, processing and transmission of information - and he is pretty good at it.  We use the products of this company every day, and we like it. <br><br>  <b>2. The mission of a real estate agency in Russia</b> <br><br>  Again we make a few assumptions.  Populate everyone?  Absurd, though original.  Comply with international standards?  Again, vague. <br><br>  Here is the official mission: <br><blockquote>  Make the rental market transparent, understandable and open </blockquote><br>  This makes it possible to use a variety of tools that will allow the rental market to enter a new level. <br><br>  UPD.  I will give examples of several other firms, since Russian real estate agencies are a rather controversial example. <br>  <b>3. **** Company is the leader in the market of light cooking products in Russia:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúFreeing up the time of consumers for a full life, producing high-quality products of easy preparation.‚Äù <br><br>  What specific products does she make?  Absolutely everyone who frees time.  And there is no limit. <br><br>  <b>4. "*****" - payment system:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúProviding individuals and legal entities with a qualitatively new level of cashless payments based on modern electronic technologies. <br>  We consider the development of a high-tech payment service as one of the conditions for achieving a new quality of life, more productive and comfortable use of personal time by a person in the face of increasing information and increasing supply of goods and services. ‚Äù <br><br>  Providing a qualitatively new level does not limit the company to use a limited range of tools - it can realize its mission in many ways. <br><br>  <b>The mission of my company</b> <br><br>  I have long enjoyed helping people.  But I always understood that not everyone needs my help.  And recently, I realized that I can create a company (and have already created), which in its mission puts <br><blockquote>  Make people more comfortable, more interesting and safer. </blockquote><br>  I like it when people satisfy their desires.  But it is also more pleasant for me when they do it not to the detriment of themselves and others. <br><br>  What allows me to declare my mission?  The fact that I can engage in completely different activities: create a convenient application planner, open a sushi studio, establish an advertising agency, run a design studio.  All my future (and current) directions are united by one thing: I try to make the life of every person more comfortable, more interesting and safer. <br><br>  Comfortable - it will be convenient for you to work with me;  more interesting - I really appreciate your desires and make every effort so that they come true.  Safer - I guarantee the integrity of work with the client, the quality of their services and their legitimacy. <br><br>  I hope that my article will help determine the undecided (what they want from their company) and adjust the plans for those who have almost achieved success. <br><br>  PS: By the way, with a clear mission in my head, it is much easier to get funding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291332/</a></p>
