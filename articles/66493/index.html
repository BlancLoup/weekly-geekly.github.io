      This project was not originally planned for release to the general public and was written rather for a narrow circle of connoisseurs.  This is a turn-based space strategy, executed in the spirit of its two progenitors - the unforgettable Master of Orion and the browser game "Divide and Conquer."  However, over time, the narrow circle significantly expanded, and in early July, the beta test ended with the restart of the servers and the start of a new game season.  Thanks to my non-standard topics, I managed to collect a kind of community, which for me is the main value of this project - as an indication that my hobby is interesting and to someone else. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Features </h4><br><ul><li>  Stepping </li><li>  The ability to change the parameters of the game race </li><li>  Ship builder </li><li>  Sufficient economic, diplomatic and military engine </li></ul><br><h4>  About gameplay </h4><br><br>  So, Space Community is a turn-based game.  This means that all actions occur only during the course calculation, which on the main server is considered three times a day.  Usually :) this recalculation takes a couple of minutes, although this value certainly increases with the development of the universe. <br><br>  All players are on the same large map, the size of 500 * 500 cells.  As in chess :) In each cell there is a planet with initially unknown characteristics. <br><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/56/ed/56ed07be3d870fe26698fcc8da1bb914.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the picture - the current population of the universe, this information is available to every player.  The points are populated planets. <br><br>  Planets - a source of income.  They live on green-man, who actually follow your instructions. <br>  The larger the size of the planet, the more green humans will ever live on it.  The larger the population, the more buildings you can build - everything is simple.  The more developed your economy, the higher your Technological Level, which opens up more and more new buildings and ships. <br><br>  In space without ships anywhere.  Especially without spaceships.  Therefore, players spend most of their hard-won resources on supporting combat and civil fleets. <br><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/b2/ec/b2ec079ee6588bbd01527c455ffcc02d.jpg" alt="map"><br><br>  <i>The figure is an example of a map interface.</i>  <i>In the center - the explored territory and the radius of a possible jump of the selected fleet, in the right part - the fleets and the ships in them</i> <br><br><h4>  Game Wars </h4><br><br>  About this game, you can say so - "this is a forum with additional features, where you can talk nonsense in a public channel and be destroyed for it."  Initially, the development is purely peaceful, but over time there are grounds for conflicts - whether it is disputed territories, planets, diplomatic duties to the allies - or simple hostility. <br><br>  Game mechanics imply that <b>any player can be destroyed</b> .  Completely and irrevocably.  The space around us is tough, yes ... <br><br>  In practice, this sometimes turned into big galactic wars, when entire gaming states that developed over many months of real time were destroyed.  Over the past two years, there were two of them; in the course of one of them, your humble servant, who initially actively participated in the game process, was also cleaned.  Yes, we were one of the few games where it was quite legal to win an administrator and a part-time developer :) <br><br><h4>  Technical stuff </h4><br><br>  In the life of every second web developer, there comes a moment when he tries to write or write his forum \ chat \ bulletin board, without estimating the amount of work that needs to be done.  Here are sample data for this project: <br><br><ul><li>  Handler of the course is a large php script that runs on the crown.  Initially, it was generally a collection of MySQL commands, but as the project became more complex and developed, MySQL could not cope with all the tasks.  Perhaps over time it will be necessary to abandon the script engine and rewrite the handler, but for now this game is not worth the trouble. </li><li>  The code corresponded more than once, and now its approximate volume is about ~ 50,000 lines </li><li>  Elapsed time - two years as a hobby </li></ul><br><br><h4>  About newbies </h4><br><br>  The beta test has recently been completed, and now the universe is young and developing, there are simply no serious state entities - so beginners can easily change the underlying balance of power in the political arena. <br><br>  Beginner start is quite slow.  The minority at this time reads the <a href="http://alpha.spacom.ru/%3Fact%3Dforum">forum</a> (the more advanced learn the <a href="http://wiki.spacom.ru/index.php">wiki</a> gradually filled), the majority did not play Master of Orion and delve into the rules with great difficulty :) <br><br>  Look at the project <a href="http://spacom.ru/">here</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66493/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66493/</a></p>
