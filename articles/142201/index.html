  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About fears of online learning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's simple, when education is easy and gives joy whether you are a schoolboy or a student of a prestigious university.  Worse, when on the contrary - every day of study as torture and compulsory duty.  And there can be many reasons for this: from dislike to the very process of study and general academic failure, to the banal misunderstanding of a particular subject and dissatisfaction with the teacher.  And here from the ongoing reforms in the field of education and improvement of the educational system is neither cold nor hot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbc/05f/d17/dbc05fd171f5f6b712733d3ffa3c5ba8.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many of us have to go to a tutor at a certain stage of study.  In junior school there are problems with the Russian language, in the senior - foreign ones resemble the Chinese letter, at the institute higher mathematics causes a nervous shiver, etc.  Although it is not at all necessary to be unsuccessful to seek help.  Often, there are questions where additional consultation of the teacher is required beyond the framework of the educational schedule: to work out separate topics, to analyze difficult issues, to understand the solution of various tasks and to learn how to solve them independently.  Therefore, the ‚Äútutor‚Äù today is a massive and understandable phenomenon.  By the way, the Russian tutoring market today is one of the fastest growing. <br><br>  Of course, there are a lot of requirements for tutors: professional presentation of information, individual approach to the student, responsibility and decency, reasonable wages, proximity, convenient time for classes.  In practice, it turns out that combining all these characteristics in one person can not always and not as successfully as we would like.

      Literate marketers promptly realized that the active development of the Internet, which the teachers of schools and higher educational institutions so persistently cursed, at one point became one of the most promising and modern tools of the educational process.  As a result, tutoring classes were transferred to the Internet and became widespread.  A modern student, a student spends a lot of time talking on the Internet.  The opportunity to study in an environment that is familiar and understandable to him has become a convenient tool for obtaining a quality education.  However, not everyone accepted the phenomenon of online tutoring "with a bang," expressing distrust of this type of service.  There are many reasons for this: there are doubts about the convenience and safety of learning online - it is not clear who is on the other side of the monitor, there are questions about the level of competence of the teacher and his responsibility for the result, the quality of training and the possibility of obtaining knowledge in full.  Questions also arise in the field of technical support: how classes are conducted, what software is used, additional devices, what to do with the quality of communication, etc. <br><br>  As a rule, online tutors have the same requirements as full-time tutors, adding a number of special ones: the ability to conduct classes online (as this is a special environment where it is very difficult without special training), the level of modern skills information technology, etc. <br><br>  Communication with the teacher on the Internet is not a know-how for foreign countries, although this trend is only beginning to take shape on the Russian market.  For example, in the US educational services market, online tutoring companies have been operating for more than 10 years.  The most famous of them held 6-7 million training sessions. <br><br>  In Russia, technically savvy tutors have long used such a teaching format, using modern technical innovations and means of communication.  However, in addition to individual tutors advertised independently using their own websites and the so-called ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù, there are companies on the market that assist in finding online tutors, providing access to ordered information about them in a specialized database.  The user of such resources is invited to independently study the detailed "dossier" of several hundred teachers, analyze and decide on with whom he will be engaged.  Responsibility in this case lies entirely on the shoulders of the teacher and the student, the company also acts as an intermediary, practically not tracking the level of competence of the teacher. <br><br>  A more modern business model of online tutoring is a full-fledged service, where the responsibility for the quality of education is assumed by the company, and not by a specific person.  Teachers are not ‚Äúarchived‚Äù in the bases, but are hired to work with all the ensuing consequences: the selection, control, testing and further supervision of all pedagogical processes.  The user does not need to study a huge number of autobiographical pages, selecting a teacher for himself - these services are provided by the company.  Such services not only provide an opportunity to learn, but also take responsibility for the learning outcomes. They create the necessary conditions for comfortable work, ensuring the accessibility and understandability of the learning format using special software.  An important merit and, at the same time, the difference of such companies from the above-mentioned "intermediaries" is the instantaneous response to user requests, in other words, round-the-clock "duty" with the possibility of providing prompt assistance when needed. <br><br>  Of course, online learning is not something completely new, but certainly more and more popular.  How will this market develop in Russia further, and which model will gain great popularity: mediation or online services, time will tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142201/</a></p>
