  <section class="page js-page"><h1>2016 through the eyes of EFF: the fight for fair use and safe havens</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The human rights organization Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) with its <a href="https://www.eff.org/2016-year-review-digital-rights">series of publications</a> on digital rights in 2016 sums up the past year and talks about the most important and noteworthy events.  One of the materials is devoted to reviewing court cases concerning fair use (fair use) of copyright objects and so-called ‚Äúsafe harbors‚Äù in relation to various Internet service providers.  The text is about Google Books and Dancing Baby cases, recalling legal complaints about the Vimeo service and the Oracle v process.  Google about Java API code.  In a word, there is definitely something to remember about judicial confrontations overseas last year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  In 2016, we witnessed the last piece in the ongoing struggle to shape copyright and determine who it serves - between the law, which respects and encourages innovation and freedom of speech, and that only serves the interests of major rightholders.  This year we celebrated a series of victories in favor of fair use and ‚Äúfree harbors‚Äù on the Internet, while some important legal battles are still ahead. </p><br><br><h3>  Main standoff for fair use in Lenz v.  Universal reached the Supreme Court </h3><br><p>  After 9 years of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/lenz-v-universal-baby-may-be-dancing-trial-0">battles</a> in lower courts, Stephanie Lenz, represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, took the fight to the US Supreme Court regarding fair use on the Internet.  In August, Lenz filed a <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-supreme-court-review-dancing-baby-copyright-case">petition</a> asking the Court to partially revoke the 2015 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit of the United States, which undermines the guarantees for users provided by the DMCA. </p><br><p>  In 2007, Lenz first filed a lawsuit, which later became known as <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/lenz-v-universal">the ‚ÄúDancing Baby‚Äù case</a> after her video on Youtube was removed as a result of a fictitious copyright infringement notice filed by Universal Music.  The video of the plaintiff was a 29-second recording, reproducing her baby dancing in the kitchen under the barely audible song of Prince Let's Go Crazy in the background.  Lenz said that Universal‚Äôs notice of violation of rights was definitely a case of abuse, which should not occur within the meaning of DMCA guarantees. </p><br><p>  In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court issued an important decision, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/important-win-fair-use-dancing-baby-lawsuit">determining</a> that prior to submitting a notice of violation, the right holders should examine whether a possible violation is not a fair use.  But the court also applied a fully subjective criterion, which, we fear, will be used as permission for content holders to <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-asks-supreme-court-review-dancing-baby-copyright-case">‚Äúrely no more than unsubstantiated conjectures or subjective criteria that are simply made up. [.]‚Äù</a> We do not think that this is exactly what implied Congress, and Lenz asked the Supreme Court to protect the rights of users to fair use and to cancel this part of the court decision. </p><br><br><h3>  The Supreme Court refused to revise the outcome of the case on fair use in the case of the service Google Books </h3><br><p>  In April, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/case-closed-supreme-court-refuses-hear-authors-guilds-challenge-google-books">rejected the</a> Authors Guild <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/case-closed-supreme-court-refuses-hear-authors-guilds-challenge-google-books">‚Äôs</a> motion to revise the landmark decision of the Second District Court on fair use in a lawsuit surrounding Google Books.  By rejecting this request, the Supreme Court upheld a significant victory in fair use and put an end to more than a decade of litigation. </p><br><p>  The second district court <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/big-win-fair-use-google-books-lawsuit">ruled</a> that the Google Books project is a very transformative, fair use of copyright objects, providing information to the public, access to which may not be when trying to use other means to do so.  The court‚Äôs decision also confirmed that the main purpose of copyright is the need to serve the public by facilitating access to knowledge and the results of creativity, deciding that ‚Äúthe ultimate goal of copyright is to increase public knowledge and understanding ... Thus, although the authors are undoubtedly important beneficiaries with respect to copyright, but the ultimate beneficiary is the public, whose access to knowledge is guided by copyright through the payment of remuneration for authorship ‚Äù. </p>

    <h3>  Federal jury in Oracle v.  Google acknowledged that the use of Java API by Google is fair use. </h3><br><p>  In May, the federal jury unanimously determined that the use of software code that is part of the Java API in the Android operating system was fair use.  Following on the heels of a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/05/dangerous-ruling-oracle-v-google-federal-circuit-reverses-sensible-lower-court">frustrating and dangerous</a> decision of the Federal District Court of Appeal, according to which application programming interfaces (APIs) are protected by copyright, the fair use decision provides some level of protection against copyright infringement on innovations and interaction in software.  But, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/eff-applauds-jury-verdict-favor-fair-use-oracle-v-google">as we said earlier</a> , it would be <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/05/stakes-are-high-oracle-v-google-public-has-already-lost-big">much better</a> if the US Court of Appeals for the Federal District recognized that the API is a system or method of work, and thus is not subject to copyright. </p><br><p>  Oracle <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/10/its-official-oracle-will-appeal-its-fair-use-loss-against-google/">will appeal the</a> decision to the US Court of Appeals, and we hope that this time the court will make the right decision and will uphold the jury's verdict. </p><br><br><h3>  The Court of Appeal confirmed that Vimeo is not obliged to track or investigate user downloads </h3><br><p>  In June of this year, responding to one of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/12/music-publishers-sue-cox-not-kicking-people-internet">several</a> recent attacks on ‚Äúsafe havens‚Äù provided by the DMCA for Internet proxies, the Second District Court ruled that the Vimeo online video service is <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/big-win-user-generated-content-hosts-vimeo-case">not obliged to</a> investigate or monitor users downloads for copyright infringement. </p><br><p>  Capitol Records, a recording company, <a href="https://www.eff.org/cases/capitol-v-vimeo">sued</a> Vimeo in 2014, stating that the DMCA ‚Äúsafe harbors‚Äù do not apply to phonograms created before 1972 (which are not governed by federal copyright law) and that even if ‚Äúsafe harbors‚Äù are applicable, Vimeo has lost the right to use them due to the lack of verification of downloads for potential copyright infringement.  The second district court completely dismissed the arguments of Capitol Records, noting that the ‚Äúsafe havens‚Äù clauses are applicable, and that Vimeo is not obliged to monitor users' downloads for violations.  Thereby, the Second Circuit Court awarded a significant victory to users and online platforms in the ongoing confrontation regarding "safe havens". </p><br><p>  If the decision were in favor of the other side, it would be a death for online competition and free speech.  The obligation for platforms to keep track of all user content will impose a significant economic burden on small and non-commercial platforms and will almost certainly lead to excessive diligence in filtering and restricting online user activity. </p><br><br><h3>  The Court of Appeal gives music sampling a breath of fresh air in the VMG Salsoul v. Case.  Ciccone </h3><br><p> Judicial decision of the Ninth Circuit Court in the case of <i>VMG Salsoul v.</i>  <i>Ciccone</i> that the ‚Äúde minimis‚Äù doctrine in copyright law actually applied to the sampling of music was a belated departure from the 2005 decision of the Sixth District Court in the case of Bridgeport Music.  In the Bridgeport case, the Sixth District Court ruled out the application of this doctrine for sound recording, creating music samples as a risky and expensive enterprise.  This year, the Ninth Circuit Court gave back to music sampling a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/de-minimis-amount-creative-freedom-courts-push-back-protect-music-sampling">necessary breath of fresh air</a> in the decision that Madonna‚Äôs use of the 23-second sample from the Salsoul Orchestra song was insignificant (‚Äúde minimis‚Äù) and, therefore, did not violate rights. </p><br><p>  But 2016 <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/12/music-industry-shouldnt-be-able-cut-your-internet-access">was not only the year of some victories</a> for users.  For example, in the <i>BMG v.</i>  <i>A Cox Communications</i> judge in the Eastern District of Virginia ruled that an Internet service provider can stop someone from accessing the Internet only on the basis of a claim of rights violation, or even lose their legal protections, which the provider cannot be found guilty of violating their rights. users.  The EFF, together with Public Knowledge and Center for Democracy and Technology, presented a report in support of the appeal, asking the Fourth District Court to consider the importance of access to the Internet in everyday life when considering the situation where copyright requires the provider to stop providing Internet access. </p><br><br><p>  We are pleased to see how some courts oppose the claims of right holders to form the right to serve their own interests.  In 2017, we will continue to fight to make sure that copyright works for each of us. </p><br><br><hr><br>  <i>Note</i>  <i>per.</i> <br><br><ol><li>  <i>The term ‚Äúsafe havens‚Äù in this article refers to provisions of US regulations (in particular, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act), which allow legal entities to avoid being held accountable if they perform certain actions.</i> </li><li>  <i>Electronic Frontier Foundation (Electronic Frontier Foundation, abbr.
