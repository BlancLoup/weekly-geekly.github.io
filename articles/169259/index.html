  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Small, aluminum and touch. Acer Aspire S7 11 inch review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More recently, if you were going to get a beautiful, technologically advanced and autonomous laptop, you had to choose any two points.  However, with the advent of ultrabooks - everything has changed.  Fortunately, for the better.  In 2012, ultrabooks with a touchscreen appeared.  Their appearance was due to the release of Microsoft Windows 8. <br>  I have repeatedly reviewed laptops and tablets on Windows 8 and had different opinions about them.  But here, in front of me is an 11 inch touchscreen ultrabook Acer Aspire S7-191. <br>  Nice design, slim, nice body, touchscreen display, Windows 8. Well, let's start. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/032/262/ae7/032262ae7faf59c49864c06751d854ca.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  Installed operating system Win 8 64 <br>  Core i5 1700 MHz processor <br>  3317U processor code <br>  Number of processor cores 2 <br>  Cache size L2 512 KB <br>  L3 cache size 3 MB <br>  Intel HM77 Chipset <br>  4096 MB DDR3 Memory <br>  Screen 11.6 inches, 1920x1080, widescreen, touch, multitouch (10 touches), IPS matrix <br>  LED backlight screen <br>  Type of graphics controller built-in <br>  Intel HD Graphics 4000 Graphics Chipset <br>  128GB Hard Drive Solid State (SSD) RAID0 <br>  Wireless Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 802.11n <br>  Bluetooth 4.0 version <br>  Interfaces USB 3.0x2, MicroHDMI <br>  Support for microSD memory cards, microSDHC <br>  Battery life up to 4.5 hours (without additional battery) 8 hours (with additional battery) <br>  Battery capacity 2500 mAh (2350 mAh optional) <br>  Number of battery cells 4 (4 optional) <br>  Battery type Li-Pol <br>  Touchpad Positioning Devices, Touchscreen, Mouse <br>  Keyboard backlight is (two levels) <br>  Built-in speakers are <br>  Built-in microphone is <br>  The webcam is <br>  Dimensions (LxWxT) 284x196x12.2 mm <br>  Weight 1.22 kg <br><br><h4>  Box, equipment </h4><br>  The device comes in a big beautiful box. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d79/b72/a2c/d79b72a2c8a95deb67c581fe634d4bfd.jpg"><br>  In addition to the ultrabook itself, inside the box is a charger, a case, an extra battery, MicroHDMI-D-sub, usb-LAN adapters, a mouse - in general, everything you need to rush into battle. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/944/ac9/aa9/944ac9aa98dfc75c1191a39c99fd421c.jpg"><br>  Charger - classic notebook.  For the ultrabook it is bulky. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a6/740/cc5/2a6740cc551ff5214551037a67b76766.jpg"><br>  But the mouse is cool.  One of its presence is already a huge plus, but after all, it‚Äôs also bluetooth (Everything is better with bluetooth!), Stylish, comfortable.  In general, cool! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bd/fed/df0/3bdfeddf0749bb6201b896561996b86b.jpg"><br>  The case is already familiar to us a beautiful and comfortable velor pocket with a flap. <br>  Plus cover that extra.  battery laptop breaks with joy. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e75/40e/866/e7540e8661c143406484187644cbc936.jpg"><br>  Yes, there is an extra battery included with the ultrabook.  It is attached slyly: two bolts are screwed into the bottom of the device, the connector is connected to the charger connector.  As a result, the ultrabook adds 400, 2500 mAh grams, as well as a process. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02e/90e/183/02e90e1838a0b9fc5c631843736df707.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e7/29e/771/5e729e7719b5d004a74f5c63b0d62c72.jpg"><br>  As a result, when working with a device, in addition to the extra time, the battery allows for better cooling air intake, and changes the angle of operation with the device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8fa/d54/7e1/8fad547e1a56a6a803c1a36af5e2966b.jpg"><br>  The battery has a button and charge indicators.  Five sections (20% each). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23e/030/b0f/23e030b0f2a46c6e75abd92af6c4db93.jpg"><br>  Let's return to the configuration, in the box you will also find adapters for working with good old LANs (usb-RJ45) and D-Sub (MicroHDMI-D-Sub). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b58/bb6/e7c/b58bb6e7c6b87fd1948d4d878ca3acbb.jpg"><br><h4>  Ports and connectors </h4><br>  Okay!  I completely forgot to tell you about the ports and connectors. <br>  On the left side of the charger connector, USB 3.0, power button, on the right - USB 3.0, headset jack, microSD card reader. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/999/cb6/48f/999cb648f5e3062d915e5278ab1bba51.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/591/910/60d/59191060d014bcdca6810c0dcfea241e.jpg"><br>  On the back side, in addition to the ventilation grille, there is a MicroHDMI port <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da9/cce/38c/da9cce38c6056d4734fdf5cd06ad1a9d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Laptop design - strict, straight lines, sharp edges and quality materials. <br>  A cover - aluminum with a textured pattern ‚Äúdiamond‚Äù.  It looks very cool and in practice it turns out to be very practical - no prints or dirt are visible.  Yes, and firmly. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d48/8ca/248/d488ca248b62f955368993a3b752740e.jpg"><br>  The lower part is a magnesium alloy, white. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2d/497/a56/c2d497a56fe031d07f16952eeb59fd56.jpg"><br>  The speakers are near the front, next to the legs.  The sound is quite loud and clear. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d5d/7e4/70d/d5d7e470da0f780cab6e95e04bb314b6.jpg"><br>  The microphone is not very well located.  Because of this good sound from him can not get.  Fortunately, in Skype it does not interfere.  But the recording studio will not be able to open.

      The opening angle of the cover is 155 degrees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d6b/afb/e80/d6bafbe80ff7c72850f1efae758886bb.jpg"><br>  Actually, the pride of the laptop cover is not only textured aluminum, but the FullHD touchscreen display! <br>  Excellent viewing angles and color reproduction, perfect resolution for 11 inches. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b5/f60/768/9b5f60768906cf08c961769fa8bc8423.jpg"><br>  The display is definitely the strength of the device. <br>  The touchpad is a bit small, but for the 11 inch it is quite convenient (especially with the touch screen and mouse, it is not so often needed).  Supports multitouch and gestures. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/600/637/e1a/600637e1acabfe93dfd9f84f83f7062b.jpg"><br>  But from the side of the keyboard, we were presented with a bad ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù (or rather a blow).  So that the laptop does not warm up and does not make noise with a cooler - the cooling system is made cleverly, and in order not to increase the thickness of the ultrabook - the engineers got rid of the Fn of a number of buttons. <br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a4/d47/1ae/7a4d471aeb7c2eb7bdd32aa7a7c8e527.jpg"><br>  Yes, the keyboard has a backlight (regulated both automatically and manually, 2 gradations) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe9/6ef/5fb/fe96ef5fb880f9f9044f8ec37a459676.jpg"><br>  Also, the disadvantages of the keyboard include the strange arrangement of E, Delete, a slash and other shortcomings. <br>  It is clear that they saved space, but it was not worth it to do at the expense of the keyboard! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69f/8ea/f83/69f8eaf83dc374c15d92c69e5921aeb1.jpg"><br>  In the end, the chip with the cooler is this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9c/60b/5b6/d9c60b5b6d65bf371361c797c0aab7aa.jpg"><br>  Due to this, the work surface (under the palms and the keyboard) practically does not heat up. <br><br><h4>  Digicamers </h4><br>  The operating system estimates the installed hardware at 5.3 points.  This is all ‚Äúthanks‚Äù to the embedded video. <br>  In justification, I will say that in addition to synthetic tests, which gave the following result: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/116/42d/fac/11642dfac06ec9fdc25f68228b1391e9.png"><br>  ... but toys (not the newest ones and not at the highest settings) are coming.  Although who will play on this kid? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/853/604/a95/853604a951753236bb12cce1f9ac529c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d09/c55/d52/d09c55d5200f4c646aeed71f8c00be9b.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2e/d8b/b4a/b2ed8bb4a71c43c03ac24637603ec877.png"><br>  Need to work!  And for work the main thing is the battery! <br>  So the battery here is good.  Even without an extra battery, the ultrabook runs for about 4 hours. <br>  And an additional battery gives an extra 3.5 hours of work! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/610/9c2/74f/6109c274f497723ddf6b1d9edc5d98ca.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b09/cbe/03b/b09cbe03b7b953928fc1d66e53cec06d.png"><br>  For such a baby - this is a decent result of autonomy. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  In conclusion, I want to mention that my wife really liked the ultrabook.  Design, thickness and style for a woman are more important than cool stuffing and bells and whistles. <br><br>  In summary, I want to say that the ultrabook left a very positive impression.  Excellent screen, sensor, awesome design and excellent materials, as well as good battery life are overshadowed by only a bad keyboard. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169259/</a></p>
