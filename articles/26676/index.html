I allow myself to give some comments as an employee of one of the Moscow state universities.

      I want to begin to correct the author of the post! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  80% come to the 1st course who do not know why they study.  But by the fifth such 20% remains from the force ... It looks like Pareto's law.  =) <br><br>  Many through colleges and go to universities.  The program of the university covers the college program.  So why should I go to college first?  Then to work for a year?  And if I already know exactly why I want to go to university? <br><br>  Have you been in the army?  And your comrades?  All mow and do not want to serve there, but once they become just the same soldiers as those who went there voluntarily. <br><br>  The quality of education and teaching methods are different things.  You have merged them.  But here I will not even develop the topic, because on the whole you are right.  Business should think about higher education much more. <br><br>  The state trains those people that it needs (albeit conditionally and according to the mythical plan).  The state regulates the number of necessary specialists by allocating budget places by specialties.  Everyone enters the budget for the general - the budget passes the one who is better prepared for entering a university, i.e.  It is logical to assume that he wants to get on this budget more than others.  All others who want to study or mow from the army (or boring life) come to a paid department and there are much more of these than students enrolled at the expense of the Russian budget. <br><br>  I agree - there is a problem that graduates immediately want a lot.  According to my observations, these are for some reason problems of the latest issues of students, and precisely Muscovites.  We licked here in the capital =) <br><br>  I do not know with whom you argued, but I think you got a botanist who did not teach the teacher something in the classroom.  This is where our top managers are taught at the first higher education?  Do not hide the name of the university - I do not see anything criminal in it.  You, it seems to me, did not argue with that.  This is really both sad and funny. <br><br>  The surgeon becomes a surgeon only after several years assisted in operations.  Well, it's just me that the analogy is not entirely correct. <br><br>  And now I can speculate a little. <br>  Gentlemen, do not forget - many of you are programmers here, and I don‚Äôt want to offend, programmers are very superficial, at the level of typical web applications.  This is not an insult - it‚Äôs just a type of work that someone must do and many of you are very much appreciated by employers for such programming, and this is reflected in your income. <br><br>  This is the kind of programming in universities that they know how to teach for the time being.  This problem is being solved, slowly but surely, but it will be finally solved when the education system is changed.  Since 5 years to learn what changes every 1.5-2 years seems to me hard.  But a lot of other specialties.  You do not need any items?  Well, don‚Äôt learn, only I start communicating with such programmers on how to solve narrowly-matched tasks and the person doesn‚Äôt know trivial things - what is marginal profit, how is the difference between income and profit, what is C2H5OH, NPV, efficiency and MPC.  =) (examples are intentionally taken from more than one subject, although they turned out to be one-sided).  But this programmer remembers that he had such subjects, and remembers only by the fact that he drank beer during lectures. <br><br>  So back to the professions.  This year, the ministry cut off a large number of places in such specialties as law, organization management, state and municipal administration, etc.  - feel the trend?  These are the specialties that have enjoyed wild popularity in recent years.  but for IT-related specialties, additional budget places are provided, because there are some really good specialists who can work with complex systems and tasks a little.  Unfortunately, now I will give only one example, since there is no longer spec.  There is such a specialty "Information Systems and Technologies", and in such a university as the <a href="http://www.itbu.ru/">RGUITP</a> students in this specialty are honed to work with <a href="http://www.ibm.ru/">IBM</a> products - Lotus, WebSphere, there is something else there.  So, those units that will be able to complete their studies until the end can immediately qualify for salary from 45 000r, and after a couple of years - 80 000 - 90 000 r.  And all because the specialists are able to work in the environment of the same lotus, can be counted on the fingers and all tear off with his hands.  And I haven‚Äôt seen anything special in this area yet. <br><br>  Another example from another area - I downloaded such a decent university as <a href="http://www.mitht.ru/">MITHT</a> .  While I was "fooling around" at the department of "marketing and management," my comrades had been stuck in laboratories for 6 years, receiving education in the fields of polymeric materials, biotechnology, and materials synthesis.  And believe me - this one cannot be learned in 6 years, and the level of training of these specialists is very high. <br><br>  We have problems with higher education, there are problems with teaching methods, problems with training in dynamic (rapidly developing) specialties are also big.  But I assure you that they are known, they are trying to solve and, I hope, they will soon decide. <br><br>  <strong>Thanks for attention!</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26676/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26676/</a></p>
