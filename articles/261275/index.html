  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Key trends in the development of mobile applications, which is worth remembering in 2015</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/701/f7e/239/701f7e239445e3a5f8d9a4f1289425ba.jpg"><br><br>  Most developers are well aware of the main market trends.  We at <a href="http://www.appodeal.ru/">Appodeal</a> see that our clients are very deeply immersed in the topic, this is fine and seriously facilitates our work.  Nevertheless, it is sometimes useful to stop and look around. <br><br>  We decided to analyze the current situation using a number of materials, including the <a href="https://www.developereconomics.com/reports/developer-economics-q1-2015/" rel="nofollow">State of the Developer Nation</a> from VisionMobile.  The report indicates a fairly large amount of information about the current market dynamics.  But we ourselves would highlight the following trends: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Swift is becoming more popular among developers. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f6/085/f6d/1f6085f6d9a74d4b9361d06e89d82ec8.jpg" align="left">  The adoption of new technologies and products may take some time, so the growing popularity of Apple Swift definitely deserves attention.  According to a survey of VisionMobiles, which was attended by 8,000 developers, just four months after the release of Swift, every fifth developer uses it.  Compare this with a share of 39% of Objective C. It is immediately clear that adoption of Swift is quite fast. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Note that 23% of developers using Swift do not use Objective C, which may indicate a wide range of developers who are planning to create native iOS applications to be involved in Swift. <br><br>  Objective-C doesn't go anywhere, so the best iOS experts often work in two languages ‚Äã‚Äãat once.  The VisionMobiles report states that in the next few years it is quite possible that programmers will have to learn both languages ‚Äã‚Äãin order to become a professional in iOS development. <br><br><h3>  2. The growing popularity of cross-platform tools </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c9/d98/0d8/9c9d980d858043b9a5a24a5bbd92877d.jpg" align="left" height="100">  The same report indicates that the majority of respondents use third-party tools in their professional activities: 83% of respondents use at least one tool for analytics, error reporting and testing.  Over the past six months, the share of cross-platform tools has increased from 23 to 30%. <br><br><h3>  3. Corporate applications make more money than regular ones. </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e61/806/dec/e61806dec6b84e4fa3ab2334788c15a2.jpg" align="left" height="180">  Smartphones are becoming more, they are swept off the shelves like hotcakes.  But this does not mean that your application will bring at least some profit.  In fact, developers who create enterprise applications earn more than others.  Thus, 43% of developers who focus on corporate programs receive $ 10,000 or more per month.  At the same time, the share of such developers among those involved in ordinary applications does not exceed 19%.  Many consumers are simply not ready to pay real money for mobile apps.  On the other hand, business representatives are almost always willing to pay for programs that help them work more efficiently and get more money. <br><br><h3>  4. Internet of Things - Hot Topic </h3><br>  Many developers invest their personal time and energy in something that does not promise instant profits here and now.  This is about the Internet of Things.  More than half of the developers surveyed by VisionMobile responded that they were engaged in a project close to IoT.  And for the most part this is still a personal hobby, not a real job.  This direction is still at the initial stage of development, but the community in it is constantly increasing. <br><br>  If we compare all the above (plus taken into account other <a href="https://www.developereconomics.com/reports/developer-economics-q1-2015/">provisions of the report</a> ), it becomes clear that the market for mobile development continues to grow rapidly, involving all new areas - from tools to finance.  Adapting the developer to this dynamic area allows you to always be at the peak of their capabilities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261275/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261275/</a></p>
