      <br>
      It so happened that until the age of 16 I constantly moved, I lived far away from school and, for understandable reasons, had no friends.  All my childhood, I fascinated myself with reading books and self-development: the family was not full and my mother always worked.  When I was 14 years old, I became interested in computers and, by the age of 16, I performed laboratory tests for university students, at the request of teachers. <br>  Being absolutely asocial, I did not communicate much with my peers.  My mother constantly acquainted me with professors of science and candidates (she herself is a candidate of science in philosophy), thus having built my ‚Äúcircle of contacts‚Äù, which in principle could not be.  By the age of 18, mother and stepfather began to worry about the fact that I still have no girlfriend, that the number of friends is small, and I myself am engaged in vacations when I read books or sit at a computer. <br>  Three times I got a nervous breakdown: the first time I could not close my eyes, the rest - I went blind for a week.  The reasons in theory were different, but only I knew the essence. <br><br>  By the age of 18 we moved the last time.  I had to get a residence permit (it was temporary) and I went to the draft board.  After seeing the entries in the card, I was sent to psychologists who conducted several tests over me and gave me three months of free consultations (they otmazali me from the military registration and enlistment office on the second day as ‚Äúfit in wartime‚Äù). <br>  As it turned out, I had a fairly high, but narrowly focused logic, mathematical calculations and IQ analysis: 239 out of 250, where the norm is 160-180.  However, I was completely incompetent in many things, be it associations, communication, and emotional development. <br><br>  Such a diagnosis is difficult for an adult, but, as seen above, it is possible. <br><br><h4>  Spread </h4><br>  Strangely enough, the spread among men and women can be correlated as 4: 1, however, among the girls, Asperger's Syndrome is very rare, because the emotional component is more developed in their development ... Sometimes Asperger's Syndrome is called "purely masculine disease", meaning pronounced systematization, the creation of daily rituals and strict adherence to all internal or external rules.  Among women, Asperger's Syndrome is expressed in the same way, only for dragging more, as it seems to us, emotionally feminine subjects, like dances or artistry. <br>  On average, the percentage of a pronounced disease is about 0.7%, and in a weakly expressed it reaches 0.9% of the total number of people. <br>  In this case, I was lucky: I could, without knowing my illness, force myself to be more social than I could. <br><br><h4>  What is Asperger Syndrome? </h4><br>  As Wikipedia says, Asperger's Syndrome is one of five common developmental disorders, sometimes called a form of high-functioning autism (i.e. a mild form of autism, in which the ability to socialize is relatively preserved).  Often, individuals with Asperger syndrome have normal or high intelligence, but are distinguished by non-standard or underdeveloped social abilities;  often because of this, their emotional and social development, as well as integration, take place later than usual. <br><br>  To be simpler: Asperger syndrome is a weak autistic disease.  In the majority, like autists, they live in their own world and, sacrificing social skills, they develop themselves independently, constantly analyzing, studying, but only what interests them. <br>  Their social and emotional skills are muffled and most of them do not know how to respond to many situations, so they seem to be either ‚Äústupid‚Äù or terribly calm. <br>  However, despite everything, they have a rich and developed inner world, where every situation from reality is displayed and easily adapts to the inner universe, where they are heroes and / or always appear in the center of events.  At any time, they can quickly analyze and present the situation to the smallest detail that ordinary people may find strange.  Most often, this world is strongly connected to reality, therefore their memory is rather long-lived: they can easily tell you a situation from life to such moments as where the pencil lay and the circle stood and how they were turned. <br>  Because of this, they have a very good spatial and logical thinking.  Also, most situations are modeled in advance and to the smallest detail, i.e.  "How to behave if it happens."  Because of this, they have such an important moment in life as intuition, which they have just a clear miscalculation.  Very often they can build you in their own world and understand where you lie to them and how you will behave in a situation and be right.  They can quickly disassemble you in detail, but not understand your motives. <br><br>  Asperger syndrome is a very difficult disease to identify.  On average, almost 10% of people do not know about their disease, however, they often have communication difficulties. <br>  For the most part, there are several reasons, and most often they are contradictory: <br>  - bright or otherwise absent expression of emotions in non-verbal communication.  Absent glance in the eyes or, on the contrary, severe restraint of the direct gaze; <br>  - weak or absent development of relations with peers to the age-appropriate level; <br>  - lack of emotional expression, i.e.  spontaneous joy, easy understanding of jokes; <br>  - lack of emotional and social reciprocity of relations; <br>  - strong withdrawal and / or frequent intensity of one or several interests; <br>  - the constant performance of any standard rituals and heavy attitude to their change; <br>  - strong enthusiasm for details and / or objects; <br>  - late development of meaningful speech; <br>  - also he should not meet the criteria of schizophrenia. <br><br><h4>  The reasons </h4><br>  Asperger's syndrome, like any autistic disease, is congenital or acquired through a head injury. <br>  I was unlucky in this double: when I was 5 years old, I fell from the garage onto a pipe sticking out of the ground and ‚Äúscalped‚Äù to me, and now I have been walking with a big scar over my head all my life.  A couple of centimeters in any direction and I would not be with you. <br><br>  It may well be that autism can go through many generations and reappear on another child.  Often, autists have healthy children, but for the most part, due to the lack of social skills, they do not have a family. <br><br>  It is also believed that it may be acquired due to reasons such as, for example, Attention Deficit Disorder and Hyperactivity Disorder.  More often, it is believed that initially everyone has a predisposition to autism in the form of Asperger Syndrome, but, depending on the upbringing and the environment, it is either muffled or becomes strongly developed. <br><br><h4>  Treatment </h4><br>  Oddly enough, there is no cure for autism. <br><br><h4>  Life in society </h4><br>  People with Asperger's Syndrome can easily coexist with you and such a person who is autistically ill can be your roommate or your co-worker. <br>  This may be a man of genius in his field or such as most people. <br>  Such people are mostly overly naive and truthful.  Very often, they may accidentally insult or offend a person without realizing it themselves, since for them this is quite normal. <br>  In some sphere they may be brilliant, but in some sphere of social skills, on the contrary, they are too deaf or inexpressive. <br>  Most often, all these problems are a misunderstanding of autists and non-autists of each other, such as American and Thai in their views on life. <br>  Children with Asperger Syndrome are often the subject of ridicule in schools because of the ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù for the level of development of the reaction or its absence.  However, if you manage to understand this person, then you can be a very dear friend for him, to whom he will always come to the rescue and with whom there will always be something to talk about, if you can understand him. <br>  Also, these people can quickly develop and be professionals in their field, which often simply cannot correspond to their age level.  Most of these people, even in a narrow sphere, are more focused and have knowledge of smaller details, which in most cases correspond to professorial details.  However, due to low social development, it is difficult for them to share their knowledge. <br>  People with Asperger Syndrome, while they are engaged in their favorite business, very strongly and quickly ‚Äúenter the stream‚Äù, from which it is quite difficult to divert them.  At this time, they demonstrate a rare understanding and adherence to the details of their work, however, in other areas they are often lazy.  In most cases, the argument of this behavior goes to a simple question: I do not need it, then why? <br>  These people are for the most part very pedantic in speech, as they try to express their emotions more correctly and meaningfully.  Although they do not understand associations well, they can express their emotions in strange sentences, where they may even have invented words, the meaning of which can be fully understood. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br>  As mentioned above, I am just interested in some of the details.  I am very fond of programming for networks and encryption.  I am interested in protocols and lower-level network details, I am interested in new types of encryption.  With each book or article I‚Äôm getting more and more into these things and I like it, I‚Äôm interested.  These things will always be relevant and interesting.  They will have a development.  I love puzzles, solve ciphers, and see in the large tables of seven-digit sets of numbers the formulas by which these tables were built. <br>  On the other hand, I have few friends and loneliness is part of my life.  I absolutely do not know how to care for girls, however, I thank my Julia for the fact that she understands me and is sometimes ready to take steps first. <br>  It often turns out that I know how things will go ahead.  In my head, I often keep complex program plans to the smallest detail. <br>  A good memory is also a plus: I can tell you how my father left my family at 2.5 years old literally before my relatives cursed, I can also tell you when at 1.5 years we went to the circus as a family ... <br>  On the other hand, for me is a strong feat to meet a man.  In the majority I don‚Äôt know how to behave in a standard situation, and sometimes I don‚Äôt understand what was said the first time.  I can accidentally offend or offend and even not see it.  Most of me need clearer answers.  It makes me constantly analyze everything that has been said to me and, at times, output so many results that you do not know what the person had in mind. <br>  The army does not take, but allowed to drive a car.  The truth is that you will not work on the railway, and you don‚Äôt walk with a weapon.  Yes, I do not need this. <br><br><h4>  Legends and Myths </h4><br>  1. Autistic people are stupid people. <br>  Not true.  For the most part, these people at the age of 13 have logical connections and knowledge at the level of professors.  Just because of the impossibility of normal communication, it is difficult to communicate. <br><br>  2. Asperger syndrome can hurt anyone <br>  Almost true.  Asperger's syndrome may hurt your neighbor or even you, but do not understand this or even never hear about it, however, the disease is often confused, for example, with ADHD.  The percentage of patients is about 0.7% - 0.9%. <br><br>  3. All programmers and system administrators have Asperger Syndrome. <br>  Lying.  Most of them are sociable people or simply self-limiting.  Autism communication with people is simply not required.  They do not need it. <br><br>  4. Autists don't care about you, they don't feel anything. <br>  Also a lie.  Very often they experience much more.  Wrong movement you can drive him into a stronger silence or hostility to his person.  However, you may not even understand this, since they cannot express it. <br><br>  5. Autists have no children or families. <br>  Almost true.  For the most part, due to the fact that they cannot interact socially normally, they do not start families, because they cannot even find a couple, however, there are those who can live in society and even develop greatly. <br><br>  6. Autists are geniuses like <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC">Kim Pick</a> . <br>  Partially true.  Among them there are often gifted children.  Since the lack of social development is compensated by self-development in their own world.  However, this person may be quite common in his development and not stand out. <br><br>  7. Autists do not work in senior positions. <br>  Also partly wrong.  They are difficult to communicate, however, they may well lead.  With the help of special training, they can develop social skills quite normally. <br><br>  8. Autism is inherited. <br>  Yes and no.  Autism can wake up through several generations.  Autistic children can be quite normal people. <br><br>  9. Autists cannot work. <br>  Yes and no.  Pronounced autists need constant care, however, people with Asperger syndrome may well live and not be aware of their illness. <br><br>  10. This diagnosis can be easily established. <br>  Not.  It is very difficult for an adult to make this diagnosis, however, it is still easier for children.  And then, the diagnosis goes on for months, and sometimes for years. <br><br>  11. Autists do not achieve anything in life. <br>  Also a lie.  Many autists have tremendous knowledge (savant syndrome).  Many people were autistic, such as Albert Einstein, Iisac Newton, Steven Spielberg. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br>  Do not try to set yourself a diagnosis as described.  This is done very long and difficult. <br><br>  Do not think that autists are those who spit in the pillow.  Most of them are very strong and smart people.  Many films have been made about them, for example ‚ÄúRain Man‚Äù, etc. <br>  Do not consider these people to be flawed - so you only remove these people deeper. <br><br>  <b>UDP:</b> There was often commented on that moment that I can not sometimes answer the question correctly or explain. <br>  First, you are comparing the previous article and this one.  We are different people and, as I said above, it is not always easy for me to answer questions and fully explain my understanding of the point; <br>  Secondly, the professions of a psychotherapist, a psychoanalyst and a psychologist are identical to me, because I do not fully understand their differences.  They all creep into your thoughts, try to understand and analyze you; <br>  Thirdly, I received an exemption from military service before I began to go for surveys; <br>  Fourth, an outpatient examination helps to identify other aspects of life without interfering with it (that's what I was told); <br>  Fifth, the medical card in my hands.  I don‚Äôt give it to registries as a matter of principle, so that they don‚Äôt lose it, because all my vaccinations, allergies, reactions to medicines, etc. are described there; <br>  Sixth, I am allergic and I have a very limited range of medicines, so I can not take many pills; <br>  Seventh, medical confidentiality will not allow you to get information about me.  The possibility of error can be everywhere and always.  The doctor I went to is quite qualified and, if he made a mistake, I would be glad, because you rarely want to tell such a truth.  Most of them understand it ambiguously or people think that they understand much better; <br>  Eight, I am not a doctor, so I explained as I could.  Thank you for your criticism.  I received these explanations from my doctor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116859/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116859/</a></p>
