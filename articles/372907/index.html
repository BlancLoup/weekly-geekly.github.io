Usually these were negative posts with an analysis of the price positions of various goods from companies from China and Russia.  For many companies, the "good" tradition has become to inflate prices by 1.5-2 times (or even more) immediately before Black Friday, and then make a 20-30% discount on such goods.  It is clear that many buyers are not aware of the real price, so they buy "promotional" positions without any ulterior motives.  But, of course, all this does not look very beautiful. <br><br>  Our company has been participating in Friday for several years, but we have a different approach.  This year, as usual, we are holding ‚ÄúHonest Black Friday‚Äù.  And here we do not embellish anything - all the shares are really honest, there are no pitfalls.  In this post, we would like to talk a little about Black Friday itself in the United States and Russia, our approach to it and a couple of actions, wherever without it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Is Black Friday Good or Bad? </h3><br>  Initially, the term ‚Äúblack‚Äù carries negative overtones, this is understandable.  Since all this came to us from the West, to understand the origin of the term, it is worth remembering that the terms ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Saturday‚Äù at first had nothing to do with purchases.  They were used by police officers of Philadelphia and Rochester to describe traffic jams and crowds on the eve of holidays.

      The authorities even recommended changing the terminology using the phrases ‚ÄúBig Friday‚Äù and ‚ÄúBig Saturday‚Äù so that everything does not look too gloomy.  But these alternative terms did not gain much popularity and were quickly forgotten. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4dc/d35/a94/4dcd35a94a326c7292a5db0e00ecba92.jpg" width="1000"><br><br>  Among the vendors, Black Friday became a popular phrase, a term describing the shopping season only in the 70s of the last century.  Journalists used it The New York Times on November 29, 1975 to describe "the most crowded and monetary day of the year" in Philadelphia.  In 1985, Cincinnati and Los Angeles retailers were not yet aware of the term.  Only a couple of years later, Black Friday began to be used throughout the United States, and then, 10-15 years later, around the world. <br><br>  On Geektimes, it was rightly pointed out that the sellers of that time marked the loss in red and the profit in black.  But it rather became an additional incentive to use the term "Black Friday".  For the first time, this fact was mentioned by journalists of the Philadelphia Inquirer on November 28, 1981.  Actually, only in the 80s the term acquired a positive color. <br><br>  In the United States, on Black Friday, there are promotions and sales for almost all retailers and regular stores, both offline and online.  On this day, there is an increased number of injuries to customers who literally sweep away everything in their path, be it goods or other buyers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a2/d96/6a4/3a2d966a496483d31f3a320e5762c7ec.jpg" width="1000"><br><br><h3>  What is in Russia? </h3><br>  Since the tradition of sales itself has become a tradition for us not so long ago, so far there are problems.  The fact is that here ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù is a great day for shoppers.  For sellers, this is a problem, in any case, for offline retailers.  To carry out the action, you need to prepare for it, which requires costs, tell customers, change prices, make discounts. <br><br>  In general, almost continuous costs.  That is why (well, plus the traditional desire to work in profit at any cost) a large number of stores do not work very honestly.  There is no doubt that there are those companies that offer honest discounts.  But on Geektimes and other resources is full of stories about how customers are trying to deceive.  Worst of all, the Chinese have already joined this ‚Äútradition‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/721/bc3/cf3/721bc3cf3a6b8fa4db223e0fc831533a.jpg" width="1000"><br><br><h3>  And what about Madrobots? </h3><br>  The main principle of our work is the rapid turnover of goods.  That is, goods-money-goods, here is a cycle.  And the faster the turnover is, the better.  On ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù we put some goods below their cost price (that is, below the price at which they bought).  For all products where the turnover is more than three months, we have set prices below or equal to the cost price (this is easy to check). <br><br>  We did not set discounts for all devices and accessories, but for a certain part - for about 100+ items.  The range of discounts here is large - from 10% to 70%.  All of them are available on the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/bf/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblack_friday_2016">promo code BFSALE</a> , you can check it yourself :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e88/34e/540/e8834e5403b847138be99716cbbda316.jpg"><br>  <i>Discounts on dozens of products are available on the code BFSALE</i> <br><br>  And we also have an excellent promotion: PLayStation 4 and HTC Vive can be obtained for a very low price (up to 1 ruble, the promotional PS4 is already available at this price).  What is this action?  We explain. <br><br>  First of all, the number of promotional devices is limited: there are only 5 consoles, and one video send. <br><br>  Secondly, why one ruble?  The fact is that on the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/bf/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblack_friday_2016">page of our website dedicated to the promotion</a> , it is possible to lower the initial price for promotional devices.  HTC Vive, for example, cost 69990. Every like on a social network or a message about a stock reduces the price by three rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/449/af3/21c/449af321c87b4687a395077aae314d21.png"><br>  <i>Current situation</i> <br><br>  At the start of the sale, 6 participants, randomly selected with the help of a lottery machine during a live broadcast (it will be held on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MadrobotsRussia/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dblack_friday_2016_black_friday_fb">our Facebook page</a> ), will receive an email notification with a code to purchase one of the 6 main sales goods. <br><br>  Upon receipt of the notification, you need to add the promotional item to the cart.  To buy, all you have to do is to click the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button, enter the promotional code from the letter and place an order.  If in the allotted time interval the winner does not make a purchase, the rally will continue until all the main goods of the promotion have been sold. <br><br>  On November 26, at 14:00 Moscow time, we will begin to choose the winners during the live broadcast.  Winners will be determined by the lottery drum.  The broadcast and selection of recipients will continue until all coupons on the site are activated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bf/538/279/4bf5382793bb48b889c70c7de1d611ed.jpg"><br>  <i>This drum will be used to determine the winners.</i> <br><br><h3>  Some statistics </h3><br>  The action is already underway, so all readers of Geektimes have the opportunity to take part in it, buying excellent things at a good price.  Some positions are more popular than others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da8/7a8/8bb/da87a88bb1954e7aa0cdecbf153443ac.jpg"><br><br>  Interestingly, despite the clearly defined conditions of the action regarding HTC Vive and PS4, some buyers order these goods first, and then wonder why their price is not 1 ruble at all.  But this we attribute to the action casus - similar situations happen and no longer cause surprise. <br><br>  The action has already attracted several thousand participants, of which more than 9 thousand (9305) shared information about PS4 promotions and almost 3 thousand (2892) - about the video helmet on social networks.  If anyone is interested, here is the promotional traffic in just one day, November 23. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e9/23e/6e3/0e923e6e36234261ae46c1ce64adffea.jpg"><br>  <i>‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù, as we see, interests many users in Russia, everyone wants to purchase goods at a discount, and we welcome this desire.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372907/</a></p>
