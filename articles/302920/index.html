      They do not know about the components of a successful landing page and do not use split testing when developing their own landing pages.  They do not interact with the audience at the very beginning, so the results are appropriate.  Copy others - this is the last thing you can do for the company.  As a rule, this approach does not lead to success, even if the copy object is on the list of top marketing solutions. <br><br>  What can you do?  See how industry leaders do, analyze their approaches, mark the most interesting ‚Äútricks‚Äù for themselves and transfer this experience to your individual ‚Äúsoil‚Äù. <br><br>  To create the most effective landing pages, you need to understand the ‚Äúpsychology‚Äù of optimization.  <b>To increase the profit from your landing, you need to pay attention to such criteria as:</b> <br><br>  <b>Value proposition</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Relevance</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Clarity</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Necessity for the consumer</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Customer care</b> <br><br>  So let's start in order. <br>  <b>1. Value of the offer</b> <br><br>  The most important criterion.  Here you should answer the question that you offer to the consumer.  To do this, build the scheme: <br><br>  <b>Value - The advantages of your offer - The cost of obtaining such an offer</b> <br><br>  Moreover, the cost of receiving includes not only the price of the goods or services, but also the efforts that should be expended to obtain them.  Psychologists consider two substances as motivation for something: movement towards a personal goal and avoiding problems and unpleasant moments.  As a rule, painkillers (which get rid of trouble in the form of physical pain), people buy more often than vitamins to maintain immunity. <br><br>  <b>2. Relevance</b> <br><br>  Your advertisements and landings should be designed so that their message fully conveys the content of the final product and the user does not have any additional questions about the relevance of its acquisition.  By clicking on the ad, the user must receive what attracted him initially. <br><br>  <b>3. Clarity</b> <br><br>  Landing pages should be clear, without unnecessary elements that distract from the main content.  Ornate design may look better, but if due to it the attention of users will dissipate, there will be no benefit from it.  <b>It is important to remember the original task of the landing - sale.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  <b>How to make your landing page more ‚Äúunderstandable‚Äù?</b> <br><br>  <b>Laconic, but at the same time informative copywriting.</b>  It involves mostly simple sentences, without complex formulations and incomprehensible sentences.  A potential client should not spend time for a long awareness of what he read on the landing page. <br><br>  <b>More visible call to action</b> <br><br>  <b>Absolutely every element on your page should perform the task of increasing conversion</b> .  Objects that do not meet this requirement, we remove without regret.  They will not help us. <br><br>  <b>Necessity</b> .  One of the most influential psychological principles. <br><br>  Imagine a situation where your friend wants to go on Friday evening and unwind and calls you with him.  And you want to stay home and watch the ‚ÄúGame of Thrones‚Äù.  The choice is obvious.  However, if it turns out that after a couple of days, your comrade is going abroad and for several years you cannot see each other, priorities shift dramatically.  This is the motivation, which should not be forgotten in the preparation of landing pages. <br><br>  <u>You have to ‚Äúpush‚Äù customers to take one or another action at a given moment.</u>  <u>It is in this, because people tend to be distracted and they can easily switch from your advertising message.</u>  <u>You must literally ‚Äúhook‚Äù them with your call.</u> <br><br>  <b>How to motivate users?</b> <br><br>  <b>Countdown timer</b>  You can add a script that has a countdown.  For example: ‚ÄúYou have 5 minutes left to buy ...‚Äù, ‚ÄúOur action ends at midnight‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  <b>Limitations</b> .  You can indicate that you have a certain amount of goods or a certain number of places (for registering for a webinar or a conference).  Fear of being left without a profitable investment will motivate users to make purchasing decisions faster. <br><br>  Here it is important to explain to potential customers why they need to purchase the product right now.  It is desirable that the reason be explained in as much detail as possible and naturally. <br><br>  <b>Customer anxiety</b> <br><br>  This is a natural reaction of users to pay to buy online.  Today, there are many cyber fraudsters who write off money from unsuspecting people.  This can not but leave an imprint on the overall level of distrust of users of Internet resources. <br><br>  <b>What can you do to increase the level of trust in your company?</b> <br><br>  Provide statistics on how many people are already using your services / using your product.  People are social by nature, so the argument in the form of public approval, as a rule, helps them to decide on the purchase of goods <br><br>  Add to the landing information about the confidentiality of data entered on the site. <br><br>  Post customer reviews.  Use real testimonials from real people.  So you can build and maintain a positive reputation for a long time. <br><br>  <b>Abstraction</b> <br><br>  This element is the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù of your conversion and profit.  On the landing page there should not be any objects that in one way or another distract the user from the purchase.  Take them away. <br><br>  As is clearly seen from the above, working with a competent landing page is not an easy one.  <b>To achieve the maximum effect of the landing pages, you need to work with them at all stages - starting with preparatory analysis and ending with monitoring the interim results from visiting the site.</b> <br><br>  <b>The main thing when designing landings is not to forget that their visitors are real people who have their own interests, needs, desires and fears.</b> <br><br>  Put the most clear and interesting idea into the landing page, and then the profit will not take long. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr08062016-2"><b>BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302920/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302920/</a></p>
