  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Patriot or Columbus? Domestic and foreign freelance exchanges</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Suppose one day after the next office day you decided, you need to change something, stop feeding others and so on and so on. After a difficult and painful internal dialogue, you decided to work for yourself, namely ‚Äútry‚Äù freelancing .  And with this firm decision hit the road. <br><br>  Hmm, and freelancers do not go anywhere, yes, for sure.  You did not go, and decided to find a place to look for orders.  So you decided to choose an exchange for yourself to search for projects and customers. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And here is the razdoroje, not only is there a huge number of exchanges, so there is also a more global question.  To work on domestic stock exchanges as a true patriot or, like Columbus, to conquer foreign ones.  I want to highlight this topic.  Just in case, by domestic I understand those in which Russian is the main language, and in foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãthe main one is different, mostly English.

      To an inexperienced <s>Jedi</s> freelancer, it may seem that foreign exchanges are much better, because they pay much more there.  But not everything is so simple, ha ha. <br><br>  So, what are the advantages of foreign exchanges over domestic producers: <br><ul><li>  <strong>High cash rate.</strong>  In other words, on foreign exchanges, most often, your work is valued more highly.  For example, the average rate of a php programmer on our exchanges is about $ 7 per hour.  Whereas on foreign exchanges it can be 2 times more. </li><li>  <strong>Higher guarantee of payment</strong> .  At the current stage of development, domestic exchanges are making little effort to increase the guarantee of payment.  The only means available is a ‚Äúsecure transaction‚Äù type of services.  But it is not strange that very few people use them.  Either it is a pity for the commission money, or this mentality :) So abroad, freelancing took a step forward in this direction, using such services is considered normal and correct.  Moreover, some exchanges offer hourly pay.  In this case, the freelancer gets money for the clock that he worked, and not by the result.  Even if the customer is not satisfied with the result, the developer does not lose all the money, but receives as much as he has accumulated.  In addition, for foreign customers the very concept of hourly pay is more acceptable than ours. </li><li>  <strong>More orders</strong> .  It turns out that not only in RuNet there are sites, moreover, RuNet occupies only a small part of the entire Internet.  Accordingly, the work on foreign exchanges is much more and it is more diverse. </li></ul>  On this, perhaps, the main benefits end.  They are few, but they are weighty. <br><br>  What will please domestic exchanges: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Russian language</strong> .  Yes, if not strange language barrier for many can not be overcome.  And the language is needed not only for placing bets, but also for subsequent communication.  Some customers will want to talk on Skype, then it will be very difficult. </li><li>  <strong>Lower dumping</strong> .  On the one hand, there are much more customers on foreign exchanges, but on the other hand, think about how many people are interested.  After all, English is known not only by the British, and even not only by Russians, but by almost everyone :) Including the beloved Indians, the Chinese, and everyone, I think there are people who want to say something even in hot Africa.  And in all these countries, the standard of living is low enough that people appreciate themselves cheap. </li><li>  <strong>More convenient ways of calculating with freelancers</strong> .  For example, exchanging paypal for real money is not such an easy task.  For comfortable work with foreign exchanges, you will have to draw up a card (although if you do this, it will be quite comfortable to work).  Whereas Webmoney, Yandex Money and others have long been convenient ways to cash out. </li><li>  <strong>The possibility of personal contact</strong> .  Often, you can meet with a client live if you work on a domestic stock exchange, especially if you live in Moscow or Kiev.  You can live to assess the human qualities of the client, to better understand whether it is worth doing business with him.  In addition, you can issue paper contracts that can increase the likelihood of paying for your work, as well as avoid a number of problems and misunderstandings. </li><li>  <strong>Nice design</strong> .  Here, in general, mysticism, or abroad, completely different ideas about the design of sites, or the creators of foreign exchanges believe that good design only spoils the impression of the site.  I do not know why, but I know very few foreign exchanges with a good design, unlike ours.  Trifle in general, but nice :) </li></ul>  That's it :) You can work there and there, it's hard to say which option is better.  But I prefer to work on domestic exchanges.  Maybe this is patriotism :), maybe because we are on time with our team, and now it is easier for us than for beginners. <br><br>  If you are doing well with English and you are confident, you can safely work with foreigners, but if not, then it will be easier for you to start on ours. <br><br>  Our popular stock exchanges are free-lance.ru and weblancer.net <br>  Popular overseas are getafreelancer.com, elance.com, rentacoder.com, also recommend odesk.com <br><br>  Interestingly, there are professionals living abroad working on Russian exchanges. <br><br>  So make a choice and go ahead, comrades! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27177/</a></p>
