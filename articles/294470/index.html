  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to get a Blue Card or residence permit in Germany and how much it costs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since the issue of obtaining a work permit is always very important, I managed to get an acquaintance to a German company that provides relocation services to specialists who come to work in Germany.  I bring to your attention the following information including approximate dates and tariffs, dates and tariffs approximate, because as a rule all cases are individual and very often the final decision for the official who reviews the application. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>General information:</b> <br><ol><li>  The application is filed through the German Embassy in the applicant's country.  Sometimes the waiting time for the consideration date after filing the application takes up to 3 months.  (Depends on the embassy itself) </li><li>  The level of education (Bachelor of Fundamental Informatics and Information Technology, Master of Applied Informatics, etc.) must correspond to the same level in Germany according to the Anabin database.  Most often, finding a match is not difficult, but sometimes it happens that matching can be found only with the help of an experienced person. </li><li>  The time for consideration of an application for a Blue Card, a residence permit or a diploma confirmation, which will be indicated below for each individual scenario, is purely indicative.  No one can accurately predict any time result.  Nevertheless, the company's experience has shown that failures are quite rare, but the company does not undertake to guarantee a time for which it has no influence. </li><li>  All information concerns candidates who did not previously have a German Blue Card or residence permit.  For applicants who have previously been granted a German Blue Card and a residence permit, the application may take from 8 to 12 weeks to complete.  In this case, the embassy must also contact Ausl√§nderbeh√∂rde (OVIR), which additionally takes time. </li><li>  The spouse of the candidate almost always receives a work permit.  In the case of a residence permit (scenarios 3-5), the spouse (s) (s) must have a basic level of knowledge of the German language (A1). </li><li>  Children are guaranteed a visa. </li><li>  A diploma confirmation in Germany may be necessary for those candidates whose educational level does not have a match in the Anabin database.  Confirmation takes approximately 3 months from the date of application.  For Blue card applicants, the period is approximately 2 weeks. </li><li>  The difference between a Blue card and a residence permit is that the Blue card offers several advantages: <br>  - there is no need to confirm the knowledge of the German language; <br>  - EU citizens do not have priority; <br><br>  A permanent residence permit can be obtained after the expiration of 33 months of residence in Germany. </li><li>  A work permit is part of a residence permit. </li><li>  Knowledge of German is not a prerequisite. </li><li>  The gross salary is the amount before taxes.  Netto - after taxes. </li><li>  Freelancer visa is also an opportunity for a candidate who is denied a work visa.  This type of visa is not clearly regulated by law and is granted at the discretion of the official.  The basis for such a visa can serve as a contract for consulting services in the field of IT.  Sometimes the chances of getting a work permit are higher if a candidate has worked with an employer as a freelancer for a while. </li></ol>

      <b>Scenario 1</b> <br>  <b>The candidate has an IT education (profile) with a clear German match according to the Anabin database and an annual salary of gross&gt; 48,400 Euro.</b> <br>  Meets <b>Blue Card</b> requirements. <br>  Chances of receiving: 95% <br>  Deadline: 1-2 weeks + time waiting for appointment date of consideration (may be up to 3 months.) <br><br>  <b>Scenario 2</b> <br>  <b>The candidate has an IT education (profile) with a clear German match according to the Anabin database and an annual salary of gross&gt; 37,752 Euro.</b> <br>  This is the same as Scenario 1, but annual salary is allowed a little lower for vacancies from areas where there is a shortage of candidates ... such as IT. <br>  Meets <b>Blue Card</b> requirements. <br>  Chances of receiving: 95% <br>  Deadline: 5-6 weeks + time waiting for appointment date of consideration (maybe up to 3 months.) <br><br>  <b>Scenario 3</b> <br>  <b>The candidate has an IT education (profile) with German correspondence according to Anabin and an annual salary gross &lt;37,752 Euro.</b> <br>  Meets the requirements of a residence permit <br>  Chances of receiving: high but dependent on salary level + EU citizens have priority <br>  Deadline: 5-6 weeks + time waiting for appointment date of consideration (maybe up to 3 months.) <br><br>  <b>Scenario 4</b> <br>  <b>Candidate education has no match in Anabin database.</b> <br>  Chances depend on the level of education.  In this case, there are 2 possibilities: <br>  - Apply for a diploma confirmation (approximately 3 months) and another 5-6 weeks is the consideration of the visa. <br>  - see Scenario 5 <br><br>  <b>Scenario 5</b> <br>  <b>The candidate does not have a document confirming education.</b> <br>  The result depends on the position for which the candidate is applying, as well as from the official who is considering the application.  Not rare cases when a candidate with deep knowledge, but not having a diploma, received a work permit because he was very interested in the company and she confirmed that she needs such an employee and that there are no candidates with similar knowledge among German or EU citizens. <br><br>  Since there is an acute shortage of IT specialists, really good specialists have a chance to get a work permit even without education documents.  There is also a regional interest (different lands) in IT specialists and in the absence of candidates from Germany and the EU, but with an experienced specialist, even without a diploma, a work permit may be granted. <br><br>  The real chances of a candidate can only be found out if there is interest in the company and documents of the candidate. <br><br>  In this case, there are 2 possibilities: <br>  - try to get a work visa (takes 2-3 months or more) <br>  - freelancer visa with the right to get a work permit for a year or more (takes 2-3 months or more) <br><br>  <b>Prices</b> <br>  A full package of services for registration of all documents (relocation) costs about 800-1500 Euro per family.  I do not list the services included in the package, since it depends on each specific case.  Someone needs more documents, someone less, someone himself, and someone has a big family. <br><br>  Diploma confirmation costs 200 Euro.  This is the ZAB (Central Office for Foreign Education) rate. <br>  The company's services in support of the diploma sub-certification process are 250 Euro. <br><br>  Full consultation on obtaining a Blue card, residence permit or confirmation of a diploma costs 180 Euro.  Includes: <br>  - examination of candidate documents; <br>  - assessment of chances (approximate); <br>  - time estimate (approximate); <br><br>  The sum of 180 Euro is deducted from the cost of the company's relocation services if the candidate decides to use it (relocation service). <br><br>  If I missed something, I will be glad to clarify and complete. <br>  Anyone who wants to communicate directly with the company, write to me in PM. <br><br>  Anyone who is looking for a job abroad, I invite to <a href="http://itrabota.com/">itRabota</a> <br><br>  Let me remind you that from time to time I will post useful information on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">Facebook</a> and in <a href="http://vk.com/public101815422">VK</a> group, as well as information on the availability of current vacancies. <br><br>  <b>useful links</b> <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.bluecard-eu.de/eu-blue-card-germany">Qualification for Blue Card</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://anabin.kmk.org/">Anabin</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kmk.org/information-in-english/statement_of_comparability_for_foreign_higher_education_qualifications.html">List of documents, rates and other information on the confirmation of the diploma (ZAB - Central Office for Foreign Education)</a> </li></ul><br><br>  Have a nice day everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294470/</a></p>
