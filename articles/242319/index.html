As part of the HWV, anyone can touch, poyuzat, potest any favorite piece of iron and get advice on the nuances of the use of a particular equipment.  There will be workshops on the security of embedded systems and wireless networks. <br><br>  For DIY lovers, we will review modern solutions for creating their devices based on the following platforms: <br><ul><li>  Teensy 2.0, 3.1 </li><li>  Dragino v2 </li><li>  mbed LPC1786 </li><li>  Spark code </li><li>  Arduino different versions </li><li>  Radxa Rock Pro </li><li>  Raspberry Pi (B +) </li></ul><br>  Hams, SDR users and hackers of wireless networks will be able to practice using such devices: <br><ul><li>  Hackrf </li><li>  BladeRF </li><li>  Ubertooth </li><li>  Proxmark3 </li></ul><br>  For reversers of embedded platforms and those who are simply interested, we will conduct a demonstration and train them to work with the following hacker devices: <br><ul><li>  Facedancer </li><li>  Die datenkeke </li><li>  Bus Pirate, Bus Blaster </li><li>  JTAGulator </li><li>  Papillio Pro FGPA </li><li>  USB IR Toy </li><li>  Open Workbench LogicSniffer </li></ul><br><h4>  In mini format </h4><br>  If you can not only break systems and devices in two or three steps, but are also ready to assemble an interesting device and tell the hacker community about it, do not pass by the Hardware Village!  This year, enthusiasts of this section have planned three competitions for lovers of hacker devices: <br><br>  1) Hacking embedded systems <br><br>  This competition will continue throughout the conference.  The first to crack the hacker device made by the organizers will receive it as a gift.  There will be several unique devices. <br><br>  2) Stand up and Hack, competition of mini-reports <br><br>  Thanks to this competition, any beginner publisher will be able to speak in public without any particular formalities.

After the appearance of every third topic, a break will be announced at HW Village, during which mini-reports will be heard.  We promise to award the best performances. <br><br>  3) HackDev - development and presentation of your hacker device <br><br>  This contest allows people who spend nights soldering / assembling their hacker devices to present their invention to the world and hold its presentation.  The authors of the best devices will receive valuable prizes. <br><br><h4>  Python Arsenal Contest </h4><br>  This is a competition of tools for solving complex problems in the Reverse Engineering process.  We believe that it will benefit the entire security community, as the plugins will be available to everyone, and experience will be shared.  To take part in it, it is not necessary to participate in the conference - you can do it remotely. <br><br>  rules <br><ul><li>  The project / script / plugin / extension should use the library from <a href="http://pythonarsenal.erpscan.com/">pythonarsenal.erpscan.com</a> . </li><li>  A new tool (not previously published) or a major update to the already known project / library / plugin with new interesting features. </li><li>  A description, requirements, installation manual is required. </li><li>  Send your <a href="">submissions</a> to <a href="">pythonarsenal@zeronights.org</a> . </li><li>  Results will be announced at the ZeroNights conference (November 14, 2014). </li></ul><br>  Prizes: unique hacker t-shirt and souvenir (personal steel badge), placement in the hall of fame, stickers.
