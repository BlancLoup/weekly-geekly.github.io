  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JIRA developer company has grown to IPO, developing without investors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The developer of the legendary Task Manager JIRA Australian IT-company Atlassian plans to go to the IPO by the end of the year.  This was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/australian-software-tools-maker-atlassian-planning-u-s-ipo-1443213301">reported</a> edition of The Wall Street Journal. <br><br>  Last year, Atlassian's valuation reached $ 3.3 billion thanks to the company's outstanding financial performance.  Separately, it is worth noting that the company developed independently, without third-party investments.  The participation of such funds as <a href="http://www.accel.com/">Accel Partners</a> , <a href="http://www.troweprice.com/">T. Rowe Price Group</a> and <a href="http://lavca.org/tags/dragoneer-investment-group/">Dragoneer Investment Capital</a> , was limited to the purchase of insignificant shares.  Moreover, Atlassian, for all 13 years, is growing exclusively due to word of mouth and does not keep sales managers on staff. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Given the unstable situation on the stock exchanges, access to the IPO for the company is a bold, but risky step.  As practice has shown, in such periods, many startups with an estimate of more than $ 1 billion do not dare to go public.  According to the company Dealogic, since the beginning of this year, only 19 companies in the United States held an IPO.  Last year, for the same period of time, 41 companies became public.  However, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/pure-storage-sets-ipo-price-2015-9">Pure Storage</a> and <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17914/">Square</a> are exceptions.  Both are preparing to go IPO this year.

      Pure Storage's capitalization has almost reached $ 3 billion.  The company manufactures disk storage consisting entirely of flash drives (all-flash).  Pure Storage will offer 25 million shares at prices ranging from $ 16 to $ 18.  As a result, the company's market capitalization could reach $ 3.3 billion.  The manufacturer of storage systems plans to attract as part of an IPO, taking into account all expenses, on average about $ 395.2 million. <br><br>  Last year, investors estimated Squre at $ 6 billion.  The founder of the company is Jack Dorsey from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">Twitter</a> .  Square offers its customers payment terminals, charging 2.75% of each transaction.  The company has already sent a request for initial public offering to US regulators. <br><br>  In the case of a successful IPO, in the hands of the founders (Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes) Atlassian will be almost the entire considerable amount gained from the placement.  After all, apart from them, the company has practically no co-owners. <br><br>  In addition to the attractive IPO prospects, Atlassian already has a very strong trump card in his hands.  A commercial success came to the company due to the demand for its products and services in Silicon Valley that had risen to heaven.  After all, it is one of the world centers for the development of the IT industry in general and software development in particular. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the competition remains fairly tough, and the Atlassian flag still stands on all the fortresses.  JIRA holds its ground tight.  But launched in 2010 and purchased in March 2012 by Atlassian, the corporate messenger <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kato/blog/246275/">HipChat</a> lost in many markets to the rival <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/8540/">Slack</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294848/</a></p>
