  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Combined Russian-Ukrainian typographical keyboard layout for Mac OS X 10.6</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr. <br><br>  For the second week now my main operating system is Mac OS X (10.6.7).  Impressions ... ambiguous.  I like many things very much, I am ready to put up with some (and even admit that the time will come when I find them comfortable), but there is one that does not suit me simply categorically.  Namely - keyboard layouts.  The fact is that I have to work with the design of texts (accordingly, we need a convenient typographical layout), plus, besides English and Russian, Ukrainian is often required.  Well, I tapped off a PC-shnoy keyboard for 15 years and continue to use it on my main job. <br><br>  Looking around in Mac OS X in her out-of-the-box condition, I was sad ... The situation, with the eyes of a new-look sweater, was approximately as follows: <br><ol><li>  Switch layouts for Command + Space.  A rather beautiful solution is a reflection of a large translucent window with layouts, but I am not used to it. </li><li>  The default layout is US. It is not disabled (in any case, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/9806/">Q &amp; A question</a> is still unanswered). </li><li>  Typographical symbols on the layouts are present, but the set does not correspond to what I usually use - a lot of excess (for me) and a lot is missing. </li><li>  The standard Russian layout is different from the PC-shnoy - a dot and a comma are available at Shift + 6, Shift + 7. There is a truth, and a PC-shny option.  Everything is quite bad with Ukrainian - there is no PC-version, plus the letters "I" / "–Ü" are replaced by places. </li></ol><br>  What do geeks do when they are not satisfied with something in the system?  Right.  :) Take the file in hand.

        </script>
      <br>
      First of all I ported my typographic layout for poppy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/413/504/ec0/413504ec028910a2088010989548f378.png" alt="English layout"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since this question is asked quite often, I will tell you preventively how it differs from the <a href="http://ilyabirman.ru/projects/typography-layout/">layout of Ilya Birman</a> : <br><ul><li>  First and foremost: it is aimed not only at text designers, but also at programmers, layout designers, Wikipedia editors.  What does it mean?  On any layout, almost all characters are available in English - #, |, &amp;, ^, &lt;,&gt; and others.  Now you do not need to switch to enter a single character. </li><li>  Expanded set of typographic characters.  For example, I do not understand why Illya has a multiplication sign (√ó and even ¬∑), but there is no division sign (√∑ and  ‚Üê not to be confused with a slash).  I also found it necessary to place a short space, the designation of the Japanese yen, the Ukrainian hryvnia, shootouts, additional symbols of copyright designation, and a heart.  Mi-mi-mi. </li><li>  It is possible to enter all digits in the superscript (Alt + 1, + digit), and all options of 1 / x fractions available in Unicode (Alt + Shift + 1, + digit). </li><li>  In the version for Mac there are characters with icons of Mac keys. </li><li>  There are no accents (in my opinion, they still have a place on the keyboard layouts of the respective languages). </li></ul><br>  In the draft version, layouts were created for three languages: English, Russian and Ukrainian.  It has become a bit more comfortable, but, alas, it is still far from ideal.  Non-switchable English layout with hellish typography did not allow to consider the mission as completed.  In search of a way to solve this problem, <a href="http://punto.yandex.ru/mac/">Punto Switcher for Mac</a> was considered - it allowed you to select 2 arbitrary layouts, and switch between them using any key combination (including Ctrl / Alt + Shift, by the way).  I found this option quite convenient (after turning off the ruffles, such as auto-switching), but again the problem is just two layouts ... <br><br>  This time the file creaked a little longer, but I got what I needed.  Rejecting the functionality of the Caps Lock key, made 2 layouts - English, which does not respond to pressing Caps Lock, and a combined Russian-Ukrainian, in which switching between Russian and Ukrainian is done, in fact, by Caps Lock.  Cyrillic layouts look like this: <br><br>  Russian <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/650/581/151/650581151845a3ae7b64203ea757b599.png" alt="Russian layout"><br><br>  Ukrainian <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/939/adb/612/939adb61269a2eeef413361adf5ef57f.png" alt="Ukrainian layout"><br><br>  What did I get as a result? <br><ol><li>  Excellent (perfect for me) typographic layouts. </li><li>  Switching between Latin and Cyrillic according to the native sweet heart Alt + Shift (optionally tuned to any other combination). </li><li>  In Cyrillic, switching between Russian and Ukrainian by Caps Lock. </li></ol><br>  What have I lost? <br><ol><li>  Caps Lock.  Now, for LOUD APPLICATIONS you need to hold Shift.  :) imho, not critical. </li><li>  The setting ‚Äúindividual keyboard layout for each window‚Äù somewhat makes no sense, because  In Cyrillic, everything will also rest against the state of Caps Lock. </li></ol><br>  In general, now I feel comfortable and happy.  I would be glad if my decision is useful to someone else. <br><br>  Download links: <br>  <a href="">Package with layouts</a> .  To install, simply place the <i>EnRuUaTypographic.bundle</i> file in the <i>~ / Library / Keyboard Layouts</i> directory.  <b>En-Us Typographic</b> (English without reaction to Caps Lock), <b>Ru-Ua Typographic</b> (Russian by default, Ukrainian by Caps Lock) and <b>Ua-Ru Typographic</b> (respectively, on the contrary) appear in the list of available layouts.  After installation, I recommend to reboot just in case. <br>  <a href="">Archive with large pictures</a> with the layout.  You can print on paper or using your favorite image editor to stick over your favorite desktop wallpaper.  Images with alpha channel. <br>  <a href="http://punto.yandex.ru/mac/">Punto Switcher for Mac</a> , you already know why: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/434/76c/cfd/43476ccfd2eabad11b8525c5981dbca7.png" alt="Connecting Layouts to Punto Switcher"><br><br>  I bow to it.  You can scold and express wishes. <br><br>  Upd .: Transferred to "Typography". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125589/</a></p>
