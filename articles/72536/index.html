This is a beautiful, team shooter, made in the sci-fi style and inspired by the anime "Ghost in the Shell", "AKIRA", and from the game Counter-Strike.  Compared to other existing mods for free, the game is not only notable for very beautiful and well-developed maps, weapons and characters, but also a very interesting gameplay.  The goal of the game is to capture the " <a href="">ghost</a> " and take it to the enemy base, or kill all opponents.  In achieving this goal you will be helped by 20 different types of weapons, and 3 different classes, each of them is unique and has its own unique instrument of vision. <br>  The owner of the "ghost" (flag) can <a href="">see</a> all members of the enemy team at a distance of 50m. <br><br>  Tackle - features of the game, gameplay video, as well as links to download the game itself and screenshots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0e2/3df/460/0e23df460d8692a38b725a6d5d5e7ebb.jpg" alt="image"></a>

      The tactical part of the game is very important, thoughtless assault, and the game ‚Äúfor itself‚Äù is very severely punished.  The game makes follow the location of your team members, almost without a radar, showing only their points.  The presence of fast classes allows you to bypass the entire enemy team from the rear, and cause them serious damage.  The ability to <a href="">lean out of the corner</a> , not rarely allows you to stay alive and reduce the affected area for the enemy.  The system of experience and titles gives bonuses to the winning team, revealing new weapons for them, but I hope it will be fixed: P.  The presence of different classes, makes change tactics, depending on who you see in front of you. <br><br>  A little more about classes: <br>  Recon - The fastest class in the game, it can run without stopping, but it has a weak weapon, but it can remain invisible * for a long time and jump into places inaccessible to other classes.  <a href="">Can see in the dark</a> and leave remote bombs. <br>  Support - Carries heavy armament, and is equally heavy scolding, because of which I can not run, and enter into invisibility *.  Can switch to <a href="">thermal vision</a> , which allows you to see through his own smoke grenades. <br>  Assault - Something in between the Recon and Support classes, has medium weaponry and a combat grenade, has a run limit, and can go into invisibility *.  He has a certain <a href="">‚ÄúMotionvision‚Äù i.</a>  <a href="">sees movement</a> . <br>  * Thermo-optical camouflage. <br><br>  Plot: <br>  The plot in the shooter, and even more so in the network shooter, is usually not important and carries only common features, and in NeoTokyo, we are given only a brief description of it. <br>  In the near future in Tokyo, after unsuccessful changes to the constitution, an armed coup occurred with the seizure of power by the JINRAI organization, trying to defend their constitutional rights, military intelligence and police forces created a group called the NSF National Security Forces. <br><br>  The weapon in the game has a strange, and slightly casual accuracy, in which shooting bursts is almost the same as incessant shooting.  Dependence on hitting different parts of the body is present, while headshots still ‚Äúblow down the tower‚Äù, but not in a metaphorical sense :). <br>  There are currently about 10 cards in the game, and 10 cards are being prepared for release with the next patch. <br>  In my opinion, the game may soon become paid, as it was with Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. <br><br>  Advantages of the game: <br>  -The beauty of maps and objects and their elaboration in detail. <br>  -Excellent OST and sounds in general. <br>  -Great tactical capabilities. <br>  -Free game. ** <br>  -Original gameplay. <br>  -Not high system requirements. <br><br>  Cons of the game: <br>  - Not debugged system of experience.  (at least from my point of view, as it creates an even greater imbalance with strong players in the 1st team and weak ones in the other). <br>  ** - Requirement of one of the games Source and Steam. <br><br>  Screenshots <a href="http://www.neotokyohq.com/media.html">here</a> . <br>  Download the game for free <a href="http://www.neotokyohq.com/download.html">here</a> , please do not forget that you need one of the games on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/search/%3Fcategory2%3D16">source</a> engine. <br>  The soundtrack has already appeared on torrentsru, and you can buy it on the off site of the game. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DozC8dHrhRIs">Gameplay video</a> . <br><br>  PS A worthy alternative to CS. <br><br>  Add <br>  Possible application without the presence of purchased games is to read in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72536/</a></p>
