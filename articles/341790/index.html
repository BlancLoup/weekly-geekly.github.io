In the hands of a skilled copywriter, phrases are transformed, phrases are transformed into capacious and informative text that can push the user to make a purchasing decision.  How to check yourself and distinguish high-quality text content from "water" text that can drive a potential client from the site after reading the first two paragraphs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Mnogabukaf </h3><br>  <i>Marketing text on a site is a kind of advertising message placed on the site pages as a text message, with the aim of influencing the reader in a certain way.</i>  <i>A good text is interesting in its content, beautifully designed visually, conveys meaning to the reader and has an effect inducing the reader to act in a certain way.</i> <br><br>  So do not write.  A user has come to your site to obtain concise and capacious information about a product or service.  And you give him a high school abstract: the term, definition, classification, methods of application ... By the way, some copywriters are exactly the way they approach the task of writing text for a site. 
      <br>

      If you think that the more information you provide in the texts, the sooner the client will make a positive decision about buying or receiving a service, prepare for disappointment.  The likelihood that a user will read your Wikipedia is nearing zero.  To interest and lead him to the adoption of the desired decision - your task.  A potential client is not obliged to sit and get the information he needs from the text bit by bit. <br>  About the glut of "keywords" to remind, probably no longer needed?  Even novice experts know that this is not only "hurts the eyes" and annoys the user, but also adversely affects the position of the site in the organic issue. <br><br><h3>  Lack of logic </h3><br>  <i>Texts, of course, should be logical.</i>  <i>The consequence follows from the cause, and the solution from the problem, and sometimes vice versa.</i>  <i>The order of the terms does not matter.</i>  <i>When a client comes to your site, he obviously wants to buy something.</i>  <i>But first he needs to learn more about the product.</i>  <i>Find out, first of all, with what pain he came.</i>  <i>Perhaps you have exactly the product that he was looking for and did not find on the market.</i>  <i>This will be the task of his coming to you.</i>  <i>Indeed, first and foremost is quality.</i> <br><br>  The art of coherently speaking and expressing their thoughts in writing is owned by, alas, a few.  Often we come across about such a ‚Äústream of consciousness‚Äù on the site.  But this is not a place for verbal sculptures, unless, of course, this is not a blog.  If the primary task of your site is to sell a product or service, then think of the text as a logical chain that can lead the buyer to a purchasing decision and at the same time argue that it is necessary to make a choice. <br>  Orient help two ways. <br><br>  <i>The first.</i>  Find out / remember what questions your potential buyers can ask you.  Most often, there is no need to answer the question ‚Äúwhat?‚Äù; If the user came to your site, he already knows what he wants.  But he will be interested in: basic characteristics, differences from other offers, price, equipment, reviews, payment and delivery terms, etc. <br>  <i>Second.</i>  Arrange the answers to questions in order of decreasing priorities and structure the text and highlight the subtitles.  Briefly and succinctly list the main points. <br><br><h3>  Stylistics </h3><br>  It's great if you know your target audience and know how to speak the same language with it.  If you are not confident in your communication skills, stick to a neutral style.  This is the golden mean. <br><br>  Do not abuse the emoticons, "Flick" and familiar references.  Correctness and tact in communication / treatment is a sign of showing respect for the virtual interlocutor and the client in one person.  Try to replace the terms and professional slang with the words understood and common in everyday life, because your main task when writing texts on the site, as we have already said, is to lead the user to a purchasing decision.  Less "water", more specifics.  Logics.  Arguments of trust (experience, cases, reviews, research). <br><br>  Emotions!  Another powerful tool in the hands of a skilled copywriter, but it can produce a repulsive effect if it sounds false and inappropriate.  Again - not sure, do not use it. <br><br><h3>  Grammar and punctuation errors * </h3><br>  <i>If you have ever used a Word, it is difficult to understand what is taught in institutions.</i>  <i>It is enough to fill in the text, everything that is underlined can be corrected without problems, if it does not help to right-click and choose the option, then put commas somewhere.</i>  <i>In the end, everything is clear? *</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/754/ead/446/754ead4466fb1533e57e2f731a6b19e4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nothing jars more than mistakes.  Nothing can so quickly dislodge the image of a prestigious company as the pages of the site violate the norms of the Russian language.  And if the grammatical Word, indeed, more or less copes (frankly, not always), stylistic and punctuation are trouble. <br><br>  Tip one - proofreading.  If you are not sure about your own literacy, just give it a check.  Not worth the risk of reputation. <br>  <i>* author's punctuation, preserved for clarity.</i> <br><br><h3>  Curve Layout </h3><br>  It can kill the most competent, logical and informative text. <br><br>  The most common mistakes: <br><br><ul><li>  The text is not structured into subsections and lists.  It is extremely rare when the "solid text" is easy to read.  But don't get too carried away!  It is not known what is worse: a dozen or two subheadings / points in the list or the notorious solid text. </li><li>  Mixing styles, fonts, font sizes.  Mixing italics, Bold and underlined text in one explosive mixture.  One sidebar, the other.  The result is porridge.  And not only on the site, but also in the user's head, too. </li><li>  Passion for beautiful backgrounds.  The classic version is black on white - win-win, visually perceived best.  A white font on a gray background or on a colored substrate may seem stylish to you, but remember that all markers are different in taste and color. </li><li>  The font size and the distance between the lines is also very, very important.  Dense rows of text, no matter how slim they are, make the user strain his eyes.  And if the font is also small?  In the text, be sure to leave air - the quality of perception will increase significantly. </li></ul><br><h3>  mobile version </h3><br>  All of the above applies to the display of the site on mobile devices. <br>  And yet - do not be lazy to see how the page of the site looks in the mobile version.  The presence of smartphones in our lives is difficult to overestimate.  Agree, it will be annoying to find out that your layout is floating on mobile, the text does not fit on the screen, the font is too small, the price and the ‚ÄúBasket‚Äù are not visible?  It‚Äôs worse to keep wondering why there are fewer orders than we would like, and not to guess about the possible reasons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2e/664/c4b/d2e664c4b5413b303cf8d31fb5bdf69c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  Most of the errors lie on the surface.  It is enough to carefully look at the texts on your site, re-read them again, putting yourself in the client's place.  And may this article save at least one site from the gloom of texts! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341790/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341790/</a></p>
