A colleague bought as a gift for his son for the new year and in order not to carry home ahead of time, he asked him to take the necessary software for the weekend.  And since I was just going to sit at the weekend at home and finally recover from the flu, I decided to ask him for help.  In addition, netbooks as a class have long interested me, and here the opportunity to borrow and decide whether I have a need for such a device.  Since n310 is a whole class of devices, I‚Äôll immediately say that I got the N310-WAS1, the main difference from which is WiMax. <br>  I apologize in advance for the quality of the photos, I do not have a fotik, so everything was photographed on nokia e66. <br>  Next, a lot of pictures and traffic, respectively. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Packaging.</b> <br>  The device is delivered in a cardboard box, which shows the possible options for the color of the device. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/bwi5fDs4e6.jpg"><br>  In my case, the netbook is dark blue.  Other possible colors are orange (judging by the image on the box with a fair amount of red), blue and black.  When transporting the netbook is wrapped in a plastic bag, fixed in the box with seals.  Nothing special, in short. <br><br>  In addition to the device itself in the box you can find: <br>  Several manuals, warranty card, 2 CD-ROMs (and when will they start delivering flash drives with devices without cd / dvd drives?) And of course the power supply unit. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/82btlpV55Q.jpg"><br><br>  The power supply has a fairly compact size, so take it with you if necessary, there will be no problem. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/hXFrahb61j.jpg">

    <img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/xNPqv1ykgB.jpg"><br><br>  Look at the device itself <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/wj10gcVvSv.jpg"><br>  From above, the netbook looks like a rectangle with rounded edges and a large Samsung inscription on the lid (some even refer to the insignia of this model as being too large, but this is a personal matter for everyone).  The size of the netbook is 282x184.5 mm.  Plastic is used as the case material.  I don‚Äôt know how anyone, but I don‚Äôt like the rounded shapes of this model too much.  I would prefer a classic design without any rounding. <br><br>  Size comparison: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/S9UWO7axe5.jpg"><br><br>  Side view: (thickness 28 mm) <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/18mIm22WfT.jpg"><br>  On this side there are 2 USB connectors, a VGA connector for connecting another monitor (covered with a rubber plug, which can be easily lost) and a connector for connecting the power supply. <br><br>  On the other hand: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/IBbcx33C2l.jpg"><br>  There are: Kensington lock, another USB connector, Lan-connector with a plastic plug (this is attached to the case, so it will not be lost), a ventilation hole, as well as microphone and speaker output. <br><br>  There is nothing interesting in front of the SD / SDHC / MMC card reader <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/PRhqy6MR3u.jpg"><br><br>  Below: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/pSTV5oQT3d.jpg"><br>  A battery, a compartment for RAM, several vents, a licensed sticker Windows XP Home and 4 rubber feet on the edges that help the unit to slide on almost any surface. <br><br>  In the open form: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/7mGwg43V8t.jpg"><br><br>  In comparison with the 23 "monitor: <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091114/K22juYy68r.jpg"><br><br>  The first thing that stops your gaze after opening a netbook is a 10.1 "screen with a resolution of 1024x600. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/XW2HHM58ks.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is covered with protective glass, forming a single surface with the case, there are no sides along the edges. <br>  Viewing angles: horizontal enough, but vertically it could be better.  I will explain.  When you work with text, everything is fine, but you have to watch the video at a strictly defined angle, a deviation from which almost immediately leads to a deterioration in visibility.  Check the behavior of the screen in sunlight is not possible because of the cloudy weather in recent days. <br>  In my opinion, the screen is the main minus of the model.  Ask why?  The protective glass is glossy and very cool glare.  Although maybe it's just that I'm used to matte screens?  Yes, the glossy surface is still very dirty. <br>  Above the screen is a peephole of 1.3 Mpx camera and a microphone hole. <br><br>  Let's look at the keyboard. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/LQ62My36W6.jpg"><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/67TS5n9iet.jpg"><br>  I do not know about you, but at my first glance I had an analogy with Makovskaya.  Apparently this is due to the fact that the keys are spaced a couple of millimeters apart.  I liked the keyboard, the key travel is not too hard and not too soft, pressing is well felt. <br><br>  Under the keyboard are the touchpad and activity indicators. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/6z6uRU7gCQ.jpg"><br>  The touchpad is quite a bit recessed into the case, the button below it is dual.  I didn‚Äôt have any problems with the use, despite the fact that the experience of using touchpads is extremely small. <br>  There is nothing to say about the indicators, they are lit in blue, except for the red indicator of the power supply connection. <br><br>  The device turns on with a small round button in the upper right part of the keyboard, which after pressing starts to be highlighted in blue. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/JH7qLz8O6h.jpg"><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/M3j3JUuIf7.jpg"><br><br>  Loudspeakers are located above the keyboard.  You should not expect anything special from them, but there is enough volume to watch a video in the absence of extraneous noise. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/v6Dx64XrWb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Battery life.</b> <br>  The device is equipped with a 4000 mAh battery, which I managed to discharge 2 times.  For the first time the netbook was connected to the network via wi-fi and pumped out updates of the operating system, when a little more than 2 hours passed I was watching the latest series of House without interrupting this process.  In total, it took about 3 hours, after which 10% of the charge remained.  The second time, the netbook was again connected to the wi-fi network and something was downloading + I was climbing in the browser.  Total got 4 hours + the same balance in 10% charge.  In both cases, the brightness was set to 3 divisions out of 8 possible.  Judging by the reviews of the owners of other netbooks obtained slightly above average. <br><br>  <b>Look under the hood.</b> <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/qYHCaX38mP.jpg"><br>  Like most devices from other manufacturers, the device has an Intel Atom N270 processor with 1 physical core, enabled Hyper-Threading technology and operates at 1.6 GHz. <br>  For web surfing and watching movies this is enough.  When viewing the heaviest video material available (HDTV-rip with a resolution of 1280x720), the CPU fray was at most 90% (h.264 video, aac audio, ffdshow decoder, MPC player), there was no lag.  When viewing dvdrip CPU load 40-60%.  Of the games, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/42688/">World of Goo</a> was tested, of course there were no problems). <br><br>  By default, the device has 1 gigabyte of RAM, which can be increased a maximum of 2 times. <br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/091115/YFzKUS0k9S.jpg"><br><br>  The device is equipped with wireless communication modules Wi-fi, WiMax and Bluetooth.  Wi-fi was used all the time the device was working, perfectly caught both my and some neighboring network (to which I unsuccessfully tried to connect at the beginning, taking it for my =) because my router ignored my desire to turn on wi-fi on it, but I did not look at the indicator).  Supported protocols are a / b / g.  There are no complaints.  WiMax in our "village" at the moment is not and is not expected.  So unfortunately I can‚Äôt say anything, except that the Intel WiMAX Link 5150 is used as the WiMax module. Bluetooth didn‚Äôt check either, and there‚Äôs really no point, there‚Äôs hardly any problem with it.  The stack is used by Broadcom. <br><br>  The hard disk in the SATA device is 160 GB, 5400 rpm., The manufacturer is divided into 2 sections of 71.5 GB (as for me - not very optimal). <br>  Graphics adapter - Intel¬Æ GMA 950, there‚Äôs nothing more to say about it. <br>  The device is also equipped with a Marvell Yukon 10/100 Mbps network controller. <br><br>  <b>Build quality.</b> <br>  On this point, I have no complaints about the device, the netbook feels like something monolithic.  No backlash, nothing dangles. <br><br>  <b>Sound at work.</b> <br>  Actually, the device does not create virtually any noise.  In order to at least hear something, you need to raise your ear almost closely, so that this is no problem. <br><br>  <b>Weight.</b> <br>  Netbook weighs 1.23 kg, which is almost 1 in 1 coincides with the weight of devices from other manufacturers. <br><br>  <b>Price.</b> <br>  According to price.ru at the moment, the price of the device ranges from 14,790 to 15,600 rubles, which is not so cheap.  All the same, there are analogues and cheaper, albeit without WiMAX, but yes he does not need me. <br><br>  <b>What is the result?</b> <br>  I liked the netbook more than not.  Assembly, keyboard, good run time, noiselessness.  In the minuses screen, price, well, the overall design (this is for me personally, for many, it may be the opposite incentive to buy a device). <br><br>  That's all, read to the end thanks for your attention =). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75256/</a></p>
