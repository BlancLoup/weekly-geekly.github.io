  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bitfury: about the team, requirements for candidates and open vacancies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We told BitFury about the company and what it does in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/bitfury/blog/321474/">previous post</a> .  And today Anna Minets, Chief Human Resources Officer ( <a href="http://bitfury.com/">The BitFury Group</a> ) will tell about our team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40e/bb4/22c/40ebb422c3464312a453079251485ba4.jpg" align="left" height="300">  At the beginning of 2017, the company employs 250 people, and 150 of them joined us during the last year.  We continue to grow and invest in highly qualified personnel.  On average, every day, somewhere in the world, a new employee comes to the BitFury team. <br><br><h2>  The composition of the development team </h2><br>  About 20% of our team are programmers.  Soon this percentage will increase: now we are paying more and more attention to software products, Data Analytics platform, Digital Assets PaaS, Lightning Network (p2p), therefore we are extremely interested in talented developers.  The average age of soft-developers is 28-30 years old, in hardware slightly older employees are closer to 40. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Candidate Requirements </h2><br>  We are engaged in the blockchain technology and, of course, we will evaluate if the candidate is already in the subject.  But this is still a new area, in which very few specialists have ‚Äúgrown‚Äù so far, and there will not be a refusal to a person just because he knows little about the blockchain.  It is good if the candidate understands related subjects: cryptography, the specifics of data warehousing, system programming, and theory of algorithms.

      It so happened that most of our developers are graduates of the Physical-Engineering Institute (MIPT), of course, they quickly found a common language and became a cool team.  We monitor the market and successfully compete for the most gifted children from other strong universities: Moscow State University, Baumanka, Taras Shevchenko University and others. <br><br>  We are always happy olympiadnikam.  The figures speak for themselves: 80% of our technical specialists are winners of olympiads, 40% are candidates of science.  Our team has a world champion in mathematics - an ambitious company we have gathered. <br><br>  By the way, about ambitions.  If they are healthy, we really appreciate them, as well as non-standard thinking.  For example, one of the candidates drew the close attention of the HR department by comparing him with ... a discriminating bride from the well-known optimization <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5">task of Martin Gardner</a> , for which at one time defended his doctoral dissertations.  And another managed to stand out from the crowd at a student job fair with just one comment.  He asked: "Do you have a really serious selection?", And, having received an affirmative answer, he asked with dignity: "Then please contact me, please."  It was clear that this is not an empty self-confidence, but a businesslike approach.  We noticed him - and did not lose.  A little advice to applicants: if you have imagination and purposefulness, do not be afraid to show them at our interviews. <br><br><h2>  About the work schedule and the warden's stick </h2><br>  As for the schedule, no one will calculate the minutes spent in the workplace.  No formalism.  In creative work it is important to grope your inner ideal rhythm - we understand this.  But usually guys come to us, over whom you do not need to stand with a stick.  In school, they were few five, and, having won the national Olympiad, they hurried to the world.  When ambitious people gather in one place and they are given an interesting task - they do not need to be customized, on the contrary - you will not stop! <br><br>  With remote employees, the situation is similar, there is a task, there are tasks responsible for tasks, there is a deadline for tasks.  Day or night, in the office or on the beach of Bali, it doesn‚Äôt matter to us where you do your work, the main thing is to have a great result and on time. <br><br><h2>  Working conditions and guarantees </h2><br>  The world of IT companies over the past few years has taught candidates that the new office is always cookies, buns, table tennis and much more, depending on the company's ingenuity. <br><br>  How does this work with us?  Comfortable spacious offices and work spaces for every taste.  Often you interact with the team?  At your service are open space with panoramic windows.  Want some privacy?  There are spacious comfortable rooms.  You can upgrade your skills, attend trainings in management and public speaking, learn English with a native speaker.  Employees in the office deliver excellent meals.  And we have the most complete medical insurance. <br><br>  Without going into details, I‚Äôll say that travel agents, lawyers, HR, the financial department and the BitFury team assistants do everything to ensure that our children do not need to think about anything other than their immediate tasks. <br><br><h2>  Test items </h2><br>  Tasks are prepared and tested by our developers.  They are not very voluminous and will not take much time.  Most often, we give the candidate a task on a topic that is familiar to him, but not as well as his immediate sphere of interest, to understand how he orients himself in related areas, whether it is easy to ‚Äúgrasp‚Äù a new one.  We do not specifically formulate the tasks deployed to see how the applicant acts with a lack of information - he asks additional questions or tries to think of himself.  Both options are good in their own way and allow you to learn more about a person‚Äôs way of thinking. <br><br>  The stack of technologies that we use now: Rust and Java for one project;  Go, btcd, Protobuf, Noise protocol for the second;  Docker, Docker compose, Kubernetes, Javascript, Node JS, Angular 2, React - for the third.  But these are not all products, therefore it is still difficult to clearly identify the main stack. <br><br>  Here is an example of one of the test tasks for a fullstack developer: write a graphic blockchain-explorer, simple in design and based on btcd, with the ability to display information about any selected transaction, address and block in a readable format. <br><br>  Or - the implementation of the Merkle Tree or Merkle Patricia Tree data structures as a separate library. <br><br><h2>  Relocation </h2><br>  We are an international company with offices around the world, so the relocation question is one of the three most asked questions.  We have official permission for it, but for a long-term move we need very serious reasons - the employee‚Äôs personal desire must coincide with the needs of the business. <br><br>  However, we have a very high internal mobility, and business trips around the world are an important part of working at BitFury.  The company's specialists attend conferences and presentations in different countries: just passed Bitcoin Expo 2017 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Recently our guys took part in the Ernst &amp; Young Blockchain Startup Challenge (London) and won the Best Pitch there, after which a promising joint project began. <br><br><h2>  Open vacancies </h2><br>  We have a vacancy that is constantly open, no matter how many people we take on it: we always need intelligent Rust developers.  We are also looking for a strong Java Lead with experience in creating enterprise solutions. <br><br>  If you are interested in the world of the blockchain and like non-trivial tasks, check out the full <a href="https://hh.ru/employer/1865709">list of our vacancies</a> . <br><br>  Maybe our team lacks just you?  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325254/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325254/</a></p>
