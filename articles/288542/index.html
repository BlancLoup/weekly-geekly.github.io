This week, LJ-public still found a topic for discussion.  The woman died a child, he was hit by a car, after five hours she <a href="http://mq.livejournal.com/184299.html">wrote about it</a> in her LiveJournal.  This is where star wars begin.  <a href="http://caralh0-v0ad0r.livejournal.com/159885.html">At first,</a> those who think that it‚Äôs at least strange to write about such a blog post <a href="http://caralh0-v0ad0r.livejournal.com/159885.html">wake up</a> .  Naturally, <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/825866.html">immediately there are</a> no less nervous opponents who claim that this is the most natural reaction.  And, finally, <a href="http://digitaldog.livejournal.com/143421.html">most of all those</a> who are tired of endless disputes about "who is smarter and who peed in the hole".  Perhaps the closest position is closer to me.  Although I don‚Äôt agree with the following quote: ‚Äú <em>Unfortunately, a lively magazine has died. Only a handful of thousands of people who link to each other in order to increase their blog rating (which clearly resembles a school measure in the locker room) and a handful of local friends discussing topics that are highly socialized</em> .

      <strong>Exposing the week</strong> <br><br>  And we have two of them!  <a href="http://schegloff.livejournal.com/87057.html">First, it gets a</a> rating of blogs "Yandex" from outraged readers.  It turns out that on weekends, the rating is not updated at all!  The assumption that blogs in places in the "Yandex" puts some clerk who just goes away for the weekend, wonderful, but incredible.  In the comments to the recording, they have already suggested that these are tricks of either Cthulhu, or Medved, or Yak-Tsup-Tsopa.  Big Brother is watching us! <br><br>  <a href="http://r-l.livejournal.com/2071959.html">Then he got</a> livejournal.com and again the restless "SUP".  It turns out that now computers of Russian-speaking users of LiveJournal, when downloading any LiveJournal page, ‚Äúclimb‚Äù to Russia, connecting to the Russian server in both directions.  And it does not matter that you are in the United States a few kilometers from the LiveJournal server, anyway, the first thing you will do is connect with the Russian server.  Here are the conclusions the author notes: ‚ÄúDear comrades, it seems to me that the level of service of a particular user has deteriorated sharply in the complete absence of him, the user, the desire and the slightest hint of information about the deterioration in the quality of service.‚Äù <br><br>  <strong>Elves of the week</strong> <br><br>  When I was little, I liked to present myself as the Pope.  My friend, when he becomes inadequate, presents himself as a little snake.  Thanks to Professor Tolkien, many people on this planet consider themselves to be elves.  Which, of course, is much better than the fascists.  And now you, my dear readers, imagine that there is a "Dating Club" for elves.  What do you think, what text ads you read there?  The funny thing is that such a club actually exists, and the Lieutenant, especially for us, <a href="http://leit.livejournal.com/330801.html">chose the most colorful ads</a> .  Naturally, the author does not hesitate to comment on all this disgrace, here‚Äôs a quote: ‚ÄúI <em>recognized myself as an elf almost at the same time as the Age of Aquarius began, that is, recently.‚Äù genetic memory. I realized that I myself was not local, but I wanted to go home to Valinor only by taxi. Help, hto what citizens can. "This Era, wounded very much, he was my dad and uncle!")</em> ". <br><br>  The theme continues with <a href="http://siltindir.livejournal.com/21625.html">Elven Perception of the World</a> .  May the elves forgive me, but I am absolutely not in the subject.  The text is large, I read it carefully, but I did not understand whether it was banter or the harsh truth of elven life.  I would better quote a passage about the professions: " <em>For elves there are - implicitly -" suitable "and" unsuitable "professions (" unsuitable ", of course, not in the sense that they are forbidden to engage in, but the fact that a real elf will become engaged only in ‚ÄúAt gunpoint‚Äù, for example, the profession of an accountant), similarly, there are ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù and ‚Äúunsuitable‚Äù social circles, talking points, etc., say, most elves do not like discussing money, business and commerce, but also does not like to communicate with people involved in these areas (in</em>  <em>ie the "inappropriate" profession and the theme unites obsession today and momentary things).</em> " <br><br>  <strong>Beauty of the week</strong> <br><br>  I think many readers of the favorite "KV" use home networks.  Naturally, the wires at the entrances are sometimes laid in the most unexpected places.  But have you ever heard from your neighbors that these wires make them "ugly"?  And even more so that this was the main argument for the conflict with network users?  But Fede was " <a href="http://alekcei.livejournal.com/62858.html">lucky</a> " with such a wonderful neighbor.  I also sometimes think that our people themselves invent reasons for frustration.  Here's what Fedya writes about this: ‚Äú <em>These wires are not even in her apartment, but on the staircase! But still, it is ugly. And they tell me this not in some old-fashioned house, but in the usual sovdepovskaya nine-story building built in 1975. To say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything. I wanted to ask, what if I‚Äôm going to the top of my toilet with hot and cold water to her top, which are also very ugly, will I take and cut off?</em> ‚Äù. <br><br>  It is better not to watch the next record for people with increased love for computers.  <a href="http://aksid.livejournal.com/175022.html">Visually in the pictures it is shown</a> how to make French fries with the help of a computer system unit and twelve bottles of sunflower oil.  Gothic, glamorous, vintage. <br><br>  <strong>"What did not fit into previous chapters" of the week</strong> <br><br>  And once again I draw your attention to the wonderful blog It It, in which we are told in detail about a pleasant pastime in the company with WordPress.  This time the <a href="http://log-it.ru/2006/11/28/20">note is devoted to OpenID</a> or an alternative method of user definition.  Naturally, the blog itself is very interesting and is not limited to WordPress.  There you will find original articles on various CMS and blogs in general. <br><br>  Probably many of you read the Bible.  And the gospel?  Remember, what begins the gospel of Matthew?  Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers, and so on.  Another anecdote was, they say, "and then something broke there, and only women began to give birth."  In general, Comrade Shestakov creatively reworked these texts and received a <a href="http://eu-shestakov.livejournal.com/90422.html">wonderful theater of the absurd</a> . <br><br>  <strong>Khalik Alekseevsky</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006490601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 49, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288542/</a></p>
