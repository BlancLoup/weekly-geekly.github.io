  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cloud housing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Being engaged in the automation of production, developers are faced with many problems.  But two of them worry everyone: <br>  1. Data transfer from the site. <br>  2. Organization of the database. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the heating systems, the first problem was decided by the purchase of a radio channel and the acquisition of radio modems. <br>  The grid operates on a non-licensed frequency, collecting data in a ‚Äúhive‚Äù and then using a GPRS modem. <br>  Vodokanal I do not know what uses. <br>  The elevator has laid the cable seems optical. <br>  The LCD for data transmission from metering stations uses cellular modems, each time searching for money to pay for traffic. <br><br>  This example shows how many methods are used to transfer data.  Everyone does what he is in.  This happens in any city. <br><br>  And all this in order to transfer the parameters of the systems of one house to different organizations! <br>  It always surprises me.

      As an ordinary tenant, it is striking that it is not possible to see data on the quality of services provided by various providers. <br>  And this is at a time when our spaceships are plying the expanses of the universe!  Although, not only the universe ... <br><br>  Each provider creates its own database, takes care of servers, maintains information and solves many other problems.  A well-designed and organized server is ultimately not a cheap solution with expensive maintenance, and these sums ultimately fall into the accounts of consumers. <br><br>  But in each city all services are the same, everyone needs the same parameters in each group of suppliers. <br>  That is, the database structure is repeated everywhere. <br><br>  Now the essence of the sentence "Cloud utilities." <br>  Everyone says that utilities are a black hole, many are trying to reform it and get different dividends from it, but in the end - everything is not getting better.  Only new offices with names that are difficult to pronounce appear, where it is impossible to recognize even elementary things. <br><br>  Solution option.  First you need to facilitate the transfer of data from objects and provide a server for storing information: <br>  1. Statewide database servers are created.  They need a little quantity, it is important to organize reservations. <br>  2. A communication channel is organized from each house.  In reality, it already exists.  It is necessary to purchase it or an agreement of the state on its allocation by telephone companies or Internet service providers for data transmission.  Sometimes you even want to use your home line to ‚Äútry‚Äù, but this is written in the contracts !!! <br>  3. In each house, a controller is installed with a modem that receives information from multiple devices of all service providers located in the house and sends data to a database server via a dedicated line.  It is easy to organize data transmission directly in the house from devices to the controller with the modem by wire or radio channel.  The control systems in the houses are autonomous, they use data transmission about the work of the object to the center, although two-way communication is also possible. <br><br>  Next is a matter of technology. <br>  Having a common base, suppliers receive all the necessary information in real time via the Internet.  At the same time, they will be interested in the quality of their work, and tenants will always be able to control this easily.  Any disputes and problems regarding the services provided are easily resolved. <br><br>  The task is feasible in a relatively short time and fully by the strength of Russian specialists. <br>  The data collection and processing system becomes transparent, cheap, efficient and easily scalable. <br>  Also solved the problem of payback.  This can be done as a targeted state project, and setting a small monthly fee for organizations.  And it will be less than those funds that businesses spend on the transfer and storage of data. <br><br>  The implementation of the ‚ÄúCloud Housing and Communal Services‚Äù does not require the will of God, a rather simple decision of the leadership - the ministries, the country?  Underline whatever applicable. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  Written a couple of years ago - the project <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIySysJrAivwcN6oCUJ9aukMgRC4JWNBl0u7A7Jt2ek/edit">PIRS</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136914/</a></p>
