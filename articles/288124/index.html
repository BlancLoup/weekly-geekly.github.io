  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network on the "Poster": be friends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To write reviews and rate everything that I have had a chance to try in life is a silly idea, if it is impossible to use this experience later.  Therefore, about a month ago we launched completely reworked personal pages ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/massmedia/30291.html">see the announcement with pictures on Habr√©</a> ) - from which it is much easier to understand what you did in your years for hip-hop (that looked, what you like, what you don‚Äôt like).  There is no talk about everything yet, but to leave comments and ratings on the main sources of entertainment (movies, places and works), and then to show and boast to others, ‚ÄúPoster‚Äù gives today. <br><br>  So that these associates do not have to throw a link to each of their reviews, and ask friends ‚Äúhave you been to <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/concert/509606/">The Chemical Brothers</a> concert?‚Äù, Today we added one little thing - the <strong>ability to add your favorite users as friends</strong> .  Yes, yes, again a social network.  Now real, with friends, etc. <br><br>  However, all this is pretty frivolous.  As Daniil Dugayev writes in the Afisha blog: ‚Äú <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/blogcomments/609/page1/">Friendship does not commit to anything: it simply means that you care about the opinion of this person</a> .‚Äù  And the meaning of "friendship" here is far from having as many people as possible in your collection.  These are those whose tastes are important to you, and with whom you plan to spend time.  About this I will say a couple of words.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  What do friends give </h2><br>  First you need to login.  Either with the login of the Poster, or <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/blogcomments/573/page1/">through OpenID</a> - it does not matter.  After adding a person to your friend list, you will see his fresh impressions right on the main page of the site.  Consider this a "shortlist of friendliness." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/aa5/a12/dfd/aa5a12dfd2d4572fcb867e7888f801b8.png" width="498" height="274"><br><br>  Almost it is also on <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/personalpage/">your personal page</a> .  In thematic sections appear, oddly enough, only reviews on this topic.  Estimates for shops or restaurants you, going into the movie heading, you will not see. <br><br>  Friendland is now a complete source of information about where your friends were and what they watched.  And, most importantly, they think about all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ad9/445/a96/ad9445a964959e35e360c685f892daf2.png" width="497" height="178"><br><br>  We tried to make a single stream of consciousness convenient by adding two small filters ("only reviews" and choosing a topic), so if you are only interested in ratings with reviews, or only reviews on films, to find that review of " <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/movie/172851/">Eternal Sunshine of Passion</a> " or ‚Äú <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/movie/178614/">Strong Bruce Willis 4.0</a> ‚Äù, which you wanted to quote to your friend in ICQ - you have such an opportunity. <br><br><h2>  Impressions for show </h2><br><br>  A common place in the criticism of social networking services has become their uselessness.  After a crowd of people of varying degrees of closeness is crammed into one or another online service, the simple question ‚ÄúSuper, and what's next?‚Äù Arises. You don't have to look for a job through LinkedIn or MyCircle very often.  Sitting around the clock on VKontakte or Odnoklassniki to a person whose work day is scheduled is rather inconvenient and, frankly, useless.  That is why we tried to get away from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"a universal tool that can do everything."  Instead, it turned out only a means to share opinions and choose something new.  Find interesting things and think about how to manage your free time. <br><br>  Once it turned out to be a discovery for me that people use thematic sites as an ‚Äúexternal repository‚Äù for their blogs.  Common things and lytdybr are written in lj or on a lyre, recipes are hung up in culinary forums, and a photo about knitting is on a site about needlework.  Decorated thoughts about movies and concerts are sent to the site Posters.  Why ‚Äústorage‚Äù?  Because they write there, and put for review links here, in their journal or on their home page.  And discuss here, with comments and examples. <br><br>  By adding ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and social network functions, we help all these excellent users not only to tell about themselves, but also to read about what their friends are watching - so it may not be long enough to write a review on a blog or on a poster, but to put one star on the film "The <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/movie/181110/">irony of fate strikes back</a> " they always have time. <br><br>  These are not faceless friend lists.  Opinions of friends easily turn into conversations or joint cultural campaigns.  And sometimes they just remind you that you need to meet more often. <br><br><h2>  What now </h2><br><br>  Go to <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/">the Poster site</a> , register or revive your old account, and look for friends.  Or send them an invitation letter.  A simple, human email, without templates and robots.  It is not difficult.  And then give marks to what you liked (and what you didn‚Äôt like!). <br><br>  <strong>Bonus track:</strong> in addition to the super-important functions of the social network, we are in the closed mode testing <a href="http://urbansheep.livejournal.com/1662288.html">the recommendation system</a> .  Since the systems of recommendations today do not surprise anyone, I can only say that judging by what the system advises me, the algorithms of our mathematicians do not just work, but they do it <em>well</em> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288124/</a></p>
