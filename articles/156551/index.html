  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro - Full eight on the tablet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, at IFA, Samsung showed new devices on Windows 8 at the exhibition: a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/150631/">phone, a tablet, two ‚Äúfusions‚Äù and a candy bar</a> .  One of these sensory hybrids was the ATIV Smart PC Pro, a tablet with ultrabook characteristics.  Despite the unique combination of form factor, capabilities and characteristics, this particular device turned out to be one of the most interesting not only in terms of positioning, but also technologically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/040/a0e/b44/040a0eb44cb0416491e9cdb706a7685f.jpg"><br><br>  Well, right after IFA, the first samples (in this case, pre-production ones) came to the Russian office of Samsung, which can be used to draw conclusions about performance, general level of filling and autonomy, as well as twist, test and torment devices under Microsoft's new OS.  In an 11.6-inch baby, a really serious stuffing was hidden, so it would be a crime not to share first impressions of the device with a similar set of characteristics.

      For unknown reasons, the topic has long lay in the drafts, so that the "wow" is not very "wow", but the material is relevant, and the characteristics are encouraging, for this reason, all those who want to get acquainted with them - please under the cat.  ;) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Alarm, on the photos is an injected sample, the body will change a bit (for the better), but the performance characteristics have already been approved and the actual values ‚Äã‚Äãare given in the article.</i> <br><br>  <b>Iron:</b> <br>  In the sample presented, there was the latest generation Core i5: the i5-3317U, with slightly reduced frequencies relative to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù models.  The performance of this solution for such a "pill" should be enough with his head.  IvyBridge is a great and energy efficient architecture that delivers excellent results in mobile devices.  The amount of RAM - 4 gigabytes.  Perhaps this will surprise few people on the PC, and almost all ultrabooks come with 4 GB of memory, but for the tablet, again, the figure is more than decent. <br><br>  Intel HD 4000 is responsible for the graphics: do not play ‚ÄúBattlefield‚Äù (in fact, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/samsung/blog/156551/">play</a> , the link leads to comments), but with the acceleration of HD video and work in the same Photoshop or SketchUp there will be no problems.  In general, in terms of performance, you can safely transfer the entire experience of using any ultrabook - the same features of the filling and similar conditions of use will give similar impressions of work. <br><br>  <b>Screen:</b> <br>  Screen - 11.6 inches, Full HD, PLS-matrix, brightness up to 400 nits (this is enough for the picture to be seen on the street), protective glass.  The viewing angles are excellent, the color reproduction is decent, and the Windows 8 capabilities of interface scaling are noticeably superior to those of the ‚Äúseven‚Äù: the font remains normal in all applications, unreadable small pages or margins and cropped buttons were not noticed, despite the relatively high resolution for such a diagonal . <br><br>  Even with the similarity of the ATIV Smart PC Pro test sample with existing tablets (form factor, autonomy indicators), comparing this device with devices on the ARM architecture is not entirely correct, both in terms of its performance and in terms of usage goals. It is difficult to avoid such comparisons, because users will still be comparing new ‚Äúhybrids‚Äù on Windows 8 with existing products based on Android and iOS, and the overlapping user cases and the form factor will only add fuel to the fire. <br><br>  However, if you recall the existing Android and iOS devices in terms of infrastructure and software, then in the case of the ATIV Smart PC Pro everything is much more fun than the failed competitors in the face of the PlayBook and the WebOS device from HP: Windows 8 devices are available and desktop software, to which everyone is accustomed, and the full set of those programs, the capabilities of which have not yet had time to fully transfer to touch devices. <br><br>  Do not forget the Windows 8 METRO-applications for touch mode, which will appear immediately after the official release of this OS in late October.  <i>(Amendment, the axis is already out, the other day, waiting for applications).</i>  Therefore, Smart PC is a competitor primarily for ultra-compact laptops and ultrabooks: absolutely the same performance and absolutely the same features with less weight, smaller sizes and greater usability on the road;  he thinks that he doesn‚Äôt have to compete with media cards on Android and iOS, according to Samsung. <br><br>  <b>Ports and peripherals:</b> <br>  The remaining ‚Äúzhelepyachnaya‚Äù part, which we did not consider, is closer to ARM tablets than to ultrabooks: the SSD disk is expanded by microSD memory cards, later on there will be models with a 3G module.  And the peephole of the camera nestled on the back panel (+ webcam in front) and just one button (Win, checkbox, start ‚Äî as you like) only add to the similarities with already existing solutions.  A nice bonus is the direct USB 3.0 host under the stub: down with the adapter for connecting external modems, drives and other peripherals!  Moreover, there will be no driver problems here: all USB-hardware that runs on a regular laptop will work in the same way on a Smart PC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d1/f96/640/0d1f966403e972b2471e1886fc41a78d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Dock and keyboard:</b> <br>  Smart PC Pro comes with a docking keyboard.  In this model, it performs its immediate task - it acts as a stable basis for comfortable work with additional ports and a hardware keyboard.  The tablet is connected via a new connector, which is almost impossible to break or damage - the needle spring-loaded contacts (just like the tabs on the processor socket, but not so delicate) and reliable latches are an excellent application for reliability and durability of the design (as they say in the company, the classic multi-pin connectors - such, in particular, were used in the predecessor of the Smart PC, Samsung 700T1A Slate PC under Windows 7 - poorly related to lateral loads, and such loads in the Smart PC occur every time you open or close  istognutoy keyboard). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04f/e9b/e4f/04fe9be4f205646b0a544b754205f72d.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom there are only 2 USB ports and a set of buttons with a touchpad.  Not so much, but the modest bonuses provided by the ‚Äúdock‚Äù are compensated by its indestructibility.  The ‚Äúholder‚Äù of the tablet is very tight, keeps the exposed angle perfectly and does not collapse until you apply effort to it.  The keyboard is moderately heavy, at normal working angles the screen does not outweigh it, despite the fact that all the stuffing is in it.  The built-in extra battery in the keyboard: the developers explain this by saying that if you constantly have to carry the keyboard with you, then it is easier to buy a regular ultrabook, which at the same cost, weight and thickness will have a large screen;  The advantages of the Smart PC are revealed when you carry with you only the tablet part, which is smaller and lighter than any ultrabook - and the keyboard acts as a docking station on the office desk.  By the way, as a separate accessory, Samsung plans to release a more classic-looking docking station, compact and without a keyboard - for those who prefer to use separate large keyboards.  The native keyboard, however, is also not so small: the layout and size of the keys correspond to 13-inch ultrabooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec8/542/ff2/ec8542ff2b75ce621c606f8633e238fc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Wacom pen input:</b> <br>  Well, lastly there was, perhaps, the most pleasant part - pen input.  If earlier the stylus in such devices and communicators was a necessity (resistive screen, low-finger interface input), now it is no longer a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù, but a flexible and powerful tool.  Drawing, handwriting, comments on documents, notes and similar actions are much more convenient to perform not just with your finger and keyboard, but with an electronic pen.  Well, Japanese engineers from Wacom, not the first year beating on the fronts of digital ink integration, provided Samsung with their technology and made sure that the work with the stylus was really convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/51b/ea6/e62/51bea6e628908a3c088535b1bf1e6b8c.jpg"><br><br>  No batteries, On Hover interaction with the interface, a projection point-sight at a potential touch point, pressure sensitivity - in general, a complete set of features from their graphic tablets.  In addition, the Smart PC turns off the usual capacitive touchscreen, if it ‚Äúsees‚Äù the pen - that is, you can safely take notes, comfortably resting your palm on the screen, and not be afraid that the cursor is going crazy.  Perhaps, this is not Intuos or Cintique, but the price is completely different (especially if you look at the prices of Sintics and remember that in the ATIV Smart PC Pro there is not only a pen and a screen).  Well, if you saw the pen on Note / Note 2, then you should have a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow convenient this ‚Äústylus‚Äù complements the touchscreen functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/378/522/92d/37852292d9138542e21ed75d10a6bb1b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Thinking out loud:</b> <br>  So, what do we have in the dry residue?  Ultrabook power, impressive autonomy (according to the passport - up to 8 hours, in reality, when playing a movie or sitting on the Internet via WiFi, you can safely count five hours without an outlet, with reduced backlight - more), mobility, compactness + possibility not only " to consume "content, but also to create it, hassle-free support for any Windows applications and any USB peripherals running under Windows is an excellent set of qualities. <br><br>  In the near future, wait for a full review, with performance tests, pen input, autonomy and all that you need to know to successfully choose a gift for the New Year!  ;) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Actual appearance is here: <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/ativ/ativ_pc_pro.html">www.samsung.com/global/ativ/ativ_pc_pro.html</a> , for the link we say thanks <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/pizguj/" class="user_link">pizguj</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156551/</a></p>
