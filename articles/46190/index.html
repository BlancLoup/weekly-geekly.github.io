  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Photos of paper "AMERO" which will replace the dollar with the spring!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Odious <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/items/tag/%25D5%25E5%25EB%2B%25D2%25E5%25F0%25ED%25E5%25F0/">Hel Turner</a> recently released information about the <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/item/499/">General Mobilization in the US</a> <br>  Yesterday he published a post in which he presented Amero Paper Money which is allegedly already being printed and will soon become the currency of the Alliance Canada - Mexico - USA. <br><br>  To the chagrin of the government, I have new AMERO paper money in my hands!  This is what the new Amero 50 note looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/382/48e/3c9/38248e3c9e3951277f3f2f982d84a06d.jpg" alt="Amero"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In September 2007, a year ago, I told the story of AMERO coins secretly minted at the Denver Mint.  After ‚Äúleaking‚Äù this story, the Denver Mint announced on its website that they close public excursions around the Mint for 10 to 14 days to make reconstructions in the tourist area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Mint.

      <br>
      However, my sources at the Mint reported that the Ministry of Finance (Treasury) leadership was offended that someone had missed (‚Äúleaked‚Äù) AMERO currency information to me, and they closed the Denver Mint to the public to secretly move AMERO from Mint yard to prevent further leakage. <br><br>  In October 2008  I received information that the US government sent 800 billion AMERO to the China Development Bank.  I wrote a story about it and got a real AMERO coin from that lot! <br><br>  I posted a video about the coin on YouTube, showing the coin and explaining that this is a planned action, originating at the highest levels of our government with the goal of deliberately extracting the dollar from circulation as a currency.  More than 600,000 people all over the world have watched this video. <br><br>  Two days ago, YouTube / Google notified me that my video was deleted and my account was permanently closed at the request of the United States Treasury.  The Treasury Department told YouTube / Google that my video ‚Äúdestabilized the US dollar, and was thus a threat to national security.‚Äù <br><br>  Only two days later, and my sources once again provided me with information, this time confirming that the government is secretly printing new AMERO paper money. <br><br>  Not only do I have a 50 AMERO banknote, look also at the 20 and 100 AMERO banknotes! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c23/5bd/059/c235bd0596fca17c26660cf1030c4f8c.jpg" alt="amero"><br><br>  Not a single citizen of the United States was officially asked if they wanted a new currency.  No member of Congress voted in favor of the new currency.  However, the new currency has already been printed and distributed worldwide.  This is done without the consent of the Americans, without a vote of Congress, and was deliberately hidden by every official who was involved in this matter. <br><br>  I think that here in America there are people who will not be loyal to those who intentionally lie to us. <br><br>  I believe that my American brethren must decide and "discipline" government officials who committed this outrage without our consent. <br><br>  Tough actions are needed to physically discipline an adult who is ‚Äúmisbehaving‚Äù, and I am ready to do it right now. <br><br>  There are officials in this country who need to be kicked in the ass, and I look forward to a chance to do this.  If they think that their insignificant, small Federal Reserve System can do something about it, then they are deeply mistaken. <br><br>  PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT THIS IMMEDIATELY.  If they are already printing paper money, the collapse of the US dollar may be just around the corner.  We all risk losing the savings of our entire life with this ‚Äúscam‚Äù currency. <br><br>  More articles Turner The <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/item/510/">US Federal Reserve is moving in the direction of "selective insolvency" - introducing their own loans!</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/item/504/">Financial Tsunami is unstoppable.</a>  <a href="http://magov.net/blogs/item/504/">The Great Depression is Coming Soon 2</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46190/</a></p>
