Buying in Western stores is attractive for two reasons: often it allows you to save money, and sometimes it is generally the only way to buy goods.  In order to purchase the right product, there is no need to devote days and weeks to independently combing the sites of these stores, choosing the best option and suffering due to the fact that not all stores want to accept cards from Russian banks and even more so deliver their goods to Russia.  You can make a purchase in a few minutes and in just two stages - first select a product and store using specialized selection services (similar to the usual Price.ru and Yandex.Market Russians) and then, without thinking about payment and delivery, place an order using the <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">EbayToday</a> service <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">. ru</a> , which works not only with online auction eBay, but almost with any American and British online stores. <br><br>  However, the first and main point is the choice of the store and, possibly, the product itself - sometimes we need not a specific model, but simply ‚Äúa color laser printer working via Wi-Fi‚Äù.  And here will come to the aid of several services, which will be discussed in detail below.  We missed all the services through two tests - through the purchase of a Casio men's quartz watch from an unspecified model and Google Nexus One smartphone.  In the first case, the ability of the service to ensure high-quality navigation through product lines was tested, in the second case - to a good processing of a specific request. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://froogle.com/">Froogle.com</a> , better known as Google Product Search </h3>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      It copes well with the second type of search: it can find a specific product.  When trying to find a watch, I didn‚Äôt suggest choosing a style, type (mechanical / electronic), product line. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/google_casio_1.png" alt="Froogle"><br><br>  Google found the Nexus One service in a fairly large number of stores - but could not combine them into a single ‚Äúgrocery card‚Äù - as a result, the comparison had to be made directly from the search results - this is not very convenient. <br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/google_nexus_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  However, for some products, Google still builds ration cards - and then they contain not only pricing information, but also reviews and ratings of sellers aggregated from different sites.  This rating is based on user voting. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/google_printer_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Advantages: it</b> finds a lot of options, has a lot of sorting options, offers a good choice, aggregates reviews from a large number of sites, demonstrates a distinct rating of stores, is well suited for selecting a seller. <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages: it</b> badly ‚Äústicks together‚Äù grocery cards, it has a clearly underdeveloped system of categories, it is poorly suited for selecting goods. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.thefind.com/">TheFind</a> </h3><br><br>  TheFind also coped quite well in order to find Google Nexus One - though here, like Google, I had to use a trick and sort the output by price after the request: there are no product categories, so the phone is in the same issue with chargers and cases.  Casio watches in TheFind were search immeasurably nicer than Google: in the menu to the right of the search results, you can set a lot of parameters that facilitate the selection. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/thefind_casio_1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/thefind_nexus_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There are no grocery cards, no less than a rating of shops in TheFind.  To find reviews, you need to use a separate search for a review that directs the interested reader to external sites. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/thefind_nexus_2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Advantages: a</b> very large number of parameters when choosing a product, user-friendly interface. <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> no grocery cards and store ratings, inconvenient to read reviews. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.shopzilla.com/">Shopzilla</a> </h3><br><br>  Shopzilla could not find the Google Nexus One.  That is, he knew about the goods, of course, but he could not find the stores that they sell. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/shopzilla_nexus_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But with the search for hours Shopzilla coped perfectly.  She offered a convenient set of parameters and a large selection of stores.  Grocery cards are also rich: there is a store rating and description of goods.  True, there is no place for reviews. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/shopzilla_casio_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> many options when choosing a product, a simple interface, grocery cards with rated stores, a good selection of sellers <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages: the</b> search is clearly imperfect.  Shopzilla knows about Nexus One, and about Amazon, Nexus One is being sold on Amazon, but Shopzilla did not find it. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://pricegrabber.com/">Pricegrabber</a> </h3><br><br>  Nexus One Pricegrabber did not find at all. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/pg_nexus_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But he coped well with the task of finding watches: he offered a lot of parameters and good grocery cards.  In addition, Pricegrabber has a full-time feature for comparing various products. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/pg_casio_1.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/pg_casio_2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> good grocery cards and the ability to compare different products.  Rich selection of categories. <br><br>  <b>Shortcomings:</b> obviously weak search base. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://shopping.com/">Shopping.com</a> </h3><br><br>  Like Google, Shopping.com found the Nexus One, but was unable to create its grocery card. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/sh_nexus_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With the clock Shopping.com managed no worse and no better than others.  Offered a lot of options for selection and good grocery cards. <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/sh_casio_1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Shopping.com, unlike other sites, is primarily focused on searching UK stores. <br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> high-quality cards and convenient division of goods into categories <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages: it</b> does not always glue the goods into cards, in order to select the Nexus One from the accessories I had to use price filtering <br><br><h3>  Afterword </h3><br>  This concludes our review of product selection and search services.  Everyone is free to choose the instrument with which he will determine what to buy.  Once the choice is made, you can not worry and transfer the process of buying and delivering professionals. <br><br>  You just need to register on <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">EbayToday.ru</a> - it will take no more than a minute.  Then in the ‚ÄúBuy online store‚Äù section specify the page address of the selected product and fill in several required fields - price, name and quantity, and several additional ones if desired (for example, you can ask our employees to remove the original packaging when sending from the USA - this will reduce the cost of sending ). <br><br><img src="http://ebaytoday.ru/static/ebay/images/nexus/et02.png" alt="Ebaytoday"><br><br>  Finally, you have to pay for your purchase in any convenient way - from Webmoney to cash - and quietly wait for delivery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97875/</a></p>
