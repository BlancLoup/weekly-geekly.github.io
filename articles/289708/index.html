ASO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The sunset sun peered at the monitor with curiosity, glare, interfered.  Gulya Analytikova and I stumbled onto the screen with our noses, trying to make out a splash on the application's installation graph. <br>  - Where, you say, did your advertising go out?  - Gulya moved slightly to the left, blocking the sun. <br>  - Here‚Ä¶ <br>  - I do not see‚Ä¶ <br>  ‚ÄúSo I don't see ...‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/811/a5f/aa1/811a5faa1e3f4adfa24faf91236ca291.png"><br><br>  We moved closer together and hit our heads. <br>  - Pancake!  - I rubbed my temple.  - So and concussion short to get. <br>  - It would be something to shake ... - growled Gulya. <br>  - What? <br>  - Optimization of the page in stores, I say, when will you do?  Your users are obviously lost somewhere along the way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - So the guys promised. <br>  - These are those who shouted loudly on Facebook that they are ready for free for the portfolio, and then silently merged?  Well, yes, yes ... Wait. <br>  I sighed.  It would be desirable, of course, that literate people helped me with the page, but judging by the behavior of these comrades, it‚Äôs not worth hoping for them from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù.  If a company basically allows itself to dynamite customers, even if they are free (most of which can be converted to potential, or even real), it can fail even at a more responsible moment on a paid project.  They would say: ‚ÄúSorry, change your mind, collect more interesting projects for our portfolio‚Äù - yes, no problem!  I would only respect that they treat their project so thoughtfully and that they did not forget to warn.  And so ... Good luck to them, cho. <br>  But I didn‚Äôt want to optimize myself categorically.  In addition to knowledge of the abbreviation decoding, in luggage there was only marketing experience in general and several ad campaigns in AdWords, not the most successful, frankly.  Understand more in ASO? <br>  - The cat also wept for transitions from advertising to landing pages.  - I continued to languidly resist, already realizing that for nothing.  - So, before users are lost.  Do you think optimization will save? <br>  - Thinking is not my job! <br>  - It can be seen‚Ä¶ <br>  - What?  - Ghoul soared. <br>  - Well, I say, I will!  Only later, when the next version of the application is finished. <br>  - And what is the connection?  - Judging by the tone, it hurt her hard.  - Come on, come on, do not filon!  How long - to figure out, sit down and do? <br>  - She said it will be, - I smiled conciliatory.  - You'd better tell me, is it worth it to start advertising, if from her zero exhaust? <br>  Gulya, still harboring under her breath, sat in a chair opposite, fiddling, allegedly settling in ... But it was already clear that she had gone.  She is generally easy to deal with. <br>  - If this, as you did last time, is not worth it. <br>  - Are you talking about <a href="http://android-magazine.ru/talejdoskop-new/">the review</a> that I ruled, and which still came out with a curved headline?  Well, this is some kind of nonsense, the rest are quite sane guys, with whom I worked. <br>  - Remind how much you paid for it?  - sarcastically asked Gulya. <br>  - Well, so ... - I was embarrassed.  It was embarrassing to admit that I still get laid out for it.  - Stuck. <br>  - In the business of a penny, wasted - this is already a lot.  And here it‚Äôs not enough for you that the text after them had to be completely exhausted, so also to hear the indignation that you dared to be dissatisfied with their work. <br>  - Yes, I understood already, I realized that these guys are going to the same forest as assistants!  Stop cutting.  In the case of what you say? <br>  Gulya got up again and walked over to the table. <br>  - Come on, show again the schedule of installations.  Where, you say, advertising went? <br>  - Where, where ... Do not rush into rhyme!  None of them worked, even hundreds of installations never existed, and the people wrote that they had thousands.  Why am I wrong? <br>  ‚ÄúWhy-why, don't rush into rhyme.‚Äù <br>  I was stuck trying to figure out what indecent word she had in mind.  Although in the vocabulary, Gulya could attach anyone ‚Äî the daughter of Google himself, not anyone. <br>  In general, a strange situation with this application ... It seems everything did what experienced marketers advise - and the reviews were, moreover, on very popular sites.  And the news in large public groups hung - and thematically-literary, and android.  And even the banner of the month hung on a decently visited site.  This is not to mention the support of our publishing audience, which has hundreds of five heads, and if Fantlab is to be counted from him under a hundred thousand users ... So what?  And nothing!  The maximum number of installations fell on the first announcement on Fantlabe - I‚Äôm ashamed to admit, but there were 33 of them in a day.  Is there really a problem in the store page? <br>  Gulya was silent, looking at the graph, changing the cuts and samples. <br>  - Is it worth it to reanimate this application at all?  - Without looking into her eyes, I asked quietly.  ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs already ... Ah?‚Äù  Hands down.  Maybe in vain I am preparing the update, I spend time on it? .. <br>  Yes ... I thought I was already on this topic, I thought ... It‚Äôs time to say ‚ÄúStop‚Äù - it‚Äôs important if this is not about a hobby.  But has this time already come?  Or is it still possible to return the patient to our mortal world, and he has a long, happy and bright life ahead of him? <br>  - And what stops?  - just as quietly and just as without taking my eyes off the monitor, returned the question to Gul. <br>  - You see, I still believe that the idea is good.  What is the application people need.  Maybe a little, but if there are five thousand active users, we can assume that it took place.  Is it really impossible to type so much? <br>  - Have you tried everything? <br>  - Pancake!  Yes, I will do the optimization!  I will do !!!

      <b>Five days later</b> <br><br>  If you look at the sunset through a glass of cognac, its color is difficult to describe, it‚Äôs embarrassing to sound banal as ‚Äúdark gold‚Äù or ‚Äúamber‚Äù.  Simply - the color "look at the sun through brandy."  It will be necessary to advise designers - let them include in the list where the color of the hip of a frightened nymph is already listed ... <br>  - Well, how are you doing?  - Gulya materialized behind my right shoulder.  - I look, you drink brandy, not vodka.  So, it turned out? <br>  - And then!  Look at the graphics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/922/596/43b/92259643b43747e3a44b97d6e68919c0.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7eb/495/9bf/7eb4959bf7d84f4d98fe221131742c28.png"><br><br>  - Did something else these days? <br>  - Nah.  Well, the next week of authorship went, so it is from Monday, and the growth began immediately after I updated the pages in stores on Saturday evening.  And this is not the first week we have in Talaydoskop - the past one, there, it was with the Booker nominee.  Publics covered well, and you can see the result. <br>  - Hmm ... So, this is a reaction to the change of pages.  Congratulations! <br>  I saluted her glass and took a sip.  Still, Hennessey XO - good! <br>  - It was difficult to?  - Gulya settled in the chair opposite. <br>  - Nah.  I found keywords in the AdWords scheduler with a decent amount of queries, chose from them those that can be inserted into the text smoothly.  Then the text itself sketched, trying to arrange everything with lists.  The screenshots were redrawn, the name of the application was changed to a banal one, but the saying "Library of Fiction" ... That's it. <br>  - Morality?  - smiled Gulya. <br>  I smiled back.  And what can you say?  The eyes are afraid, and the hands are doing.  And in this case it turned out to be unimportant that I had neither knowledge nor experience.  Common sense and one day of work, including reading a couple of articles on the topic.  The result, of course, is not the one that the pros could issue, but my task is solved.  For myself, I made a conclusion - it makes sense to turn to specialists in such matters during large-scale progress, when all actions must be coordinated, and queries on keywords must be constantly monitored.  If it is just about eliminating significant, as it turned out, interference on the way of users to the application settings, then there is a real way to cope on their own.  But an unsuccessfully designed page can, indeed, multiply by zero all the promotion activity. <br>  - What do you think next?  - Considering the answer with my satisfied physiognomy, Gulya continued the interrogation. <br>  - Rethenshens need to be increased in order to not lose new users in the application itself - here I want to build reminders.  And the duration of the first session is too small and falls.  I suspect that working during the first update of the catalog is inconvenient.  I will change the scheme for downloading the content and add the tutorial ... As long as the user is watching, the catalog, you see, will be updated. <br>  - And what about the rest of the sessions? <br>  - They, too, are mostly short - they need to be increased, but I don‚Äôt know how yet.  Then think about it. <br>  - Then she will think ... Come on, show the chart by month. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a25/4bf/c98/a254bfc98c3b42b8b6b4877694d5df19.png"><br><br>  - Hmm, sad sight ... Heartbreaking ... Nightmare ... <br>  Well, who asked her?  This mood is excellent - the patient was able to reanimate, even if he doesn‚Äôt run, but you can transfer to the intensive care unit ... No, just to be happy for me.  Plans would be discussed later.  After a day there, a week ... Although how much useful things can be done for this day or week? .. <br>  - And how much do you want to increase?  - Sensing my outrage, Gulya changed her silly tone for business. <br>  - Well I do not know.  Just a little more to ... <br>  ‚ÄúJust a little more ...‚Äù she mocked.  - Five minutes or half an hour? <br>  I shrugged.  How do you rate this? <br>  - What is your average session duration with conversions? .. Well, well ... Well, here it is, darling ... Look.  The average for the entire period is 18 minutes, a bit too much.  But if you throw out February with his 25 minutes and look at the last months, then in March - 10 minutes, in April - while 8. Here are these numbers and look out for you.  Do you understand? <br>  I nodded awkwardly.  That's clever, contagion!  Although a lot to know and be smart - two big differences ... But I didn‚Äôt say that out loud. <br>  - Design you would still change ... <br>  - This is yes.  I want to try a material one, but not in the nearest update, otherwise I will do it before the carrot season. <br>  - It is logical.  Well, good luck to you!  Call me when you need me.  - Waving goodbye, Gulya dissolved in the air. <br>  I looked again at the fading sun through the glass.  From a practical point of view, sunset is meaningless, but beautiful.  The numbers in the analytics table are ugly, but meaningful.  But the application should be both meaningful and beautiful ... Beautiful, like a glance at the sun through cognac. <br>  Sympathetically sighing, the sun finally disappeared over the horizon.  And I was waiting for the next one, and not the last working night - I need to finish the update ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289708/</a></p>
