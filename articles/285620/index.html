  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience a remote job search in London</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A year ago, an agent from London called me - they were looking for Javascript programmers for Badoo.  Vaguely remembering that in order to work in the UK, a complicated work visa is required, I immediately informed them that I only have Russian citizenship.  The agent said that this is not necessarily a problem, and that Badoo has several quotas for people without the right to work in Britain.  Later, he really called back, apologized, and said that the quotas were over. <br><br>  This year I received EU citizenship and decided to try my luck again.  Active search took about 3 months.  There will be a list of various thoughts that came in the search process. <br><br><ul><li>  To search for work is to be treated like a game.  There are rules of the game, there are winners and losers, and you can always play another game.  Do not take the whole process too seriously. </li><li>  The rules of conduct in interviews, technical tasks and questions are more likely to be irrelevant to real projects.  Likewise, the final impressions of you by the team may not be related to what you actually can. </li><li>  It should be extremely clear for yourself on what position you want to get.  It will save a lot of time - you can quickly sift out all unnecessary.  I started the search as a front-end developer, then outlined the circle as a full-stack developer with the prospect of entering the project manager. </li><li>  Skype interview - approx.  Terms of reference for the weekend - approx.  Fly to London for the first interview or first technical task - not ok.  It only makes sense to fly when everyone already likes each other, and both sides have a positive idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow things can work out.  Or just if you want to see the city. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Some companies arrange a pair programming session during the interview.  In my case, it took away from half an hour to an hour.  You are allocated a computer, one or two people from the team.  They set before you a task and with interest look how you will get out.  For 10 years working in Finland, I have never programmed a couple, and for the first time I was attacked by an incredible stupor.  Well helps to pronounce aloud all your thoughts, as well as paper with a pen. </li><li>  Startups often offer low salaries, while demanding vast experience and involving greater responsibility.  This is not necessarily bad, especially if you can agree on a stake in the company. </li><li>  Agencies.  They will look for positions, organize interviews, kick companies and you so that everything moves forward.  They will tell you how to dress up for an interview and what questions will be asked there (not the fact that it will coincide, but they will try).  They can even send you a zip solution to the technical specifications, which in my opinion is quite a cheating.  On the other hand, between you and the immediate position there will be a layer in the form of an agency.  All communications will be conducted through them.  When the decision of a technical task does not suit the company, you cannot directly ask the person who assessed it, what he did not like and how to improve everything.  The agency will send feedback, which usually comes down to ‚Äúthe code level does not match the requested salary level, we already have candidates who code better for less money‚Äù </li><li>  It should be borne in mind that for an employer company an agency is an extra waste of money.  For this reason, the agency will recommend that you lower your salary requests - to the extent that you receive less than you already receive. </li><li>  For the same reason, it makes sense to take the initiative and go to the company itself, without agencies.  Many vacancies and companies have a postscript - ‚Äúif you are an agency, please do not disturb‚Äù.  The cool office of FT Labs writes in plain text - ‚Äúif for the first time the agency represents you and not you, it will create a bad impression‚Äù. </li><li>  If you asked for a technical assignment, then it is necessary to specify in advance the dates and the day when you return it.  The task delivered on time creates a positive impression. </li><li>  The technical task code without tests is an automatic file. </li><li>  Another thing about agencies - if you are talented and your githab sparks stars, agencies will quickly find you many positions.  If you have 0 followers on a githaba (like mine), agencies will send you random positions in the hope that someone will bite you.  Conclusion - a talented person can quickly find a job through an agency.  But a talented person can also find a job without them. </li><li>  The job search should occur constantly, even if you are already satisfied with everything.  This should not be taken too seriously - then there will be no time left for the main work.  But it must be such an ongoing process to keep yourself abreast of real value and demand in today's world.  What technologies are used in real projects.  Several interviews can give an excellent cut about the techniques of work and processes in the teams of modern companies.  Each company (especially large) is like a separate world, in which its laws, and which does not recognize anything else.  Startups are more unified, everything works about the same. </li><li>  A good approach is to keep a brief diary of the main events of the process.  If the technical task or interview did not go smoothly - write down your thoughts and next time take them into account.  There is always the next time. </li><li>  If you do not look for a job, you can quickly break away from reality and have an exaggerated idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyourself. </li><li>  Two interviews a day directly in the offices of companies - the ceiling.  After that it's nice to have at least a day of discharge. </li><li>  Most companies will try to save themselves and you time, immediately to the forehead asking questions about salary, citizenship, when you can move.  An excellent sign would be if the company offered a (reasonable) technical task even before the very first interview - then you can not even waste time on the interview if something does not suit them. </li></ul></div>
