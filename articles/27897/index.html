  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Night call to webdesign spammer or "Porn sites is illegal"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just an hour ago, my anti-spam filter missed a tricky ad, and I found in my inbox a letter without text and even without a theme, but with a picture inside.  From a certain Filaret Basargin (come up with the same). <br>  Removed.  Not reading.  But a piece of text was still snatched by a look, for some reason it reached into the basket, for some reason it read it.  I wanted to call and ask a couple of questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here it is advertising. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4c0/2d2/87b/4c02d287b92042e7acb7fa53dfc8835b.gif" width="450" height="31" alt="hello from spammer" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  ‚ÄúWe offer you high-quality creation of websites of any type of any complexity and any topics. <br>  Call 8 (495) 772-68-58 George " <br><br>  I looked for a VOIP number so that the phone call didn't fly out and started dialing the number, hoping to wake up George. <br>  Zhora answered politely, although at first he could not wake up to figure out where to speak, but still thank you for picking up the phone.  Truly 24/7 service. <br>  There was about this conversation. <br>  - Yes. <br>  - Hello, can I talk to George? <br>  - Yes, I listen. <br>  - I would like to order a site. <br>  - Yes of course.  What site? <br>  - Porn site. <br>  - Which one? <br>  - Porn site.  Adult content. <br>  - No, we do not undertake such. <br>  - Well, how is it, because in the advertisement it is written "... the creation of sites of any type, of any complexity and of any topics ..." and the porn site quietly falls under this definition. <br>  - Well, we did not mean porn sites. <br>  - What sites did you mean? <br>  - Others. <br>  ‚ÄúWhy don't you want to deal with a porn site?‚Äù <br>  - It is against the law. <br>  - Well, I'm not asking you to participate in the shooting and look for models.  This is not about content, it seems. <br>  - No, we can not. <br>  - I am not on the territory of Russia, and the project does not fall under the Russian legislation, and whatever was on the site - you will not have any relation to the content. <br>  - Well, we can make a gallery, write scripts and all that, but we will not fill it. <br>  - Are you generally law-abiding? <br>  - Yes. <br>  - By the way, spam is illegal, but porn sites are not. <br>  - Well, in what you are right (guilty) ( <em>comm. - What is ???? ?????</em> ) <br><br>  In general, I did not dictate TK over the phone, I regretted that it was not possible to record the conversation in audio format.  He asked once again about whether or not they would, and he received an affirmative answer and said that they would also call him about work.

      I don‚Äôt know if people who advertise something as spam should be considered mentally normal.  The nature of the phenomenon is clear, but in the courtyard of 2008, and it would be time to understand that spam, apart from irritation, causes nothing to <strong>normal</strong> people.  And with the <strong>abnormal ones</strong> who suddenly respond, then they will have to work.  And if you call yourself a web designer, then take care of the honor from the young :) <br>  So as not to say people later: <br>  - And ... this, grandchildren, web designers are going, do not be friends with them ... <br><br>  And so that webdesigners do not poke their fingers and spit in the back ... <br><br>  I wrote this in order to convene a flash mob (at least try) and ask the habra people to help download the guys with ‚Äúwork‚Äù, because this is an overwhelming announcement that made me angry, but I‚Äôve been clacking - cooled.  (by the way, is it like a city number or mobile in Moscow, too, are tied to the city code?) <br>  The guys seem to be punished like this with fate and stupidity, and most likely it will work as anti-advertising.  Although, why not pofleshmobit. <br><br>  Such are the pies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27897/</a></p>
