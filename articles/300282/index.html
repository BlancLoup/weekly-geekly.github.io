He was headed by the Internet holding <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.ru Group</a> , overtaking his competitor - the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> .  The third place was taken by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">the Kazan Helicopter Plant</a> .  They went around last year's winner, the company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2583%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">"Sukhoi"</a> .  But aviation has retained the industry championship, writes RBC. <br><br>  The holding is now ranked first in terms of daily mobile audience in Russia, and more than half of users access Mail.ru Group projects from mobile devices.  Now the holding is entering the second phase of the transition to mobility: ‚ÄúThe paradigm, the approach to services, and the understanding of their work are changing.  There were people who actually did not see the computers, but they checked the phone 300 times a day, ‚Äùsaid group general director Dmitry Grishin. <br><br>  In 2015, the monthly audience of the company's portfolio games reached 43 million people.  Revenues from MMO-games in 2015 increased by 6.3% and amounted to almost 9 billion rubles.

      Despite the leadership in the ranking, Mail.Ru Group is not the largest company among the rating participants. <a name="habracut"></a>  The revenue of Yandex is 1.8 times more - about 70 billion rubles by the end of 2015. <br><br>  65% of their total revenue of participants in the rating is accounted for by military and partially military enterprises, and not by IT.  Therefore, in compiling the rating, not only the size of the company, but also the profitability of the business were taken into account.  Internet companies are taking the lead precisely because of high margins, RBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/21/04/2016/5717add09a7947dbb2695677">reports</a> . <br><blockquote>  Judging by the rating, the IT sphere in the Russian economy of technologies still holds a modest place: only 10.2% of the total revenue of 50 participants accounted for the industry where the leaders of the rating work.  Aviation remained the main technological industry - manufacturers of such equipment ‚Äúbrought‚Äù 28.1% of the total revenue of the rating companies.  At the same time, the sphere of IT was also bypassed by railway engineering (about 16%), manufacturers of weapons (almost 15%), companies working for space, and shipbuilders (approximately 11%). </blockquote><br>  In compiling the rating, RBC analysts ranked the companies, taking into account both their size and business profitability, counting their average annual revenue and profitability over the past five years.  If you rank the company simply by average annual revenue, the position of the leaders of the IT industry will be more modest. <br><br>  The researchers considered companies engaged in the development and production of unique technological products and technologies, with revenue in 2014 of at least 10 billion rubles.  They used data from the SPARK-Interfax system (as of 03.30.16), open sources and data from the companies themselves. <br><br>  For the ranking of enterprises were used three composite index: <br><blockquote>  1. ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù is the average annual value of the indicator over five years, from 2011 to 2015.  If the company does not have reporting for the previous year, the index was calculated on the basis of data for 2010-2014. <br><br>  2. ‚ÄúProfitability‚Äù is the average annual value of the net profit margin.  To calculate this indicator, they took the revenue and net profit of the enterprise over the past five years. <br><br>  3. ‚ÄúDiversification‚Äù is the number of market segments in which the company's products are present. </blockquote>  Each index is normalized by the maximum value among similar indicators for all companies from the short list and takes a value from 0 to 1. The total enterprise index is the sum of three normalized indices. <br><br>  Almost none of its participants produces goods and services for the population.  An excellent illustration of the attitude to such products can be voiced by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585">Rostec's</a> plan for the production of the first fully-assembled Russian smartphone, which will cost up to $ 200.  The Roselektronika holding, which is part of the state corporation <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">,</a> hopes to begin production of these devices in three years, said Igor Kozlov, the general director of Roselectronics, in March. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300282/</a></p>
