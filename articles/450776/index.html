Short card about</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you turn to a simple inhabitant, he will surely say that the radio is dying, because in the kitchen the radio point is long cut, the receiver only works in the country, and in the car your favorite tracks are played from a flash drive or an online playlist.  But we all know that if we hadn‚Äôt been a radio, we wouldn‚Äôt read about space, cellular communications, GPS, television, Wi-Fi, experiments with microwaves, smart home and IoT in general.  And Habra would not exist, because the Internet is also a radio.  Therefore, today, May 7, 2019, we are writing a post of thanks to the radio, which has done more for the development of society than all the revolutions and intergalactic corporations put together. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c2/ec7/0f6/0c2ec70f62a33e49775107538661a22a.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Radio life is not just a story of a technical entity, it is life itself: parents did not believe in it and believed that it was capable of small things, it was limited in possibilities, it was used for evil purposes, it helped to overcome good and save people and eventually it took over the world and became the founder of a separate technological universe.  What is not a superhero story! <br><br>  If it is very generalized, then radio is communication using radio waves.  It can be one-sided, bilateral or multilateral, to ensure the transfer of information or the exchange of it, between cars and people - this is no longer the essence.  The main words here are two words: radio waves and communication.

      First of all, let‚Äôs put an end to the beginning of the article - why May 7th?  On May 7, 1895, the Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov conducted the first radio communication session.  His radiogram consisted of only two words ‚ÄúHeinrich Hertz‚Äù, thus he paid tribute to the scientist who laid the foundations of the future radio.  By the way, the primacy in the radio department is contested not only by Guglielmo Marconi, who conducted the first session also in 1895, but by a number of other physicists: 1890 - Edouard Branly, 1893 - Nikola Tesla, 1894 - Oliver Lodge and Jagadish Chandra Bose.  However, each made his contribution, and it is worth adding a few more names: James Maxwell, who created the theory of the electromagnetic field, Michael Faraday, who discovered electromagnetic induction, and Reginald Fessenden, who first modulated the radio signal and, on December 23, 1900, transmitted a mile speech - with terrible quality, but sound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02a/7d7/815/02a7d7815674cfe224d8e5357a68cee4.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>A. Popov and his invention</i></font> <br><br>  Heinrich Hertz conducted the first experiments with wireless transmission of information.  His experience was a success - he was able to convey a message within one attic of his own house.  Actually, this would be the case if the Italian Marconi had not read this remarkable fact in Hertz‚Äôs biography.  Marconi studied the issue, combined the ideas of his predecessors and created the first transmission device, which did not receive interest from the Italian authorities and was patented by scientists in England.  At that time, an electronic telegraph already existed and, according to Marconi, its device would complement the telegraph where there are no wires.  However, Marconi's invention was used for communication on warships, and sending messages to a large number of listeners at the same time remained in the future.  Marconi himself did not believe in the brilliant future of radio communications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d4/a44/358/7d4a4435803a62c3d9945f6a47c48cbf.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>G. Marconi and his invention</i></font> <br><br>  By the way, about the ships, more precisely, about the navy - in 1905, in the Tsushima battle, the Japanese fleet defeated the Russian squadron partly "thanks to" the radio equipment that Japanese military leaders bought from Marconi.  But this was not the last argument in favor of the complete radioification of the military and civilian fleet.  The last word turned out to be another, this time a civil one, a tragedy - the death of the Titanic.  After the emergency signals from the sinking giant saved 711 passengers, the maritime authorities of the developed countries of the world ordered that there was radio communication on every sea and oceanic ship, and a special person ‚Äî a radio operator ‚Äî listened to the incoming signals around the clock.  Security at sea has increased dramatically. <br><br>  However, they did not particularly believe in other prospects of the radio. <br><br>  But numerous radio amateurs believed.  For the First World War, so many amateur radio stations were created that the governments of the countries were in a panic: amateurs connected to military communication sources and listened to the channels.  Therefore, the radio became the object of regulation, and there were no longer those who underestimated it.  It became obvious that in the hands of mankind a powerful cultural phenomenon, information weapons and promising technology.  Although, we are ready to argue, then no one had any idea about the true prospects of radio. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the radio split the life of mankind in the twentieth century into four parts along three milestones: <br><br><ol><li>  November 2, 1920 - the first US commercial radio station, KDKA, went on the air in Pittsburgh </li><li>  July 1, 1941 - the first commercial television station began broadcasting. </li><li>  April 3, 1973 - For the first time in history, Martin Cooper from Motorola made a cell phone call. </li></ol><br>  As you see, both the state and the business understood that radio is information, money, power. <br><br>  But scientists and engineers did not stop, they were disturbed by radio waves capable of transmitting, heating, having different lengths and speeds.  Radio fell to the service of science and is still on it.  It seems that there will be more than one decade.  Today we recall the most unusual and important inventions in which the radio was not a tool and not a means, but a full co-author. <br><br>  <b>The development of electronics.</b>  Radio simply built electronics and microelectronics: devices, televisions, receivers, transmitters required a huge number of circuits, boards, complex and simple components.  A whole gigantic industry has worked and is working for the radio industry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/035/2c7/ffa/0352c7ffa31467dbfa7fcaef45464e72.png"><br><br>  <b>Radio astronomy.</b>  Radio telescopes made it possible to study objects in the Universe (although the signal goes by earthly standards for a long time - from several seconds to several hours) by studying their electromagnetic radiation and radio wave band.  Radio astronomy gave a huge impetus to all astronomy, made it possible to obtain data from moon rovers and rovers, to see in space what the most powerful optics is not capable of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f6/1ac/1ad/5f61ac1adbd57d0600ebb4f7a047667c.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>This is what radio telescopes look like (Paul Wild Observatory, Australia)</i></font> <br><br>  <b>The means of navigation and radar</b> is also a merit of the radio.  Thanks to them, you need to try to get lost in the most remote areas of the planet.  It is the radio that helps to create and use the most accurate maps, the most sensitive trackers and ensures the interaction of the machines with each other (M2M).  Here it is worth mentioning the radar, without which the automobile industry and transport would have evolved several times slower.  Radar played a huge role in military affairs, intelligence, the development of weapons and military vehicles and ships, in science, underwater research and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66c/011/f09/66c011f0953474395fb3812225e38a71.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>The principle of operation of the satellite navigation system.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i><a href="http://information-technology.ru/sci-pop-articles/27-transport/6202-kak-rabotaet-sputnikovaya-navigatsionnaya-sistema-gps-i-glonass">A source</a></i></font> <br><br>  <b>Cellular and Internet.</b>  Remember the terms Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, CDMA, DECT, GSM, HSDPA, 3G, WiMAX, LTE, 5G?  All these technologies and standards are essentially nothing more than an oscillating circuit opened in 1848.  That is, the same radio waves, but only at different speeds, ‚Äúrange‚Äù, frequency.  Accordingly, it is radio that we owe to the things that occupy our mind today - in particular, the Internet of things (things communicate over the air), the smart home, various integrated information gathering technologies, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/085/6e4/9fe0856e49ca6500a03b5feb29df13f8.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Surely each of you saw these towers close (white boxes - base stations of operators, BS-ki).</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>The intersections of the BS coverage areas define ‚Äúcells‚Äù - cells.</i></font> <br><br>  <b>Satellite communication</b> is a worthwhile achievement.  Radio waves made it possible to get the benefits of wireless communication where it is impossible to organize a cell - in remote areas, in the mountains, on ships, etc.  This is an invention that has saved lives more than once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a13/c4e/e28/a13c4ee28c8ed29747eb3bbbac9e250c.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Satellite phone</i></font> <br><br>  <b>The Eiffel Tower.</b>  Built for an international exhibition in 1889, it was supposed to stand for only 20 years and was doomed to be disassembled.  But it was precisely this high structure in Paris that became the tower of broadcasting, and then television broadcasting and communications ‚Äî accordingly, they changed their minds about such a useful thing, and it gradually became the main symbol of France.  By the way, do not move away from the workplace - still on the tower are fixed base stations, transmitters, plates, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67e/c88/6cd/67ec886cd54081b28e3f363f2e1a1624.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>How do you like this angle symbol of France?</i></font> <br><br>  <b>Radio wave surgery</b> (do not confuse with radiosurgery!).  This is an advanced operative method that combines tissue section and coagulation (‚Äúbrews‚Äù blood vessels so that there is no bleeding) without mechanical action with a scalpel.  The principle of operation is as follows: a thin surgical electrode produces high-frequency radio waves, which are generated by alternating current with a frequency of at least 3.8 MHz.  Radio waves heat tissues, evaporate cellular moisture, and tissues diverge bloodlessly at the incision site.  This is a fairly low-impact and painless method (most often used under local anesthesia), which is also common in aesthetic surgery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/941/55a/eff/94155aeffe14459b00bb6763654d509e.png"><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>The device for radio wave surgery BM-780 II</i></font> <br><br>  Of course, we can recall certain types of locations, microwave microwaves familiar to us, therapeutic experiments, of course, numerous and diverse radio stations, a whole world of radio amateurs, and many other examples - we gave the most extensive and interesting ones. <br><br>  In general, guys, communicators and affiliates, with the holiday!  Traditionally: for communication without marriage, the purity of frequencies and to a single gap. <br><br><h2>  73! </h2><br><hr><blockquote> The postcard was prepared by the <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft Developer Studio</a> team - we not only create CRM systems, but also try to make a feasible contribution to the life of television and radio <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dcrm_me">holdings</a> , so we developed a cool industry solution for them <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/loader.php%3Fsrc%3Dcrm_me">RegionSoft CRM Media</a> .
