  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless charging of electric vehicles while driving in the near future</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear <a href="http://www.icover.ru/">iCover</a> readers!  What do you think, is it possible to create a system capable of fully meeting the energy needs of a vehicle on an electric load without any physical and significant time costs on the part of the driver?  Is it possible to charge your electric car on the way, without turning off the track and not losing at least several hours to charge or recharge?  In the British Ministry of Transport and the state road company Highways England believe that yes, and insist that they are ready to prove it in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98a/326/a58/98a326a58147440e63adc3612fe02c66.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  More recently, Ilon Mask was answering journalists' questions about what, in his opinion, will be the dynamics of the increase in the length of the Tesla electric car run without recharging the battery.  To date, the distance record when driving without overload and at low speeds is 800 km.  By 2016 - 2017, Ilon believes, the 1000 km bar will be overcome, and by 2020 - 1,200 km from a single charge.  On average, the capacity of existing Tesla batteries will increase by at least 5-10% annually.  The range of movement in this case will be determined, of course, not only by one battery charge capacity.

      With such life-affirming dynamics, the issue of creating and developing the existing charging infrastructure, as well as finding alternative ways to charge the batteries of electric cars, is still very acute. <br><br>  While Ilon Musk is pondering how to increase the range of an electric vehicle without recharging from 800 to 1200 km, the engineers of the British state company <a href="http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/projects/preparing-the-strategic-road-network-for-electric-vehicles/">Highways England,</a> with the support of the British Ministry of Transport, suggested a bold alternative project - Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer (DWPT), the successful implementation of which will allow charging Already existing vehicles on an electric charge in a wireless way while moving along certain sections of the route. <br><br>  Thus, DWPT (as a balanced addition to existing and prospective fixed networks) will solve not only the problem of charging an electric vehicle, but also the painful problem of creating and developing the infrastructure of charging stations. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer Systems - Realities and Prospects</font> </h2><br>  In order not to be ahead of events, let us note that for the time being this is not a concept, but a promising pilot project.  At the same time, the goals, opportunities and the resolute mood of the leadership of the national subordinate company Highways England give hope for the successful implementation of the plans. <br><br>  Objectives of the project Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer: <br><br>  The study of dynamic battery charging systems for electric vehicles on strategic highway routes will allow you to: <br><br>  Owners of electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles: <br><br><ul><li>  Release the vehicle from tight binding to the existing network of charging stations. </li><li>  Significantly reduce the cost of refueling. </li></ul><br>  Road companies: <br><br><ul><li>  Improve air quality. </li><li>  Reduce noise and improve the quality of life of people living in close proximity to highways, filling stations and charging stations. </li><li>  Minimize costs associated with servicing charging stations. </li></ul><br>  We intend to start implementing the roadmap at Highways England this year. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe possibility of recharging electric vehicles while driving will open up interesting prospects,‚Äù said Transport Minister Andrew Jones (Andrew Jones) ... - In order for the UK to be the first to introduce this technology, improve ambient air quality and create additional jobs, the government has already allocated 500 million pounds sterling for the next five years. ‚Äùhe states. <br><br>  Testing innovation at Highways England is originally planned on UK private roads.  In accordance with the plan, the first stage should start by the end of the current year and last for a year and a half.  ‚ÄúActive‚Äù sections of the route (the so-called ‚ÄúCharger loop‚Äù) will be located at an interval of 30 km on the designated lanes.  If everything goes according to plan, then at the next stage DWPT systems will be deployed on key highways in the UK.  The first stage will allow to investigate the system in action, to answer the remaining questions related to its effectiveness and safety, to outline ways to eliminate the detected problems in promising solutions. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the Highways England organization, which is responsible for the quality and repair of roads and the qualitative improvement of the national transport infrastructure in Britain, became the driving force behind the project.  According to Mike Wilson, the company's chief road engineer, "... Testing wireless power technology outside of the main highways will help to adapt the UK road network to energy efficient technologies and will open up new freight opportunities throughout the country." <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Electric Highway Technology</font> </h2><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw6XtzEOlyI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxMu2P3lrwGfKWF5R8tbdWDmZw_g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The DWPT technology allows non-contact transfer of energy from the existing national grid to the charger of an electric or hybrid car, a minibus and cargo transport while driving on the highway.  And this is its innovation. <br><br>  To create a resonance (Shaped Magnetic Field In Resonance) between the ‚Äúradiating‚Äù block of the roadway and the receiving unit of the electric vehicle, the latter will be equipped with electromagnetic coils and the associated interface. <br><br>  Test tests will be conducted in closed mode.  Cars participating in the tests will be equipped with coils that convert electromagnetic radiation produced by elements in the road surface in areas of the charge loop into electric current.  Equipment carrying out wireless delivery of useful energy of the vehicle will be located under the road surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c04/227/d4a/c04227d4a02f15e71b4552164c61dbd4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The advantages of DWPT wireless dynamic charging stations are obvious.  With the successful development of the project - is, first of all, a highly effective solution to the problem of the shortage of stationary charging stations.  This is no need to waste time on charging the battery.  For the owner of the vehicle - it is an opportunity to increase the length of the rally of an already existing vehicle modification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf8/9af/dfe/bf89afdfec3e50e5242ec3ac0c8e70ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the attractiveness of such a solution, engineers rightly believe that they will have to face several problems in the process of ‚Äúrefining‚Äù the project.  One of them is the reliability of the structures that hide the equipment placed under the road surface.  No less serious challenges can be thrown and the weather surprises - rain, snow, ice.  Factors related to potential health risks for the driver and passengers should be clearly calculated. <br><br>  The project is a project, and an accurate assessment of the throughput capacity of DWPT systems, as well as the cost of dynamic charging services, is possible only in the conditions of a real route, in areas with heavy traffic, etc. This is well understood by Highways England engineers.  And therefore ahead of time prefer not to declare success. <br><br>  At the same time, they don‚Äôt plan to completely abandon the stationary charging stations even in case of successful implementation of the DWPT project in the UK Ministry of Transport.  On the contrary, a parallel and mutually complementary development of two alternative service systems is planned, with Highway England engineers planning to deploy stationary stations on the main thoroughfares of the country at an interval of 35 km. <br><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of the blog iCover!
