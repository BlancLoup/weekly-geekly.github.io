  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bill No. 305828-6: Liquidation of the Russian Academy of Sciences</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  RIA News: <br><blockquote>  On Thursday, June 27, at a meeting of the government of the Russian Federation, a large-scale reform of the Russian state academies of sciences was announced.  It is assumed that out of three academies (RAS, RAMS - medical, RASN - agricultural) one will be formed, which will turn into a "club of scientists", free from the need to manage financial flows and property.  Three more academies will be transferred to the government. <br></blockquote><br>  As an employee of one of the institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences, I cannot deny that I am vitally interested in the fact that what the <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/%2528Spravka%2529%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D305828-6">draft law</a> provides for does not happen.  In fact, it implies the elimination of three academies, the creation of one single RAS, deprived of property management, procurement and research costs. <br>  All institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences will be reformed according to the principle of universities in the recent past: one third will be simply eliminated, another third will be given to departments, and the most ‚Äúprivileged‚Äù third will remain under the Russian Academy of Sciences, which, however, will not give any preferences. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On this subject recently read a very vital: <br><blockquote>  Well, what are you boss?  Do you have a budget?  Do you have the opportunity to hire the employee you need or buy something?  That's the same thing!  But at NASA, even the youngest manager has a small, but his budget, which he can manage and is responsible for the results of his spending. </blockquote><br>  Russian science does not have a future in the version that is regulated by the new law (as yet) of the project. <br>  <a href="http://www.odnako.org/blogs/show_26556/">Here it is</a> interesting and informative on the topic of this new ‚Äúreform‚Äù by the authorship of our beloved for almost a year of the Ministry of Education Science.  (quote above - also from there). <br>  Again, the situation doesn‚Äôt remind anyone of the creation of Oboronservis?  And what do we have with him now? <br>  In a similar scenario in the 1930s.  under Mussolini, the National Academy of dei Linchei, the oldest national academy of Italy, founded under Galliele, was eliminated.  Later, after the Second World War, at the insistence of Benedetto Croce, the Academy was restored to its original form, but so far Italian science has not been able to recover. <br>  All the institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences are now actively discussing the prospects for such a reform.  I do not know yet a single person who would have advocated the entry into force of such a law.  And we are full of examples when various laws were ‚Äúdragged‚Äù through the State Duma at once in three readings for such periods that one wonders. <br>  The number of petitions and open letters is growing every day.  Requirements - from stopping the discussion of the project without public discussion to the resignation of Livanov personally (the current min.Ob.Nauki) and even the entire government apparatus under the leadership of Medvedev. <br>  Our institute did not stand aside either (IORAN is not the smallest, by the way).  Today a general conference was held and an appeal from the institute was made.  Unfortunately, you cannot participate in it.  But you can well help to stop the consideration of the bill by signing one of the public appeals. <br>  The most effective is to leave your signature (real, pen, by hand, with passport data) under the text of the appeal to suspend consideration of the bill.  If someone still decides on this (and this is fraught with "difficulties": it is necessary to print the appeal, sign it and somehow send it to me, to our institute or to the Presidium of the RAS) - write in a personal, I will send and we will agree how we will do it.  Any citizen of the Russian Federation who has the right to vote, regardless of affiliation with the Russian Academy of Sciences or science in general, can sign.  Although the concierge of your porch. <br>  From alternative options - leave your vote <a href="http://save-russian-academy.org/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.change.org/ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">here.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://asozd2.duma.gov.ru/main.nsf/(Spravka)%3FOpenAgent%26RN%3D305828-6">UPD.</a> <br>  07/03/2013 <br>  2681-6 DG: <br><blockquote>  adopt the bill in the first reading;  submit amendments to the bill to 15 hours on July 4, 2013 </blockquote></div>
