  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Invented profit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One kind person had a plot of land ... There was such a kind of house, a homely house there, a wooden fence ... And suddenly, next to his section, right behind the fence, they began to build something orgomno ... Maybe a skyscraper, and maybe a business center ... To build and then the funds ended ... And a lot of building material remained there ... <br>  A kind person thought and made a hole in his fence ... He put some bricks for himself, a little bit of slate ... But how much does one person need?  Here he, from the kindness of his soul, told all his acquaintances about his manhole, wrote ads ... And he began to let people through his station completely for no man‚Äôs good ... He had no benefit in anything but universal gratitude - it became warmer in his soul when the frequent guests ‚Äúthanked‚Äù said, they shared a meal with him, they supported the conversation ... <br><br>  And everything was fine, until it turned out that his courtyard was too small, and often people, literally, had to line up in a queue on the street in order to get a freebie breech.  He talked to people, they gathered money, helped a little, but he began to finish the guest rooms on his own, to pave the path, to expand the gates.  Naturally, we had to close the hole regularly, dig holes, install construction vehicles on the site, bring night lighting ... <br><br>  But the majority did not understand him - they started shouting ‚Äúwhy did you bury the passage with your cars?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI because of you, bastard, fell into a pit!‚Äù And other nasty things ... Immediately there were advisers of the horde, who and what column to put, how and what to build ... <br>  And the most curious case was when people started dumping heaps of carried material on the street, near the latrine ... They said, ‚ÄúI'll take it tomorrow,‚Äù ‚Äúlet it go here, maybe someone should.‚Äù And after a while, this is, I apologize, a bathroom , barricaded, that there was no access to it at all ... It was necessary for a person to rake it all by himself, move it to another place, and throw all frank trash back onto the construction site.  And so, grateful people, seeing this raised a terrible scream.  Everyone found something irreplaceable that was thrown by a careless owner, everyone shouted that with such an attitude he would better go to the construction foreman and would buy the same material from him ...
