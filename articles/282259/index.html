  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Windows migration experience On Linux / Unix. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Linux forever! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Debian 7 continued to be my second operating system.  Because of the work load, on the one hand, there was no time to understand it as well as to implement the project on LFS, but on the other hand, the quality of the fonts did not suit me.  Sometimes, spending 10-12 hours a day, in front of the display, didn't want to spoil my eyesight.  All the applied guidelines for improving the font did not give results. <br>  Nevertheless, on the server side of the next project, I decided to rely on Linux in the server side, using the hired admin for this purpose, using only the architecture.  And I was extremely pleased with the results, because  managed to integrate LDAP, key authorization in Apache and raise the application server through FastCGI.  All this rotated on a virtualka for 500 rubles a month while it was under development. <br>  In the meantime, Debian 8 came out and, in the evening, I decided to upgrade Debian from 7 to 8. But either I was tired, or I didn‚Äôt jab at the wrong place - the MBR on the screw wiped.  It was theoretically clear how to fight, but a strong-willed decision was made to install only Debian, since  it became clear that without this progress will not be.  Moreover, the fonts in Gnome 3 turned out to be quite acceptable.  Said done and not a working compic for Linux.  For a while, I settled down and adapted in it, until I finally mastered it completely.  Meanwhile, the development of a bicycle on a working machine began to approach the final stage and it became clear that it was time to install an SSD to improve performance.  Under this idea, it was decided to transfer the development environment under linux, since  I was more or less accustomed to it and was ready to move on. Further, the story will be closer to the subject. <br>  The first task that had to be solved was setting up the file system for SDD.  In general, it did not cause any difficulties, although the correct configuration was not created the first time. <br>  The second task, which took five days of life, was setting up the mail server.  Knowing that linux is strong in networking, I thought the task was trivial.  It turned out, as I later read, this is one of the most complex administrative tasks.  Maybe I was looking bad, but there are two situations.  The first is that the mail system is strongly integrated into the operating system and many programs send notifications to root @ localhost.  The second situation is that there is a separate pop3 (imap) server (dovcote) and smtp server (postfix) and setting up their collaboration with the integration of authorization, given the fake dns host name for development purposes is not a trivial task.  But thanks to reading posts on Habr√© and smoking manulals, I mastered it. <br>  The next problem was again the fonts.  1C enterprise required some kind of separate fonts, and java required configuration settings.  In addition, the quality of the fonts at regular work again did not suit as a whole.  I had to put a set of patches Infinality.  And here was the first real challenge for me in the system.  After the next update of the system with the kernel, something became incompatible with the Infinality patch and the graphical environment did not load, cursing that some symbolic links either lead to the wrong place or indicate that they are not.  But removing Infinality and reinstalling it solved the problem.  We can say that I repaired something.  By the way, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm right or wrong, but it seems to me that, unlike Windows, the visual quality of the fonts depends on the angle of the monitor. <br>  The second problem was that the evil corporation, as always, ignores the generally accepted standards and the Ctrl-Break, which is required in long-running operations in 1C for interruption, does not work in linux.  And then I wrote my first script, which by Ctrl-Break creates the file stop1c, and in 1C I replaced the system interrupt check with my function.  And it all worked.  By the way, I did not find such a solution on the net.  And I am proud of my first script: <br>  #! / bin / bash <br>  touch /home/....../stop1c.txt <br>  Everything else works as a whole and I am very pleased that the system is completely under my control and I am already planning to upgrade my own server, since  to deal with hosting is a tedious task.  And I even had further commercial ideas about Linux :) <br>  Now, about the disadvantages of Linux.  I consider the first drawback of the system to be the absence of a standard and standard interface to configuration files.  The second drawback is still insane amounts of barbed on teams.  Of course, I have already mastered the basic arsenal, but again I would like to have a standard wizard for constructing parameters and command keys.  And the third drawback I consider the bash syntax.  I understand that all the topics are flame, and the last one is in nature, but the syntax is extremely archaic.  And what to do ... Soon will have to smoke manuals. <br>  As a result, I want to say the following.  Windows and Linux are not comparable with each other both in capabilities and level of control over the situation.  The comparison is clearly in favor of Linux and I recommend everyone to move in this direction. </div>
