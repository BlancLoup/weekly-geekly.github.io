I did not want to tell my boss that I was leaving.  I knew she would be frantic.  After all, I went to competitors who were going to pay me a big salary.  I was a traitor. <a name="habracut"></a>  But how could I leave the company for more money.  She continued to tell me that leaving the company - I made the wrong decision;  and that it is not possible to make a decision based on the amount that the new employer is willing to pay.  And she was right, I really should not have made such a decision, starting only from the amount.  And this, of course, was not the main reason for my leaving, but she tried to convince me that this was the only reason. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85d/ee6/c5e/85dee6c5ed4321e441a0215c3b7f7977.jpg"></div><br><br>  Do you think I made the wrong decision about leaving?  Since this happened a long time ago, I can say with confidence that I made the right decision.  However, if I now asked my past boss if my decision was correct, I would get an unequivocal answer - no.  And no matter: let me go and created a new Facebook or become a billionaire.  In her eyes, I made the wrong decision.  After some time, I realized that any decision that I would not take was always wrong.  Regardless of your decision, there will always be a person who will be angry with you.  And there will always be people who will be adversely affected by your decisions, even the most insignificant ones.

In fact, there was not a single person who supported me.  I had a wonderful job with skills that are very much in demand in the labor market, and here I decided to quit and go about my business. <br><br>  After 6 months, I can confidently say that it was a wonderful decision.  I achieved many of my goals and managed to completely replace all of my past business connections that simply became useless.  If you ask me, I will say that I made a wonderful decision.  The best solution in the last few years.  And my past employer still thinks I was wrong.  If you ask my family, they still doubt that I made the right decision. <br><br>  They still want to get me back to the corporate world.  And now, if suddenly I decide to leave the world of startups and return to the corporate world <b>*</b> - this will make many people happy, except for my new friends on a startup.  For them, I will forever remain a traitor. <br><br><hr><br>  * unlikely <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/dmitry_zhariy/" class="user_link">Dmitry_Zhariy</a> says: <br>  <b>Read this text in English!</b> <br><img src="http://k.min.us/ilPp06.png" align="left">  Try to read the text of this article in English in order to improve your skills and goodness. <br>  The following link leads to a bilingual (mixed, English and Russian) version of this article.
