      A few words about physiology: the main task of your body is to provide mobility and efficiency ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù.  Almost always with victims in the future.  What happens when we sit in a chair?  A modern office person is physically poorly developed (this is true), so a long, tense posture (head stretched forward, eyes peering at the monitor, back rounded and skewed sideways, because one arm rests limply, and the other actively moves the mouse). the spinal muscles cannot hold the correct position of the spine for more than one and a half to two hours - they simply relax and release the ligamentous-joint apparatus.  To avoid injury - the body includes an emergency mode of preserving mobility and redistributes the vertical load so as to compensate for it by bending the spine itself and the tension of the ligaments and small muscles. <br><br>  It's not scary, it's normal, but the problem is that we do not notice the change of conditions and continue to sit in this position for another hour, two or more.  As a result, the load falls not on large and strong muscles, but on joints, tendons and many small muscles, which in the future is guaranteed to lead to a whole bunch of diseases with a common root ‚Äúchondrosis‚Äù. <br><br>  The solution is the correct posture.  How to achieve it?  And completely by regular means, without hellish armrests or chairs for one and a half thousand euros? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Let's first decide what is needed for this: <br><ul><li>  table, working chair and footrest should be adjustable in height and in the horizontal plane; </li><li>  the height of the working surface of the table (for adults) should be regulated within 68-80 cm (in the absence of such </li><li>  possibilities, the height of the working surface of the table should be an average of 72.5 cm); </li><li>  any desktop should have space for legs not less than 60 cm high, not less than 50 cm wide (you can lay a few more centimeters ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù if your height exceeds 190 cm); </li><li>  foot rest: not less than 30 cm wide, not less than 40 cm deep, height adjustable up to 15 cm and the angle of inclination of the bearing surface up to 20 degrees;  the surface is desired grooved, with a front side 1 cm high for stopping the foot and preventing socks from hanging down; </li></ul><br><br>  Now about the landing: <br><ul><li>  The chair (very preferably rotating) should be adjusted in height so that the monitor screen is in front of you in the center and just below eye level;  the back of the chair should support the back, especially its lower part; </li><li>  feet should rest on a special stand or at least a full foot on the floor; </li><li>  hands when working with the keyboard should lie directly in front of you, and fingers - easy to move, the keyboard itself should be located at the desired height - at the level of the elbows.  The angle between the shoulder and the brush should be close to straight.  The elbows should not be very ‚Äúsplayed‚Äù; </li><li>  it is important that the armrests, if any, are at such a distance that the forearms are placed freely on them, without raising the shoulders; </li><li>  The mouse should be positioned so that the brush is not bent at the wrist, either up or down (if necessary, use rugs with wrist support).  Do not hold the mouse for a long time in one place, move it every 20-30 minutes to another area, hold it lightly, with a relaxed brush; </li><li>  operating mode: no more than 6 consecutive hours (and ideally no more than 2 hours), obligatory short breaks and walks every 30-60 minutes, long breaks (at least 10-15 minutes) every 2 hours, with the performance of relaxing exercises (and not computer games).  Easy gymnastics will work fine (I'll take the liberty to recommend the book <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%2B%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%2B%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%26clid%3D14585%26stpar2%3D%252Fh0%252Ftm7%252Fs3%26stpar4%3D%252Fs3">Office Yoga</a> - a good set of simple exercises); </li><li>  carry out unloading complexes of exercise therapy (ordinary Soviet complexes, they will tell you about them in any hospital) daily or at least several times a week.  Practice Pilates gymnastics - the exercises are simple, but they help very well; </li><li>  if you play sports or go to the gym, pay a little more attention to your back by removing peak loads in the 120 Ramstein style and adding some exercises to strengthen the ligamentous-joint apparatus.  For example, there is a lifter "isometric" exercise; in the stand for the deadlift, keep the bar at a height of 3-10 cm from the floor for 5-15 seconds.  The back should be perfectly flat.  Or add to the program swing backs on the goat, but follow them at an average / slow pace, bending as much as possible upwards and without burdens; </li></ul><br><br>  The last check of the correctness of your landing is an opportunity, without tearing your back from the back of your chair, with your extended hand to reach most of the items you need to work. <br><br>  <b>Task two is to ensure a physiologically comfortable position that prevents the occurrence of back pain.</b> <br><br>  In most of the seats, during normal landing, the back in the lumbar region is arched back, the discs are expanded back, the ligamentous apparatus of the spine is overgrown.  All this contributes to the functional overload of muscles, ligaments, intervertebral disc, and vertebrae, which quickly leads to feelings of fatigue and back pain. <br><br>  With physiologically correct posture, the support in the lumbar region should be under the upper lumbar and lower thoracic spine.  Roughly speaking, your belly should be protruding. <br><br>  The support for the lower back can be made by yourself or buy a pillow for an office chair.  For the sample, take a large bath towel.  Fold it, not twist, so that the roller has an oval rather than round shape.  By changing the size of the towel, you can choose the most convenient size of the roller and choose a lumbar pillow according to this sensation.  Roller in a plastic bag, tie the elastic to the ends of the bag.  Now correctly position the support (self-made roller or a special pillow) for the lumbar response.  First of all, the gum of the backwater spreads over the back of the chair, without it the roller or cushion will fall down all the time and put pressure on the sacrum, and should on the transition from the waist to the chest section.  As a guideline, you can use the lower edge of the pillow; it should be 5-10 cm higher than the seat of the chair. <br><br>  With such a position of the spine, the ‚Äúvertical spring‚Äù depreciation works, the load on the spine is evenly distributed across all vertebrae and intervertebral discs, and the blood supply to the tissues is minimized.  This physiologically comfortable posture can significantly reduce the possibility of back pain due to neurological manifestations of spinal osteochondrosis. <br><br>  I should add that the most common posture disorders in the sitting position are that the person is hunched, the head moves forward and to the side, the body leans forward, the lumbar spine is over-extended, or the pelvis moves forward, kyphosis of the lower back and thoracic.  In the half-reclined position in the chair there is no clear support for the waist, and the head is tilted forward in a tense posture (often when reading). <br><br>  Resting while sitting, you can not slouch, keep "legs and legs". <br><br>  When driving a car, the steering wheel and control levers must be within easy reach, the back is straight, the head restraint is obligatory.  When discomfort in the lower back - put a roller.  Turning the head during reversing is carried out synchronously with the rotation of the eyes and torso. <br><br>  I hope these simple tips will help the habra people and their associates to feel a little better using the usual items available right here and now. <br><br>  <i><b>Update:</b> Transferred to the blog "Learn to work."</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47435/</a></p>
