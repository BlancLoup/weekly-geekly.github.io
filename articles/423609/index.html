  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where do web sites go after death? Personal experience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi habr. <br><br>  A long time ago, more than 10 years ago, I started a website for myself.  More precisely, even two.  The first was a typical home page in the style of narod.ru (if anyone remembers), honestly composed using Notepad in HTML.  Contact and LiveJournal was not there, so having a website with a photo gallery, a news feed, a guest book and a visitors counter at the bottom of the page was then cool.  The second site in the domain com, was intended to host several shareware programs.  For him, even a corporate design template was bought, so the site looked quite good at that time. <br><br>  I never became a shareware genius; 1-2 sales per month brought in no more than $ 25, which could have been enough except for going to McDonald's, updating my homepage with time, too, was tired.  Paying monthly for hosting has become meaningless, and it was decided to close these sites, just do not renew them, and that‚Äôs to the end.

      Passed a couple of years.  What was my surprise when, for the sake of interest, typing the address of both pages, I saw that both sites still exist.  How do they work?  Details under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Homepage </h2><br>  Obviously, anyone can buy a vacated domain, and there would be no ‚Äúintrigue‚Äù here.  However, my homepage had an address of the form <a href="http://xn--80adthqjaot2j.spb.ru/">http: //wasapupkin.spb.ru</a> , and besides me, and no one would need a complete namesake who lives in the same city.  Therefore, it was 100% obvious that after the domain was not renewed, it would simply go into non-existence. <br><br>  But it was not there.  Having typed my address, I saw something like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/y4/25/nsy425i3gwe4irloe5cax7jqn8a.jpeg"><br><br>  The texts are blurred so as not to make free advertising for new owners, but the approximate content consists of randomly created texts such as ‚Äúbbw in underwear‚Äù, ‚Äútattooing for free‚Äù and other nonsense. <br><br>  Of course, because  the address of the site was known by friends and acquaintances, and even he was searching by my name and surname, I didn‚Äôt want a page with ‚Äúfat girls in underwear‚Äù popped up when opening ‚Äúmy‚Äù page. <br><br>  The first thought was that the admins of my hosting provider ‚Äúearn additionally‚Äù - they simply hammered the vacated domain with random content, and hope for some pennies from clicks from random visitors.  However, the tech support provider replied that they had nothing to do with, the domain was renewed again in another place.  As shown by whois, the hosting is American Cloudflare, and the date of the last update is 2017-02-17.  No less important is the fact that it is already impossible to close the site or change its contents. <br><br><h2>  Page on .com domain </h2><br>  Let's say, to score pages with random text, it is quite simple.  With the second page, everything turned out to be even more original.  "New owners" retained all the old texts, screenshots and page hierarchy, replacing the site template with a modern one.  Only all links are removed, only text is left.  On the main page, only an advertisement of some VPN Port Forwarding service has been added (I will not, of course, provide the link). <br><br>  It turned out a kind of "flying Dutchman", a site with empty pages leading to nowhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zv/ap/de/zvapdel6v3mou78rluinkfp2ud4.jpeg"><br><br>  The whois data says that the domain is quite active, though the hoster is different: <br><br>  Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.namebright.com <br>  Registrar URL: <a href="http://www.dropcatch1129.com/">www.DropCatch1129.com</a> <br>  Updated Date: 2018-03-12T07: 21: 26Z <br>  Creation Date: 2018-03-09T19: 32: 02Z <br>  Registry Expiry Date: 2019-03-09T19: 32: 02Z <br><br>  Of course, as in the previous case, it is no longer possible to remove a domain or change its contents; it belongs to the new owners. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The result as a whole turned out to be interesting - as it turned out, ‚Äúscavengers‚Äù exist on the Internet, and even a completely unwanted and closed site may well ‚Äúrise‚Äù again.  Although everything is clear from the household and from a legal point of view - what was thrown away does not belong to the owner.  The fact that the name of the site coincides with someone's name, the reason for its closure can not be.  In the second case, theoretically, one could get to the authorship of the texts, but of course there is no practical sense in this. <br><br>  Apparently, it is impossible to fight this - except to prolong the domain all the time by yourself, which would also be meaningless.  But the owner of home pages should be borne in mind - you should not be surprised if on the page with your name and surname there is then completely left content. <br><br>  PS: By the way, as it turned out, a page abandoned 10 years ago on narod.ru also still opens, and neither can be deleted, nor can it be changed - the old login, of course, has not worked for a long time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423609/</a></p>
