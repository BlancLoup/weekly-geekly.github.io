So far on Alibab you can find echoes of that Mpow, which was not familiar to the general public.  It is under this name <a href="https://detail.1688.com/offer/583519426809.html%3Fspm%3Da261b.12498223.ul20190117.61.12652d89KPDtD0">that the</a> lenses for the smartphone <a href="https://detail.1688.com/offer/583519426809.html%3Fspm%3Da261b.12498223.ul20190117.61.12652d89KPDtD0">appear</a> , then the <a href="https://detail.1688.com/offer/561382434742.html%3Fspm%3Da261b.12498223.ul20190117.68.12652d89KPDtD0">covers</a> .  In general, it was time to search for a niche.  In a number of sources you can find a mention of the brand as a manufacturer of LED lights, bracelets. <br><br>  Today, echoes of this search are still <a href="https://www.xmpow.com/collections/professional">traced</a> in selfie sticks and ear plugs, but the main direction at the moment is unambiguous - headphones and headsets. <br><br>  The Mpow brand is quite young: according to the official website, the history of the company begins in 2013.  (Although 2004 <a href="https://bestgear.me/brands/mpow/">is</a> also <a href="https://bestgear.me/brands/mpow/">mentioned</a> somewhere).  According to <a href="https://www.owler.com/company/xmpow">Owler</a> , in 2012. The very next year, the company's monthly turnover (data from the official website) is $ 30 million in 30 countries.  At Owler, annual revenue is estimated at $ 17 million. <br><br>  And the following years, several awards at once as ‚ÄúBest Sellers‚Äù in the European Amazon and, along the way, several ‚ÄúRed Dots‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Audio Mpow</b> <br><br>  Why is such a success?  In fact, over the past 6 years, the company, firstly, has grown into an assortment, and secondly, despite minor setbacks and a local negative, still their headphones are very, very good and, finally, by some miracle they managed to thunder on top YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x5/km/rq/x5kmrqm7qkrj5z5opcfuqa0yodw.png"><br><br>  The Chinese, who are proud of Mpow as their own, even <a href="https://www.cndsw.com.cn/shangye/4816.html">devote articles of</a> this kind to success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/oq/xv/beoqxvie58osntynlnt_burhs7s.png"><br><br>  Well, the prices, of course, are cheap.  Headphones with an average cost of 30 bucks for their sound, good autonomy, and good design are in the West, where it‚Äôs somehow customary to pay a lot, of course, they will be appraised. <br><br>  Well, then on the thumb it all through Aliexpress reached our YouTube, and now the ‚ÄúBest Headphones‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Main Competitor of AirPods‚Äù and so on, which somehow provides Wordstat with the brand at the level of 3 and a half thousand.  The story of Mpow headphones on Habr√© also has some: we already wrote about the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/373263/">Thor</a> model at the time, just recently wrote about a kind of heirs to this model - <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/459328/">059</a> .  However, a couple of years ago, Mpow in Russia was known, surprisingly, for <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/406793/">Bluetooth receivers</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/33/nq/su33nqwhplr6go4s6c6lacfjvuk.jpeg"><br><br>  Now in the official catalog these gadgets are slightly retracted to the periphery, however, to this day the thing is very popular, despite the abundance of wireless headphones and cars, where Bluetooth is already available as an option. <br><br>  <b>The main catalog of Mpow is headphones</b> <br><br>  Categorically, products cover all the most popular sectors for today: full-size, TWS, wireless, children‚Äôs, for gamers, business, and each of them has 5-6 units of devices. <br><br>  Headphones are generally praised.  In most reviews, there is a general trend for all devices - great bass, but a rather "normal middle".  Here, for example, a <a href="https://www.rtings.com/headphones/reviews/mpow/h10-wireless">review</a> on the model H10. <br><br><blockquote>  The Mpow H10 is a decent-sounding, closed headphone.  Their bass is almost perfect, but their midrange is recessed, and some may think that they sound just as good.  This causes the vocals and lead to move back to the back of the mix.  However, these headphones still sound good and will be universal for a wide variety of music genres, although they will not be ideal for vocal-oriented music. <br></blockquote><br>  Or, model 059 from there: <br><br><blockquote>  These headphones have deep, consistent and powerful bass, a well-balanced midrange, and decent and high-frequency.  This makes them suitable for those who prefer heavy bass to neutral. </blockquote><br>  Similar comments <a href="https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/1708629811767716420.html">can be found</a> in both professional and amateur reviews / reviews of Mpow headphones for listening to music.  Nevertheless, the final verdict is always in favor of the brand: as a result, it always turns out that the headset, taking into account the build quality, battery endurance, and the versatility (for some) of the connection, and the price tag, and sound, are perfectly balanced for everyday use and are "optimized" for different genres. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/lp/hg/tylphg3egocftc2suggcvdaeymu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>A few examples from the catalog</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y0/kc/pu/y0kcpuf3dnsnwd_btmx6sartpwg.jpeg"><br><br>  Several of the most popular Mpow models are also presented <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/katalog/mpow.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Dbrand">in our catalog</a> .  Here, the already mentioned Amazon best-selling model is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/459328/">059</a> and some others. <br><br>  <b>Flame</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n7/as/wp/n7aswpowlcqkv73oexv8q9n5oao.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mpbh088ar.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Dflame">The model is positioned as a sports one</a> , although, in our opinion, it is more suitable for the usual urban mode of use: speakers that are too large, although they have hooks for a denser / more durable fit, can still seem heavy on their own. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/tv/9v/wwtv9vqb9qeg_scx6zfb6rfdgmw.jpeg"><br><br>  Nevertheless, the model for sports can be successful: high autonomy up to 8 hours without a break, good waterproofing (up to 1 meter / 30 minutes).  For an hour of work, it is enough to recharge the headphones for 10-15 minutes.  As in most models, there is a ‚Äúrecessed‚Äù middle with good bass.  A plus is a set of accessories and a durable comfortable case. <br><br>  <b>Magneto sport</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o-/-n/2p/o--n2ph8w9hl_0vt5x1ruahdgxw.jpeg"><br><br>  Headphones are also <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mpbh305ab.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Dmagneto">sold as sports</a> .  There is a little less dynamics, and a hook is used as a mount, which is placed inside the auricle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/na/z9/wr/naz9wrohce5kq_buijnoo32ivva.jpeg"><br><br>  They are also equipped with consumables and a cover (although it is slightly smaller than the previous model).  ‚ÄúMagneto‚Äù in the name indicates that the speakers are attached to each other using built-in magnets. <br><br>  <b>TWS Headphones - T7 (A4)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0x/ae/nc/0xaencyxsvd0mscjzmac4ct4oke.jpeg"><br><br>  Headphones are <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mpbh334ab.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Dt7">quite bizarre in</a> form, which come complete with a charging case.  Of the main advantages - good autonomy: taking into account the case-trust, up to 20 hours. <br><br>  <b>TWS Headphones - T5</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/vb/on/ohvbonr3afkbfadvhalhww4z1n4.jpeg"><br><br>  Inside the line today is an <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/mpbh322ab.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmpow%26utm_campaign%3Dt5">absolute hit</a> , despite some misfortunes that haunted the model.  For example, the first version refused to work with Android 9. <br><br>  The model was redesigned, and now the shelves are already updated, which does not experience any problems with synchronization.  It sounds very decent, here, as in all models, rich bass is noted, and a Qualcomm codec is involved in data transfer.  Stable Bluetooth signal indoors and outdoors. <br><br>  At the same time, the earphone managed to keep small size and light weight. <br><br>  <b>As a result</b> <br><br>  Mpow is a rather curious brand, a brand with obviously Chinese roots and a relatively short history, which already fits into the public‚Äôs recognition, prestigious awards and good annual turnovers. <br><br>  First of all, this is probably facilitated by the low price, which makes the headphones accessible for users of any income.  At the same time, a person is always kind of sure that he doesn‚Äôt take a pig in a poke, but a normal high-quality sound, a convenient design for himself, and good assembly. <br><br>  In this sense, Mpow quite successfully adopted the Xiaomi model: cheap and high quality on a small assortment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461863/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461863/</a></p>
