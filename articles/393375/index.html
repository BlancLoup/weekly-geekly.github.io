  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Battery eaters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One fine morning, waking up to the sound of an alarm clock on a smartphone, I saw in my news feed on the social network LinkedIn an interesting note with a funny name - Battery Eaters (battery eaters).  At first I thought that this was another post with a selection of software that would ‚Äúeat up‚Äù the battery power of your device in a matter of hours.  But, having opened the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/battery-eaters-eibert-draisma%3FarticleId%3D6127774476659671040">link,</a> I saw a small ‚Äúlittle man‚Äù with arms and legs from ordinary clips, a printed circuit board as a body and LED lights instead of eyes. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ua-hosting/blog/275004/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/943/b1a/40b/943b1a40b1cf48afb717611d6f4b9d4c.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The creator of this unusual "robot" is a famous Dutch designer, inventor and artist Eibert Draisma (Ebert Driesma).  In November 1991, he graduated from the Design Academy in the city of Eindhoven, after which he worked for more than 10 years on various inventions, most of which were focused on bringing new innovative products to the market.  Between 2000 and 2008, Ebert developed more than 150 DIY products for Praxis, a Dutch DIY chain.  His work has been published in many magazines and books around the world.  From 1992 until today, Ebert Driesma continues to teach industrial design at the Eindhoven Design Academy.  In 1993, he was one of the first designers who were associated with such a design direction as Droog (translated from Dutch meaning ‚Äúdry‚Äù).

I think many of you know that in every battery that you throw away, there is still a supply of energy.  Abbert Driesma encourages everyone to use this remaining charge, and also to do it in such an unusual way.  He created the first battery eater back in 1986, as a gift for his grandfather.  Since then, many relatives and friends have asked him to do something similar for them.  To date, some "grandfathers" of these unusual "little men" continue to work so far, and thus delight their owners for several decades already.  According to statistics, more than 3 billion batteries are sold in the US alone in a year, so there will always be something to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù these funny ‚Äúrobots‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/47c/b41/a7c47cb412214d04ab042eaa91f7be5d.jpg"><br><br>  In order to run a small robot, it is enough to take an AA-size battery and insert it into this unusual "little man" from the back side.  Then just admire the blinking of his LED eyes for months, or even several years, until the charge is fully exhausted.  Also, an adapter will be supplied with battery eaters, which will allow you to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù this unusual ‚Äúrobot‚Äù and AAA batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/369/c3e/ae2/369c3eae2aa0438f97a5d2e8fb32b4fd.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the expected success of this invention, Abbert Dreysma plans to create a whole family of small battery eaters.  In addition to the head of the family that has already been presented, a "robots" woman and child will be developed.  Also, Abbert does not forget about pets and wants to create a dog and cat battery eaters.  There will be such a small ‚Äúarmy‚Äù of funny ‚Äúrobots‚Äù who will be able to help you put things in order with old batteries, while doing so will make it very funny.  They can also become little helpers in your daily life, for example, they can send messages to people you love: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a7/55a/ed7/4a755aed7e094ee996a8e48eed7be287.jpg"><br><br>  Will help decorate the Christmas tree: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b19/138/83f/b1913883fc4a40af915bdce01906064c.jpg"><br><br>  Or your vehicle, the same bike: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/e85/a2e/925e85a2e88a47879d64f222dc55b2b2.jpg"><br><br>  Can lure buyers good discounts: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfc/169/3a3/bfc1693a3af840789dfa0585fb816d73.jpg"><br><br>  Or they will help to store various trifles, for example, the same keys: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db8/c40/9e5/db8c409e58344eaab2d60e21f22d73af.jpg"><br><br>  These little ‚Äúlittle men‚Äù can become the favorites of not only your children, but they will also definitely like adults.  They charge a positive, and also help breathe new life into unused energy.  Do not forget about the environment, "recycle" batteries with a smile on your face and a spark in your eyes! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/m05HZBOqwIM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhic71aLFudouNSVMUbqqsWMS8EzmQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393375/</a></p>
