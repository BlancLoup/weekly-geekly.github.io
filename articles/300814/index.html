Despite the fact that there were few changes in the staff of the largest Russian IT companies and media resources, they attracted public attention. <br><br>  Someone changed jobs based on personal sympathies.  Someone just chose the best of "a huge number of worthwhile offers."  Someone had to "instantly solve" the problem of burnout and leave the company. <br><br>  Someone managed to once again confirm that a dream at work can lead to positive results.  And someone filed a lawsuit against the employer because of the "unbearably boring" work.

      "Megamind" invites readers to recall these events and make a "commit" of the changes that have occurred. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Design Director of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> Konstantin Gorsky decided to leave the company.  He <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gorskiy/posts/10154798301250744">reported</a> about it on the page on Facebook.  His duties will be divided among themselves by his deputy Lola Kristallinskaya and art director of Yandex in Turkey Sergey Fedorov. <br><br>  Gorsky explained his departure by a desire to "try to live and work in another country."  From the summer of 2016, he will start working at Intercom, where he will occupy the position of lead designer. <br><br>  Lola Kristallinskaya will be responsible for managing the design department, and Sergey Fedorov will focus on the design and content of projects.  Up to this point, Kristallinskaya held the position of Deputy Gorsky.  She also leads educational projects of Yandex - the School of Design and Mobilization.  Fedorov served as art director of the company in Turkey, and before joining Yandex, he worked in the studio of Artemy Lebedev. <br><br>  2. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258A_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC)">Kommersant</a> publishing <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%258A_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC)">house</a> <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2980114">announced</a> that its general director, Maria Komarova, goes to work on the board of directors of UTV-holding. <br><br>  The position of general director of the publishing house will be occupied by Vladimir Zhelonkin.  Until now, he served as chairman of the board of directors.  The new chairman will be elected at the next meeting of the board of directors. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn 2008 I began work under the leadership of Ivan Tavrin in the group of companies‚Äú Choose Radio ‚Äù, in 2013, at his invitation, I joined Kommersant.  Now Ivan Tavrin intends to focus on new projects, and he invited me to participate in their implementation.  With interest and gratitude, I accepted his invitation.  In the near future, I will be engaged in new projects, including in the field of media, ‚Äùsaid Maria Komarova. <br><br>  3. Former Vice President of PR and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargaming.net">Wargaming</a> Marketing Nikolai Nebyshynets, who left the company at the end of 2015, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mike.belton.9/timeline/story%3Fut%3D32%26wstart%3D-2051193600%26wend%3D2147483647%26hash%3D10209625586744516%26pagefilter%3D3%26ustart%3D1%26pnref%3Dstory">returned</a> to the World of Tanks game development team.  He will lead the Publishing CIS department and will work on promoting Wargaming projects in the CIS.  Nebyszyniec took up his duties on May 11. <br><br>  In Wargaming, the appointment of Nebyszyniec was explained by the need for ‚Äúspecial experience and knowledge of local culture and business‚Äù to work in the CIS market.  Nebyszyniec himself said that the Wargaming offer turned out to be the most interesting of the "huge number of worthwhile offers." <br><br>  Nebyszyniec explained his departure from Wargaming in December 2015 by the need to ‚Äúinstantly solve‚Äù the problem of professional burnout: ‚ÄúThe cyclical trap of daily work activities makes you forget about the importance of life balance.  I wanted to look at life from the outside, I needed to get a chance for comparison: what I do is right and what needs to be changed. ‚Äù <br><br>  4. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple</a> hired a robotics professor, Yoki Matsuoka, <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/05/03/apple-hires-nest-yoky-matsuoka/">writes</a> Fortune. <br><br>  At the time, Matsuoka was among the founders of the secret research unit of Google X, which is engaged in advanced developments, including Google Glass smart glasses and a self-driving car. <br><br>  In addition, in the record of service, Matsuoka is the position of Technology Director at Nest.  The next job was to be the post of vice president at Twitter, but the plans had to be changed due to the deadly disease diagnosed several months ago.  According to Matsuoka, the treatment was successful. <br><br>  5. Actress Megan Fox has become the main character of the advertising campaign for the mobile game <a href="http://vk.com/stormfall_dominions">Stormfall: Rise of Balur</a> , which was developed by an international company with Israeli roots Plarium. <br><br>  Thus, the studio repeated the experience of the company Machine Zone, whose Game of War: Fire Age has become one of the most recognizable games due to advertising with the model Kate Upton, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/05/04/take-that-kate-upton-as-megan-fox-becomes-the-face-of-plariums-stormfall/">writes</a> VentureBeat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f28/786/45e/f2878645eedef0e91fc5d668d508598b.jpg" alt="image" width="550"><br><br>  Now the audience of Rise of Balur is about 7.5 million registered users, while in Age of War there are about 250 million accounts. <br><br>  Fox will "play" a character named Amelia Deltanis, captain of the High Council guard in the game.  Her character will become a mentor to the player, and Fox herself can take part in "live" staged commercials. <br><br><h4>  Sleep at work to speed up production </h4><br>  The head of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Motors">Tesla,</a> Elon Musk, said that he had to sleep at the factory to help the company speed up the production of cars.  About it <a href="http://recode.net/2016/05/04/elon-musk-tesla-manufacturing-earnings/">writes</a> Re / code. <br><br>  Together with the publication of financial results for the first quarter of 2016, Tesla announced its intention to produce 500 thousand cars by 2018 - two years earlier than originally planned. <br><br>  While communicating with analysts and journalists, Mask said that he was ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with situations that simultaneously challenge Tesla and can make it the best automaker in the world.  ‚ÄúI have a sleeping bag ... in the factory.  My table is right next to the production line, ‚Äùsaid the head of Tesla. <br><br><h4>  "Unbearably boring work" </h4><br>  A resident of Paris, 44-year-old Frederick Desnard, accused his former employer of boring work and filed a lawsuit against him, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/02/frenchman-demands-280000-after-being-bored-out-of-his-job/">writes</a> The Telegraph.  He plans to recover 360 thousand euros in compensation from <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interparfums">Interparfum</a> . <br><br>  According to Desnard, the authorities deprived him of a real managerial position and for four years entrusted him with ‚Äúunbearably boring‚Äù tasks.  Disadvantages at work led to the fact that Desnard had health problems - epilepsy, ulcers, insomnia and depression.  ‚ÄúI was ashamed to get paid for not doing anything,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  After the company lost a major contract and began restructuring, Desnard went to the hospital, the statement said.  In 2014, after seven months on sick leave, he was fired from Interparfum. <br><br>  Now, a former employee wants to be paid vacation pay, as well as compensation for lost opportunities at the time he was not promoted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300814/</a></p>
