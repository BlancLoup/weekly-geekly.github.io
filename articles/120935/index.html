I worked for a long time in the field of catering, ranging from a waiter, a bartender, a cook to an assistant director + there was a good vision of the future business.  At the same time there was no knowledge and experience in the field of entrepreneurship and the necessary funds.  A trifle :-) But I was full of enthusiasm and intent to realize my plans. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I began, of course, with the search for the necessary information on the Internet.  Shoveled a lot of sites on the topic - how to start a business, how to write a business plan, where to get money, etc.  In the end, I got a rough picture of what needs to be done.  It is worth noting that not a single site offered a comprehensive solution.  Nowhere was there an approach to the implementation of the conceived, even at the level of presenting information as an <b>‚Äúidea-project-realization‚Äù process</b> .  Everywhere had to collect information in pieces.

      I must say, my plan was not implemented.  There were many reasons for this: a mistake at the concept level, lack of understanding of all the details of the process, lack of an investor, experience, and so on.  But even then I wondered why there is still no one integral solution in the implementation of projects.  Over the entire history of the development of the project approach, a huge knowledge base and tremendous experience has been accumulated.  But at the same time it is quite difficult for a simple person with a good idea to understand all these <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge">PMBok</a> , <a href="http://www.pmpractice.ru/training/sertification/ipma/">IPMA</a> , <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRINCE2">PRINCE2</a> , <a href="http://www.iteam.ru/publications/project/section_35/article_2384/">LSP</a> .  Here even the problem is not to understand this, but to put it into practice. <br><br>  Since then, I have participated in many projects - educational, IT, environmental, business, etc.  Some were realized, some were not.  Yes, now it's easier with this - there are business incubators, government grants, parties for start-ups, etc. ... There is some kind of project infrastructure.  On the Internet, more and more solutions are emerging in the field of <a href="http://www.onlineprojects.ru/">online project management</a> , all kinds of socially targeted services for finding investments and forming a team ( <a href="http://cofounder.ru/">cofounder.ru</a> , <a href="http://napartner.ru/">napartner.ru</a> , <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">startuppoint.ru</a> , etc.).  But at the same time there is no single approach that would approach systematically the design process itself and the environment in which it is applied. <br><br>  <b>The essence of the problem</b> - at the moment there is no favorable project environment on the Internet that allows anyone, regardless of their level of knowledge, experience and availability of resources, to implement projects in different areas of activity. <br><br>  <b>The online project environment</b> is an information system that covers all phases of the project process and allows you to effectively implement projects in various areas of human activity via the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Project Process Diagram </h4><br><br>  In order to better understand the essence of the problem, let's look at the project process itself. <br><br>  Below is a graphical representation of the implementation scheme.  It reflects only the process itself, the milestones of this process and its direction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ad/555/fdf/5ad555fdfaf53dd13a0a6fb70ae8e048.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The scheme does not claim to be the ultimate truth.  It is the result of the analysis and synthesis of the knowledge and experience that I gained in the process of implementing various projects.  The construction of this scheme uses the principle of passing the necessary stages (milestones), without which the project cannot be implemented, or its implementation will be difficult. <br><br><h4>  Project process </h4><br><ol><li>  <b>The concept</b> is a holistic system of views on the problem, allowing you to find an approach to its solution.  It helps to answer such questions as: ‚Äúwhat is the essence of the problem?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat solution is there for this problem?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWho may be interested in the project implementation?‚Äù.  In short, the <i>concept is the core of the project</i> . <br><ul><li>  <b>Problem:</b> Creating a concept is not a trivial task.  If we consider the creation of a concept as a process, then conditionally it will look like this: checking the idea for adequacy - brainstorming - bringing the idea to the level of the concept.  At the moment we have: <br><ul><li>  The lack of an effective service to evaluate the ideas of projects for their adequacy. </li><li>  The lack of competent Russian-language service collective brainstorming. </li><li>  The lack of a service that allows you to automatically create concepts for different projects with expert support. </li></ul></li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> <br><ul><li>  <i>Check for adequacy:</i> <br>  - For information projects: <b>habrahabr.ru</b> , <a href="http://cofounder.ru/">cofounder.ru</a> , <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">startuppoint.ru</a> , <a href="http://startupindex.r/">startupindex.ru</a> , <a href="http://nachinai.com/">nachinai.com</a> , etc. <br>  - For non-informational projects: <a href="http://homebusiness.ru/">homebusiness.ru</a> :-) </li><li>  <i>Collective brainstorming:</i> <a href="http://bubbl.us/">bubbl.us</a> (English), <a href="http://mindmeister.com/">mindmeister.com</a> </li><li>  <i>Collective work on the concept:</i> <a href="http://openideo.com/">openideo.com</a> (English), <a href="http://quirky.com/">quirky.com</a> (English). </li></ul><br></li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Building a Model</b> A model is a detailed image of a future system that defines its main elements and their interconnections. <br><ul><li>  <b>Problem</b> Lack of service for online modeling of different systems (the system in this context can be a business, organization, festival, website, etc.), where one could choose different modeling methods, optimize this model, conduct simulations, get expert help, and more .d </li><li>  <b>Existing Solutions:</b> <a href="http://boardofinnovation.com/">boardofinnovation.com</a> </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Project team.</b>  It is necessary to assemble an effective team to implement your project. <br><ul><li>  <b>Problem The</b> lack of a competent service that allows you to unite people around a project or idea <i>, regardless of the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapplication</i> according to the principle ‚Äúthe right people - the right projects‚Äù. </li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> <a href="http://cofounder.ru/">cofounder.ru</a> , <a href="http://buildwithme.com/">buildwithme.com</a> (eng.), <a href="http://nachinai.com/">Nachinai.com</a> </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Action strategy</b>  Develop a <b>non-</b> detailed project work plan, i.e.  create a tree of goals, determine priorities and criteria, determine costs and timelines, determine the range of tasks for each team member. <br><ul><li>  <b>The problem</b> is the lack of an online service to develop an action strategy.  <i>Here you can use online project management solutions.</i>  <i>However, their functionality is sharpened more for the operational management of the project, so their use is inefficient.</i> </li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> none. </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Presentation of the project to potential investors.</b> <br><ul><li>  <b>The problem is to</b> prepare a presentation based on the comments of the project team and the community.  Investors and other interested parties do not have the opportunity to trace the history of the project and its ratings at the previous stages. </li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> <a href="http://slideshare.com/">slideshare.com</a> , <a href="http://prezi.com/">prezi.com</a> , <a href="http://sliderocket.com/">sliderocket.com</a> </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Attraction of resources</b> necessary for project implementation. <br><ul><li>  <b>The problem is the</b> lack of an integrated investment platform, where all types of investors (state, banks, venture funds, business angels, etc.) would be combined, and the lack of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_funding">social investment</a> mechanism. </li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> <br>  - Investor bases: <a href="http://investclub.ru/">investclub.ru</a> , <a href="http://napartner.ru/">napartner.ru</a> , <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">startuppoint.ru</a> , <a href="http://nachinai.com/">nachinai.com</a> <br>  - Social Investing: <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">kickstarter.com</a> (English) </li></ul><br></li><li>  <b>Implementation of the</b> conceived. <br><ul><li>  <b>The problem is</b> now on the Internet there are many services that allow you to manage your project online.  But these services allow the team to work on a project like in a closed system.  Here it is necessary to change the approach itself and consider the project and its team as part of the information environment in which it is located.  Thus, it is possible to coordinate different project teams for solving common tasks, outsourcing, expert assistance, and replenishing a common knowledge base. </li><li>  <b>Existing solutions:</b> <a href="http://onlineprojects.ru/pm/">onlineprojects.ru</a> , <a href="http://webasyst.ru/">webasyst.ru</a> </li></ul><br></li></ol><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Each of the indicated problems may be a separate start-up, but separately all these services will not have the desired systemic effect.  They must be integrated into a <b>single process</b> . <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I outlined my vision for the project process and the problems that can <br>  to come across a simple person (like me, for example) when trying to translate a certain plan into reality.  I know that quite a lot of people are faced with a similar range of problems, and they, like me, also have a need for some kind of integrated online environment for project implementation.  If you have any suggestions, comments, thoughts, write to the comments.  In the next article I will try on the basis of feedback to describe an integral solution of this problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120935/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120935/</a></p>
