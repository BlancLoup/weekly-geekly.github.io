  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attempt to translate and voice acting video at home</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every self-respecting Soviet boy had to: know where to find the carbide;  to be in love with Alice Seleznev;  want to become an astronaut.  I am not an exception in this respect, and, so to speak, fully corresponded.  Over time, much has changed, but interest in space has remained.  Since January 2004, for a year and a half, I went almost every day to a special NASA page and watched what was new with the rovers.  So the documentary " <a href="http://docuwiki.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DDeath_of_a_Mars_Rover">Death of the Mars Rover</a> " ( <a href="http://docuwiki.net/index.php%3Ftitle%3DDeath_of_a_Mars_Rover">Death of a Mars Rover</a> ) was initially doomed to a resounding success among me. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the <a href="http://rutube.ru/video/18c480e72948fba313de3f40190c69bc/">only existing</a> until recently, the voice of this film was ... how to say it ... "not a solid five."  For me, in principle, it doesn‚Äôt matter - I can look at English as well - but for the <s>power of</s> other viewers it was offensive.  Therefore, I decided to independently translate and voice this interesting film with the help of available tools.  To make, so to speak, a feasible contribution to the dissemination of knowledge among the population.  I thought I would manage quickly - only 45 minutes to master!  But the process took much more time - verbose, on the verge of logorei, read the description of the details under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e76/928/f8b/e76928f8b51bebd18797741362c4594b.jpg">  "

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the following tools were on hand: <br>  - Microsoft Word for translation; <br>  - Sony Sound Forge for reading and sound processing; <br>  - Sony Vegas for the imposition of sound on the video and leveling; <br>  - Package MKVToolNix to create a .MKV file, so that you can put the movie on torrents; <br><br>  Well, the "iron": a condenser microphone with a pop filter, an external sound card and, of course, a computer.  On the mixing console, I have not collapsed. <br><br>  <b>1. Translation</b> .  Since I could not find a subtitle for the film, I had to translate it by ear.  The most convenient thing was to load the film into Sony Vegas, so that there was both a picture and a sound curve before my eyes.  The complete phrases of the announcer are clearly visible on the curve, it is convenient for work.  When writing a translation, I inserted marks into the text for subsequent reading: here it is slow to read, but here it is faster.  Why I did this, I will explain later.  As far as possible, I tried to select Russian-speaking analogues of English proper names.  So the Plate of the Home Plate, for example, became the ‚ÄúMain Base‚Äù - even in passing, I had to correct the Wikipedia article, in which instead of the baseball term for some reason the ‚Äúhome plate‚Äù was used.  In general, the transfer phase took about 8 hours of pure time. <br><br>  <b>2. Nachitka</b> .  The condenser microphone is notable for its irrepressible sensitivity, and I didn‚Äôt do so without an anechoic chamber, so the main problems were room reverberation and background noise.  To minimize the reverberation, I had to speak rather quietly, which is why the voice was sluggish and dull.  To get rid of extraneous noise, I a) went to the dacha, where it was rather quiet in the winter, b) took the microphone away from the computer so that the noise of the cooler was not caught (and I have it noisy).  So the translation had to be recited from the printout, without looking at the screen and without consulting the video sequence.  This is where the ‚Äúslower / faster‚Äù tagging came in handy.  It took about two hours to read, taking into account reservations, numerous re-reads and correcting some points of translation right on the fly. <br><br>  <b>3. Sound processing</b> .  Amateur pseudo recording studio sound quality, of course, does not indulge.  But since the reading was supposed to lie on top of the original audio track, one could not particularly worry about minor bugs and noises - they would hardly be heard anyway.  But just in case, after removing all the failed duplicates, I slightly strangled the background noise using the Noise Reduction function and cut out all the sounds of breathing.  It took another hour and a half. <br><br>  <b>4. Overlaying and mixing sound</b> .  We‚Äôll go back to Sony Vegas and insert the calculated audio track with the reading into the project.  Now you need to cut it into phrases and arrange them in accordance with the original narration of the announcer.  It was necessary to tinker here, because, naturally, somewhere Russian phrases did not fit, but somewhere it was necessary to arrange them quite widely, cutting them in the middle of intonation.  Since the Russian recitation turned out to be monophonic, it was necessary to make sure that the audience could orient themselves - when the announcer speaks, and when one of the participants of the film is given behind the scenes.  To do this, I set up a Russian recipe with a slight delay regarding the original sound, so that the first few moments of English phrases could be heard.  When the translation was completed, I decided to show perfectionism suddenly and play with the sound levels, muffling the original track during Russian reading and taking it up in the intervals between phrases using the Volume Envelope function.  The effect of such information is not very noticeable, but the sound as a whole becomes more pleasant for the ear.  This work is tedious and painstaking, so along with the placement of phrases, this stage took almost 4 hours. <br><br>  <b>5. Creating final files</b> .  To create the MKV, it was enough to calculate the mixed sound in Vegas and add the audio track to the container with the original movie using MKVmerge.  It took quite a bit of time, after which the film was ready to be laid out on Rutreker.  But in addition to torrents, you need to spud online video hosting sites!  Obediently observing copyrights, YouTube refused to post the result of my work, like Vimeo, so RuTube was chosen as the video hosting service.  However, the domestic service does not understand MKV, so I had to re-calculate the entire film, including video and audio tracks, in one of the well-known formats of the MP4 format.  More than an hour, like a bush. <br><br>  So, the translation and dubbing of a 45-minute film from scratch took about 16 hours of pure time.  I have no idea if this is a lot or a little, but I liked it.  The result can be <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4326743">downloaded in HD quality</a> from Rutreker or assessed in SD quality <a href="http://rutube.ru/video/c885dadf626660204c84d61e1a5d6d01/">on RuTube</a> . <br><br>  PS In the comments on Rutreker, many advised me to make donate a chance.  Let's try, what the hell is not joking!  Poison 41001124705139, PayPal / Moneybookers: airstrike@mail.ru.  I did the translation without remuneration, but if you liked my work and you would like to support me modestly, I would be very pleased :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170557/</a></p>
