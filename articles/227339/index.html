  <section class="page js-page"><h1>7 tasks for marketing and management solved in a CRM system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today it is difficult to imagine an effective marketing, divorced from sales, service and information technology.  A manager who dreams of having a holistic view of the company's work and the contribution of each department, in the near future will be able to simplify his life by using the latest tools to automate all business processes (sending, collecting and analyzing data) in a single data system.  The marketer will also be able to build a system of performance indicators and automate routine tasks. <br>  About one such system, its intellectual capabilities, which we use in our experience, I would like to tell colleagues responsible for marketing and sales.  The solution for integrated automation of Internet marketing ClickDimensions is integrated with sales, marketing and service blocks within <a href="http://www.a-practic.ru/services/livecrm/">Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online 2013</a> . <br>  What tasks of a modern marketer are more efficient to perform using ClickDimensions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Create a smart newsletter to inform customers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Any structure and formatting in a convenient editor to choose from <br>  ‚Ä¢ Personalize any fields in a letter from your CRM <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dynamic mailing on any segments <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89f/64e/e13/89f64ee13c34edce9d72752d638d093a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  2. Visual analysis of mailings in reports <br>  ‚Ä¢ A / B testing sales letters <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fc/ac2/01a/9fcac201abba9b92fccd5d0fe0a2b569.jpg"><br>  ‚Ä¢ Infographics of results, a map of clicks and rassharivaniy in social networks <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b21/058/f68/b21058f68a7a56b06a9262c19f0e7332.jpg"><br>  ‚Ä¢ Detailed report on leads, contacts or organizations <br><br>  3. Creation of CRM-related landing pages and feedback forms for the site <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fast structure design <br>  ‚Ä¢ Formatting and design, message after sending <br>  ‚Ä¢ Simple add code to the site <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/696/b2f/9c5696b2fa746069e336c97daf391045.jpg"><br>  4. Surveys and customer surveys, automation of response <br>  The tool is in demand both by the marketing service and various managers for assessing the level of customer service satisfaction, determining the level of loyalty, questioning test groups for new products.  You can quickly create a survey in a convenient editor and download the results to Excel to create analytical reports. <br>  It is possible to contact the contact personally when filling in the Comment field or to customize the response business process under certain conditions.  For example, if it is difficult to call, automatically suggest alternative sources of communication or send the task to the manager to call the specified contact. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6b/dcf/6e7/a6bdcf6e7266f97d94a96e9acf02abf5.jpg"><br><br>  All data on the activities of your potential and current customers fall into the CRM-system and await the decisions of a marketer, a seller, a client relations specialist.  You can assign business processes that create a task to specific managers and display alerts and the results of their execution on the work area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsible employees. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41b/f89/2f2/41bf892f293275112d1b57c137d5fa21.jpg"><br>  5. WEB-analytics of actions of known contacts <br>  ClickDimensions tracks cookies of both your customers and visits of unknown visitors, and allows you to analyze their activity on the site: pages visited, length of stay, keywords, browser, input device.  Directly from the analyst, you can go to the contact card and see his personal activity. <br>  6. Mobile marketing and webinars <br>  Allows you to send personalized SMS messages and see reports on them, as well as connect the service for webinars, statistics on which will also be in CRM. <br>  7. Estimation of the cost and mood of the client, communication with sales and service departments <br>  Ideally, the manager wants to see in his workplace hundreds of emoticons of satisfied customers who bring him profit.  With every dissatisfied staff should work on the basis of data on its cost, rating and understanding of the reasons for his dissatisfaction.  Quickly see the actions taken at the moment to work with complex contacts and make key decisions based on them.  It is possible to customize CRM for your specific tasks, so that the heads of departments will no longer be able to shift their tasks and the reasons for the failures to the neighboring department.  Thus, an understanding of the goals and the current situation will be directly reflected in the sales funnel and various reports collected in a personal presentation on the desktop of the system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30f/cf3/a3f/30fcf3a3ff9fdb0aad5474754571672d.jpg"><br>  In addition, the effectiveness of internal communications is expanding due to the capabilities of the Yammer corporate social network built into CRM, which allows keeping and keeping correspondence of remote employees. <br>  The wide possibilities of integrating additional tools into the CRM system make it possible to solve other marketing tasks.  For example, to build in the SaleSpring contact database is a universal service for finding potential customers and partners in the B2B segment, and for the B2C segment, connect the Microsoft Social Listening system for monitoring social networks. <br>  What is the advantage of ClickDimensions in comparison with various mailing and analytics systems?  It allows: <br>  1. as efficiently as possible to accumulate and use information on clients and calls in one place; <br>  2. unite the efforts of marketing and sales departments to reduce the time of sale and ‚Äúnurturing‚Äù the largest number of leads (contacts) to active and regularly buying customers; <br>  3. Automate company results for management, demonstrating the impact of marketing and the effectiveness of marketing investments.
