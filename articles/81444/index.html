  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Step-by-step, from newbie to happy end from beginner</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day, <br><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/81266/">previous year, there</a> was a rather active discussion about employee motivation.  I thought about what to write for a long time, and now, actually, the topic was born of how to get a novice up to a high grade. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Anyway, career growth is one of the components of employee motivation.  I don‚Äôt think that the lion‚Äôs share of your employees (not all of them, of course) stupidly wants to be developers all their lives, sooner or later a person begins to wonder, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next?‚Äù.  Actually, Habratopic is for almost everyone, for those who have already achieved something, and for those who are just going to achieve or not at all (I strongly hope that Habratopik will reanimate your desire for something new).  But it will be focused on those who are just starting.  Although it will help those who lead, in the steps necessary for training an employee and making a full-fledged member of the team. <br><br>  Managers, in any case, even if you‚Äôre working a little less, remember, you are always a beginner and always learn.

      <br>
      To begin with, what you can achieve in life is all that you achieve and what you get depends <b>only</b> on you.  Even if you have an obstacle in your path, only you can overcome it.  No matter what baggage of experience you have at the moment - everything in life is achievable, it is a fact and try to take it as an axiom. <br><br>  So, you are a young man from 15 to 50 (maybe more) years old.  The fire in the eyes, the thirst for knowledge, hands burn something to write, somewhere to shine with the mind, everything around the guru, but no one understands anything of what you say.  Congratulations - you are a beginner. <br><br>  To begin with, I advise you to find a Learning Based company (or just a small company where you will be taken to learn), where you could learn from the experience of your employees and learn how to work.  For now, just stupid.  Read the literature (all from programming, to fiction), that you will develop memory.  Personally, I re-read the entire library that I have.  These are children's fairy tales, and fantasy, and fantasy, and scientific literature, programming, teaching aids on management and communication, etc.  Believe me, no matter how skeptical you are about this, it will help you.  Of course, it is not at all necessary to be that same pedagogue and fan of computers, it is enough just to read it.  Over time, you will have a library about IT + your favorite genre. <br><br>  In the beginning it is worth learning to learn (tautology, but it is better to say so).  Those.  you need to learn to look for information and assimilate it.  If you have questions that you cannot solve yourself, then try to find at least something to come to the manager or a colleague and ask the question correctly.  I will give you a guarantee that the prepared question will cause more respect than stupidly to say "I can't, I can't find it, tell me how."  Over time, you will learn to look for information where it was not before.  And you can help your budding colleagues yourself.  Also, do not be afraid to try to write your product on the basis of the finished one that you write in the company.  Do not be afraid to peep.  This will help you navigate the code already written by another person.  But try to come up with your own variants of code.  Do not be afraid to completely rewrite everything, even if no one sees it, but you will gain experience.  And in principle, do not be afraid of anything - you are a beginner and you get away with a lot. <br><br>  In my opinion, you should not linger in the company where you studied, especially if you feel that we have reached the ceiling set by this company or you feel bored by the lack of growth and further development.  A year (maximum two) is quite normal to learn at least something.  It's time to move to the next company.  To another job, to another direction. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to dramatically change the technology and the direction of programming in the next company - this will help in the future to quickly navigate in someone else's code and completely new technologies. <br><br>  So, we were engaged in the writing of some sites, proceeded to the writing of others :).  Not scary.  The main thing changed the type of products.  Personally, I did this, wrote a resume, put in everything that was possible, even basic (of course I signed that knowledge was superficial) and sent a resume.  During the interview, he intentionally went to the interns.  Why?  Yes, because when training in a previous company, someone must have missed something and we should study everything again.  Well, + each company has nuances in the requirements and the new company will help you quickly adapt to any conditions in the future.  If it turned out that you already learned and understood everything, then it is also not scary.  If you immediately reclaimed yourself right away, then you have a chance to go to your grade after the test (even if the boss is ‚Äúbad‚Äù, then you can achieve the right thing vseravno).  Just remember that the company has its own rules and laws.  Big mistake of many to try to adjust the system for themselves.  If you are such, then either look for a company for you, or try to find more points of contact with the current (especially if you value the work). <br><br>  And by the way, whatever your profession is, you are a seller anyway.  You are the seller of the service - writing / maintaining the code.  It is a pity, personally, I realized it quite late.  But during the interview it is necessary, watching the interlocutors, to offer your price for your work, i.e.  for how much you agree to sell your labor.  It is not necessary to go too far; one way or another, the company has a budget for the employee being received, and if you say: ‚ÄúI want a cottage, a car and a hundred thousand mulens‚Äù, they will laugh of course, but they will forget about you. <br><br>  When I started, it was not money that was important to me, but knowledge.  By the way, I still hate the question: ‚Äúhow much would you like to receive?‚Äù.  I want a lot, but what I say is a problem.  But it is - thinking in the ear. <br><br>  Vobschem you took, let the department be 10 people.  A lot, but enough.  If more, good too.  But remember, the more people in your department, the more difficult it will be to develop, if of course you do not have your own microcommand in a person 3-5.  In any case, if you can swim, then set yourself a plus. <br><br>  Immediately you need to tune in not to stupidity, but to work.  You have come to receive invaluable knowledge and experience.  Entertainment should be left for later, the main thing here is to enter the team and become your own "in the board."  And try to become indispensable. <br>  Immediately warn.  Some novice employees mistakenly think that becoming indispensable is when you are not at work (you drink tea) and you will be looked for.  Indispensable - this is when the head will clutch at the head, if you decide to get sick or go on vacation. <br><br>  <i>In one of the firms we had such problems.</i>  <i>There were really irreplaceable people, when they went on vacation, the project was stopped, because there was no one to do it - there was not enough experience.</i> <br><br>  In general, from a year to two is to work and get the maximum.  The main thought is that you are going up your career not for the sake of your career, but for the sake of experience and the work you really want to do.  Therefore, it is sometimes worthwhile to say your fi, if you are said to be disdainful in the back, "Careerist."  But sometimes it‚Äôs worth thinking about the words, maybe you don‚Äôt notice that you really turned into someone working for a career. <br><br>  Also at this stage, I advise you to start slowly acquiring budding acquaintances.  It will be extremely useful to try to help someone with a difficult dilemma in programming. <br><br>  At one time at this stage, I began to do my projects aimed at understanding and administering Linux.  Helped admin sites, server.  There is always something to learn (see above). <br><br>  Anyway, you have achieved something and feel that you already know everything and everyday tasks have become a routine that you solve quickly, confidently and in a short time.  Level complete.  <i>Of course, if everything suits you, then you can stay.</i> <br><br>  In general, if everything is so sad, then it's time, friend, to look for a new job.  Even if you worked in an offshore, then vseravno you should have time to solve a fairly large range of tasks in two years.  And, I'm afraid, the firm will not offer you anything new.  There are of course exceptions, but they are rare. <br><br>  At this stage, it is worth thinking about what you want to do, if the goal for which you went into fire and water for 3 years (approximately) has not been lost.  We start looking for a job with a bias in your interest. <br><br>  <i>I once had a dream.</i>  <i>Work at CryTech.</i>  <i>I have a good knowledge base. I somehow found their specialty in vacancies.</i>  <i>I wrote, called, talked, wrote to them, they invited Frankfurt to an interview.</i>  <i>Sat down, thought.</i>  <i>I understood that it was a ‚Äúchildhood dream‚Äù, and a childhood dream should remain a dream (maybe I was a fool that I did not agree, but I do not regret it) ...</i> <br><br>  So what am I talking about.  Immediately go to the dream is not worth it - you risk being disappointed.  And so - casually worth a try.  If you like it, you can continue to move in the chosen direction.  We go to interviews, we offer ourselves for money :) We arrange.  "Feel" the work to the touch - rejoice or disappoint. <br><br>  Well now you are already an expert, you are not called a coder.  Respectfully communicate and listen to what you say.  Few people doubt those ideas on technology and solutions.  Congratulations, you are a developer. <br><br>  What is the difference between a developer and what you were in the beginning?  A developer is a developer, i.e.  You can already develop systems, platforms, features.  You can find, albeit with little effort, solutions to complex problems.  Well, all you have to do is develop what you have invented, accompany, work on it.  Well?  Garbage turned out?  Not scary - you are a developer.  Look for solutions to your problems and decide, now you can. <br><br>  <i>I myself had the experience, I wrote a good server application, designed for terrible loads.</i>  <i>When changing iron to a more powerful one, it turned out that the speed did not increase.</i>  <i>So I caught shoals, wrote crutches.</i>  <i>As a result, he spat and, taking into account all the crutches and plans for future workloads and future changes, wrote a new application.</i>  <i>And no longer on what he knew, but on what was better suited to solve the problem.</i>  <i>At the moment I am doing experiments in the symbiosis of my code and C ++ or Java.</i> <br><br>  And at this moment I finally broke up with the illness of many - PC games.  I want to say that they do not interfere with the programmer, on the contrary, you begin to think that some parts would be different.  They did it crookedly, they did not finish it.  It is useful, especially when compared with their shoals (where without them).  In general for myself, I found a new kind of games.  It turned out to be much more useful to play in solving unsolvable problems and questions.  In general, the meaning is as follows.  I am writing a product, I see that the framework does not have something that was in another (more imperfect) framework.  Or it is necessary to solve a non-trivial question on replication, such as how to make all databases main and make them correct, and how you want to synchronize, and also quickly :).  In general, somewhere it turns out, somewhere not (again, experience - lack). <br><br>  In general, you at this stage should try to learn how to find solutions to problems WITHOUT visible efforts.  And the most important thing is to learn how to justify and explain these decisions.  Be sure, it is difficult for everyone to understand you, even if they do not understand anything in your technologies. <br><br>  I first try to explain to my wife, she is far from IT, if she understood, then everyone will understand. <br><br>  In general, almost everything you can write in Kratz.  If you write deployed, then not everyone will write the written.  But the scheme is suitable for any initial step, because, there is always something to learn and there is no limit to growth, because you can be the boss in the team, and you can be the boss of the teams. <br><br>  I want to say one thing.  Whatever the firm was, in this firm there is a certain set of rules and laws.  For example, you can get the next level in N months.  Breaking laws is not worth it, especially if you have no arguments for this (In this case, argumentation is provable, painless for the company, supported by your actions or thoughts).  I did not accidentally give a hint about the exception.  Breaking is not worth it, but if you have a Wishlist, then you should talk about it, and you need to confirm your Wishlist with arguments.  For the desire on the head will not give, and if there is an opportunity your Wishlist to implement, then you have all the chances. <br><br>  For managers already and not only: this scheme is partially suitable for choosing the direction of personnel training, and not only in IT. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81444/</a></p>
