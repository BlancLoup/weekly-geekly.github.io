Some of you asked me whether you need to sacrifice everything for the sake of business - I will answer that no, not necessary.  Today I would like to talk to you about success.  I had several successes in my life;  The last experience I received when opening a tea company taught me more than any previous one. <br><br><h3>  Some things just can't be early. </h3><br>  One of the things that fascinates me most about a cup of tea is that you cannot speed it up. <br><br>  If the instructions say that tea must be brewed for 5 minutes, you will have to wait until it is brewed - there is no physical way (perhaps for now) to brew it quickly.  This serves as a wonderful reminder that some events in our lives, from which we expect excellent results, require a little patience.  If you wait for tea to brew, you can simply enjoy it (in this case, bursting cookies for tea and chatting with friends).

      Success is like ... Sometimes we ourselves and our creations need a little time to unfold, so instead of struggling, enjoy the process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Pour tea properly to avoid trouble. </h3><br>  I love old fancy teapots with big fancy noses.  I have one.  But, did you notice how easy it is to spill their contents?  If you pour too fast, hot tea spurts out of the spout and can easily spill over the cup.  If you pour too slowly, the tea flows too thinly.  The only way to get the right amount of tea without spilling it is to choose the right angle of inclination of the kettle. <br><br>  Success is like ... Sometimes delay leads to loss of opportunities, and haste - to trouble.  Finding the right rhythm is the key to success, and requires some experience. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities can cool off, but sometimes there is a second chance. </h3><br>  Anyone who drank tea knows that cold tea which has stood for some time has an unpleasant taste.  The taste of tea can always be restored, for this it is necessary only to empty the cup and brew tea again. <br><br>  I think that the opportunities can also cool and stagnate, so it is very important to use them as quickly as possible after a thorough assessment.  You never know which of the lost opportunities will come up again.  I would like to believe that some of them, really meant for you, will find their way back. <br><br><h3>  For the best sales there is nothing more important trifles </h3><br>  You can drink a cup of simple unremarkable tea, but the most popular teas (English Breakfast or Earl Gray, for example), to create the perfect aroma, are always blended from several varieties. <br><br>  There is an infinite number of tea blends, from the simplest to the most absurd.  To create a bestseller, you need not only high-quality ingredients, but knowledge about how to mix them better, a little more than one, a little less than the other, and maybe try to add a pinch of the third. <br><br>  Success is like ... It requires good components and the skill of connecting them together in the best possible way. <br><br><h3>  You need to know what you want. </h3><br>  The world of tea is quite extensive.  Tea can be hot or icy, exciting or soothing.  It can be a healing herbal or spicy mixture.  It seems that tea can be anything, but it becomes especially relevant only when you realize what you want from it.  Want caffeine-free, soothing evening tea?  Take herbal.  Would you like an invigorating morning drink?  Earl gray is the best choice.  Peach iced tea is perfect for summer evenings on the veranda. <br><br>  Success is like ... Yes, you can try to combine the incompatible - but when you know how success looks and feel it, it is a little easier to find what you are looking for. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285934/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285934/</a></p>
