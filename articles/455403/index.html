  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From five cents to the game of deities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day. <br><br>  In my last article, I touched upon the topic of tabletop role-playing contests, which, like all kinds of indie jams for software developers, help concepts and sketches to develop into something more.  This time I‚Äôll tell you about the history of my other competition project. <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/3f/mj/af3fmjzrkgf9iv7eubxigdwvhgk.jpeg"></div><br>  Board-role contests I came across as our domestic (called "Cooks"), and international (annual Game Chef).  At the international level, as a rule, it was necessary to come up with some kind of new mini-system of rules, and not only systems, but also adventure modules for existing systems were submitted to the Cooks.  Another international competition tried to set certain trends and experiment - that year another theme of Game Chef was the search for new desktop role-playing formats: ‚Äúthe absence of a rule book‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And here are the conditions: <br><blockquote>  This year's theme: BOOKS DO NOT EXIST <br><br>  Board role-playing games for a long time were limited to one format - the format of the book of rules.  But in recent years, this standard has begun to change: there are more short games;  games built on card mechanics or on the basis of small brochures.  This year, as part of Game Chef, we suggest you develop this trend.  What if the game has no uniform rules, no single base text?  How then does the player learn the rules of the game?  Is it possible to create a board game without a single set of rules?  Maybe the game will take on new forms?  Or maybe there will be new solutions to old problems?

      Get inspired by this theme, let it change your game in the process.  Interpret it in any way possible.  It is likely that your vision will differ significantly from the options offered by other participants.  We gave the topic some explanation, but you are free to interpret it in your own way. <br><br>  Four ingredients this year: absorb, wild, shine, sickle </blockquote><br><br>  I will clarify that the words-ingredients should have been somehow reflected in the competitive work (at least two of the four words). <br><br>  The topic seemed interesting to me, because I already specialize in experimental systems.  At first, I was going to take the mechanics out of my already finished game about space that I wanted to ‚Äúdrop from heaven to earth,‚Äù that is, create worlds not only on cosmic expanses, but try to settle down on some kind of limited map and adapt the rules to it.  But there was not much time left for the work, and I also wanted to implement that idea in the form of a standard rule book.  Therefore, I began to think in the direction of something else, better than the corresponding topic of the competition. <br><br>  Here I was visited by various thoughts about proposing some kind of superstructure over some well-known rules.  Well, you know, for example, they still know what kind of traffic light you can go to and what you need to stop at.  Maybe build the rules around the use of a device (as I did in the last contest, using a calculator), books or some other thing. <br><br>  So there were ideas about the use of penny coins and images.  I also thought to involve, say, a newspaper.  But I thought they were not very common. <br><br>  With the form, I decided to take a risk and submit the rules in an implicit form, through one big example of the game, as ‚Äúoverheard‚Äù pieces of information are formed in a certain pattern of each observer.  The best embodiment of my idea would be to make a video or record a podcast, but then there was no such opportunity and skills.  In addition, for this case would still be necessary basis, the script.  And so the unexpected decision came - a mini-play.  Thus, the final result was a simple text.  As forum topic, comment, transcript, record. <br><br>  That's what eventually happened: <br><br><h3>  Gatekeepers, or Shishkin will not </h3><br>  Role-playing thought in five cycles <br><br><blockquote> <b>Characters</b> <br><br>  <b>Liza.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Arkhip Ivanovich.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Aivazovsky.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Salvador.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Shishkin.</b> <br><br>  TACT 1 <br><br>  <i>The action takes place in the apartment Aivazovsky.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Spacious room, clean dining table, on which lie two reproductions and a handful of coins.</i>  <i>Near two leather chairs and three stools.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>There are two in the room, one in the chair, the other is at the table.</i>  <i>Flash frames on the included television panel.</i>  <i>In the windows - sunset.</i> <br><br>  <i>Aivazovsky, Salvador (chatting).</i> <br><br>  Salvador.  How can you even watch it?  I do not understand. <br>  Aivazovsky (thoughtfully).  Normal movie. <br>  Salvador.  Then you look, one.  (Takes a couple of steps.) When will the rest be? <br>  Aivazovsky.  Already have to.  I will call now. <br>  Salvador.  So wait.  You tell me the rules yet. <br>  Aivazovsky (reluctantly turns off the TV).  Yes there are no rules.  (Looking closely at Salvador.) Imagine, there are no rules at all!  (Makes a hand gesture.) Quite! <br>  Salvador.  Are you kidding me now, huh?  How to play something? <br>  Aivazovsky.  You will see. <br><br>  <i>Clicks the lock.</i>  <i>Liza and Arkhip Ivanovich appear at the door.</i> <br><br>  Salvador.  Here you go.  Less than a year, as Arkhip Ivanovich granted! <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (grumblingly).  I am the same Ivanovich, as you - Salvador.  (Sighs. Greetings with Salvador. He makes a reproachful look.) So while waiting, we could have brewed tea. <br>  Salvador (deadpan).  Nothing, you have time with your tea.  (Aivazovsky.) Well, that's all, everything?  And Shishkin? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Shishkin will not. <br>  Liza.  How it will not Shishkin?  (Nods to the crowd.) Hi. <br>  Aivazovsky (looks at his watch).  Yes, he will.  Later.  (Turning to the new arrivals.) Pictures brought? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes.  Here it is.  (Pulls out a reproduction, puts it on the table.) <br>  Aivazovsky (looking at Lisa).  You? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  And she is.  Well, it's Lisa! <br>  Liza.  Wait a minute.  Arkhip Ivanovich said that I did not need. <br>  Aivazovsky.  Oh, yes, I forgot completely. <br>  Salvador.  I do not understand something, that is, you can play without a picture? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  No, we are just Gatekeepers, and Liza is like a guest in our worlds. <br>  Lisa (thoughtfully).  Are they Gatekeepers or Gatekeepers? <br>  Salvador.  Is the Gatekeeper not comfortable with you? <br>  Liza.  We must somehow call you. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Lizok, do not be stupid.  I am Arkhip Ivanovich.  (He points to Aivazovsky.) This is Aivazovsky.  (He looks at Salvador, remembering something.) Well, yes, I do not know.  You better not go to his world at all.  (Smiles.) And then the clock will melt or some other trouble.  In short, the chores are solid. <br>  Lisa (displeased).  It is now.  So the pictures could be without authors. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  There is no picture without the author. <br>  Salvador (Arkhip Ivanovich).  Do you have something against the world of soft watches? <br>  Lisa (enthusiastically).  Oh my God, the World of Soft Watches? <br>  Aivazovsky.  Yes!  Watch it.  (He takes one of the reproductions in his hands, showing it to Lisa.) <br>  Lisa (looking at the picture).  Oh, right.  I remember. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Everyone saw it, nothing interesting.  Here I have the World of Lunar Night! <br>  Aivazovsky.  And I just.  The ninth world. <br>  Salvador.  Ninth world?  Somewhere I have already heard. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  And then Shishkin?  World of bears? <br><br>  <i>Laugh.</i> <br><br>  TACT 2 <br><br>  <i>It's been 20 minutes.</i>  <i>Same there.</i> <br><br>  Aivazovsky.  Everything, we play.  I am the first. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Go, go.  Present already. <br>  Aivazovsky.  It means so.  (Gathering with thoughts.) This Gate led to the colorful Ninth World, where waves crash against rocks and seagulls circling high in the sunset sky, mourning for the dead ships.  The boundless sea keeps the same number of secrets and secrets ... <br>  Lisa (interrupts).  And how many ships have already sunk? <br>  Aivazovsky.  So far, only one.  Last time played.  (Thinks for a few moments.) In short, such a little world. <br>  Salvador.  Well now I am.  Just tell, yes? <br>  Aivazovsky.  Wait, I'll create an underwater monster. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Cthulhu? <br>  Aivazovsky.  Yes, let it be Cthulhu.  (Takes a five-kopeck coin.) <br>  Liza.  Cthulhu?  Who is this? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  No matter, he will still sleep.  (To Aivazovsky.) I hope he will sleep? <br>  Salvador (Lisa).  Chthonic monster absorbs brains.  Have you not read Lovecraft? <br>  Liza.  No ... And I'm not going to, it seems. <br>  Aivazovsky.  Yes, he will sleep.  (Circling those present with a sly look.) For a while. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Well, thank God.  Only you take a ten-kopeck, it is too big for a simple creature. <br>  Aivazovsky (laughs).  That is, Cthulhu with us will be held as a location? <br>  Salvador.  Cho you muddy there? <br>  Aivazovsky (changes coin).  Well, five kopecks is a hero, and ten is a place.  (Sighs.) Now ten moves will be built. <br>  Liza.  And one penny? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  For one - the subject. <br>  Liza.  A, clear.  (Salvador'u).  How is the World of Soft Watches? <br>  Salvador.  Now, you see Aivazovsky monsters deduces. <br>  Aivazovsky.  So I am everything. <br>  Salvador.  Well listen ... <br><br>  TACT 3 <br><br>  <i>An hour has passed.</i>  <i>The same and Shishkin.</i> <br><br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (Shishkin).  And I thought you would not come today. <br>  Shishkin.  Well, you must go and see the ghouls.  To control. <br>  Liza.  In short, I want a raft! <br>  Aivazovsky.  Is it an item or a place? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (caustically).  Or maybe he is reasonable?  Then a creature. <br>  Liza.  You're scaring me.  Normal raft.  (Lost in thought.) Although not, the usual will drown here.  Antigravity! <br>  Salvador (puts a penny on the picture of Aivazovsky).  You write it down, write it down.  Raft. <br>  Aivazovsky.  Hey, what are you doing here for me? <br>  Salvador (Lisa).  Look, he doesn't like it.  Better in my world build. <br>  Shishkin (Aivazovsky).  What are you not happy with the raft? <br>  Aivazovsky (Shishkin).  Antigravity! <br>  Liza.  And what is not according to the rules? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  That's the point, there are no rules. <br>  Shishkin.  Well, technically they are.  Just in free form.  There are the conditions themselves: drawings, coins, time of construction.  Plus more wild rules. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (skeptical).  Oh, come on.  In fact, there are no rules. <br>  Shishkin.  And the wild? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  These are not rules. <br>  Salvador (impatiently).  Well, you will go there, will you?  Lisa ordered a raft. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Pancake.  We didn‚Äôt do that. <br>  Shishkin (smiling.) What a tea, three in the morning! <br>  Aivazovsky.  Actually, half past ten.  (Inspects the crowd.) Stop for tea? <br>  Shishkin.  Well, let's. <br><br>  <i>Get up.</i>  <i>Go to the kitchen.</i> <br><br>  Salvador (Shishkinu).  And how is your picture called? <br>  Shishkin.  World?  Uh ... Forest! <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (sarcastically).  And not the world of the morning?  Isn't Peace Pines? <br>  Lisa (picking up).  World of bears? <br>  Aivazovsky.  I know the World of the Chests! <br><br>  <i>Laugh.</i> <br><br>  Shishkin (rolling his eyes).  Damn, how you zadolbali. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes, we have not even started. <br><br>  TACT 4 <br><br>  <i>In ten minutes.</i>  <i>After tea drinking.</i>  <i>Same there.</i> <br><br>  Shishkin (ending the description).  Actually this is such a fabulous meadow in the forest. <br>  Salvador.  With bears! <br>  Liza.  And with cones! <br>  Shishkin (with irony).  Yes, in general!  Tin full. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (businesslike).  What are you building? <br>  Shishkin.  Wings.  Bears <br>  Liza.  Why bears with wings? <br>  Shishkin (wearily).  Why why.  Fly away from you!  (Thinks.) But no, we‚Äôll make a better hero, a warlock. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Again warlock?  Why in the forest? <br>  Shishkin (Arkhip Ivanovich).  Not again, but again.  Give me a coin.  (Looking at the rest.) Who is there next? <br>  Aivazovsky.  I. Then there will be Salvador, then Arkhip Ivanovich. <br>  Liza.  Then I. <br>  Shishkin (Liza).  What world are you building in? <br>  Liza.  Have Aivazovsky for now.  Raft, pirate and lock-balloon. <br>  Shishkin.  Great! <br>  Liza.  But there is a restless sea and the pirate wants to dump somewhere. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  I create a castle on the bank of the river.  Or a pirate ship.  Frigate! <br>  Liza.  No, you are gloomy.  And I wanted to specifically transfer this pirate. <br>  Shishkin.  We have not done it yet, but you yourself can create a Wild rule. <br>  Liza.  So I did not understand how to do them. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes, he did not eat, we still have only Sickle Occam and a guest. <br>  Salvador.  So, in more detail this moment. <br>  Shishkin (sighing).  Well Serp I added. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes, we cut out Cthulhu to them today, by the way.  Just in case. <br>  Aivazovsky.  Did he bother you? <br>  Salvador.  Oh, that was it.  Clear. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes.  (To Shishkin.) How does the rule sound exactly there? <br>  Shishkin (reads).  Sickle Occam.  Appears in the universe every ten turns, no matter whose, and goes to that ... (Interrupts reading.) In short, who has the first building completed, he gets a Sickle, and can bang something extra anyone. <br>  Aivazovsky (Arkhip Ivanovich).  Here it is just over the course will appear again, and I will cut your tower of black magicians. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (in protest).  But I need it, it is not superfluous! <br>  Liza.  Actually, I will get a Sickle, my castle will be just completed. <br>  Aivazovsky (winking at Salvador).  Oh, not a fact. <br>  Liza.  Well, no shit, something to do.  I was against it! <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (Shishkin).  Ah, yes, Aivazovsky, another Wild rule added.  You can mess when you have something weighty built. <br>  Aivazovsky.  Yeah, then slow down any building for one turn.  In short so much harm on the little things. <br>  Liza.  And the guest is what? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  And it's you.  I added that the player could not have his own Gate and build where you want. <br>  Liza.  Well shine!  I was going to take my picture. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yeah.  Do you know what she wanted?  Portrait!  (Lisa.) How do you imagine this, tell about the world through a portrait? <br>  Liza.  Normally imagine, take and describe.  (Tired.) Okay.  We drove. <br>  Shishkin.  Let's add a rule that it is possible to build portals between the Gateways.  If both Guardians agree. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Stop, you can't add yet.  You already have a Sickle. <br>  Shishkin.  Yes, I tell Lisa.  Well, by the way, I can cancel my own. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  By voting? <br>  Shishkin.  Through voting, only new ones, and old ones simply by personal desire. <br>  Liza (looking hard at Aivazovsky).  It would be better to cancel it. <br>  Salvador.  That is, we add with Liza according to the rule and everything? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  No, then everyone will have one at a time and you can add new ones. <br>  Aivazovsky.  In short, we are returning to the Ninth World.  (Lisa.) As your pirate flew the Plywood, the weather changed.  Thunderclouds appear on the horizon, a storm is coming.  (With pathos.) The Elf King frowns and gives the order to dive, with a wave of his hand.  A minute later, the elf submarine closes with flickering power shields and hides under water. <br>  Liza.  Well, now the storm is coming. <br>  Shishkin.  Nothing, you will take cover in the air castle. <br>  Aivazovsky (businesslike).  Well well.  The island in three turns will be, an underwater cave in seven.  I will replenish the team for now.  I will order an elf in red. <br>  Salvador.  Blonde? <br>  Aivazovsky.  Of course! <br>  Salvador.  In the meantime, a clockwork dinosaur was added to the Soft Watches, and ... (Looking meaningfully at Aivazovsky.) I get a Sickle! <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich (reproachfully).  Rays of hate you get. <br>  Aivazovsky.  No, Liza's Sickle appears. <br>  Salvador.  Oh yes.  (Liza.) Then just lock your lock ... <br>  Lisa (indignant).  Radish! <br><br>  TACT 5 <br><br>  <i>In one day.</i>  <i>Phone conversation.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Shishkin and Arkhip Ivanovich (discuss the latest events).</i> <br><br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  You know, I would redo it.  I would write normal rules so that I don‚Äôt think of it every time.  (Pause.) Well, look, you have Sickle Occam - to do something similar for each philosopher. <br>  Shishkin.  So again everything was in vain? <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Well, not that in vain.  The thought itself is good, you just need to arrange the game normally. <br>  Shishkin.  Yes, I was thinking about how to do the standard.  But.  (Pause.) But then Shishkin would not be there.  Do you understand?  And the point is that everyone himself thinks out the mechanism. <br>  Arkhip Ivanovich.  Yes Yes.  The concept of a game that does not exist in the form of a set of rules ... it is stoned somehow, difficult.  (Pause.) Well, that's okay, in principle.  Lisa here you know what offered ... <br><br>  The end? <br></blockquote><h3>  Reviews </h3><br>  In addition to delivering their own games, all participants were asked to write small reviews on 4 games from other participants, and also to choose one of them, the most worthy.  Thus, my Gatekeepers also received some feedback from other authors, here they are: <br><blockquote>  <b>Review ‚Ññ1</b> <br><br>  Very interesting story with entertaining characters, but it is completely incomprehensible how and what they are trying to play.  Ingredients are mentioned, although the same Sickle is dragged by the ears to Occam's razor.  In general, an interesting essay, but this is not a game.  I would love to read this author, but I cannot vote for this work. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Review ‚Ññ2</b> <br><br>  Review of the play Gatekeepers <br><br>  I must say at once that the form of the presentation of the material in this work is simply beautiful.  However, this is not surprising, given that its author is also the creator of the enchanting system and, first of all, a collection of incredible settings - twisted terra.  The matter is not even in the unusual presentation of the material, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãacquainting the reader with the necessary factual material, frankly speaking, is not new, but the style of the work brings to mind the fantasy of those times when it was still warm and lamp. <br><br>  Alas, the form of filing, apparently, was the cause of the weak points of this work.  Despite the fact that the characters acting in the work explain to the novice the rules of the game for which everyone has gathered, but the main phrases, apparently, are either spoken off-screen, or are only implied. <br><br>  Given that the game described is more like a board strategy than a classic role-playing strategy, the text does not show the details that are quite important for this class.  So, the purpose of the game is casually mentioned - to tell about the world.  Based on what is happening in the play, it can be assumed that the story should consist of the creation and buildings in the world of new elements.  But it is not indicated either when the game is considered finished, how the winner is determined, or even what to do with the created entities.  Coins are used to create and build, which are also the counters of resources and the measure of time needed to create.  The decision is so logical and beautiful that after reading about it you are surprised that everyone around does not do that.  Alas, this mechanic is also damp - it is not clear where, for what, and in what quantity the players get coins, can they be exchanged and, conversely, summed up. <br><br>  If you decide that the game is still role-playing and you don‚Äôt have to win it, the picture still turns out to be rather strange.  In the text, one of the players proposes to introduce an additional rule, introducing portals connecting the disparate worlds.  Perhaps this would really not be superfluous, since it seems that at the time the game described in the play consists of several monologues in which everyone talks about his creation, occasionally harming the rest of the little things.  By the way, about additional rules.  The core of the rules implies the introduction of additional rules of this game during the game.  Again, an excellent solution, and a very ingenious approach to the theme of the competition - the rule book really does not exist, because the game is created anew each time.  But in this case, it turns out that most of the gameplay shown to us is a private situation, characteristic of a single party, and not related to the game itself. <br><br>  From all the above, I would draw the following conclusion: Gatekeepers cannot be played in the form in which it is presented.  Actually, the play does not describe the game, but the mechanic set.  By the way, the players themselves also understand this, this can be understood from the resonant speech of Arkhip Ivanovich.  However, the mechanics used are listed in the same place: <br><br>  ‚ÄúShishkin.  Well, technically they are.  Just in free form.  There are the conditions themselves: drawings, coins, time of construction.  Plus more wild rules. ‚Äù <br><br>  By the way, from the given constants only pictures came to me as perplexed.  It seemed to me a rather strange idea to create the world from an image already created by someone.  Undoubtedly, the drawings can help a lot, trigger fantasy, give associations, and finally build a single figurative line.  But the loan is limited to one work, and even bring it to the game in advance.  Perhaps this detail would make sense to make the random component of the Gatekeeper. <br><br>  And finally, on the formal side of the issue.  As I said, the author dealt with the main theme brilliantly.  I also want to be able to.  But the ingredients did not receive much development.  I could see only the Sickle in the form of one of the optional rules, and the Radiance in the entourage of one of the given worlds.  But, again, as already mentioned, the text of the play is written in excellent language, contains a number of allusions and Easter eggs, and is generally pleasant to read.  Describing Cthulhu as locations is generally a delight.  I really hope one day to see the new gatekeepers along with the murshambola and twisted terra. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <b>Review ‚Ññ3</b> <br><br>  Somehow Shishkin, Dali, Aivazovsky, Mona Lisa and Kuinji gathered together, and a conversation came out.  The conversation stretched across several pages, it was all spiced up with unsuccessful attempts at joking and strange gestures.  "Artistic images, as if alive, stood before my eyes, revealing like the sky over Berlin or the skeletons of the Dresden cathedrals after the bombing."  I would like to write such a phrase about this game, but no.  Artists gathered, talked about something, about Cthulhu, sickle (it‚Äôs not clear where it came from) and so on.  Bacchanalia reminded me of the movie ‚ÄúGreen Elephant‚Äù, and wanted to rush into this meeting and shout: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?  What Cthulhu, what pictures ?!  What are you, gone? ".  Honestly, we did not understand anything from the game.  All this looks like an art-house film: too many unnecessary pompous words that are perfectly perceived separately, but do not add up to a single sentence.  Verdict: complete zero, we did not even understand how to play it.  Keywords are not used properly, but the topic is fully disclosed: there is no book.  Nothing at all. </blockquote><blockquote>  <b>Review ‚Ññ4</b> <br><br>  Age markings rule <br><br>  The coolest thing about this job is the pitch.  Statement of the rules in the form of a game session description seems to me brutally abrupt move.  The module as a way to design the game is really great.  You can show the author's vision of the relevance of the application and interpretation of the rules, to convey the way of the game.  Recreating dialogues and questions will fit what is in the air in your company when you develop it. <br><br>  The good news ends there.  For an adult, the proposed design is not a game.  It is possible to play this game with pleasure at the age of 4 - 5. An adult can play this game with a child.    -  ‚Äî  .      .      .    ‚Äî   ,          ,        ‚Äî  .            ,    ,      -          .    . <br><br>      ,    .  , ,     ,  .            ,    ,    ,  ,       .  ,            .  ,                .    . </blockquote><br><h3> ,     </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As time went on, the concept of a game about divine creatures was slowly cooking in my head, until one day the experience of playing a desktop Smallworld was added to the pantheon of divine simulators that influenced me (Populous, Black &amp; White). And then I finally had a puzzle that my game with the gods would be built around the advanced mechanics of the Gatekeepers, from where I would take the economy of a sacred resource (manipulation with coins of faith). Thus, the heroes of the play play a kind of prototype of the future "Almighty", exchanging impressions similar to what happened in the end.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And it turned out something like a "role-playing Monopoly", where players play the role of deities, controlling certain territories on the map and throw dice every move, moving the chip along the path of fate. Different effects occur in different sectors. You can collect coins of faith from sectors, or pay with these coins to create something, returning them to the track. At the same time, the game is focused on creativity, although I also added some final goals. And one more of the deities can play out and turn into a science, if conditions develop - then the gameplay for him will change.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I noted from test games, the main thing is not to hurry with one's own course and treats what is happening as a desktop role-playing game, and not the usual board game. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, you need to tune in to the imaginary world and the situations in it taking place, invent and describe the events taking place, and not just throw the dice and collect coins. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can look at the rule book here: </font></font><br><br> <a href="https://twistedterra.github.io/Almighty.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ALL-MIGHTING</font></font></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/tt/nm/j-ttnmz8p7jlg6k30ndp1bmobpi.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> However, the rules are rules, and, as they say, it's better to see it once. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So below I will describe how one of the playtests of the game, which I spent in one of the clubs in my city, took place.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Report on the role-playing game about the joint creation of a new world </font></font></h3><br><blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, young deities gain strength in the vastness of the primeval continent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They build faith and lead their people into the future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Armed with a hex dice and coins of faith.</font></font></blockquote><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our test game was attended by five participants (this is a game without a lead, so I also acted as a player) and the following deities and races were represented: </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Hiddenweiss</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the patron of the high mountain peaks of Wrynn - the god of multicolored dragons </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mordkaizer</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , the patron of the dark swampy Lanfa - the god who commands hordes </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Prontos</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> undead </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(aka White Wanderer), desert patron Kavarro - god guarding the white clay </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">golems Myrtyn</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , patron of the mysterious Kapona - god watching over werewolf people </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I played for </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reformax</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">the patron saint of Ventron covered with forests, in whose territory the race of trans-ports dwelled ‚Äî creatures made of stone and red energy, which cannot walk but are able to teleport for short distances. Over the forest stood the residence of my deity - a large portal in which red energy circulated. Of the other residences, I remember the long tower, full of books, hanging in the middle of the desert of the god Prontos, as well as a citadel of stone and huge bones near Mordekaiser. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The game system has four types of deities: Emitter, Battery, Transformer and Devourer. Each type has its own behavior and nuances of game mechanics. Preparing for the game, I printed out memos for each type of deity, so that everyone has information at hand.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oj/zr/jw/ojzrjwfdtyrctrq_p2j2tjvkzpq.jpeg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The types of deities were distributed as follows: Mordekaiser chose the path of the night devout-deity, Hiddenweiz chose to be the Transformer-Enlightener, Prontos went into Batteries, and Myrtyne became the day-time Deity Emitter. I chose a random type of my Reform, it turned out to be another Battery - a deity that focuses on material values.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, it turned out pretty fun game, full of unexpected events. We saw how one of the golems was swallowed by a sandworm and it was able to get out of the monster outside. Saw how the skeletons asked their master to make them even more dead. We saw the battle of two dragons, as well as the dragon's prayer to the god of werewolves, so that he would give her the opportunity to give birth. Golems dug up in the desert a huge cyborg. One of the werewolves hovered between the forms during the transformation. Trans-ports built a symbolic wooden bridge into the desert, as a sign of friendship with its inhabitants. A golem praying to the god of werewolves could turn into a man. Two trans-ports were accidentally stuck in one point of space and were merged into one new creature. A squadron of dragons hunted monstrous fish in the world's oceans.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the game, Hiddenways, following the prescribed character of the Transformer God, read awesome advice from his notebook, responding to the requests of believers (instead of creating miracles themselves, of course, as was supposed to be a Transformer god, who used to help more often with words than with deeds) - this was very cool and fun (although a person saw this game for the first time in his life, but he was very good at improvising, having come up with a playful advice from his third-party notes). True, a couple of times he nevertheless condescended to divine intervention, for example, pointing the way back to the dragon lost in the world ocean. Mordkaizer raised a draco-lich-possum, who then prayed to him to be taken apart and put together by a simple draco-lich.In addition, the god of the night launched a dead citadel into flight and tested its weapons - firing a rocket into the desert and cutting through the forest lands with a ray of destructive energy. Prontos created a unique piece of brick, which later became an indestructible artifact. He also invented an eye that can be inserted into objects, thereby reviving them. He also had a mask that allowed him to move into the one who put it on. Mirtyn also slowly created objects, one of which was the Cube, creating random effects.creating random effects.creating random effects.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During the game, stable expressions appeared, such as ‚ÄúIncoming Prayer‚Äù and ‚ÄúPray for Me,‚Äù accompanying moments when players stopped on the yellow sectors of the fate track. This event meant that you need to select another player who will describe the creature‚Äôs address to the deity, and then describe his answer to this prayer.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for my deity, for him the story developed approximately as follows: at the beginning there were a couple of minor troubles - for example, an anomaly appeared in the locality under control, in which trans-ports could not teleport. Then a first unique object appeared, called the Trans-fruit - it was an apple on one of the trees, which suddenly turned from ordinary into glass, filled with red portal energy. The item allowed the owner to teleport. Later this item became damned (a glass worm wound up in it) and was taken away by the god of dragons. The next item was a weapon - Psychocrest. It was an x-shaped thing that shoots psychic energy. Pretty soon, this item received the status of an artifact and became indestructible.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vk/z6/lk/vkz6lkhrh4ex0eweyumcrphoktk.jpeg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">View of the playing field for the final game meeting (buttons mark the Chosen)</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Then my Reform was created: </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The sphere of invisibility</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (giving the owner invisibility and found in the area cut by the beam of the dead citadel), </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Space staff</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (captured by one of the trans ports in another dimension and later eliminated attack of insects from underground caves), </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Misty Cup</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (giving knowledge to a drinker and found in underground caves cleared of insects), </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Signet of flight</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (later disappeared along with one of the transport ports in the endless sea ) and the </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Bag of Secrets</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (from which you could pull something interesting).</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I note a couple of prayers that occurred in the change of my deity. Once trans-ports desired to see any changes, in a word of reform. Then Reformax decided to respond, and with divine power he lifted separate parts of Ventron into the air, forming it into a pile of forest-covered islands, between which only transport ports (or flying creatures) could travel. Another moment is connected with the trans port, which the god of dragons wanted to teach him how to be a dragon - the petitioner was able to breathe a cloud of red energy.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After accumulating five items, the Battery God comes to life the Chosen One (other gods need to grow three heroes for this) - I have some Remix chosen for this Chosen, a transport consisting entirely of red energy and stored until this time in a stone tomb. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Having appeared, the Chosen One went to gather faith from the regions of the continent that were not yet open. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the five hours of the game, we finally had three Chosen Ones: the golem created by Prontos from different parts and artifacts, as well as the Hiddenweis dragon, who learned unearthly wisdom, joined the heroine consisting of red energy. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k3/qb/oq/k3qboqspmqhmbepg-033op6vzx8.jpeg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And here are the participants of the game</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> .
