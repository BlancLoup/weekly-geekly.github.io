  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mediamagiya: Come home, take the remote and choose to watch from the tracker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let me begin my story with a story about free time, family and craving for beauty.  The free time I can spend with my wife is usually very little.  Either I am busy, then my wife.  That both of us.  But sometimes an hour or two is released that can be spent together.  And what can be done together?  Well, besides what you thought, you can still watch the movie together.  Go to the cinema, for example, by choosing one of five sad movies in the cinema.  Or get a DVD from the shelf and see for the 5th time ‚ÄúNew 2006, 8 in 1‚Äù.  But who needs the new 2006 in quality for a mobile phone or pay money for movie tickets, if everything you need for pleasure can be done at home almost for free?  If there is a tracker on which hundreds of interesting films are constantly laid out?  If you have a good TV and a sofa on which to watch movies is much nicer?  No, sometimes, of course, it is pleasant to go to the cinema, or review the novelties of 2006, but in most cases we want (1) <b>at home</b> , (2) watch <b>for free</b> (3) a <b>new</b> movie (4) <b>in good quality</b> (5) <b>without waiting</b> for it is downloaded. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As I have.  Well, more precisely, it was before.  If there was free time, when both my wife and I can and want to watch a movie, I turned on the computer, went to the tracker, flipped through new items for a long time, read descriptions, chose a movie, put it into download, waited for the download to finish, connected the computer to the TV, turned happy to my wife and ... I realized that she had fallen asleep for half an hour while I was doing all this.  At some point I got tired of it and I went the other way, which I will now tell you about. <br><br>  For starters, I got rid of the need to connect a computer to a TV.  From the old iron I assembled a computer dedicated specifically for the role of a media server.  On this computer, I put the Linux assembly "mythbuntu", specially created for this purpose.  I found an infrared receiver, bought 7 years ago with a Sony Ericsson mobile phone.  I bought a remote in the subway for 190 rubles.  I connected the assembled computer to the TV and so I got a media server with an intuitive graphical shell, controlled from the console.  Here is a photo.  PS3 is my server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1e/dc/1edc4d5ee5669883e020cb1a72e0bfa8.jpg" alt="image">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And this is a picture of the MythTV shell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/70/31/7031d497ec1f2251feacb3252efb06d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then the fun begins.  I put a torrent client running 24 hours a day on this computer and wrote a script that downloads all popular movies from the tracker according to certain criteria (there should be more than 70 watches, but do not download screens and serials), download descriptions of movies, who is the director, actors, release picture, etc.  All this he puts MythTV, and sends me a letter that began downloading a new film.  Sitting at work at a working computer, I receive a letter from my server, with a description, a picture, etc., and if the film seems to me to be dull, I reply to this letter with the label that the film should be deleted.  The server reads the answers, stops the download and deletes the movie.  So, by the way, the letter looks like <br><br><img src="http://portal.san.ru/forums/journal/uploads/j18532_1253389122.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And when I have the opportunity to watch a film with my wife, I no longer spend time searching, downloading, and so on.  I pick up the remote, fall to my wife on the sofa, and together we choose what to watch.  Already from downloaded.  Our server while we worked.  It looks like this: This is the list of films. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/92/b0/92b0a591282e40ce0fa249fc1a94329f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And this, here, the description of the film: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/17/64/1764a95d65202d5ba9ad1abe42ce6373.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In reality, the time spent creating the server and writing the script was worth it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111954/</a></p>
