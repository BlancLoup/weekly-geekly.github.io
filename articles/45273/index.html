The answer was positive. <br>  So, for several months, a code was written by a familiar programmer for little money. <br>  For a little money, I received a non-optimized code, as it should be.

      Further, over the course of a year, we advertised our search engine several times on the webmaster forums to listen to the opinions of those who understand this. <br><br>  We rewrote the parsing algorithm three times.  Have achieved fast work. <br>  Caching is also present. <br>  Yandex has been parsing officially, in XML, and Google - unofficially :) <br>  At first, there were generally three search engines ‚Äî including Rambler, but I quickly abandoned it. <br><br>  We took a dedicated server in Moscow.  Added weather, YouTube search with the download function and image search (rough parsing of Yandex with the opening of the image immediately, without intermediate transitions). <br><br>  Developed a portal (a la Yandex).  Naturally, with their chips. <br><br>  We put Ya.Direkt on the page and Yandex allowed us to make up to 10,000 XML requests per day. <br><br>  But in January 2009, the main programmer went into a long hard drinking, and Yandex blocked us access via XML for what we did not designate in the search - where their output was, and where not theirs.  That's all. <br>  For a month of inactivity lost enthusiasm. <br><br>  Nothing big shone to us. <br>  Although ... we had more than 500 regular users at the peak :) <br>  I myself used the search engine, it was my default browser. <br>  To create competition to giants and in thoughts was not. <br><br><h4>  What was the intention? </h4>  The most important argument was that Butty combines the two best search engines into one. <br>  Like, why spend twice as much time when there is Butty? <br>  Well, unlike the same Nigma, we had no repetitions. <br><br><h4>  Cunning attempts to promote </h4>  <b>1. Opened free hosting</b> <br>  In exchange for hosting users posted a search string Butty <br>  More information about the history of hosting can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/107675/">here</a> . <br><br>  <b>2. SmallProxy</b> <br>  I agreed with the now deceased author of the popular SmallProxy program so that when installing his software, Butty becomes the start page. <br><br>  <b>3. Banner with the latest search query</b> <br>  Made a tricky banner: <br><img src="http://poisk.be/images/468.gif" alt="image"><br>  It was placed on sites with a large number of transitions from the PS. <br>  The referrer recognized the request by which the visitor came. <br>  Then gif was generated with this very query in the search line :) <br><br><h4>  Clones </h4>  The project had 3 (three!) Clones. <br>  They copied the design, but they had their own parsers.  Worse. <br><br><h4>  Title </h4>  The word ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù (butterfly) spun in my head.  Next, I hammered "butty" in Lingvo and learned that it translates from English as "friend, buddy, comrade;  companion". <br>  Only a few months later I learned that ‚Äúbutt‚Äù is translated from English as, excuse me, ‚Äúasshole‚Äù! <br>  It became especially unpleasant when I entered butty.com in the address bar (there is a porn site there). <br><br><h4>  Logo Evolution </h4><img src="http://poisk.be/images/logo.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="http://poisk.be/images/logo2.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://poisk.be/images/logo_last.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4>  Perhaps you remember that I wrote posts on my own failures several times in Habr√©. <br>  I want to say that not a bit sorry about these attempts. <br>  They gave me such an experience, such a basis, without which now it would be very difficult for me to work. <br>  Try, gentlemen.  Try!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45273/</a></p>
