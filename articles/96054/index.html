  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to stop "helping children" from scammers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just before bedtime I received <b>once again</b> spam from scammers, to which I could not help but respond.  Under the pretext of helping children scammers lure money.  To the depths of the soul resent cynical actions.  But the problem is not even that - in the last half of the year I have already received the third letter of similar content, clearly from the same ones I threw, therefore it still makes a profit.  How to deal with it? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Current situation: </h4><br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://pomogitesvetiku.ucoz.ru/">pomogitesvetiku.ucoz.ru</a> <br>  <b>Falsified docks:</b> <a href="">svetikyanchuk.moy.su/_si/0/25661055.jpg</a> taken from <a href="">www.pomogi.org/f/1/success/korsacheva/korsacheva-schet.jpg</a> <br>  <a href="">svetikyanchuk.moy.su/_si/0/66026751.jpg</a> - it's hard to find where they got it from, but there they even forgot to overwrite the Help.Or payer <br>  <b>What has been done:</b> <br><ul><li>  Written a complaint to the arbitration WebMoney </li><li>  Written complaint in Yandex.Money </li><li>  Notification sent to host </li><li>  The site was a ‚Äúguest book‚Äù (judging by the entries in it, unfortunately, people react and believe).  For 20 minutes, I wrote an auto warning warning there with a built-in decapcher, but the scammers, as a result, turned off the ability to post to the guestbook for unregistered users.  To write a user account creator on a yukoz - imkho overkill. </li></ul><br><h4>  Why this topic? </h4><br>  The bottom line is that despite all my actions, fraudsters clearly continue to "work" on the topic for half a year, without changing the handwriting.  Therefore, it brings money.  Sites after complaints sometimes live for 1-2 days, and sometimes longer (see below about livejournal).  Any other types of fraud do not cause me such a violent reaction, but in this case, I would like to find some more effective method of struggle, so I want to share my observations. <br><br>  I am an active user of electronic payment systems (seller), therefore I am a member of numerous e-commerce catalogs (megastock, payi.ru and the like).  Mailings always come either to WebMoney in the form of messages, or by e-mail specified in the profile in directories (always unique).  Users of various "Internet money" are clearly the "target group" of scammers.

      WebMoney and Yandex.Money rather quickly block wallets for withdrawal (within 24 hours), but judging by the latest versions of pages, fraudsters are focusing on non-cash transfers.  What can I do?  I live in Germany, so I can not go and write a statement.  Yes, and in fact such a statement in Russia will take?  I do not seem to be affected person.  Complaint to the bank? <br><br>  The Administration has helped. For a very long time, the Org suffered from the actions of this group, I was writing off with them, but they cannot do anything except what I suggested.  This, in principle, is understandable. <br><br>  In spring, the same scammers posted their page on livejournal.com and what surprised me, the conflict committee of livejournal.com refused to delete it with the wording that it is not responsible for the content of posts (although I and the employee Help. Org confirmed to them that they are fraudsters). <br><br>  If I had my own small botnet, he would have already ‚Äúworked‚Äù in this direction, but being a law-abiding user, I just spent a little time writing an auto-post in their guest room ‚Äî it didn‚Äôt bring much results.  Apparently, while abuz-departments of all organizations described above will respond, compassionate citizens will already sponsor scumbags. <br><br>  Summing up, we can say that most likely fraudsters, at best, block e-wallets, and they withdraw money from the account with complete impunity, there was hardly even a single statement to the police.  And how to be,% habraiser%? <br><br><h4>  UPDATE 12.06.2006: </h4><ul><li>  <b>ucoz <s>did not answer, the site continues to work,</s> finally answered, killed - who has friends there?</b>  <b>Why so long?</b> </li><li>  WebMoney answered, the wallet is blocked </li><li>  Yandex.Money answered, the account is blocked </li><li>  I received another spam with the same site on another email, also registered on Plati.Ru </li></ul><br><br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96054/</a></p>
