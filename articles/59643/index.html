  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Empirically found ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Take two individual designers and place them in the next room.  In room number one we organize home slippers, a cat and a ficus.  In the second - throughput system, cheap tea dust in bags and limited Internet traffic.  We will give specialists the same tasks and find out who performs them more effectively.  We will select experimental subjects so that they have an equal weight of cultural baggage, are not deprived of ambitions and human weaknesses. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <em>Test 1. Responsibility.</em> <br><br>  Time spent in the office is the time and money of the company.  Therefore, a full-time specialist begins to squander it with ease, sipping tea dust and talking about star wars.

      An independent specialist does not face the problem of self-motivation.  Any hour not spent at work or searching for it is stealing from oneself.  Of course, our test subject needs to eat, sleep and reboot the brain.  But unlike the office sloth, an independent specialist is aware of why he is not working at the moment.  Loneliness compels to be honest with yourself, because there is no one to lie (the cat does not count). <br><br>  <em>Test 2. Productivity.</em> <br><br>  A complex company management mechanism requires predictable planning.  The dates are averaged, the productivity of all specialists is considered the same.  Office mutants called man-hours appear (we saw spider-man, but what does man-clock look like ... Enibadi know?) <br><br>  The productivity of a domestic worker does not depend on the surrounding office ballast.  The sooner you hand over one project, the sooner you proceed to the next.  ‚ÄúOne of the ways to break the wheel of sansara is to unleash it as quickly as possible,‚Äù our experimental person comments on the approach to work. <br><br>  <em>Test 3. Physical data.</em> <br><br>  A sleepy employee is the enemy of the company.  In turn, the office mode is the enemy of the employee.  In room number two, we observe another victory of the regime and the ensuing harm to the company in the form of a poorly done or delayed project due to the drowsiness of the individual.  An interesting fact from the life of the test subject: he was persistently taught to kindergarten for an afternoon nap, but then suddenly the holiday ended and severe school / institute / labor (underline) everyday life began. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou will sleep an hour - you will work an extra couple of hours,‚Äù is the motto of a specialist in a ficus room.  As you can see, it is bearing fruit in the form of fresh ideas and a quick delivery of the project. <br><br>  <em>Test 4. Mode.</em> <br><br>  When we took individuality number two to the state, we were promised a 40-hour work week.  We fooled him.  In order to work out the lack of professionalism of the manager or the profanation of the customer, he has to go to work on the weekends and linger in the evenings. <br><br>  It is surprising that in room number one, the specialist is also seen in the workplace on weekends and holidays.  The only thing that distinguishes him from a colleague is the presence of a smile on his face and excitement in his eyes.  We see another idea coming to his head to sleep, and with burning eyes he sits until night. <br><br>  <em>Test 5. Rest.</em> <br><br>  Our staff specialist worked a lot, earned some money, decided to buy a car and drive, let's say, a couple of months in Europe.  Relax, be impressed and invent new ideas.  Reported this to the authorities.  He, in turn, told him that he could shove his fantasies into a drawer, and asked him to go to work this weekend, because  he (the boss) has many interesting plans for loading the employee with a new profitable (for the boss) job. <br><br>  Looking into the room with the ficus, we do not see the experimental.  Did you go to Europe?  No matter how wrong!  We let him out just for a couple of hours in the everyday free gym: cheer up, drive blood to the brain and think about our enviable share. <br><br>  <em>Test 6. Experience.</em> <br><br>  In room number two of our test subject, we regularly launch individuals of the same sex with him, so that they can be shared by mutual enhancement of experience.  Experiments succeed in glory: it is clear how the productivity and knowledge of individuals grows.  You look, soon they will put experiments on us! <br><br>  Yes, it is not easy for the test subject in a room with a ficus: he was given a difficult task by the customer.  The third day he fights against the wall.  Physical injuries and self-discovery threaten to negate the results of the experiment.  But what do we see?  An individual arranges a virtual conference meeting with those like him.  They long and hard knocked on the keys ... Voila!  Our experimental gets out of a seemingly hopeless situation.  The idea was invented, some of the income was transferred to friends as a thank you, the project was saved, the experience was gained. <br><br>  <em>Test 7. The cost of maintenance.</em> <br><br>  Difficult conditions that we have invented for an office employee entail large costs.  This led to a huge cost of services for the company, which employs an experimental one.  Not every innovative and young business can turn to such a company.  A large queue of customers in room number two lined up, apparently, in an old Russian habit: "pay a lot, wait a long time."  Therefore, customers are angry, and managers are driven back and forth, and they are forced to redo the work of the unfortunate test subjects. <br><br>  A rare bird will fly through the window to our home experimental.  But if it flies, it will be fed, fed and will receive from the designer such a feathering, which will overshadow the beauty of all the old and decrepit birds.  It is not for fear that our experimental subject works, but for conscience! <br><br>  <em>Marginal notes.</em> <br><br>  It has been found that in the food chain an office specialist is one or two steps lower than an independent home worker.  In the second case, only the customer is able to bring brains to the designer.  But at the office experimental there is an additional chance of being eaten by evil superiors.  Therefore, the home dweller gains over time valuable experience of persuasion, and sometimes even pressure on the king of the food chain ‚Äî the endowed customer. <br><br>  <em>To date, the experiment continues ...</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59643/</a></p>
