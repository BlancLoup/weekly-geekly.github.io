I want to share the impression of some that are in my modest collection. <br><br>  I am sure that those who have long wanted to master any musical instrument will find what they like.

    <h4>  First place: flute </h4><br>  When I got the first recorder, I didn‚Äôt even know at which end it was necessary to blow.  Now with the help of epoxy and a tone generator I can rebuild almost any ‚Äúlog‚Äù. <br><br>  Now my favorite is Kung's student block: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bb/f75/2ef/2bbf752ef5196216c3ce19f71a29f0e5.jpg" alt="Block"><br><br>  Differs gentle and at the same time loud sound. <br><br>  Another weird thing in my arsenal is the bone flute.  The sound is very high.  The range is a full octave.  Makes an ambiguous impression on those who see it for the first time: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d2/068/e57/4d2068e572c2407578934a602392f125.jpg" alt="Bone leg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With this flute I got hit by the Moscow master Lesha Palagin.  Very loud, but with a velvet sound.  If you know how to play, one and a half octaves are chromatic: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dcd/082/93e/dcd08293ecebb9236cb94ad8ccf99927.jpg" alt="Zhaleyka"><br><br>  Here it is about her sound: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ULEI-2_aBI&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhleiqp5gtR562uhLfpC9gVMxQFcQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why the first place: small and not very loud instruments.  Though in the office at least with a guitar play.  Learning the basics is really easy. <br><br><h4>  Second place: harp </h4><br>  I did not expect that such a divine sound could come from a 70-centimeter crumb.  Only 15 strings (2 full octaves), but such a buzz is indescribable! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a69/46f/666/a6946f6664b753c85f6139dcf8668df8.jpg" alt="Harpoch"><br><br>  The most interesting thing is that no matter what strings and in what order you touch, the music is still obtained.  Unlike the same guitar. <br><br>  That's just annoying that the deck (seven-year aged spruce!) Did not survive our heating season.  Cracked.  I had to restore it.  The master suggested replacing the deck with a 15-year-old spruce, but our mail was unable to ship the instrument back.  Then they don‚Äôt have a suitable box, it is not trimmed ... For the 4th time I spat and repaired the harp myself. <br><br>  The sound is gentle.  Dynamics - excellent: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oaLEOl1GAd0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg-HaSx5iERuoBQVbs5HPQkJ-ApyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why second place: even distant from the music IT people can make music on it. <br><h4>  Tambourine </h4><br>  Brought as a gift from Uzbekistan.  The true meditative tool IT specialist.  Promotes multitasking: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/953/6cb/233/9536cb2330b8795013d297a994c57309.jpg" alt="Tambourine"><br><br>  Why the third place: well, where in our area without it? <br><br><h4>  Fourth place: bagpipes </h4><br>  It was funny with the bagpipes: I wanted to have a bagpipe to the worst.  There was only a recorder.  What did I start with?  Made a website about bagpipes. <br><br>  A couple of days later, they called me from the Moscow bagpipe orchestra and asked if I wanted to play with them ... <br><br>  As it turned out, the birthplace of bagpipes is the Middle East, and there are quite a lot of them.  There are them in almost every country.  My first bagpipe was a ‚Äúhandicraft‚Äù made by our Russian master.  Since there has never been a bagpipe in Russia, they usually turn out to be appropriate. <br><br>  After tormenting for a while, I became acquainted with German bagpipes.  I now have two - quiet (dudai) and the loudest of bagpipes - dudelzak.  Slightly more than a meter in length: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/788/158/02d/78815802d1d90133ecbd6d2a5e1a4560.jpg" alt="MA bagpipe"><br><br>  In this play In Extremo: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RNCS8nL0Wxc&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgDT507O_fWnQwNjMoBkaY7VrpRoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why fourth place: it‚Äôs not very convenient to carry such baggage with you.  You can play only at home in Dudai, otherwise the school in front of you and the neighboring quarter will be listening with you along the bagpipes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107854/</a></p>
