  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My second ears</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, the wave of publications about headphones subsided ... And I didn‚Äôt tell about my <b>Sennheiser CX 300-II</b> .  It's time to correct your mistake, especially since it is very difficult to find the second such headphones in terms of price / quality ratio.  In general, if you need compact headphones with good sound for a reasonable price, then you are welcome under the habrakat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/194/54b/7aa/19454b7aaa7c068147e64c68757ddcf7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  What begins acquaintance with any gadget?  Of course, from the box in which he was diligently packed by hardworking <s>Chinese</s> Germans.  In my case, the box was also, but did not live to see the review.  I really wanted to evaluate the quality of the headphones, so everything was opened right in the store.  In this connection, the photograph of the whole box had to be taken from the Internet.

By the way, there are still pink, red, silver and white options. <br>  In the box itself, there are interchangeable ear cushions in the amount of 3 pairs, the ears themselves and a leather case, with which I am nowhere to part with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f91/843/294/f9184329474a20a6f123885a64862b46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is made very conveniently, at the top, instead of lightning and other uncomfortable things, it has two plastic strips that bend in different directions when pressed and prevent the headphones from falling out. <br>  The case itself is very pleasant to the touch and quite beautiful, not ashamed to get in the transport.  In the photo the thread came out pale-yellow, apparently I‚Äôve put it on too much, but overall the quality of the case is quite decent. <br><br>  Ear pads I advise you to try different, with each pair the music sounds differently.  Personally, I was ideally suited average, than I am very satisfied. <br><br>  The headphones themselves are a separate song, which I will discuss in the next section. <br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/abc/c5c/5e9/abcc5c5e9af4e731bca610f5eb8c8c15.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Characteristics, it is worth noting, very good for headphones-tabs, but not the same as for monitor headphones for 5-10k. <br>  However, hardly anyone expects a good sound from such babies.  I did not wait either.  And as it turned out - in vain. <br><br>  Actually, the budget when buying was very limited, the size of the headphones too (I didn‚Äôt want to carry around my neck, I wanted to be able to hide it in my pocket and forget until I needed it again), but the sound still worried.  And, as it turned out, finding such headphones is quite realistic. <br><br>  The first thing that struck, is the sensitivity of the headphones.  If you do not include music, you can hear how the wind blows.  And if you wear them under clothes, then it is quite possible to hear the heartbeat.  But all this is heard only before the inclusion of music, but when you start listening to your favorite melody ... <br>  It is difficult to convey these feelings, but one thing I can say for sure - I didn‚Äôt expect this from headphones-plugs for the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e28/84e/c8a/e2884ec8aa99a4271ae4246000ec6705.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If you describe the sound, it is quite rich and dynamic, good bass and fairly clean treble. <br>  But the most important thing in these headphones - insulation.  I have never been able to ride the subway and listen to podcasts, in which the presenters are barely audible.  With the same headphones it is absolutely unimportant where you are, in the subway or bus, in the stadium or at home - you can hear it perfectly everywhere. <br>  The only drawback is when you immerse yourself in music or a movie and you don‚Äôt hear anything, but at this time you get a phone call or knock your feet on the door. <br>  But wait, because you relax in your favorite headphones ... <br>  True, missed calls and unopened doors on time often affect karma in a negative way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c2/33f/612/0c233f6122c56de1e1e52be5378a2ce4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, before passing the verdict to these headphones, I would like to give the <a href="http://doctorhead.ru/faq_report_hp_fr">frequency response</a> and <a href="http://doctorhead.ru/faq_report_hp_rz">impedance</a> for audiophiles (and those who do not know what it is, you can follow the links and see the excellent FAQ in both terms): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ff/65a/a50/4ff65aa50f08baf0dff18606149cfa43.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a06/6bc/35a/a066bc35ad7ed91b94a8e2fd079a430a.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Verdict </h4><br>  In this part, I would like to talk a little about the price and make a control weighing of all the pros and cons of these headphones. <br><br>  If we talk about the price at which these headphones came to me, then these were symbolic 1404 rubles. <br>  I made a purchase in St. Petersburg, where I actually live, or more precisely, in the Ulmart store. <br><br>  If, however, Yandex.Market is to be trusted, the price range is from 1,000 to 2,000 rubles. <br>  And if you look at stores with a good reputation, then the price goes around around 1,400 rubles. <br>  Is it possible to pay such money for these headphones?  You decide, and I will try to help control weighing. <br><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - Price <br>  - Compact and comfortable case <br>  - Noise isolation (just super) <br>  - Replaceable ear cushions <br>  - Sound <br>  - Appearance <br>  - Warranty 2 years <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - Asymmetrical cord (with special diligence they can suffocate) <br>  - L-shaped plug (personally does not bother me) <br><br>  If you like these headphones, but you want a better sound, I can recommend the older models in the line: <br><br>  <a href="">CX 400-II</a> <br>  <a href="">CX 500</a> <br>  <a href="">IE 4</a> <br>  <a href="">IE 6</a> <br>  <a href="">IE 7</a> <br>  <a href="">IE 8</a> <br><br>  All of the above headphones are made in the form of plug-in headphones ("plugs"), and their prices range from 1,800 to 9,000 rubles. <br><br>  I hope you liked my or other headphones in the series and you will definitely make your choice. <br><br>  PS Be careful, <a href="http://doctorhead.ru/articles/sennheiser_fake">there are fake</a> Sennheiser CX 300 (version without cover), very similar to the real ones.  Under the link you can read how to distinguish fake from the original. <br><br>  <b>Comfortable headphone and good sound!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91636/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91636/</a></p>
