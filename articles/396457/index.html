  <section class="page js-page"><h1>APEIGAMING IN NUMBERS. Month after launch (video)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day.  For a month now I have been talking about our experiment in creating a cyber-sports organization of a new format.  Frankly speaking, everything turned out to be much more complicated than I expected.  If you try to find an analogy, then managing a community of 1000+ people scattered around the world, aged 16 to 38 years, is the same as putting your hand in a hive and hoping that everything will end well. <br><br>  But surprisingly, apart from minor excesses, the situation stabilized fairly quickly, and we entered the working pace.  You can of course blame everything on luck or chance, but specifically in this example, I think it has nothing to do with it.  One day, many years ago, I came across one picture, and I remember it all my life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c4/38b/52f/6c438b52f20d7684da37de3b572d512b.jpg" alt="image">

      This is exactly what a real leader should do, and this is how all new projects and start-ups are promoted.  Everyone in our organization is equal, and we all do one thing in common.  Over the past month, we have achieved phenomenal results, ‚Äúovertaking‚Äù many e-sports projects that already exist for more than one year. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  <b>Media support:</b> <br>  200.000 people saw publications in <a href="https://vk.com/apeigaming">VC community group</a> . <br>  80.000 unique visitors read our blog on geektimes and other portals. <br>  20.000 pages viewed on <a href="http://www.apeigaming.com/">the organization's website</a> . <br>  7,000 people visited our <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apeigaming">Twitch</a> channel. <br>  4,000 users watched the video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwBRksf3o-4vcQaRm2Cx7NA">Youtube</a> . <br><br>  <b>ESports support:</b> <br>  1,200 players registered on the organization's portal <br>  2,400 training hours played <br>  40 staff connected <br>  30 tournaments completed <br>  16 compositions collected <br></blockquote><br>  These indicators are the main motivator for the continuation of our initiative.  There is nothing worse than indifference, but all our social platforms are very much alive, and this gives reason for restrained optimism. <br><br>  But not everything was so rosy, especially in the first days after the launch of the project.  For 90% of incoming people, eSports are the finals of world tournaments, where professional athletes show the highest level of gaming skills.  At the same time, not many people think about what and who is behind these results.  Essentially, eSports, from the point of view of the training process, is not much different from sports in the usual sense of the word, but from the side of mental work it surpasses it many times.  I think that even chess is ‚Äúnervously smoking on the sidelines,‚Äù at the sight of all sorts of statistical combinations and development paths in the same Dota2.  Just do not forget about the other side of this process - organizations and sponsors who invest both their temporary and material resources.  Reflecting on how to simplify the process of introducing new players into the course of business, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa video blog on YouTube was born, which we called ‚ÄúCyberKitchen‚Äù. <br><br>  In it, I try to be as succinct as possible, and most importantly, to clearly explain all the main organizational issues, as well as to talk about what is happening in the community at the moment.  One of the most successful releases and I want to put on your court. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylbRz4v_eFk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhip1brtSNg5Jfc9N1TqnIHcrWxAWg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the time of this writing, 3 parts have already been published, but not all of them fit the format of this portal and may be incomprehensible to an outside observer.  But for those who are interested, leave a link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLFC4qP18qC_fAEJcjoaVRCFrgGuajgeC4">to the playlist channel</a> . <br><br>  The initial stage is passed, the workflow is adjusted, it remains only to grow, without slowing down the pace.  Road going by walking! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396457/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396457/</a></p>
