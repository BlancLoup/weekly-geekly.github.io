  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sennheiser HD 228: What is he like a cat in a bag?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I was in such a situation that I was left without headphones.  Serving faithfully AKG K26P for about three years ordered to live long.  From long wearing they broke the wire in the place of attachment of the mini-jack.  We must pay tribute to these headphones, as they are used actively and, sometimes, hard.  I rode them on a bicycle, walked in the rain, wore in a backpack without a case.  With his, at first glance, flimsy design, the headphones withstood everything.  Over time, the braid lost its elasticity, and the wire broke. <br>  Why am I describing it?  The fact is that these headphones have become for me the standard of sound for portable headphones.  With their small size, they managed to play low frequencies so that they began to vibrate, and not to rattle, the effect is about the same, if you stand in a room with a subwoofer.  At the same time there was no loss in the detailing of high frequencies, nor the blockage in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù.  Following them, Sony MDR-V500DJ was ordered to live long.  When not very careful handling, although by chance, the mount broke. <br>  Therefore, the question arose about the purchase of headphones.  Without any options, I began to look for AKG, but I ran into two problems.  One of the famous stores wanted to carry headphones only when ordering 10,000 rubles, the second, equally well-known, store did not send the bill. <br>  Since just a couple of days ago I bought the iPod Video U2SE, I went to look for headphones for shopping, not really hoping for a wide choice with an established budget of 2,000-2,500 rubles. <br>  My fears were confirmed, in this price category overhead headphones of the closed type and compact size turned out to be three models.  What is even more insulting, the staff very reluctantly responded to the request to listen to the sound, and really did not want to buy a cat in a bag, but I had to. <br>  What kind of cat in the bag under the name <a href="http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/home_en.nsf/root/private_headphones_wired-headphones_502761">Sennheiser HD 228</a> , you can read more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, headphones come in a blister.  It was completely refused to open it in a large trading network, so I had to rely on advertising inscriptions on the packaging: ‚Äúfor iPod, Explosive Bass, Closed-back on-ear stereo headphones with excellent bass perfomance‚Äù, which for an ordinary consumer means: ‚Äú- Take, take , you will not regret, the firm is good, it does not knit brooms, take it soon. ‚Äù <br><br>  After thinking for a few minutes and walking around the store, I headed for the checkout. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e9d/d49/6dc/e9dd496dc7d6ab269048323554cbae4d.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  Some dry facts: </h4><br>  <b>Type of headphones:</b> overhead <br>  <b>Headphone type:</b> dynamic, closed <br>  <b>Frequency range:</b> 18 - 22,000 Hz <br>  <b>Resistance:</b> 24Œ© <br>  <b>Sensitivity:</b> 110 dB <br>  <b>Connector:</b> 3.5 mm straight minijack <br>  <b>Cable length:</b> 1.4 meters <br>  The price varies from 1 590 to 2 263 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea6/0dd/1f5/ea60dd1f5f27d86c278c949c3e368ae4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Glossy shells with a chrome-plated plastic finish are mounted on a black matte handle made of high-quality plastic.  The wire is led to the left shell.  Adjustment of sinks on the flight and the corner.  The ear cushions and the cushion at the top of the bow are pleasantly soft, covered with a pleasant-to-touch leatherette.  The wire is thin, collected in one vein.  Honestly, does not inspire confidence.  The plug is straight, large enough.  The only negative is insufficient clamping force, on the other hand, the head and ears are not tired of it. <br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  About two months have passed since the purchase, during which time I can draw some conclusions.  The first impression that still remains is that there is not enough bass, in some places the headphones start to ‚Äúchoke‚Äù, games with an equalizer didn‚Äôt save the situation, so you have to turn down the volume.  In part, this effect is due to insufficient pressure of ear cushions to the ears.  Medium and high frequencies are very good, wood is naturally knocking, glass is ringing loudly.  A personal score for listening to music is 4+. <br>  It should be noted separately how the headphones behave when listening to audio books and when watching movies.  Here I have no complaints.  Everything is well heard, the explosions frighten, the voice of the announcer is heard very well and clearly.  Personal rating - 5. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd5/99a/4ba/bd599a4bacec71a15d6edf437defa4ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  The cost of the headphones, in general, justify.  It is pleasant enough to sit on the head, but due to insufficient pressure and small shells that do not cover the ear, the headphones can fall off if you look down, or sharply jerk your head.  Sometimes there is not enough folding design, so the headphones dangle around the neck, instead of lying in a bag or backpack.  The cat in the bag was thoroughbred, but sometimes shkodit.  Subjective assessment - 4/5. <br><br><h5>  Pros: </h5><br>  - Reasonable price <br>  - Interesting design <br>  - Comfort when using <br>  - Worthy sound <br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br>  - In some places the bass "chokes" <br>  - Not tight enough to sit on the head, you have to correct <br>  - Big plug <br><br>  In the tests took part: iPod Shuffle 2, iPod Video 30Gb U2SE, MacBook Pro 13 " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86238/</a></p>
