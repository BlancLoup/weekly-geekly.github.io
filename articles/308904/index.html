While schoolchildren and students reluctantly say goodbye to summer freedom and resent the fact that the letter from Hogwarts has not come again, we remind you that ONLYOFFICE is also a solution for educational institutions. <br><br>  Further we will tell about how ONLYOFFICE can help in the educational process and / or its organization. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/210/4b0/553/2104b0553a744b16aa2971bec5802ad9.jpg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  ONLYOFFICE in schools and universities: so what? </h3><br>  ONLYOFFICE was originally conceived as a business solution, but time (and interest from NGOs and educational institutions) showed that it is more versatile.  The functions that were created with a view to optimizing business processes are quite capable of working on education.

      Now we see at least two directions for using our software in this area: <br><br><ul><li>  Organization of internal document management and school / university management; </li><li>  Use directly in the educational process to organize the interaction of students and teachers. </li></ul><br>  Here are the tools that ONLYOFFICE offers to optimize both directions: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Online editors</b> for viewing, sharing, co-editing and commenting on students' written works (on what exactly ONLYOFFICE editors are superior to Google Docs and MS Office Online read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/teamlab/blog/275471/">here</a> ); </li><li>  <b>Documents</b> module for organized storage of files and providing access to them - these can be accounting documents, orders, curricula, and handouts for lessons, lectures, etc. </li><li>  <b>Projects</b> module for organizing and monitoring educational and extracurricular activities; </li><li>  <b>Community</b> - a kind of social network with blogs, forums and chat for communication and discussion of important topics in real time.  It can also work as a warning system for events, vacation dates, holidays; </li><li>  a <b>CRM</b> module for storing necessary contacts (for example, parent numbers in the case of schools); </li><li>  <b>Mail</b> for managing correspondence, alerts about changes in the schedule; </li><li>  <b>Calendar</b> to keep track of important events and teachers' employment. </li></ul><br>  And yes - we offer not one, but several solutions - from them you can choose the one that suits your organization more, depending on its structure and size. <br><br><h3>  The shortest guide to solutions for educational organizations </h3><br>  <b>ONLYOFFICE in the cloud</b> <br><br>  The solution includes all ONLYOFFICE functionality + 2GB of disk space.  It is free for all NGOs and any general education organizations. <br><br>  Ideal for educational institutions with a small number of users.  For example, language or business schools: a document management system can be used both for bookkeeping, scheduling and managing internal resources, and for storing materials for students and checking their work.  Just think: it is not necessary to send a million scanned documents to dozens of mailboxes - you can simply fumble around students.  It is not necessary to download and edit essays written by students, and then send them back by e-mail - all this can be done on the portal with the help of our joint editing!  (yes, about the language school - it was painful for the author) <br><br>  <b>ONLYOFFICE server version</b> <br><br>  Solution to deploy on your own server.  Suitable for large organizations with the necessary equipment and high security requirements (important for those who fear leaks of confidential data from the cloud, as well as for those who fall under the law on personal data). <br><br>  The server solution includes all the functions from the cloud version + Control Panel, which provides, firstly, automation of web office management, and secondly, serves to provide enhanced security.  For example, you can switch to https, backup and restore data, track user inputs and actions. <br><br>  Free for general education schools, for other educational organizations - discounts. <br><br>  <b>Desktop Editors</b> <br><br>  for editing text documents, spreadsheets and presentations without an internet connection.  Suitable for those who, for economic reasons, avoids licensed MS Office and (for whatever reason) can‚Äôt accept the need to use LibreOffice.  Very simple interface allows you to quickly get used even to the most conservative teachers.  By the way, desktops can also be connected to the cloud and to the server and, if necessary, easily switch between offline and online editing modes. <br><br>  Technical details on the ONLYOFFICE desktops can be found in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/teamlab/blog/279397/">this article</a> .  They are free for all educational institutions (and personal use). <br><br>  <b>Online editors for integration</b> <br><br>  We did not think about it until we received a request for the integration of editors from a pair of universities from Western Europe. <br><br>  The integration solution is suitable for institutions with an established and actively used document and process management system.  ONLYOFFICE online editors can be embedded in a web application written in any language and used in a familiar environment.  According to our data, the integration should be easy and painless: if necessary, we will provide moral and technical support.  And you can also read detailed documentation on <a href="http://api.onlyoffice.com/editors/">our API</a> . <br><br><h3>  ONLYOFFICE in the cadet corps </h3><br>  Are there examples of successful integration of ONLYOFFICE in educational institutions?  Definitely yes.  And now we will tell about our beloved. <br><br>  Specialists from the Laboratory of Innovative Educational Technologies of the St. Petersburg Cadet Military Corps (SPbKVK) launched one of our first web offices after their decisive transition to STR. <br><br>  The reasons for the decision lie on the surface: the educational institution belongs to the Ministry of Defense and practically all the internal documentation has at least the heading ‚ÄúFor official use‚Äù.  In addition, under federal law, which we all remember and love, all information must be located on servers within the Russian Federation.  This prompted the representatives of the cadet corps to look for the server solution that runs on Linux.  Searches stopped at the open source version ONLYOFFICE. <br><br>  (Rejected solutions: Google Apps, Office 365 and Bitrix 24, distributed on a commercial basis. In addition, at the time of the transition, only Bitrix began to transfer its servers to Russia). <br><br>  A small spoiler: later in SPbKVK they switched from the open version to our corporate server solution ONLYOFFICE Enterprise Edition.  In fact, it was the productive cooperation with the cadet corps that prompted us to make the Enterprise Edition free for schools. <br><br>  <b>System requirements and some technical details</b> <br><br>  To install ONLYOFFICE on the school server, the following requirements must be met: <br><br><ul><li>  Dual-core processor clocked at 2 GHz; </li><li>  at least 6GB of RAM; </li><li>  64-bit version of Linux / Ubuntu; </li><li>  Hard disk space - from 40 GB. </li></ul><br>  In the cadet building ONLYOFFICE deployed on the basis of the distribution Xubuntu GNU / Linux version 14.04 with 64-bit architecture (selected version of Ubuntu with a lightweight desktop XFCE). <br><br>  <b>INFOSONA Cadet Corps</b> <br><br>  The electronic document management system, created with the help of ONLYOFFICE in the cadet corps, received the proud name of "INFOZONA".  It is used by teachers, methodologists and the administration of the cadet corps.  The total number of users of the system is about 100 people who work in four different buildings. <br><br>  As the head of the Laboratory of Innovative Educational Technologies Vitaly Bityunnikov told us, almost no one experienced the difficulties of switching to new software: all employees had the necessary minimum of experience working with Google Apps and after a short motivational speech and very little training everything was easily rebuilt (some also had to change Internet Explorer on Google Chrome, but we believe that all of this is only better). <br><br>  Now the solution is used exclusively for the management of information resources of the school.  But at the same time, the IOT Laboratory is thinking of connecting the students themselves to the system.  In this case, the number of users of the system will grow to 800, and ONLYOFFICE will become an integral part of the educational process, which we ourselves, we must admit, would like very much. <br><br><h3>  Almost end </h3><br>  The most pleasant thing is that the cadet corps did not just implement ONLYOFFICE: the developed system is presented at conferences and events such as the Ministry of Defense Innovation Day, and the IOT Laboratory prepared a whole manual to simplify the transition of other schools to vocational education and ONLYOFFICE. <br><br>  We will continue to look for cooperation with educational institutions.  So we get the opportunity to fulfill our true mission and give a good office software to a large number of users.  Well and we bring up a little new generation of ONLYOFFICE users. <br><br>  In general, this whole pathos to the fact that if you represent an educational institution, write to us at edu@onlyoffice.com.  We will find ONLYOFFICE solution for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308904/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308904/</a></p>
