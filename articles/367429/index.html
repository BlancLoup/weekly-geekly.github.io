      Netatmo has released a universal device that can measure indoor temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, atmospheric pressure, noise pollution and indoor humidity.  If it's time to air the room, the meteering station will report it.  As you know, it is often necessary to ventilate the room ‚Äî this is necessary both to maintain normal well-being and to work productively for a long time. <br><br>  If, for example, there is a large amount of carbon dioxide in the room (which, as we know, it is not detected by organoleptic methods - it is transparent and odorless), the person begins to feel not very well, the ability to concentrate disappears, the person quickly gets tired. <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/personal-naja-meteostancija-netatmo.html">Netatmo station</a> transmits all data to a mobile device, to the application, where the weather forecast for the entire current region is also displayed.  Plus, you can control the station by voice. <br><br><h3>  Nest Learning Thermostat </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2PWdzYuiqc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhp89XUQP6Q-xP01FhoFKt0izyg3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Many people know about this thermostat, since the device perfectly controls the room microclimate, interacting with some smart devices.  According to the developers, the thermostat provides not only a comfortable stay of people in the room, but also an energy saving of 20%. <br><br>  Nest can control the temperature in the house, depending on weather conditions and temperature changes outside.  At the same time, the thermostat is capable of self-learning, and works in full accordance with the schedule, daily routine and preferences of each family (of course, Nest can be installed not only in an apartment or a house, but also in the office).  For example, Nest recognizes that there is no one at home and automatically adjusts the temperature to avoid overheating or cooling an empty house. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_lS0KOdBSc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLeoX6qlbHSPHmUiXBWSSQY0Ehog" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samoobuchajuschijsja-termostat-nest-learning-thermostat.html%3F___SID%3DU">The Nest thermostat</a> works with 95 percent of various heating and cooling systems, including systems running on gas, electricity, using a heat pump, systems of forced air circulation, systems running on solar and geothermal energy, etc. <br><br><h3>  CliMate is the smallest weather station in the world. </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dzl8GgAvhfs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh19OFtPAco_1GO-FRLGAfuT8qP5w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The developers claim that this is the smallest weather station in the world, which, while remaining practical.  The device can measure air temperature, humidity, as well as the level of ultraviolet radiation.  Information transmitted by the station is updated every 15 minutes, while the data enters the application on the mobile device.  The developers have equipped the device with a small amount of autonomous memory, so synchronization can be carried out not constantly (after all, this possibility may not be). <br><br>  <b>CliMate features:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Connection: Bluetooth 4.0 <br>  ‚Ä¢ Operating temperature: -20 ¬∞ C to 65 ¬∞ C <br>  ‚Ä¢ Resistant to splashing water: IPX4 standard <br>  ‚Ä¢ Battery: replaceable round cell battery.  One battery lasts up to 6 months in normal use (the back cover opens and the device battery is easily replaced) <br>  ‚Ä¢ iOS compatibility - devices <br>  IOS version 6 or newer <br>  iPhone 4S or newer <br>  iPod Touch 5th generation or newer <br>  iPad3 or newer (including iPad Mini) Android devices <br>  Any device with Android 4.3 (or newer), with Bluetooth 4.0 support <br>  ‚Ä¢ Colors: yellow, red, white, blue, gray. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/249816/">Here the</a> company Medgadgets reviewed the capabilities of the device, including unpacking and testing. <br><br>  By the way, now the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/climate-treker.html%3F___SID%3DU">weather station Rooti Labs CliMate is</a> on sale, and its cost can hardly be called high. <br><br><h3>  Detector carbon dioxide Master KIT </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fea/3c2/f0e/fea3c2f0edf0d02da46e6fbe402f3018.png"><br><br>  Easy to use and very effective device that performs its functions perfectly - it determines the level of CO2 concentration in the air, plus it determines the temperature of the air in the room. <br><br>  Thanks to this device, you can always know what the condition of the air in the room.  Moreover, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/kit-mt8057.html">detector MT8057</a> can be installed absolutely in different places: kindergartens, work offices, schools, etc.  The device will instantly react to the slightest change in the concentration of carbon dioxide, will warn of an increase or decrease in temperature.  As a result, you can always adjust on time with additional airing, turning on the air conditioner. <br><br><h3>  Withings WS-50 </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mcF-a-ovc9I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhik5n1ql2jaxqj_y6kFb9A6JjGoaA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, this device is positioned, but in fact the device is more functional.  The developer positions this device as a body analyzer.  Scales not only measure the weight of the wearer's body, but also know how to determine the pulse and even monitor the quality of the air in the room, with an assessment of the ambient temperature and the concentration of carbon dioxide. <br><br>  Measurement data is transmitted via the wireless Wi-Fi module to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù and the application on a mobile phone.  In the "cloud" a detailed analysis of the measurements is carried out, with the derivation of the results of the analysis in an easy-to-understand form.  It is worth noting that third-party developers are releasing applications for scales.  By the way, the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/vesy-smart-analizator-tela-ot-withings.html">Withings WS-50</a> also has a Bluetooth module, which is used to configure the device. <br><br><h3>  Nest protect </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0a/a92/240/c0aa92240a07c2847f4726c9156e0e17.jpg" width="681"><br><br>  And this is a smart smoke detector and a carbon monoxide detector.  The manufacturer of the device is Nest - the same company that produces and smart thermostat.  One of the advantages of the system is that it can determine the concentration of carbon monoxide (carbon monoxide).  Carbon monoxide is much more dangerous than carbon dioxide, as it actively reacts with blood hemoglobin, leading to blockage of the supply of oxygen to the body. <br><br>  In addition, the device can determine the humidity.  Inside the detector are the following modules: <br><ul><li>  photoelectric smoke detector </li><li>  carbon monoxide sensor </li><li>  thermal sensor </li><li>  three violation detection sensors </li><li>  ambient light sensor </li><li>  humidity sensor </li></ul><br><br>  Like all the devices described above, Nest Protect transmits all data wirelessly to a mobile device. <br><br><h3>  Tzoa </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTSBmbiquGA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhilBQo6gXn8nkmNQFxkJVoTHX1JjA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A miniature device, called TZOA, can be considered as a personal air quality determination station.  The developers have equipped the station with several sensors (including a carbon dioxide sensor and a UV sensor) that help the user to understand how ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù the air inside or outside the room can be considered. <br><br>  Personal station is useful for everyone - from office workers to athletes who hardly want to ride bicycles or run in places where the air is polluted with exhausts.  Instead of a ‚Äúdose of health‚Äù in such a place, you can only get a negative impact on your body. <br><br>  TZOA, in addition to determining the quality of air, can also give advice that helps either to put the environment around it in order (if it is a room), or simply to move to another place (if it is a walk along the street). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367429/</a></p>
