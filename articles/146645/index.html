In fact, the title of the post ‚ÄúWhy I don‚Äôt like to watch long videos when you can say the same thing in two words,‚Äù but it wouldn‚Äôt have been so attractive. </h6><br>  I am not against YouTube, as well as not against all other video hosting sites (probably, excluding vimeo, which is repulsively played on mobile devices and old browsers.).  They made it very quick and easy to share videos (remember, these horrible links on the ‚Äúdownload video, avi, 5.4mb‚Äù sites?), Which is undoubtedly a plus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38f/47d/35b/38f47d35b28cf2aec2dd95b33b958e62.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, in some cases, the video can not do.

      But what I absolutely dislike is video reviews and most video instructions. <br>  Now I'm playing with the Ramos W6HD tablet, and among others, I installed the <a href="http://www.librehat.co.cc/2012/03/keep-updating-ics-hatmod-for-ramos-w6hd.html">firmware</a> compiled by one of the enthusiasts.  Let me give an example from this page. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How to flash a tablet, video instruction. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWueZLpzfZI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  2 minutes of time.  A tablet lying on the table, a card that is inserted into the tablet, then it is leaned against a can of napkins so that you can put the camera in front of you.  Then you have to press two buttons with one hand - the second is occupied by the camera, having previously poked a finger at the buttons.  The inscriptions on them can be seen only by opening the video in full screen - the player on the site is very small.  The buttons must be held, so the hand closes the half of the screen.  Now we look at the process of the firmware - as the strip runs across the screen.  We look, we look, we look, we look ... Hooray, it's over.  Now look at the boot process.  Everything is completed by music. <br><br>  How to flash a tablet, text instructions. <br><br> <code>Depress the 7z file, put all extracted files into SDcard. <br> Then, press the M button and Power button to flash it.</code> <br> <br>  Unpack, copy to the card, turn off the tablet, and simultaneously press M + Power. <br><br>  Two lines!  Two lines that I read in a couple of seconds, instead of two minutes of my life! <br><br>  Now seriously.  Why do I prefer text to video? <br><br>  1) Attention.  To watch the video, you need to pay all attention to the video.  Especially if with sound.  Just turn aside - and that's all, ‚Äúwhat did he do now ?!‚Äù and look for the time when you got distracted, using the red strip on the mouse. <br><br>  <b>Distracted during a thoughtful reading, of course, unpleasant, but not fatal - the maximum will have to reread the previous sentence, which does not take much time.</b> <br><br>  2) Continuity.  In order to escape from the video, you must first pause it.  And if you want to clarify something, first find that place with an accuracy of a few seconds. <br>  <b>For the text of this problem does not occur - no problem to be distracted instantly, and then just as quickly return to reading.</b>  <b>You can easily leave the tab open and reply to a message or letter.</b>  <b>Or go to sleep, and finish it tomorrow.</b>  <b>Or turn off the computer, knowing that finding the right place in the text - a couple of eye movements and mouse wheel.</b>  <b>And not re-loading video and flipping.</b> <br><br>  3) Inconvenient movement and search <br>  Finding the necessary fragment in a 20-minute video is very difficult.  Either use the services to accelerate the rollers, or flipping with a small gap, hoping that you stumble at the right moment. <br><br>  <b>Search in the text is a much easier task.</b>  <b>Either Ctrl + F, or with your eyes (with the ‚Äúreading speed‚Äù skill pumped, this is very convenient) and you instantly move to the right moment.</b> <br><br>  4) one-dimensional <br>  In the video at a time you can see only one frame.  You pause, and limit yourself to 1/30 second of real time. <br><br>  <b>Seeing in front of you a page of text, you can only move your eyes to the previous paragraph, and then go back.</b>  <b>Eye movements are incomparably faster than comprehension, hand movements to the mouse, and the search for the desired fragment in the video.</b>  <b>And do not forget, you have to go back exactly at the same time.</b> <br><br>  5) Greater demands on technology <br><br>  Still, both creating a video and watching it is much more complicated and demanding on resources. <br><br>  To install the video you need at least a camera and a simple video editor, for viewing - a modern computer, fast internet, or an expensive smartphone. <br><br>  <b>To read the text you need a cheap phone, reader, communicator, e-book, tablet, or at the end of the day a simple paper book.</b>  <b>For writing - a simple laptop or phone with a keyboard.</b> <br><br>  Dixi.  73! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146645/</a></p>
