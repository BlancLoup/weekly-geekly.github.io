However, an important reservation must be made here.  Some tools of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/344090/">Social Architecture are</a> dangerous.  By setting an exciting goal for people, you can push them towards self-destruction.  This was the main problem in <a href="https://ffii.org/">FFII</a> (Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure), when I came there, and it was aggravated by the high intensity of emotions that was characteristic of the organization‚Äôs tribal corporate culture at that time.  Many of the key players were exhausted and emotionally exhausted.  Not by hearsay familiar to me the state itself. <br><br>  Studies of emotional burnout, which you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout">read about in Wikipedia</a> , in my opinion, do not correspond to what is happening in real life.  But reality is still more important than theory.  I have repeatedly observed this characteristic feature of burnout in voluntary communities: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  It is expressed as a deep aversion to a particular project.  We throw the project away, stop responding to email.  mail and we can even leave the community.  The rest say: ‚Äúhm, he behaves in a strange way ... probably upset or tired.‚Äù </li><li>  This state is projective.  Those.  we fade in relation to one project, but with others everything can be fine.  In other cases, we can be paralyzed even for several months - then we will start working again, but already abandoning the project and taking on something else. </li><li>  This happens every one to three years, depending on your nature and situation.  Very persistent, motivated individuals can endure longer, but when they fail, it will be even worse. </li><li>  There is a cure.  I tried this strangest approach when I managed to find the money and pay the burned out volunteers for what they did for free.  They returned happy and continued to do their work. </li><li>  The disease can also be prevented.  Paid workers also do not suffer from exhaustion.  Of course, they may fall into depression, but usually they are not cut down suddenly. </li></ul>

      Which leads me to the idea that the problem here is the problem of optimal investment of professional efforts. <br><br>  People invest a lot in their professions, take great risks, especially in their youth, hoping for a reward later.  We can ignore material rewards for a long time if we are sure that we are following the right path.  For example, a young writer or musician is willing to endure poverty for many years if he believes that fame and wealth are waiting for him ahead. <br><br>  And no matter how faded a carrot hangs in front of us from a stick - it always looms in our subconscious.  We are essentially economic animals.  All life - accounting.  We are perfectly able to lie to ourselves, but still there is an economic motive behind every action and decision.  We invest in projects because we feel that they will contribute to our success, even if it takes years.  We are competing with others, trying to find a niche where our talents will shine in all its glory. <br><br>  And so it turns out that a young brain, struggling to invest its resources in the right things, finds himself in a situation where a snowball of lies reaches a critical mass.  The road suddenly ends in a dead end.  The people who followed her are deceivers and manipulators.  Mission - fake.  The endorsements of others are emotional manipulation.  Years of effort go up in dust, and every next minute becomes a meaningless sacrifice. <br><br>  Such a burnout is like a reckoning.  We are throwing the project as if it had suddenly become poisonous, as if we understood that we had swallowed up some rotten piece.  Here are some ways to reduce the likelihood of such a development: <br><br><ul><li>  We cannot work on projects alone.  Concentration of all responsibility on one person who does not work excessively often leads to burnout. </li><li>  Projects require a business plan.  Hope to receive material rewards allows the brain to tolerate some time with the lack of rewards. </li><li>  Information can serve as a preventive measure against burning out.  When we explain people what a burnout is, they recognize it faster and ask for help even before things go too far. </li><li>  Good tools and practices allow us to work with less stress and less dependence on one person. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Translation of the book "Social Architecture":</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Preface.  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/346064/">Crowd wisdom</a> </li><li>  Chapter 1. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/344090/">Toolkit</a> </li><li>  Chapter 2 <br>  - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/345982/">Emotional burnout of volunteers</a> <br>  - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/345688/">How to capture / protect an open-source project</a> <br>  - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/346586/">The myth of individual intelligence</a> </li><li>  Chapter 6. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/philtech/blog/342036//">Living Systems</a> </li></ul><br><br><hr><br><h3>  about the author </h3><br>  <i>‚ÄúUnfortunately, we do not choose death for ourselves, but we can meet her with dignity so that we will be remembered as men.‚Äù</i> <br>  - the movie "Gladiator" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/851/fbc/56d/851fbc56de834030ace75fd09d604877.jpg"><br><br>  Pieter Hintjens - Belgian developer, writer.
