  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Barack Obama is also in podcasting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, the regular Weekly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DiGpIT2bVZDw">YouTube video</a> from the newly elected US President Barack Obama appeared on the website <a href="http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/the_key_parts_of_the_jobs_plan/">Change.gov</a> .  It seems that the fashionable trend of ‚Äúpresidential podcasting‚Äù in the absence of microphones, annoying flashes and dozens of journalists is becoming fashionable.  In the video, Obama voiced his (?) Thoughts about the economic crisis, as well as several "innovative technical" ideas that, in truth, are far from progressive.  The President of the United States noted that the country is in 15th place in the world ranking of broadband access and made some suggestions on how to bring a network to every home. <br><br>  <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5103530/president%2Belect-obama-loves-the-internet-pledges-to-bring-it-everywhere">Gizmodo</a> notes: ‚ÄúObama usually exaggerates one or more statements about how important technology is, but today we see what he actually plans to do.  Broadband Internet access for all Americans, to every hospital and private medical office, school or other public institution.  Part of the plan to restore the country's economy lies precisely in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãhospital computerization, first of all it concerns the digitization of all medical records. ‚Äù <br><br>  Meanwhile, Gizmodo asks quite logical questions to its public: who and how will pay for this initiative (the answer is obvious: taxpayers), and how to modernize the American outback (which is also strong in its ossification)?  Time, facts and Mr. Obama will surely answer these questions.

The idea is that 533,000 people lost their jobs in November alone - one, the worst, month of layoffs in nearly 30 years.  This figure allows you to sum up the total number of jobs lost during the recession: about 2 million. <br><br>  But it's not about numbers.  The point is in each of those families where someone has lost their job.  The point is to increase the frustration and dissatisfaction that many of you experience during the holidays.  Can you take your children through college?  Can you pay for your health care?  Can you retire with dignity and confidence in your own safety?  Will the work of your husband, or daughter, or son become the one that will fall under reduction next month? <br><br>  These are questions that make many Americans wake up at night.  But this is not the first time these questions arise before us.  We have encountered many difficulties on our way in the past, in situations where it seemed that the economic dignity of the country is leaking from under the fingers.  And each time, we stood up in order to accept all difficulties, the whole nation united under the banners of a common goal.  And I know that Americans can rise again. <br><br>  But we must act - and act now.  That is why I asked my economic team to create an economic recovery plan, both for Wall Street and Main Street (meaning the middle class), which will help save or create at least two million jobs, while our infrastructure will be rebuilt, schools will improve, dependence on oil will decline, saving billions of dollars. <br><br>  We do not do it in the style of old Washington.  We will not just throw money into the problem.  We will measure progress with the reforms we are making and the results achieved - the number of jobs saved by energy, and in general how America is competitive in the modern world. <br><br>  Today, I present to you a few key points of my plan.  First, we will launch a massive project in order to make public buildings more energy-efficient.  Our government today pays the biggest bill for electricity in the world ‚Äî and that needs to be changed.  We must improve federal buildings: from changing old heating systems to installing more efficient light bulbs.  We save not only your money, the American taxpayer, but these are billions annually.  We will get people back to work. <br><br>  Secondly, we will create millions of jobs, making the single largest investment ‚Äî in our national infrastructure.  It will be similar to the creation of the 1950s federal highway system.  We invest your valuable tax dollar in new and more advanced roads, and we introduce a simple rule: use or lose (‚Äúuse it or lose it‚Äù).  If each state does not respond quickly enough to invest in roads and bridges, it will lose that money. <br><br>  Third, my economic recovery plan will attempt to launch one of the most serious and risky attempts to modernize and upgrade school buildings.  An attempt that this country has never seen before.  We will repair old schools, make them more energy-efficient, install new computers in classes.  Because in order to help our children be competitive in the economy of the 21st century, we must send them to the schools of the 21st century. <br><br>  At the same time, as we will update schools and roads, we will also deal with our information super highways.  It is unacceptable that the United States is ranked 15th in the introduction of broadband access.  Here, in the country that invented the Internet, every child should have a chance to go online - and they will get this chance now when I am president - because this is the very method by which we will increase our ability to survive in the world. <br><br>  In addition to connecting libraries and schools to the Internet, we also need to make sure that our hospitals are interconnected over the network.  In this way, our plan of economic recovery, which I propose, will modernize the health care system - and this will not only save someone from losing their jobs, it will save lives.  We will be sure that the office of every doctor and every hospital in this country is at the forefront of technological development and uses an electronic method of keeping medical records.  This will protect us from mistakes and, again, it will save billions of dollars. <br><br>  Here are a few points from the economic recovery plan, which I will announce in full in the coming weeks.  When Congress resumes its work in January, I expect them to immediately adopt a plan.  We must act with urgency, since all those who have lost and continue to lose their jobs will not wait.  And we will create these two million jobs, with the result that two million Americans will have hope for the future.  And this is exactly what I'm going to do during my time as president of the United States. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </blockquote><br><br>  I will not give a subjective assessment, because I am not well acquainted with the situation in the United States ‚Äî let everyone draw conclusions by himself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46347/</a></p>
