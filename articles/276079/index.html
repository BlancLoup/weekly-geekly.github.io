There I scribbled an ‚Äúengineering Olympiad‚Äù, where I had to make functional objects out of scotch and toilet paper, dragged a 3D printer (on which we tried to print master keys) and taught a couple of guys how to climb a window at night and smear it with toothpaste.  Oh yes, we also wrote several articles on Habr, first under strict supervision, and then independently.

We also soldered the belt for the development of neuroplasticity.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261041/">"Children's camp: bisectoral-Pythagorean triangles, brain reprogramming, radar detector and breaking handcuffs</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261041/">"</a> <br>  And they also launched a ‚Äúpirate‚Äù flash mob on the translation of the book from the editor-in-chief of WIRED (the former blackhat hacker) about the underground billionth market of carders: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/261491/">‚ÄúKingpin: schoolchildren translate a book about hackers‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  And now the team of organizers decided to launch a hackathon (and a series of lectures and workshops) on the analysis of open data and we need tips, ideas and hypotheses from habrachiteli. <br><br>  Under the cut there are a few descriptions of the event and lecturers, as well as useful materials for preparing for the hackathon.  In the comments, you can offer your problems, ideas and hypotheses for verification.  (Think of yourself as a schoolboy, what would you be interested in working on if you got into such a hackathon?) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Alena, the organizer, confessed to me why they all do this: <br><br><ul><li>  All data science and related disciplines are positioned (perceived) as very complex things and teach this only at senior courses and in SADs, but in fact there is nothing terrible there and the idea is more important.  You can safely try, do research.  Moreover, data analysis is useful in all areas, and we will show this in open lectures (with examples from CERN to advertising with banks).  And the idea there is more important than possession of complex tools. </li><li>  Secondly, we work with a generation of schoolchildren and first-year students, but we don‚Äôt know so much about it.  And it turned out that sociologists know no more.  They do time polls online by asking a question in a paper questionnaire.  In Russia, it was somehow very difficult to research social networks, we found only a few sociologists, and called them to the hackathon. </li><li>  Thirdly, this thing is educational, we want to drag and ‚Äúbite‚Äù more guys with all sorts of popular technologies that are not familiar at all at their age.  Yes, and the experiment with the mixing of schoolchildren and younger students is conscious, I want to confirm the hypothesis that the differences in their training and abilities in new fields are insignificant (or not?). </li></ul><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Organizational information</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hackathon will be held February 19-21, in Moscow, for free. <br>  Senior students and students aged 15‚Äì18 years from all over Russia who are able to program in at least one language, as well as having ideas about algorithms, data structures and databases, are invited to participate. <br><br>  To participate you must apply for participation on the site.  After that, the organizers will send you a qualifying task to analyze the subtitles for the TED conference clips, the decision of which must be sent within exactly 10 days from the moment the organizers sent you a letter.  The main and reserve list of participants will be published on February 12, their participation must be confirmed within 2 days from the date of publication of the lists. <br><br>  During the hackathon, it is necessary to formulate and test one or several hypotheses about one's generation or to develop a recommender system or service based on open data from VKontakte 15-18 year old users.  Work on the task will be held in teams of 2-3 people, the formation of which will take place in the first hours of the hackathon. <br>  Each team will be provided with a consultant who will help to overcome technical difficulties during the entire hackathon. <br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Lecturers and jury </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f59/6c0/35a/f596c035a39ba1d483a0da01a1922833.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I heard about research somewhere that after seeing a 5-second video with a teacher, a student subconsciously forms an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow effectively he will learn from him.
