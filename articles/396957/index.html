Money depreciates faster than technology (yes, that there is technology, look at buckwheat).  The difference in courses is not what it used to be.  But even now abroad you can find products with a lower cost than in Russia.  The American market offers the best level of service and high quality products.  Problems begin at the stage of delivery to Russia or the CIS countries.  Our service <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> will take the shipment to itself, and deliver the desired package in just 7-15 days straight to the apartment - much faster than from any southeastern country. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Should I buy in the United States in general, and through Pochtoy.com in particular? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c9/b3b/cb4/8c9b3bcb417841aab5c9515468ed67f0.jpg"><br><br>  Many brands are officially represented only in local stores, or are sold in Russia with an impressive mark-up.  So, Levi's jeans add in price up to 200 - 300%.  Apple products - up to 40%.  And there is also a lucrative market for ‚Äúrefurbished‚Äù electronics - laptops, smartphones and even televisions restored in official services.

      We have been using Pochtoy.com for 5 years to help users receive purchases from the United States 7-15 days before the apartment - faster than EMS delivery from China.  We do not only provide your order address.  Need - complete.  It is necessary - we will wait and unite.  And if you need to - buy, pack and send the most profitable way. <br><br>  If necessary, the user can use our US accounts to bypass the blocking of Russian bank cards.  Among them - the official <a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple. Store</a> , <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> , the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">US eBay zone</a> and <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/shops/">many others</a> .  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> also delivers products of crowdfunding projects from <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> and similar sites. <br><br><h3>  Why choose Pochtoy.com </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/195/1c9/4411951c91384514ba4e55fc5701f49c.jpg"><br><br>  With our help, you can bring any parcel (with the allowed content, of course) with dimensions up to 275 centimeters (length + perimeter) and weight up to 31 kilograms (varies by type of delivery).  Even skis and snowboards, not to mention household appliances, servers or equipment (if it is allowed for export). <br><br>  The main warehouse is located in Pennsylvania.  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/user-room/virtual_address/">A spare warehouse in Delaware is</a> required for orders that are taxed - Delaware is a kind of analogue of our free economic zone, and there are no taxes charged. <br><br>  Pochtoy.com provides free storage services for your purchases for 70 days and free storage of collected parcels for 14 days.  You can buy and complete the shipment gradually and send the parcel not immediately after the assembly, but at the moment when you have the money. <br><br>  For 5 years of work with the help of our service, more than 60 thousand parcels were sent to Russia and the CIS.  Now every month we deliver up to 9 thousand mailings - without failures and complaints about the quality of packaging, design and service. <br><br><h3>  How to buy? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4d/754/c61/e4d754c6111643f487731bb050e311be.jpg"><br><br>  To get started with our service, just register.  After registration, the user will receive an opportunity to use one of the two available methods of placing an order through Pochtoy.com for free. <br><br><h4>  "Virtual Address" </h4><br>  When using the ‚Äú <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/how_to_va/">Virtual Address</a> ‚Äù service, the buyer independently makes an order in the necessary store, and pays for the purchases on their own using their own means of payment - credit or debit cards, PayPal, WebMoney accounts and others.  After payment, you must specify the <a href="http://pochtoy.com/user-room/virtual_address/">virtual address</a> issued on Pochtoy.com during registration.  If necessary, you can use the detailed instructions (for example, <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/zappos/">how to order products on Zappos.com</a> ). <br><br>  This purchase option works with <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/shops/">most stores</a> (including Apple.Store and <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/private_sale/">closed sales sites</a> with discounts of up to 90% on certain brands). <br><br>  A ‚Äúvirtual address‚Äù is assigned free of charge to every account registered on Pochtoy.com.  When using it, the user pays only for receiving and weighing the package ($ 1).  Photo mailing label parcel, combining multiple parcels into one, removing unnecessary materials - for free.  Money for registration and dispatch is debited from the account of the account, which can be replenished in a variety of ways. <br><br><h4>  "Full support" </h4><br>  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/how_to/">This method of purchase is</a> necessary in those cases if the store does not accept Russian cards for payment or if you are afraid to order on your own.  In the form on the site, you must specify the name of the product, links to the desired goods to be purchased, and specify additional parameters (color, size, other features).  If you know the discount code - enter it in the comments to the order.  After adding all the goods and paying for the order, it will be visible to the operators.  Then Pochtoy.com will make a purchase using payment cards and the address of the service. <br><br>  With the use of the ‚ÄúFull support‚Äù service, you can purchase a custom product with unique properties, if available for purchase.  All that is required is to specify all the details when ordering, or to take a screenshot of the order page (so that you can trace all the properties of the desired product). <br><br>  "Full support" is available for auctions on eBay.  It is enough to specify the maximum purchase price you will be willing to pay for the goods.  The rate will gradually rise with the help of a bot.  If the total amount of the purchase is lower, the balance will be returned to the account of the account in the Pochtoy.com system. <br><br>  Commission for "Full support" is calculated from the cost of the order and the percentage of calculation decreases with an increase in the cost of the order.  Merging shipments, removing unnecessary boxes is as free as when using a virtual address.  More information about the tariffs can be found <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/tariffs/">here</a> . <br><br>  Using this option is possible only with a full prepayment of the order, for which you need to <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/faq_payments/">replenish your account</a> . <br><br>  As part of the options you can use additional services.  Among them: testing equipment, additional protective packaging and even urgent assembly of the package out of turn.  ‚ÄúLive‚Äù technical support with party names ‚ÄúNatalya‚Äù or ‚ÄúAlena‚Äù living inside a pop-up window will help to orient oneself in the abundance of services and their options. <br><br><h3>  Delivery </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aea/0bb/68d/aea0bb68dc144131831fe6b36f8bbc19.jpg"><br><br>  Among other mailforwarders, <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> is distinguished by the largest number of carriers available.  Due to this, the cost of delivery starts from $ 21 per kilogram parcel.  But, the greater the weight of the outgoing parcel, the more favorable the delivery terms.  The most expensive at the cost - the first kilogram, each subsequent significantly cheaper.  The minimum delivery time is 7-14 days. <br><br>  At the moment, the following delivery services are available: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Mail Express and Mail Express Light.  (Pochtoy.com's own delivery service in collaboration with Boxberry).  Delivery is carried out without the participation of "Mail of Russia".  The first one is delivered to the customer‚Äôs door.  The second - only to the regional branch of the postal service. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ USPS Priority Mail International and Express Mail International (EMS).  Regular state mail delivered to the post office and express mail delivered by courier EMS. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Econom Priority, Avia and Sea.  Delivered through the Post Office of Russia in Berlin.  "Avia" is delivered to your home by courier.  Priority and ‚ÄúSea‚Äù - only to the post office. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Light Box.  A private supplier, carrying parcels through Europe and transferring them for further delivery to the Post of Russia. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Mist-Avia and Mist-More.  Can be delivered by air and sea transport.  "Mist-More" - the cheapest, but also the slowest type of delivery of all presented. <br><br>  Delivery costs for the ‚ÄúVirtual Address‚Äù and ‚ÄúFull Escort‚Äù services are the same.  But for the convenience of users, we have released two versions of the <a href="http://pochtoy.com/calc/">Delivery Calculator</a> - for <a href="http://pochtoy.com/va_calc_new/">independent purchases</a> and for <a href="http://pochtoy.com/sa_calc_new/">purchases by operators</a> .  The first one takes into account the commission for incoming parcels, insurance of the parcel and the cost of the delivery itself.  The second one takes into account the cost of the purchases themselves (since this is necessary to determine the commissions of the service), the company's commission, the amount of insurance payment and the cost of shipping.  If you want to calculate the cost of delivery approximately, but there is no mass on the goods page in the store - you can clarify this (approximately, of course) <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/weight/">here</a> . <br><br>  For small, but at the same time expensive purchases (for example, a smartphone), the best type of sending will be ‚ÄúMail of Express‚Äù or ‚ÄúMail of Light‚Äù.  For large orders (for example, snowboards) you need to use USPS EMS - with their help you can get the goods with a length of up to 180 centimeters.  A small amount of lithium-ion batteries for personal use (which are now forbidden to send without a safety certificate by all airmail) can be sent to the Mist Sea. <br><br>  Delivery charges are also debited from the user's internal account at Pochtoy.com.  If the parcel cannot be sent in the chosen way, the operators will replace it with the most suitable one within the same postal operator or cancel the parcel, indicating the recommendations for the service and composition of the parcel. <br><br><h3>  Insurance </h3><br>  When shipping valuables across the ocean without insurance can not be.  For the most popular types of delivery "Mail Express" and "Econom" insurance is required and is included in the cost of delivery.  When choosing other types of delivery, you will decide for yourself whether you need insurance.  If a positive decision is required to pay $ 3 for every $ 100 of the estimated amount. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Insurance of goods in the package against total loss (all services) <br>  and from total loss + theft (for Qwintry and Econom, for the latter <br>  required and included in the delivery) </td><td>  $ 3 for every $ 100 </td></tr><tr><td>  Insurance of goods in the package against total loss and theft <br>  (Mail Express).  Insurance is mandatory, included in <br>  cost of delivery </td><td>  $ 0 to $ 100 = $ 2 <br>  $ 100 to $ 400 = $ 4 <br>  $ 400 to $ 700 = $ 5 <br>  $ 700 up to $ 1000 = $ 7 <br>  $ 1,000 to $ 1,200 = $ 10 </td></tr><tr><td>  Shipping insurance (in case of total loss <br>  parcels) </td><td>  $ 3 for every $ 100 </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Bonus for readers Geektimes </h3><br>  We give all our readers a promotional code ‚Äú <b>geektimes</b> ‚Äù for the free admission of incoming packages to Pochtoy.com warehouse.
