Neurobiologists from Brown University and Melbourne University studied the archive of the famous naturalist and <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09647040903506679">published</a> an article about his ‚Äúemotional‚Äù experiment in the Journal of the History of the Neurosciences.  According to the publication, Darwin showed his friends photos of people with different facial expressions. <br><br>  All images were taken by a neurologist <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%258E%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Guillaume Duchesne</a> during experiments with contractions of facial muscles.  The participants in the experiment correctly identified the emotions in the photographs.  Based on this experience, Darwin suggested that people of different cultures and nationalities <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4829.html">express their emotions</a> with the help of universal facial expressions. <br><br>  This experiment became the forerunner of modern research on cross-cultural recognition of facial expressions and pushed for a more extensive study of this topic. <br><br>  Professor of psychology at Knox College, Francis Macandrew ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_T._McAndrew">Frank McAndrew</a> ) conducted a series of studies on facial expressions and non-verbal communication.  In <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-did-the-smile-become-a-friendly-gesture-in-humans/">an interview for the scientific magazine Scientific American,</a> he noted that people do not have the need to learn to smile - this is already "pre-programmed" behavior.  For this reason, sighted and blind from birth children smile the same in the same situations. <br><br>  Scientists agree with him at the University of California at San Francisco.  They believe that " <a href="https://www.science20.com/news_releases/blind_people_use_same_emotional_expressions_because_they_are_innate_not_learned_study">mimicry is programmed into our genes</a> ."  Psychologists have analyzed more than 4 thousand photographs of Paralympic and Olympic athletes.  It turned out that blind people use the same facial expressions as the sighted.  During the medal ceremony, 85% of silver medalists smiled the same.  They used only the muscles of the mouth, but did not use other muscles that narrow the eyes and lift the cheeks. <br><br><h2>  Smile and sound </h2><br>  A smile not only externally changes a person‚Äôs face, but can affect how we speak.  This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University of Portsmouth.  They shot a video of the interview, where one group of participants in the experiment answered absurd questions. <br><br>  Based on the record, psychologists identified four main types of smiles in speaking people.  Then they gave another group of subjects to listen to their answers.  Listeners correctly identified each type of smile by voice.  Thus, people are able to <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5118.html">perceive a</a> smile at the ear.  Psychologists suggest that a smile and other facial expressions affect a person on a subconscious level.  It is believed that there are about 50 different types of smiles - from jubilant to sad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5y/-l/nl/5y-lnl7u_mfxvm8wne2fanj85-u.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/141436406%40N04/30082302878/">David Stewart</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Cognitivists from the National Center for Scientific Research of France (CNRS) went further in the study of the relationship between mimicry and sound.  The task of scientists was to understand how people react to the "auditory smile." <br><br>  The fact that a smile can be <a href="http://www.neurohumanitiestudies.eu/archivio/Emotional_Contagion.pdf">contagious</a> , scientists wrote in the XVIII century.  It is known that motor mimicry, including the genuine ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile%2523Duchenne_smile">Duchenne</a> 's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smile%2523Duchenne_smile">smile,</a> ‚Äù can cause a similar muscular reaction in the viewer.  However, as <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/07/26/what-does-a-smile-sound-like/">one of the authors of the study</a> Pablo Arias <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/07/26/what-does-a-smile-sound-like/">notes</a> (Pablo Arias), until that moment almost no one had studied how a person reacts, perceiving a smile to the ear. <br><br>  As a result of the <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(18)30752-8">experiment,</a> French researchers found out that added to the recordings of speech, the sound of a smile can make a person reflexively imitate it.  In their work, they relied on previous research on the relationship between voice and facial expressions. <br><br>  The experiment took place in several stages.  First, Arias and his colleagues analyzed how the participants in the experiment sounded when they smiled and did not smile.  They then developed and patented software that mimicked the acoustic effect of the lips, stretched into a smile.  The principle of the program does not depend on the sex of the person, the height of his voice, as well as the speed of speech or its content. <br><br>  The 35 participants in the experiment wore electrodes on their faces and watched the movement of their faces.  Upon hearing the recording, where the program artificially added the sound of a smile, the participants unconsciously included in the work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygomaticus_major_muscle">large zygomatic muscles</a> .  According to previous studies, such facial expressions are found when people see smiles and repeat them in response. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThese results show that there are similar neural mechanisms for processing both visual and audible facial expressions,‚Äù says Arias. <br><br>  You can join the experiment on the official <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cnrs_officiel">CNRS</a> page <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cnrs_officiel">on the SoundCloud website</a> .  There are <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cnrs_officiel/exemple-anglais-1">two records</a> posted by the participants. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://w.soundcloud.com/player/" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Significance of research </h2><br>  Research into the relationship between facial expressions and <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4963.html">sound</a> can help understand why people with autism experience disturbances in the interpretation of emotions.  ‚ÄúWe can understand how autists react to artificially generated emotional signals in speech,‚Äù <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2018/07/26/what-does-a-smile-sound-like/">says the</a> French scientist. <br><br>  The ability of the program to work with different languages ‚Äã‚Äãmay be of interest to companies such as Google and Amazon.  It will help improve their speech recognition and synthesis systems. <br><br>  At the moment, the cognitive program is using the program to study the sounds of anger.  The task of scientists in the future is to understand how and why people hear smiles and, possibly, other signals of mimicry. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Our microformat is the Telemania <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/">Telegram channel</a> :</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/613">Where is the music going to VK</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/619">Walmart will "listen" to employees</a></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And narratives in our blog on Yandex.DZen:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/1g/wb/lu1gwb60qf3wy2nt6xrui8tffpm.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5b0e77ae1aa80c98ec3588de/11-interesnyh-faktov-iz-istorii-brenda-marshall-5b45d025e9e97b00a985180f">11 interesting facts from the history of the brand Marshal</a> l</i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/1g/wb/lu1gwb60qf3wy2nt6xrui8tffpm.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://zen.yandex.ru/media/id/5b0e77ae1aa80c98ec3588de/4-izvestnyh-cheloveka-kotorye-uvlekalis-muzykoi-5b575630ca14c800a854832a">4 famous people who are addicted to music</a></i> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420527/</a></p>
