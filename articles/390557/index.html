      The fact that sound engineers make big money and get world renown by storming the top of the music charts inspires many young people to follow in their footsteps.  However, they do not fully understand how much time and effort is needed to achieve such heights. <br><br>  Because of his work, Thomas Graham (Thomas Graham), marketing manager, often communicates with professional sound engineers, most of whom are happy to share their experience.  Once Thomas asked them a question: ‚ÄúWhat advice can you give to students or novice sound engineers who want to do the same thing as you?‚Äù <br><br>  Mick Gazaaski, who worked with such stars as Daft Punk, Farrell Williams, Madonna and Snoop Dogg, from an early age was fond of electronics and sound.  He wanted to learn about music and sound recordings as much as possible. <br><br>  Mick says he worked in an audio store because he liked to disassemble and assemble various devices.  He even assembled a small studio at home. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúNowadays everyone has access to high-quality equipment - start with the basics, understand how these systems work, experiment!  Record a demo for a group. <br><br>  When you get comfortable with the equipment, take a couple of lessons on recording.  Now, probably, it‚Äôs not so easy to get an assistant‚Äôs work in the studio, but after the courses it would be nice to try doing it, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.avidblogs.com/sound-advice-from-the-pros-part-1/">says</a> Mick. </blockquote><br>  Craig Bauer, a Grammy-runner who has worked with celebrities such as The Clark Sisters, Kanye West and Ed Sheeran, <a href="http://www.avidblogs.com/sound-advice-from-the-pros-part-1/">believes</a> that in today's world of music you need to create opportunities for yourself: ‚ÄúPeople often ask me:‚Äú What do you need to start recording? ? ‚ÄùI always give the same answer and say that the days when it was possible to get a job as an intern and climb the career ladder, gradually mastering the music business, are long gone. <br><br>  Today it is important to be able to work with digital tools, for example with Pro Tools.  Buy yourself some installation and start exploring the question yourself on the materials from the Internet. " <br><br>  Canadian producer Noah '40' Shebib (Noah '40' Shebib) says he started with Pro Tools LE.  ‚ÄúWith it, I recorded the first works of Drake,‚Äù Noah said.  The point is that you need to start somewhere and master at least some instrument.  You do not need to make a lot of effort, download the free version of <a href="http://apps.avid.com/ProToolsFirst/">Pro Tools |</a>  <a href="http://apps.avid.com/ProToolsFirst/">First</a> .  If you are a student, a subscription will cost you only $ 10. <br><br>  Initial skills are very important, for example, see how the EQ and compressor work, why they are needed.  This will help you understand how to work with music. <br><br>  Producer Dave Aude (Dave Aude), in turn, notes that we should not downplay the importance of hard work: ‚ÄúMany buy their own computer, software, speakers, and collect a small home studio in which a dozen songs are recorded.  After that, they come to me and ask: ‚ÄúDave, I don‚Äôt feel successful.‚Äù <br><br>  My answer to this is always the same: ‚ÄúMake another 100 and ask yourself this question again.‚Äù  It is almost impossible to become successful, having gained a repertoire of 10-20 songs.  To start working with studios and famous performers, you must first gain experience. <br><br>  Important components of success are communication and dating. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe main thing is to responsibly treat your work and get to know the right people.  It would be great if you can record a demo with any of the artists - make it upscale and they will certainly notice you, ‚Äùsaid Mick Gazaacki. </blockquote><br>  Connections are a very important aspect, because the people you meet can help you get a job, and you can meet them in the schools of cities connected with the music business: Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, London. <br><br>  What to do after you noticed?  Next you need to apply all your social skills, which are just as important as sound handling skills.  Good communication skills, attentiveness to others and the ability to understand what the client wants are vital. <br><br>  You need to be stress-resistant and good for people in all situations.  For a client to contact you again, he must have an unforgettable impression of working with you.  Here it is important to remember that you are working on a client‚Äôs show or film, and not on your own.  ‚ÄúTheir opinion is more important than yours, so you need not just to be able to press the buttons and move the faders, but to be a competent diplomat,‚Äù <a href="http://www.avidblogs.com/sound-advice-from-the-pros-part-2/">said</a> Scott Weber. <br><br>  According to Scott, in most cases you will have to start from the bottom of the career ladder, and therefore you must have a goal to which you will move.  But do not hold on to her with a death grip. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou may want to become a sound designer, but if a studio needs a noise maker, become one. <br><br>  I went my way, answering "yes" to all the offers, - says Scott.  - At first I was a sound engineer, then a sound effect editor, then a noise maker, and only after that I became a re-recording specialist. <br><br>  It took many years.  Always learn something new and say yes more often than not. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Thus, if you want to succeed as a sound engineer, then: <br><br><ul><li>  collect a small studio and experiment, learn more about the audio equipment; </li><li>  study materials on the topic and new technologies online; </li><li>  train, train and train again, develop a repertoire; </li><li>  try to get to know the right people; </li><li>  pump social and communication skills; </li><li>  Do not refuse the job that you offer. </li></ul><br>  In conclusion, I would like to bring the universal advice that Noah Shebib shared, he said: ‚ÄúThe best advice I can give is to work with what you have and try to get the best result.  You will see how doors will open in front of you that will take you where you want. ‚Äù <br><br>  Materials on the topic: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/259950/">Engineer's opinion: How to create your own ecosystem of sound;</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/270238/">Old new sound: Opinions of the engineer and music lover;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/269310/">Development of acoustics: Who needs it;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/shop/cat-100.html">Section "Professional Audio".</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390557/</a></p>
