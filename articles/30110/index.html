  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 reasons to create an account on My Compass</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I myself have been using the service for a long time and I was delighted when the creative team <a href="http://www.moikompas.ru/">My Compass</a> published on the project's blog those very reasons that make this site convenient and in many ways irreplaceable. <br><br>  <strong>1. All on the shelves</strong> <br>  Almost all of us use social bookmarks, collecting information on a particular topic.  And all is well, as long as we are dealing with a small number of links.  But sometimes the critical volume of links (150-300 or more) accumulates, it is very easy to get confused in them.  Even the tags do not always save, and sometimes it takes too much time to find the MOST link that is urgently needed right now. <br>  On moikompas.ru, the user has the opportunity to place all the links, like books, by lists and "sign backs".  In the future, this will greatly facilitate the search for material to which we urgently need to return.  And what is especially convenient - all links (video, graphic and text materials) are on the same page before the user's eyes.  Having once ordered all the materials in one place, we save our time, which could be spent on a repeated search. <br><br>  <strong>2. Quick knowledge sharing</strong> <br>  Often we have to transfer accumulated information to others.  For example, an experienced traveler advises low-cost airline airlines or resources where you can download electronic maps of the area to beginners.  In this case, you have to go to the bookmarks, search for the necessary links and send them to the applicant.  It takes a lot of time.  It is much easier and faster to send the interested person just one link.  A link to the compass, in which you have previously all clearly lined up and inserted the necessary links.

      <strong>3. Blog Substitute</strong> <br>  Each of us is an expert in any field.  Many people want to share their experience, show their professionalism?  You can, of course, start a blog.  But what to do if there is a catastrophic lack of time for regular writing posts and there is no desire to write all the time on the same topic.  Start creating compasses - a great way to pass on your knowledge to others.  In this case, you are not obliged to make each new compass strictly on schedule and stick to one theme, so as not to lose readers.  If the compass is interesting and useful, readers will always be there.  If you are an expert in a question that you disclose in your compass, you will definitely appreciate it! <br><br>  <strong>4. Self-expression</strong> <br>  An active person?  An aspiring writer who is tired of ‚Äúwriting to the table‚Äù?  Amateur journalist?  Tracer?  Want to attract attention or find like-minded people?  Make a compass about yourself, tell about your hobby, put your achievements on the page, be it a text, a note or a video.  Let others know about you! <br><br>  <strong>5. New visitors</strong> <br>  You are the owner of a commercial web resource and wish to draw public attention to it, to attract new visitors (customers).  Make a compass about your child, tell about your product (service) to a potential consumer, wake up his interest.  But do not fall into spamming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30110/</a></p>
