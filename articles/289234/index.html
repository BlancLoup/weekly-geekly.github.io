  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a company. Mission, Goals and Principles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, dear friends.  I am glad to present for your discussion my vision of the technology of creating a company.  The first article - the definition of the mission, goals and principles of the company.  After all, without them anywhere, right? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To create the mission, goals and principles of your company, you can use ready-made solutions.  However, think about whether such a mission, goals and principles belong to your company. <br>  The concept of mission and goals, I am sure, you have met more than once when trying to create your own business.  And always, most likely, you are faced with a certain obligation of these concepts: "... come up with a mission, without it there is no company ...", "... only on the basis of the choice of the company's mission you will develop in the right direction ...".  Sounds like a threat, doesn't it?  So what is the mission and goals of the company? <br><br>  <b>MISSION</b> <br><br>  In fact, the mission exists in any organization that is newly created: if it is not formulated, this does not mean that it does not exist.  In order to say at least to yourself what the mission of my company is, it is worth answering a few simple questions. <br><ul><li>  What do I want to do? </li><li>  Will the activities of my company be useful? </li><li>  Will my business bring enough profit for its existence and development? </li><li>  What can my company give to society and the state? </li></ul><br>  I will give an example.  Ask your friends if any of them have a desire to open their own business.  Of course, there will be such people who will say: this is difficult, large expenses are required, etc.  But you check with them: if setting up your own business would be as simple as going to the movies, would you create your own business?  I am sure the answer will be yes.  After that, ask them the above questions, and you will see how the mission of their newly invented company is born right before your eyes.

      <b>What do I want to do?</b>  <i>I want to open dentistry.</i> <br><br>  <b>Will the activities of my company be useful?</b>  <i>Yes, dentistry is a very popular branch of medicine.</i>  <i>Potential customers - all categories of the population.</i> <br><br>  <b>Will my business bring enough profit for its existence and development?</b>  <i>The services of a good dentist will always be paid and generate income.</i>  <i>It is only necessary to properly distribute your cash flow, namely, income should always be compared with expenses.</i> <br><br>  <b>What can my company give to society and the state?</b>  <i>Good dentistry will raise the level of services rendered to the population (healthy competition), give new jobs to the city, bring taxes to the state‚Äôs treasury</i> (and so on). <br><br>  Let's open, for example, the dentistry "Smile".  Consider several options for the mission of dentistry: <br><ul><li>  The mission of our company is to discover new facets in the field of medicine. </li><li>  Or this: The mission of our company is to make the world more beautiful with the smiles of happy people. </li><li>  Or the third option: The mission of our company is to give comfort and joy to people.  (Simple and true) </li></ul><br>  You may notice that the mission of the company is very similar to its slogan.  I do not argue, coincidences may occur: the slogan may coincide with the mission. <br><br>  <b>GOALS</b> <br><br>  For the purpose of the company, everything is a little simpler and more practical.  The rules for forming the goals of any company can be described in one sentence: what should I do to make my company successfully exist and develop (I want to make people happier).  For this, I need to have: <br><ul><li>  There were customers </li><li>  I could satisfy their demand </li><li>  There were opportunities for the development of my company </li></ul><br><br>  Result: <br><ul><li>  In order for me to have clients, our company must be known and recognizable. </li><li>  In order for people to remain satisfied with the quality of our services, we must hire only qualified specialists, we must have a good tool and comply with all legal requirements. </li><li>  For the development of my company, I need to always improve the quality of the services provided by training personnel, purchasing new equipment and enhanced advertising in the market. </li></ul><br><br>  The goals of dentistry "Smile": <br><ul><li>  To become a well-known and recognizable company in the market of dental services. </li><li>  To have in their arsenal only the professionals of their work and the most modern tool. </li><li>  Constantly invest in the development of their capabilities. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>PRINCIPLES</b> <br><br>  When developing this item, remember that everyone has principles.  A principle in a general sense is a rule, a model of behavior of one or another subject.  That is, there are always regularities in the actions of any person or organization.  For a legal entity (firm), principles are a kind of code of honor, moral rules of conduct. <br><br>  Declaring and observing its principles, the company will benefit from the fact that it will cooperate with, as there is confidence that the behavior of your company is orderly, regular and will not bring unpleasant surprises for those with whom you cooperate (customers, suppliers, investors and other ). <br><br>  When creating the principles of the company, you can use the universal principles of behavior, edited for commercial enterprise. <br><ul><li>  Honesty and trust </li><li>  Punctuality and timeliness </li><li>  Quality assurance and so on, that you consider your positive qualities. </li></ul><br>  Make yourself the principles that you are proud of in yourself, and transfer them to your company. <br><br>  PS It is worth adding that missions, goals and principles can be changed, added, deleted, added, edited and rethought. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289234/</a></p>
