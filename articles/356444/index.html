  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The threshold of votes for the consideration of people's petitions by the State Duma will be reduced by 3 times</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2897532">an agreement was signed</a> between the State Duma and the foundation in charge of the Russian Public Initiative website.  Under the new rules, petitions may be sent to the State Duma, which received not 100 thousand votes, but three times less - 35 thousand.  Some responsible persons believe that this threshold can be reduced to 25 thousand votes. <br><br>  The Russian Public Initiative portal was created in 2013 on the initiative of Vladimir Putin.  The portal serves to place petitions - this right can be used by all citizens of Russia registered at the state portal ‚ÄúGosuslugi‚Äù.  The popular petition, which received 100,000 votes, is sent for review by an expert group, which may recommend the State Duma to consider the petition and, possibly, translate it into a draft law. <br><br>  For more than two years, <a href="https://www.roi.ru/complete/">only 9 petitions collected</a> 100 thousand votes, and they have not yet become bills.  Unfortunately, a set of votes by petition does not automatically mean that the idea described in it will become law.  Moreover, some of the petitions do not even reach consideration by the Duma ‚Äî although Putin, expressing this idea in a pre-election letter, mentioned the need for ‚Äúcompulsory consideration in parliament‚Äù of these initiatives. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúLaw enforcement practice has shown that not everyone, to put it mildly, goes to the Duma,‚Äù said Ilya Massuh, head of the Information Democracy Foundation.  - And Lebedev and I (Vice-Speaker in charge of the working group on e-parliament) began to think about how to include the Duma in the process so that the initiatives could get there directly.  The decisions of the expert working group of the government are less legitimate than the deputies, if they reject the bill.  Therefore, the idea was born that the initiatives are sent to the State Duma to familiarize the deputies and continue to vote on the ROI.  Some deputy might think that she is interesting. "

      Minister Mikhail Abyzov, who oversees the working group on the consideration of petitions under the government, believes that ‚ÄúCivil initiatives that have gained a significant number of votes and received support from a large part of the population should be taken into account by the authorities‚Äù, and the threshold for passing them to the Duma can be reduced to 25 thousand. dealt with more promptly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356444/</a></p>
