It will appear on the IBM Design website.  So far, there is general information about the company's initiatives, but in a recent speech, Phil Gilbert (the head of the design of the corporation) <a href="http://www.aiga.org/video-gain-2014-gilbert/">spoke in some detail about these guidelines</a> (the specifics begin in the second half). <br><br>  The design language of IBM will describe the general principles, visual and interface guidelines, techniques and tools of work.  In particular, they proposed their own variation of design thinking, more pragmatic and applicable in real life.  Judging by the shown sketches of real products, it falls on the life of a corporation very well. <br><br>  The company is over a hundred years old and during this time it has been able to reinvent itself several times and get out of severe crises.  They also approached the design systematically, as well as everything else - the strategy of its introduction into the life of the company is impressive, as is the scale (the design staff must reach 1,000 people).

About how to read a lot, know and not go nuts.  The complexity of modern products is growing, and the format of the work of modern product teams is becoming more dynamic.  We are expected to have a sufficiently high level of professional erudition, which is not easy to recruit, and supporting is even harder. <br><br>  I work closely with information on the profession and structure understanding of its areas that I work with or will probably work in the future.  Initially, I spent a lot of time on this, but gradually I learned how to cope with this hellish flow, so now it takes an hour and a half a day.  The presentation explained why I consider this important, how the information flows are arranged and how it helps me to practice.
