  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Workreactor: Freelance vs Business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/freelance/113224/">described for virtual community the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa virtual corporation</a> - a new scheme of labor relations in the digital age. <br><br>  I argued that the main problem with the wide distribution of distant work lies precisely in the inappropriate management system - the traditional corporate culture.  But there is no doubt that the future of mankind is in distributed, decentralized, virtual companies.  Obviously, for most types of work, where the employee‚Äôs workplace is a computer, there is no point in constantly moving the physical body from home to office and back, in fact, there are only two reasons for this: <br><ol><li>  When the workflow is not organized clearly, constant and intensive communication between employees is required in order to jointly work out ways to resolve emerging issues and coordinate their actions. </li><li>  When employees have no direct personal interest in the quality result of their work, managers have to tightly control them, personally observing employees. </li></ol><br>  For five years, my colleagues and I have explored in our experience the possibility of alternative organization of labor relations, more suitable for remote work in the modern digital era.  And they came to the conclusion that a qualitative change in this issue can only occur if the following two conditions are met: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Replacing the boss-slave relationship to the contracting customer, the lack of a hierarchy of subordination, all employees are equal, if someone needs something from another, he simply orders this job from him, </li><li>  Refusal of long-term labor relations (employment contracts) in favor of micro-contracts - small clear tasks beyond which there are no mutual obligations between employees. </li></ol><br>  And we, as enthusiastic programmers, fixed our experience by creating an information system implementing these principles.  And today we want to present you the result of our work - <a href="http://workreactor.ru/">Workreactor social management system for business</a> . <br><br>  The service is built on a combination of two concepts - a social network and a task management system. <br><ol><li>  By organization, it is a social network, i.e.  Each of the peers on the network can establish relationships and communicate with any other member.  However, instead of friendships (as in general-purpose social networks), participants enter into agreements among themselves, which are essentially cooperation agreements, and communication takes place in the form of setting and performing tasks and mutual settlements. </li><li>  At its core, it is a task and settlement management system where relationships with customers and contractors are taken into account.  It allows you at any time to see the full picture of the work in progress and financial balance. </li></ol><br>  Here are some features of the system, a more complete list can be found in <a href="http://about.workreactor.ru/features.html">the user manual</a> .

      <b>Coordination of conditions</b> <br>  Consistently transfer a task or agreement between partners until agreement is reached on all parameters.  Also unprofitable for the participant cash transactions always require confirmation. <br><br>  <b>Engagement levels</b> <br>  The unobtrusive scheme of engaging a partner in working with the system is applied: <br><ul><li>  full participant uses all the features of the service, </li><li>  if the customer does not want to understand the interface, you can contribute everything yourself, and he will limit himself only to confirming the statement of the task, accepting work, monetary transactions, etc. </li><li>  if the customer does not enter the system at all, he will simply receive automatic notifications: ‚Äúthe work has been started‚Äù, ‚Äúcomment on the task‚Äù, ‚Äúthe work is done‚Äù, etc., </li><li>  the customer may not even be aware of the existence of the system, then he will appear simply as a client in the CRM system. </li></ul><br>  <b>Delegation of work</b> <br>  It is possible to quickly delegate work - breaking up large tasks into smaller ones and assigning them to individual performers ... <br><br>  <b>Time tracking</b> <br>  Tasks can be paid for by the hourly or piece-rate scheme, after accepting work on the task, its cost is automatically recorded in the calculations.  For convenient accounting of working time there is a timer, the customer sees what task the executor is working on now. <br><br>  At this point in time, freelancers are closest to the described organization of labor relations, so we focus Workreactor primarily on: <br><ul><li>  freelancers who want to scale up their activities, </li><li>  freelancers who want to build an autonomous business on the basis of their activities, </li><li>  companies that work with freelancers and use outsourcing. </li></ul><br>  We ourselves use Workreactor in our business and will actively develop and refine it, we want to end up with an integrated ERP system that allows you to organize your business on new, freer and modern principles and take another step from the slave corporate culture towards the new free world without borders and dependencies. <br><br>  We invite everyone to join the beta testing of the system, we will be glad to any comments, comments and suggestions. <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://workreactor.ru/">workreactor.ru</a> - project site <br>  <a href="http://about.workreactor.ru/">User's manual</a> <br>  <a href="http://blog.workreactor.ru/">Project Blog</a> <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/">Our Twitter</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136484/</a></p>
