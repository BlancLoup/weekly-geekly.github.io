At this time, the choice fell on the company Westone, a little less known in Russia.  But it is known in the USA: for example, the headphones of this company are used by the armed forces of this country.  In addition, the company produces sound equipment for medical purposes - hearing aids, etc., as well as monitors for musicians, headphones for military and athletes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97a/423/e23/97a423e23ce3790193204990af72447a.png" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  In 1959, the company Westone first in the world began to produce individual headphones for intra-ear imprint, ideally suited to the ear.  It was at first a modest family business in Colorado.  In the photo - inside the form there is an earpiece made by the impression. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/add/385/6c9/add3856c927e0641746a90ba2ae846f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the moment, the company produces equipment, instruments and accessories for doctors and people with hearing problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e3/721/4ce/9e37214cefd16126f40290e404ec9a6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In order to make an individual earpiece, a special material is used.  It is poured into the ear, after which you can work with the resulting form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/387/234/912/38723491289868c611e8449b8d5f3ac7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the company produces everything that is possible, for the treatment, diagnosis of hearing.  These are various hearing aids, instruments for doctors, models for installation in clinics, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/205/56c/17c/20556c17cb2e35a7316c23c6ec59666c.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/402/6a0/cfd4026a0807c957c2917c8f5e6ac8f1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Offtop</b> <br>  I will reveal the topic of hearing prosthetics in a new article that will be included in the cycle of posts that I started with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">Health!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">Wearable devices in sports and medicine</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212723/">Expanding capabilities</a> .  Also on the way is an article about devices for the visually impaired. <br><br><h4>  Monitors for musicians </h4><br>  The main thing for Westone is hearing protection.  Who needs it: musicians, pilots, motorcyclists, cyclists, call center operators.  Here is a useful table ‚Äúhow to lose your hearing.‚Äù  So the company expanded its product range, taking up the production of goods for these categories.  Keep a useful sign about "how to lose your hearing." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d9/492/5f4/1d94925f413e2eafc8696ae667c462ad.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  It all began in 1987, when Etymotic offered Westone to jointly develop headphones for musicians.  The goal was to create headphones that protect hearing.  That is, at least they will not harm one of the most important organs for a musician.  The production of Etymotic headphones has begun.  Westone was responsible for developing comfortable soft tips. <br><br>  In 1990, there was an important step in the production of headphones for musicians: Westone was the first to use rebar drivers in monitors.  The feature of headphones with a balanced anchor is that the effect on the radiating membrane occurs with the help of a movable anchor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/408/13b/2e6/40813b2e6223b367cbf23e3fc5474fbc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1995, Alex Van Halen had a problem: he did not hear over the drum set that other members of his group sang and played.  Louder monitors did not help.  Jerry Harvey, the sound engineer of the group, found a solution: he assembled two-driver headphones capable of blocking noise and producing sufficiently high-quality sound.  At first, other members of the group became interested in developing, then Skid Row joined, while touring with Van Halen - they sold six pairs for three thousand bucks.  After pop singer Engelbert Humperdink also wanted one, Harvey decided to start Ultimate Ears.  And the company Westone helped to refine these headphones and took up their production.  In 1998, among the clients of the UE were The Rolling Stones, Enrique Iglesias and Red Hot Chili Peppers. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ErdPPJiGyIk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgPJBOKHCjUrPj-l1x2kxGBhL9-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf3/44b/00f/bf344b00f4e0313dd189ad033d5236d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1996, together with the Shure company, universal intra-channel monitors were developed, to which a set of nozzles went.  Not as convenient as on the cast, but you can choose the best option.  In the photo - soundproof monitor E1.  All Westone headphones - with a balanced anchor, or rebar.  In the lower price segment such simply does not happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d33/08f/8e3/d3308f8e318d8445fe10429ce45c1d97.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These are E5 dual-drive monitors, released in 1999. The landing is again versatile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08a/9b7/a33/08a9b7a33999b76b4e07fb75bcb1f358.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now the company produces five product lines - headphones and monitors for musicians.  The first is the Universal Series monitors.  It includes models UM Pro 10, UM Pro 20, UM Pro 30, UM Pro 50. In the photo - UM Pro 10, reinforcement headphones with one radiator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/5d2/02d/f675d202df74a840609f5a7ce40ee71e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  UM Pro 50 - reinforcement headphones with five emitters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f1/ddb/54b/1f1ddb54bb940e23ae822e993440e0b4.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  The next line is the W Series.  In the photo - W50, with five emitters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87f/ea6/ec1/87fea6ec104f17e386d85726bf4124e0.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  At CES 2014, the W60 was introduced - these headphones each have two emitters for low, mid and high frequencies.  One of the advantages of the entire series is a detachable wire with a coaxial connector.  This wire is with the headset.  Convenient, of course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14c/350/9c7/14c3509c794316ae7c100c9ed5a90ee2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Elite Series monitors are made on the ear of a musician. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df9/75a/67e/df975a67e6138b51f12574875f2718a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  CR10 - Consumer Recreational. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dff/7ae/e66/dff7aee66e850b784246f86f99aafc8b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Monitors for musicians AC10 and AC20. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2de/bae/51c/2debae51c039b117d18bc8f58334e64c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the fifth "family" - universal adapters for headphones and monitors UM56. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/127/cff/a70/127cffa70fa12eef0a92d930dbeb97fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Headphones </h4><br>  This part is more interesting for the average user.  And for an audiophile. <br><br>  Remember the walkman?  In 1985, Westone developed headphone jacks for this player.  First, the headphones have become damn comfortable, unlike the competitors currently available.  Secondly, the low frequencies in them sounded much better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ae/449/d8e/7ae449d8e4e531764257384e63fc56f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2002, reinforcement headphones with a single emitter UM1 were released.  This is the first headphones under the brand Westone, which were produced for mere mortals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee6/736/1b2/ee67361b2514d00e21b63469f9a9d6fb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Westone 3 headphones - rebar with three emitters, designed for the consumer market.  They were released in 2008.  A year later, Westone 1 and 2 appeared for the same purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdb/c51/134/fdbc51134018f4139fe13e4897453ca4.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2012, the 4R line is on sale. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sMmIpjug54g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpOQ1Eo3WVI723pY2j3q5YdfJKqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52e/254/90d/52e25490d5f31be24208a05e0c481b8f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At CES 2014, the W Series headphones mentioned in the product section for musicians were presented.  They will suit ordinary users.  For example, for a W60 with six emitters, you can also buy a wire with a headset so that you can use them every day with a smartphone.  The voice of the wife will be transferred qualitatively, more than ever!  If the carrier does not fail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/e3b/165/07be3b1658cf1fddfde3be2aa7d52669.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Warfare </h4><br>  As it was shown in the table, closer to the beginning of the post, the rumble from the take-off of a jet plane can ruin the rumor completely.  Therefore, everyone who deals with airplanes and helicopters needs to take care of their ears.  For the military, Westone produces headphones that protect the ears, and at the same time allow you to hear where the co-workers are going to fly and where to shoot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97a/423/e23/97a423e23ce3790193204990af72447a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/341/64b/d1e/34164bd1e59be629475cdd02b906ff43.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  The key series in this direction is ACCES, Attenuating Custom Communications Earpiece System.  If anyone knows, Aces are aces or aces.  See, therefore, called so consonant.  The picture on the right shows the pressure stabilizing headphones designed for pilots.  To these headphones there are also many additional features, such as a clip for a helmet, allowing you to remove the wire, and the cable attached to the oxygen mask. <br><br>  Elite Series monitors are offered the same case as ACCES.  It includes hygiene products, including headphone grease.  Case itself shockproof and waterproof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/b97/8b7/bd9b978b7ff7963bb8b9ce45e7d10407.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is interesting: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194662/">Nintendo story led by Hiroshi Yamauchi</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/217015/">Samsung Electronics History: From Dried Fish to High Tech</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216321/">To health!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/216321/">Ten most interesting new products of 2014</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">To health!</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212633/">Wearable devices in sports and medicine</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212723/">Expanding opportunities</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228033/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228033/</a></p>
