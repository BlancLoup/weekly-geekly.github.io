As a result of semi-annual development from scratch, this <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/">web service has</a> turned out <a href="http://lingualeo.ru/">to master the English language online</a> .

      As promised, the place is transferred to a new promising startup.  The winner was the startup MyInviter - a <a href="http://www.myinviter.com/">web service for sharing invites.</a> <br><br>  The head of statrapa Inviter shares his impressions of the first days of development on a tropical island and invites talented professionals to the team. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To be honest, I‚Äôm still that Peter, because I‚Äôve been looking for a way to get from Raska somewhere to warmer lands.  Perhaps you found on Habr√© a wave of posts on the topic * It's time to dump *, and among them was a wonderful article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/migration/59790/">IT-emigration to the Land of Smiles, to Thailand</a> , which finally inspired me to slowly start collecting suitcases.  Why Thailand?  The answer to this question can be formulated by reading the article, and for me personally, the determining factors were the ease of obtaining and extending the visa, the relative cheapness of life, the tropical climate and the excellent ecology. <br><br>  By the way, in view of the preparation for the move, I enthusiastically perceived the appearance of a post on Habr√© about LinguaLeo and became one of its first users :).  It was all the more interesting for me to learn that the guys are developing in the jungles of Thailand.  Wow, I thought, smart people think the same way.  And took the post on the pencil.  Well, you never know, ask something in a neighbor's closer to the point.  As time went on, we ended up resolving issues related to the upcoming relocation.  And when already it was actually only for buying tickets, a new <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/lingualeo/blog/90460/">post</a> appeared.  Do I have to say how much he ended up in the topic, which I immediately wrote about in a personal LinguaLeo.  After the celebration of the Thai New Year (there are already 2053 here, so there is no need to fear the arrival of 2012) and not long negotiations, it was decided that a place in the sun would still get Inviter. <br><br><img src="http://img121.imageshack.us/img121/8054/ddwm46fh8gxq4gzjvb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a result, on arrival we were given a beautiful big house, a server with computer peripherals, office furniture and kote, which is inherited by those who are already owners. <br><br><img src="http://img535.imageshack.us/img535/1181/ddwm46fh7g32h6fgqb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first days, of course, almost did not work, but settled down.  Acclimatization, again, played its role - the heat was unimaginable.  But when the exhaustion after the flight subsided a bit - completely and completely covered with a wave of positive.  Around nature, palm trees, clean air, and from the window in front of the workplace - ocean view.  Just for the sake of this kind of cost here to move.  Around smiling faces.  If a person does not smile, it most likely belongs to a European, and most likely to a Russian.  By the way, there are not many tourists in the low season, and mostly they are Germans or our countrymen.  And on the market next to the house for 700 rubles the floors of Lacoste are sold, exactly the same as in the Evropeisky shopping mall.  Immediately you understand the ridiculous price of Ponte, on which you have to spend most of your life for the residents of megalopolises ... <br><br><img src="http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/4064/ddwm46fh9gz4fqd5qb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Briefly about our service (deployed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/75121/">here</a> ).  The <a href="http://www.myinviter.com/">Inviter</a> Online Service is an online exchange of invitations - invitations to participate in other services.  Using the service, Internet users can receive invitations for themselves or share such invites with other Internet users.  As always, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãideas and plans, including fast monetization ... <br><br>  And in a month spent in Thailand, my companion and I completed a great job - we translated the site into English, so that, to some extent, he owes the English-speaking incarnation to the country of smiles.  By the way, today we will release the English version of the service at Digg, so if among you, dear readers, there are Digg users - do a good deed, vote for <a href="http://digg.com/software/MyInviter_n_Easy_way_to_get_Invite_to_closed_resources">our news</a> .  Again, taking this opportunity, I propose to take part in the translation of the resource into other languages ‚Äã‚Äã- for starters, German, French, Chinese.  In my opinion, excellent practice and an example of non-standard work for a portfolio. <br><br>  Actually, this post was originally conceived in order to find employees for our project, but since the startup is entirely funded from the personal budget (investors), and moving on this budget hit quite hard, the maximum that I can offer potential employees at the moment - A roof over your head in a paradise.  Not the worst option, I must say, especially if there is at least some kind of independent financial support.  And they are looking for, as before, experienced PHP programmers with excellent knowledge of ZendFramework, as well as developers who have experience with the API for Vkontakte and Facebook applications.  Even if there is no desire to move somewhere from a familiar place, but there is experience, time and a desire to work - write, perhaps in the foreseeable future, we will find an opportunity to compensate for the work and remote workers. <br><br>  A big request to those who are interested - please write in a personal immediately indicating your skills, completed projects, the amount of free time and the conditions under which you are ready to take part in the project. <br><br><img src="http://img37.imageshack.us/img37/6441/ddwm46fh6ff2bw3g4b.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96723/</a></p>
