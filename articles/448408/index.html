  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DCIM - the key to data center management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  According to analysts of the company iKS-Consulting, by 2021 the increase in the number of server racks at the largest data center service providers in Russia will reach 49 thousand.  And their number in the world, according to Gartner, has long exceeded 2.5 million. </p><br><p>  For modern enterprises, the data center is the most valuable asset.  The demand for data storage and processing resources is constantly growing, and with it, electricity tariffs are rising.  Traditional monitoring and management systems cannot answer the questions about how much electricity is consumed, who consumes it and how to save it. <a name="habracut"></a>  They do not help to find answers to other questions of data center service specialists: </p><br><ul><li>  How to ensure uninterrupted operation of the center? </li><li>  How to configure equipment and create a reliable infrastructure for critical elements? </li><li>  How to establish effective management of the most active sites? </li><li>  How to improve data center management system? </li></ul><br><p>  That is why DCIM comes to replace outdated non-integrated systems - the latest data center monitoring and management system, which allows to reduce costs, answer the questions posed and solve a number of other equally important tasks: </p><br><ul><li>  elimination of causes of failures; </li><li>  increase data center power; </li><li>  increase return on investment; </li><li>  staff reduction. </li></ul><br><p>  DCIM brings together all the hardware and IT infrastructure components on a single platform and provides complete information for making management decisions and quality data center services. </p><br><p>  The system in real time monitors power consumption, displays energy efficiency indicators (PUE), controls environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, pressure ...) and the work of information resources - servers, switches and storage systems. </p><br><h2>  Three examples of DCIM solutions </h2><br><p>  Briefly describe how the DCIM-system <a href="https://www.deltapowersolutions.com/ru-ru/mcis/data-center-infrasuite-manager.php" title="Delta InfraSuite Manager (DCIM)">Delta InfraSuite Manager was implemented</a> at different enterprises and what results were achieved. </p><br><p>  <strong>1.</strong> <strong>Taiwanese semiconductor component development company.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Specialization:</strong> development of integrated circuits for wireless communications, DVD / Bluray devices, high-definition television. </p><br><p>  <strong>Task.</strong>  Implement a full-fledged DCIM solution in a new mid-sized data center.  The most important parameter is continuous monitoring of the energy efficiency indicator (PUE).  It was also supposed to monitor the state of the entire working environment, power systems, cooling, access to the room, logic controllers and other equipment. </p><br><p>  <strong>The decision</strong> <strong>.</strong>  Three modules of the Delta InfraSuite Manager system (Operation Platform, PUE Energy, Asset) are installed.  This made it possible to integrate disparate components into a single system, where all information from the elements of the data center infrastructure began to flow.  To control costs, a virtual electricity meter was developed. </p><br><p>  <strong>Result:</strong> </p><br><ul><li>  reduced average repair time (MTTR); </li><li>  increase in the availability of services and environmental data center; </li><li>  reduced electricity costs. </li></ul><br><p>  Despite the fact that with the help of the data center monitoring and management system, you can solve a wide range of tasks, you first need to focus on the main problem - the pain point of the business, where DCIM implementation will bring maximum benefit. </p><br><p>  <strong>2.</strong> <strong>Indian company Tata Communications.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Specialization: the</strong> world's largest provider of telecommunications services. </p><br><p>  <strong>Task.</strong>  For eight data centers, each of which occupies a four-story building with two halls, where 200 racks are installed, it was required to create a centralized data warehouse on IT equipment.  Operating parameters should be continuously monitored and displayed for real-time analysis.  In particular, it is important to see the power consumption and power consumption for each rack. </p><br><p>  <strong>Decision.</strong>  Deployed Delta InfraSuite Manager as part of Operation Platform, Asset, and PUE Energy modules. </p><br><p>  <strong>Result.</strong>  The customer sees data on electricity consumption in all racks and their tenants.  Receive individual reports on power consumption.  Monitors data center performance in real time. </p><br><p>  <strong>3. The</strong> <strong>Dutch company Bytesnet.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Specialization:</strong> provider of computing services, providing services for the placement and rental of servers. </p><br><p>  <strong>Task.</strong>  The data center located in the cities of Groningen and Rotterdam was required to implement an energy infrastructure.  The data center-wide PUE indicators were planned to be used to develop energy efficiency and cost reduction measures. </p><br><p>  <strong>Decision.</strong>  Installing the Operation Platform and PUE Energy modules of the Delta InfraSuite Manager system and integrating a number of devices of different brands to optimize monitoring. </p><br><p>  <strong>Result: The</strong> staff was able to observe the work of the data center equipment.  PUE indicators provided managers with the necessary information to improve work efficiency and reduce energy costs.  Data on the changing load on the cooling system and other important parameters allowed the company's specialists to ensure the availability of critical applications and equipment. </p><br><p>  Modular DCIM solutions make it possible to implement the system in stages.  First, the first module of the system is put into operation, for example, to control energy consumption, and then all the other modules in order. </p><br><h2>  DCIM's future </h2><br><p>  DCIM solutions make IT infrastructure transparent.  Together with power monitoring, this makes it possible to minimize downtime in the work of the data center, which is costly for the business.  Centers approaching their capacity limit, installing DCIM helps increase the return on existing infrastructure and delay new financial injections. </p><br><p>  Analyzing the state of the working environment, the available capacity and the capacity to increase it, companies begin to plan their capabilities using precise data.  This helps to avoid financial risks in the form of unjustified investments. </p></div>
