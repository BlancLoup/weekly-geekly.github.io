  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3D printing as a marketing tool</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Although the history of three-dimensional printing dates back to the 80s of the twentieth century, only in the current decade, 3D printers have become widely available technology.  They opened up new opportunities for small and large companies operating in various industries. <br><br>  Over the past five years, people have tried to print <a href="https://russian.rt.com/article/78172">buildings</a> , <a href="http://prototypster.ru/blog/post/52/">prototypes of cars</a> , <a href="http://prototypster.ru/blog/post/76/">medical implants</a> , <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/15/3d-printing-revolutionising-guitar-making">musical instruments</a> , <a href="https://i.materialise.com/blog/fashion-meets-3d-printing-an-overview-of-anouk-wipprechts-amazing-tech-dresses">clothes</a> , <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2015/10/07/adidas-creates-3d-printed-futurecraft-soles-to-mimic-runners-footprints/">shoes</a> , and even <a href="http://prototypster.ru/blog/post/140/">jewelry</a> .  For example, in the Netherlands a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/17/dutch-startup-plans-first-3d-printed-steel-bridge-to-span-amsterdam-canal">bridge</a> over one of the canals in Amsterdam is being prepared for printing.  3D printing is also used by brands to promote their products.  This is not surprising, because technological innovations of this caliber are able to interest a large audience.  Here are some examples of the use of three-dimensional printing in advertising activities of trademarks of various directions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Print yourself and your family (Coca-Cola, ASICS and ASDA)</b> <br><br>  The most common use of 3D printing in promotional activities are events during which participants can scan miniature copies of themselves after scanning.  An example would be the <a href="http://www.coca-colacompany.com/stories/say-hello-to-my-little-friend-coke-israel-invites-consumers-to-create-mini-replicas-of-themselves/">Coca-Cola promotion</a> held in 2013 in Israel, promoting a new small bottle.  The company held a contest in which participants with the help of a special mobile application had to create a mini-copy of themselves.  The winners were invited to the Coca-Cola plant, where their real miniature copies were made (after a full scan of their bodies). <br>  The same idea was used by ASICS to attract attention and promote the brand at the New York Marathon in 2014.  Previously, she suggested that registered participants send their photo via e-mail (using a special website for this purpose).  Then the company transformed the first 500 received images into 3D models and <a href="http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/asics-salutes-500-nyc-marathon-runners-3-d-printing-statues-them-161147">printed them</a> .  Athletes could pick up miniature versions of themselves at the ASICS booth.  During the marathon, a Twitter contest was also held, in which 50 runners with the highest number of tweets containing the #minimarathoner hashtag won the same mini-copies of themselves.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f7/ba2/79f/8f7ba279fc6940f3b8d07666a3f2984d.jpg"><br><br>  For the UK supermarket chain ASDA, 3D printing in 2015 became a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2450908/Asdas-3D-printing-service-UK-first.html">standard service</a> offered in more than 50 points of this brand in the UK.  This is the result of a successful experiment conducted in 2013 at selected points (including York, Edinburgh and Manchester) and a ‚Äútour‚Äù across the country with a mobile scanner and printing equipment.  The interest of visitors to ASDA supermarkets to the novelty was immense: the action attracted a large number of customers. <br><br>  Thus, it was decided to include scanning and 3D printing in the list of permanent services of photo studios located in the stores of this brand.  <a href="https://www.asda-photo.co.uk/bookings/asda-3dme-a-miniature-3d-figure-from-asda-photo">The new service is</a> advertised in the way it was done for ordinary photography in the 19th century: customers are urged to perpetuate important moments of their lives through unusual (at least for the target group) technology. <br><br>  <b>Huggies</b> <br><br>  The Huggies diaper brand, in its last Brazilian <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/04/huggies-ad-blind-mom-ultrasound_n_7207256.html">campaign,</a> also used three-dimensional printing, in a more humanistic manner than in the examples above.  In social media, an action was held under the hashtag #CountingTheDays.  Its main part was an online video showing the real story of a blind pregnant woman who, thanks to scanning for ultrasound and 3D printing, was able to touch the face of her baby before birth. <br>  Obviously, this is an image campaign and an isolated case, but one can easily imagine that in the future such actions will be carried out on a larger scale.  The advertising campaign was very successful: in 2 months she received <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKD0AC43fc_4">more than 10 million views on YouTube.</a>  In the case of Huggies, 3D printing served as a key tool for causing mother's joy and audience emotion.  Thus, the brand used modern technology to achieve its goals. <br><br>  <b>Volkswagen</b> <br><br>  Back in 2012, Volkswagen used 3D printing technology as the main <a href="http://www.thepoloprinciple.com/index_eng.html">focus of the Polo Principle campaign</a> in Denmark.  The company focused on using VW 3D printers at the prototyping stage, encouraging the audience to develop their own cars using tools on a special website or using ready-made templates for graphics programs.  Among the projects sent by users, the jury selected the top 40 and printed them specifically for the fair in the Danish Design Center.  The winner received a real car for use for two summer months (with a design developed by him personally).  The action was carried out in social networks, as well as through commercials and Internet video. <br><br>  In the Polish campaign (April 2015) advertising the Volkswagen Passat, 3D printing technology also occupies a leading position.  The protagonist of the <a href="https://vimeo.com/124658887">video</a> is a car ad designer.  He explains the advantages of using 3D printers (saving time and materials), appreciating their creativity and calling it ‚Äúfuture technology‚Äù.  Referring to innovation, <a href="http://3dprintingindustry.com/2015/04/27/vw-proves-to-polish-public-the-power-of-3d-printing-for-its-latest-passat/">Volkswagen creates a visible link between its brand and 3D printing</a> : once a company uses such ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù solutions, it itself must be modern and innovative (although using this technology to create prototypes of cars has already become standard). <br><br>  <b>Barnardo and "House for Christmas"</b> <br><br>  Barnardo is a charitable organization that helps children and young people who find themselves in difficult living conditions.  On the occasion of the Christmas holidays in 2012, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/9753652/Barnardos-offers-3D-printed-snowglobes-of-donors-houses.html">Barnardo organized a fundraiser</a> to support homeless youth, encouraging people to donate money by organizing a competition, in which <a href="https://vimeo.com/56007489">miniature 3D models of</a> philanthropist <a href="https://vimeo.com/56007489">houses</a> placed in glass balls were awarded.  To take part in this competition, it was enough to transfer any amount using a special website.  The winners were chosen daily throughout the promotion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/497/a31/6a6/497a316a62e144eda24357f8213174a4.jpg"><br><br>  The organization contacted them to confirm the details of the address, and then, using photos from the Google Maps platform, created three-dimensional models of houses.  The lucky winners could send additional photos to improve the accuracy of the printed prototype and the original building. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe campaign was to remind people what a happiness it was to be home for Christmas, indicating that more than 75,000 young people were left homeless over the holiday.  Using these messages, the organizers counted on the audience‚Äôs emotional response.  At the same time, the use of personalized 3D printing was more pragmatic: the real reward was supposed to be a tempting motivator for donors. <br>  Only thanks to 3D printing it was possible to create so many different models in such a short period of time, and the mention in the mass media of the use of innovative technology for charitable purposes only increased the success of this excellent initiative. <br><br>  <b>DVV Insurance Agency and Digital Key Backup</b> <br><br>  In September 2013, the Belgian insurance agency DVV launched a <a href="http://adage.com/article/creativity-pick-of-the-day/belgian-insurance-company-dvv-3d-scan-keys/243204/">new service</a> specializing in the creation of digital key models.  The usefulness of this solution is obvious: instead of having to call a locksmith, you simply download and print the key using 3D technology.  Files are stored in the cloud, not associated with personal data, so you can not worry about the "leaks".  Each download should also answer a personalized question.  This is a good example of the use of modern technology for the benefit of customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ff/226/3c4/7ff2263c493a42af9012b831cbfd2a61.png"><br>  <i>source: <a href="http://blog.netpeak.ua/3d-kreativ-vremya-pechatat-idei/">blog.netpeak.ua</a></i> <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br><br>  3D printing is a relatively young technology, but modern achievements can already be used to create high-quality products.  Also, 3D printing today is of great interest from the public and therefore will serve as an effective tool for promoting and drawing attention to the brand.  In addition, using this technology is much easier to create personalized things, which makes 3D-printed product more attractive than mass-produced.  As we have seen from the examples in the text, it is an individual approach that makes the experience of participation in an advertising campaign unique and therefore important for its participant, who later becomes a loyal customer and buyer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34a/7fc/4ef/34a7fc4ef065408fadc1792d4a686b44.jpg"><br><br>  Souvenirs reflect the brand image, therefore, requires a responsible approach.  Choosing 3D-printing for the promotion of the company, it is important to find a contractor who will fulfill such an order.
