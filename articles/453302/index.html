Module.  The guys at the booth during YaC 2019 ran for permission to sell it.  And got it.  For it has already been announced))) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/hd/lj/5hhdljpnkzd_cbrtngnxbx9_bkw.jpeg"><br><br>  What can I say, according to the results of the first hour of its use ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>  (it is, for the time being, the last, the Module is put back into the box).  The device itself is about completely meaningless.  It works exclusively (as long as I have) in a pair with something on which the Yandex application is launched, through a voice chat with Alice.  And there is a feeling that it should also work under my account (it‚Äôs my office in Plus), that is, on the phone of my wife or children on my home TV when I‚Äôm not within reach, it will not work adequately.

      At the same time, the instruction in the box or on the screen is missing as a class, only rather short tips.  There is a <a href="https://yandex.ru/support/module/index.html">support page</a> , to find it is a separate quest, but there is some information on it.  And it is clear why this information is hidden so far - it can hardly be happy. <br><br>  The interface, in my picture of the world, under the voice is not ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù from the word at all.  No, you can manage it, of course (either with your voice, or write commands on the keyboard in the Yandex chat application on your smartphone))), it's just easier to shoot yourself right away.  To the UX specialists who did this, I would tear off my hands at birth.  To get to the settings, if it is possible, it is unclear how, the USB port and the slot for the microSD card are programmatically disabled.  So far they are only for beauty. It‚Äôs impossible to watch the program schedule normally; there is not even a remote control imitation in the application (as, in fact, there is no separate application).  From Ether on the desktop, switching to the Module (even on the same wi-fi network) is also impossible;  as well as control the module from the desktop.  If you work on a smartphone, then you must first start the chat with Alice, and then first press the Alice activation button, and then say the command with your voice. <br><br>  By the way, with Yandex. Remote, if anything, does not work either. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mu/p4/l0/mup4l0_j8wu5fw0x5_1v1pjvl5w.jpeg"><br><br>  And there is no fair built-in Alice in it, although the opposite is stated - there is simply no microphone in this device, in order to launch Alice - commands are accepted and processed on a smartphone or speaker. <br><br>  They say (in Yandex) that it works more adequately with Yandex.Column.  But why module, if the column itself is able all the same?  UseCase, which is offered in Yandex, is a wireless connection of Yandex. Columns with a TV through the Module.  Wireless dongle ??? <br><br>  It is written that inside Andriod 7.1, but there is simply nowhere to check it))) <br><br>  And, most interestingly, it is written on the box that this thing was made in May 2018 (albeit on the thing itself - November 25th).  That is, it was ready for a year and lay in warehouses for at least six months while the software was finished for it.  Maybe they forgot to lay out what they finished? <br><br>  PS At the request of the comments a few "live" photos.  Flash drive near for scale. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vr/tr/2e/vrtr2e47a9zujgswy5updm9kami.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453302/</a></p>
