      First of all, you need to understand that each has its own selection and evaluation criteria, and if you try to satisfy everyone, it‚Äôs crap.  The following rules will help you realize your strengths, and focus on them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Part one.  What to show? </h4><br><h5>  Eminent projects </h5><br>  If you are lucky to work with public companies like Nestle, or Coca Cola - of course, place in the portfolio large logos of these corporate monsters.  The demonstration that you have trusted such cool companies adds +100 credits from the customer. <br><br>  Of course, most designers have clients, at best, ‚Äúwidely known in narrow circles,‚Äù but there is a way out here ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt stop you from writing a little more about the client‚Äôs company.  ‚ÄúUkrTransImporKabel‚Äù is not a well-known supplier of cable products, but it has 200,000 square meters of warehouses in 5 countries on two continents.  Already more or less cool sounds. <br><br><h5>  Creative and original solutions </h5><br>  In case you put pressure on a creative - demonstrate originality.  Emphasize the unexpectedness and innovativeness of your own decisions in relation to other "classic" options.  Show the dullness and everydayness of what others are doing, and the brightness of your own idea. <br><br>  But be tolerant to others - show the work of colleagues in the shop without dirt and without specifying names.  Your task is to play with the mood of the viewer, and not to find fame * luck. <br><br><h5>  Related Tasks </h5><br>  Customers rightly believe that if the designer worked in a particular area, it would be easier for him to do another job for the same sphere.  Do not be ashamed to describe the essence of your customers.  And in the case of web design, it is desirable to additionally indicate how customers use the site in their work. <br><br><h5>  Related task conditions </h5><br>  For certain customers there are specific working conditions.  These conditions can be different, ranging from rush deadlines and budgets, ending with the specifics of the work, for example, when you have to redo or finish the work after another performer. <br><br>  At a time when dinosaurs were running around the planet and I myself earned money by design, my versatility captivated customers.  I could draw the site, rip the banners, flash the headband with the music to the main one, and then throw in the business cards with a bonus.  An integrated approach in one person. <br><br><h5>  results </h5><br>  If your work can be measured in numbers, it must be demonstrated.  The number of registrations on the site increased by 21.3%, the bounce rate decreased by a factor of 5.2 ... Everything that can be useful, calculated and looks cool should be demonstrated.  People generally believe in numbers very well, use this ;-) <br><br><h5>  Awards </h5><br>  Of course, if you are lucky to get <a href="http://www.effie.org/">EFFIE</a> - the photo of the golden statuette should definitely be in your portfolio.  And let not all customers know what it is, but recognizing you by others - this greatly increases the credibility of you as a professional. <br><br><h4>  Part two.  How to show? </h4><br><h5>  Chronology </h5><br>  Almost all freelancers and design studios make a big mistake - they show works in chronological order.  In fact, it is convenient only for those who regularly come to your site - that is, for competitors, but not for customers. <br><br>  <i>Remark: Yes, in the portfolio, in particular, it is important to show that you are alive, so do not be ashamed to confirm this somehow, for example, add the date of the last completed work or the number of projects for the current year.</i> <br><br>  For someone who plans to pay you money, not the chronology is more important, but the steepness of the projects and your competence (all that was discussed in the first part).  Therefore, first put the projects that you are proud of, and not those that you completed the last. <br><br><h5>  Performance </h5><br>  Extremely important is how you demonstrate your work.  Even the coolest work without the appropriate filing will not bring absolutely no benefit. <br><br>  Here are 2 tips: show in the "natural environment" + show it cool. <br>  If this is a logo, it has a place on business cards and T-shirts, if the site is on an iPad, a mobile application is in an iPhone that is held in the hands of a living person (demonstrate that you are using the application, and do not insert a screenshot into the template frame). <br><br>  Better for great pictures only sells great video.  So, for example, branding meters present their work: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/51462003&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhgeVuZ7jsbXILgu2_eGOUH03LBSCg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="7digital Brand Identity Journey" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  For inspiration, I collect such product presentations on a board in <a href="http://pinterest.com/sudilkovsky/product-launch/">Pinterest</a> . <br><br><h5>  Reviews </h5><br>  I had a client who did not see any work from my portfolio, but nevertheless arrived at the first meeting immediately with an advance.  Recommendations and reviews - work.  Collect letters, letters, everything that you can get from a happy client, scan it and place it near the work. <br><br><h5>  It was - it became </h5><br>  A nice reception too.  There was a logo with a globe, and what a mimichek became :-) <br><br><h5>  Justification price </h5><br>  It is not enough to show the result of the work, it is also important to show the whole process, how difficult it was to do, what problems you encountered in the process and how they were solved.  This will be the rationale for the price. <br><br>  There is even an anecdote on this topic: <blockquote>  Mike Tyson was a designer until another client asked: ‚Äú50 bucks for an icon?  What is so expensive?  She's maaaalen! ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><h5>  Less is better </h5><br>  If the amount of work done is not your strength - remove mediocre work from the portfolio.  Let them remain 10, but they will be super cool.  So do good directors and authors of books - throw out most of the footage, trim the book 2-3 times, leaving the most delicious, which then is already evaluated by readers, viewers, customers. <br><br><h5>  Presentation </h5><br>  Not necessarily at all on your portfolio, BigBoss will be the first to look.  In large companies, the initial selection is carried out by the secretary, and here it is important that there is no spoiled phone, and the girl with solitaire on the computer has accurately transmitted information about you.  I don‚Äôt know a better solution than a PDF or PowerPoint presentation.  Place in one small document a short story about yourself and your work. <br><br><h5>  Count-to-action </h5><br>  No one thinks about this at all :-) A number of action games is an element that will prompt to action.  What prevents the bottom of the work in the portfolio to finish "Would you like yourself such a cool logo - write me a letter right now at mr.des—ñgner@gma—ñl.com"?  It is not enough just to show the work, the viewer must be motivated to action! <br><br>  <b>PS A</b> poorly formed portfolio is better than no portfolio.  The fact that you do not have time is not an excuse for your laziness.  A person can spend up to three days without food and water - that's all, I found you 5-6 hours of time :-) <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> If you know examples of a beautiful portfolio - throw off in the comments and do not forget to write why you like it. <br><br>  <i>And in order to earn more now, read ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/187942/">How can a designer make more money today?</a></i>  <i>".</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188458/</a></p>
