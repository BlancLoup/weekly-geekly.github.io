The event will include seminars and workshops dedicated to the intellectual analysis of mobile and distributed data, the development of online games, the architecture of the Android operating system, and the identification of requirements for mobile offers.  Free accommodation and meals included, the number of participants is limited.  All the details under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/ce5/a2c/3face5a2c34848cdab117d382454d971.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Despite the nearly half-century <a href="http://www.computer-museum.ru/histsoft/">history of</a> research in the field of software production, this area still remains, rather, the result of the creative activity of mankind, rather than the result of a systematic process.  This situation is observed everywhere in all types of software production, but is most typical for the development of web and mobile applications, where developers have innumerable methods of product development, and the concentration of new ideas is much higher than anywhere else in this area. <br><blockquote>  The main goal of the School is a comprehensive discussion of the problems associated with the production of software.  We are confident that the event will become a discussion platform for analysis and in-depth study of not only the basics, but also aspects of the software, and will be of interest to young scientists, trainees and university students, ‚Äùsays <a href="https://scholar.google.fr/citations%3Fuser%3DGuGM3LMAAAAJ%26hl%3Dfr">Mohamad Kassab,</a> Director of the upcoming event.  "This year, the School will focus all its attention on mobile and global development, namely, to study aspects of designing applications that interact with the Internet of Things, solving key tasks characteristic of the modern world," he said. </blockquote><br>  <b>The following topics will be covered at the International School:</b> <b><br></b> <ol><li>  coding based on mobile application development requirements with an emphasis on detail.  Features of using the structure of the Dalvik virtual machine when developing applications for Android, knowledge of which will help to write more efficient code, optimize memory costs, control power consumption, etc.  (Advanced Java programming for Android applications.) </li><li>  further management of information that is distributed across the network to create more efficient and useful applications (Spatial Network: a revolution in the world of network data management) </li><li>  Combining the above aspects in a specific application area, in particular, video games (developing computer games for mobile and network applications) </li><li>  collection of requirements for the development of mobile applications around the world within the limits of the collection of requirements on the network, as well as taking into account the diversity of stakeholders, instability of requirements, etc.  (Requirements for mobile applications) </li></ol><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An expert in the field of design of operating systems, object-oriented design, software architecture, Professor of the University Innopolis Mohamed Kassab about the section of the School dedicated to the requirements for mobile applications:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúAdvanced mobile technologies still form the professional environment.  Smart mobile devices, handheld computers and laptops give users access to the wired infrastructure of information systems and perform tasks in different contexts.  As a result, there are changes and consequences associated with functional and non-functional requirements.  The difficulties caused by such changes have deeper roots, in particular, when development products are video games on mobile platforms.  For example, they must meet a number of important non-functional requirements (compatibility, plot, emotional perception).  Taking into account these aspects, we will explore a number of problems associated with the development of requirements for mobile applications, and consider the technologies for effectively collecting, analyzing and managing requirements of various kinds. ‚Äù </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Director of the Institute of Information Systems, Head of the Industrial Software Production Laboratory of Innopolis University Giancarlo Succi on the section ‚ÄúAdvanced Java Programming for Android Applications‚Äù:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "In this part of the event we will review the principles of Java programming for applications on the Android platform (reflection, virtual functions, control changes, dependency injection), define the structure of the Android byte representation in the standard Java virtual machine (JVM), and discuss the principles of the virtual machine Davlik (DVM), as well as their stack and register architectures.  In addition, in the framework of the section, we will study in detail the Zygote process, the DEX file format, ways to clean up memory from unnecessary data in the Davlik virtual machine (DVM), Dalvik and ART, dexopt vs.  dex2oat, JNI and DVM, let's talk about the interface for direct access from Java (JNI) and the Davlik virtual machine (DVM). </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An expert in the field of distributed databases and Big Data analysis, a professor at Innopolis University, Qiang Qu, said that he was waiting for participants in the section on the revolution in the world of network data management:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúThe rapidly emerging mobile infrastructure of the Internet creates a revolution in data management.  We will look at advanced applications and services (for example, network data collection, localization based games, etc.) and discuss problems (spatial searches, keywords, group searches, etc.) related to the relevant technicians (IRtrees, Voronoi Cell, etc.). ‚Äù </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An expert in the field of software development, machine learning, formal methods for designing software architecture, semantic analysis, Professor of Bologna University Paolo Chacarini will tell you about software development of computer games for mobile and network applications:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúWhen developing digital games, experts face a number of difficulties in commercial software.  Prototyping, testing, and multiplatform compatibility force developers to be flexible in matters related to the specification and functionality of the software.  Even experienced specialists are forced to change their usual approaches to design and group management, while taking into account user behavior and technological diversity.  Computer games design lessons are applied in software development in many industries, including the development of mobile applications and interactive content for e-books and tablets, as well as in such areas as healthcare, the defense industry and education. ‚Äù </div></div>
