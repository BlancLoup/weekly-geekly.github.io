  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is an information object</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ownership is the basis of modern civilization, the ability to say ‚Äúthis is mine‚Äù.  One can single out (exaggerating, of course) the three main types of rights. <br><br><h5>  Property right </h5>  Ownership of the material object.  His main problem is the rights to objects that a person did not create.  Who owns them?  Who is stronger, who first found or who first said about this?  Some enterprising citizens even sell land on the moon, which was only seen through a telescope. <br><br><h5>  Patent law </h5>  Ownership of the class of similar material objects created in a certain way on the basis of some information object.  Generally speaking, you can get a patent for an invention that is not embodied in a material form, but the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpatenting is to provide a description sufficient to create a working model in exchange for the protection of rights.  A patent infringement is an implementation of an invention that complies with the description of a patent without permission.  The main problem with this right is that sometimes they try to patent not a class of objects, but an action class.  For example, "slide-to-unlock".  When it comes to obvious things, this is easily detected.  They will not allow patented breathing through the nose or walking with the help of legs.  However, in new areas of obvious things yet, and this is trying to take advantage.

      <br>
    <h5>  Copyright </h5>  Ownership of the information object.  The main problem of this right is that no one knows what this very informational object is. <br><br>  Before I say, this is mine, it would be nice to understand what is ‚Äúthis‚Äù.  So we will try to figure out what an information object is, through observation and analysis of its properties. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b>An information object appears when it can be unambiguously identified among other information and disappears when the possibility of such an allocation disappears.</b> <br>  For example, we wrote a story about Vasya Pupkin.  The ‚Äústory about Vasya Pupkin‚Äù object was created.  We wrote another 20 stories, 4 stories and one feuilleton about the same Vasya.  We have an information object "Vasya Pupkin", which readers now distinguish from others.  For example, our Vasya Pupkin is a two-meter private detective with a phenomenal ear.  Note that no one can name the exact moment of the appearance of Vasi Pupkin.  Just at some point, some critical mass was accumulated.  At the same time, in hypothetical Albania, where they just started publishing our books, Vasya Pupkin is still not recognized as a separate object.  And now let's imagine that someone else wrote 20 stories about Vasya Pupkin, but there this Vasya is a shabby old man, a master of sports in chess.  And then someone else wrote 20 stories about his Vasya Pupkin.  After a while, speaking of Vasya Pupkin, you will have to clarify, and which of them you now have in mind.  Vasya Pupkin began to lose his individuality. <br>  Sometimes the moment of the appearance of the information object is artificially fixed.  For example, you register your song in a certain public organization that plays the role of this very critical mass of people familiar with the object.  This organization takes care that your object does not lose its individuality and thus prolongs its existence. </li><li>  <b>Information object exists due to copying.</b> <br>  You can even say that the information object is ‚Äúpropagated‚Äù by copying.  Copying the object itself and copying information about the existence of this object.  I can give a friend to read an interesting book, but I can tell you exactly what that book is interesting.  Reading the book, I copy it to my memory.  Telling a friend about a new book, I copy to him some of the metadata of this object.  At the same time, my opinion about the book is also an information object with all the ensuing consequences.  The life of an object (that is, its recognition) depends on the distribution of this object and information about it. </li><li>  <b>Information objects are comparable only at the level of similar / unlike.</b> <br>  Even the concept is such a "similar to the degree of confusion."  Two information objects are considered identical if an outside qualified observer cannot clearly separate one object from another.  Take, for example, the brilliant poem ‚ÄúTour-Tour-Tour-Tour, we are going to physical education‚Äù - it could easily have been independently composed by several different independent authors.  The more complex the object, the less the likelihood of such a coincidence, but the probability is not a reason for the recognition of authorship.  If I changed 2 lines in the poem - did I create a new information object?  How to measure the change that separates the two objects? </li><li>  <b>A part of an information object is an information object only if property 1 is fulfilled for it.</b> <br>  It is often written that the citation of the material in whole or in part should be accompanied by a reference to the source, but what if the source is not determined for this part?  It is obvious that the rights to a part of an information object disappear when this part becomes rather small.  We do not demand rights to all the words we used in the article (for example, in the article).  So somewhere there is a border, starting from which a part of an information object ceases to be associated with an object, ceases to be separable.  More precisely, the original information object ceases to be recognizable, however, the part itself can still be perceived as a separate object.  This happens, for example, with winged expressions and aphorisms.  Many use them without knowing completely and not associating them with the original source. </li><li>  <b>Since its inception, the information object is beyond the control of the author.</b> <br>  After publication, the author can no longer destroy his work and cannot control its distribution.  Even if you forbid me to transfer the object itself - you cannot forbid me to express my opinion about the object, which affects its recognition and the attitude of other people towards it.  And you can not make me forget.  Of course, I do not mean exceptional cases such as "the killing of all humans."  The promulgation itself is not canceled.  If I publicly (that is, for everyone, regardless of whether they were directly present at the same time) sang a song, then I actually made it available to everyone.  Even if I did it without permission, you will not return the information back. </li><li>  <b>The value of the information object is subjective</b> <br>  There is even nothing to comment on.  You can only add that the cost is also very dependent on the author.  Someone for inspiration needs a week to rest in Tahiti, and someone to drink a cup of coffee. </li><li>  <b>The value of the information object can be found out only after reading it in its entirety.</b> <br>  A good impression of a book, song or movie can be ruined by a bad ending.  Any annotations, trailers and reviews do not provide an accurate picture of the value of the object for a particular person.  By the way, the influence of the information object is also impossible to accurately assess.  Neither benefit nor harm.  Reading the book can have far-reaching and not always good consequences, but the author is almost always (except in rare cases) released from responsibility for it. </li><li>  <b>The consumer buys not an information object, but impressions from it or information from it.</b> <br>  We can't watch a movie or hear a song.  The algorithm for which we bought the book may not be suitable for us, so the cost of an error in this matter is very high.  When buying an information object, we do not acquire a product, but a service, but we cannot appeal against the quality of the performance of this service, since the quality is subjective. </li><li>  <b>An information object exists regardless of its rights.</b> <br>  Information about who the author is, how and under what conditions the object can be distributed is not part of the object and exists independently.  This is a completely different information object that they are trying to tightly tie to the source. </li><li>  <b>The information object is monetized directly through the sale or indirectly through an increase in the value of the associated objects.</b> <br>  Moreover, the associated objects are not required to be informational.  Item plus information costs more than just an item. </li></ol><br>  Not enough information to reliably judge the nature of information objects, but assumptions can be made.  My is: information is a currency.  One of the four main types of currencies along with time, money and trust. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143551/</a></p>
