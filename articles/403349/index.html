My keys were already part of posts on Geektimes, and today I decided to answer a few more questions that we receive on our organizers.  Today I will tell you how I brought my Smartpoket to mind and how much it cost me (spoiler: cheap). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d67/561/afc/d67561afc1e64a368f7a2cff7f212e02.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Perhaps someone will be interested to read the story: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/286562/">1 part</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/287806/">Part 2</a> </li></ul><br>  In short, I managed to fit this:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e4/669/c4c/6e4669c4cd324be0ab0d73d6ab4683a5.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Little SmartPoket</b> <br><br>  I always tried to get rid of some of the keys.  Even when we lived in a communal apartment, and every door inside, besides the entrance door, was locked with a key, I found some compromise.  We owned two rooms, and I just left the keys to the second - in the first.  This allowed me to give up two additional keys on the bundle. <br><br>  So I got the result: 1 key from the top, 1 - from the bottom, 1 - from the second door, 1 - from the inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/304/81d/42b/30481d42bcf747fa970809ae522ea2ec.JPG"><br><br>  This is my first bunch of keys, which is always with me.  For her, I chose a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-organajzer.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoket">small SmartPoket</a> .  The fact is that the key to the upper lock here is not so long, and it perfectly fits into the basic version.  The only thing turned out to be that he had an ‚Äúear‚Äù a little less than necessary.  I acted rather handy: I ‚Äã‚Äãtook a drill, took these nozzles ... In general, the key came up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/812/a8d/c32/812a8dc327b94a7ebe1bcffd4648688b.JPG"><br><br>  The position of the large key inside the organizer is very simple: the number of plastic plates on the opposite side.  If you try to make the organizer as thin and graceful as possible, then the key may stick out a bit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4d/711/5cc/c4d7115cc52a41ad9839bd833800be80.JPG"><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is no way to fix a tablet from the intercom of this type.  Therefore, we have to admit that this is a key chain ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67c/097/aef/67c097aef32d40f589050a0fb96be8f1.JPG"><br><br>  <b>As a result</b> <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have additional expenses for a small version, I just had to slightly sharpen the key, but this is not a problem.  The bundle came out very compact and comfortable for me.  Since the keys used to hang out in the backpack all the time, sometimes I heard them.  I didn't like it very much.  Now they are fixed in a special pocket, do not take up space and do not distract.  I use this bundle not often. <br><br>  From the rest of the observations: the keys are quite convenient to reach, this is done with one hand: you simply push the keys from the side you need.  Someone has said in the comments that it will be impossible - it is not. <br><br>  And also easy to clean.  Enough to make a fist. <br><br>  <b>Big SmartPoket</b> <br><br>  In a <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-l.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoketlarge">large SmartPoket,</a> I managed to stuff a tablet from an intercom, three keys and a flash drive.  And it was a whole story. <br><br>  Difficult for several reasons.  First of all, I wanted more compression, and I originally planned to remake the key from the upper lock into a small, short one, but this turned out to be impossible.  Several surveyed masters said that this is some kind of ultra-rare key, and it can only be big.  Yes, and he found something not immediately. <br><br>  However, of course, I had to redo it - it came out another 400 rubles to the cost of the organizer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d0/dfd/690/7d0dfd690b3c4937a4e038d8f0141216.JPG"><br><br>  There was no key with a round hole either, but as it turned out later, this does not change anything at all.  The key sits tight and walks smoothly. <br><br>  The problem was the part with the tablet from the intercom.  We tried several options, since it is clear that in the current form it could be inserted except that: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/0e1/014/8e00e1014ca54afba1e7ea3e74cba888.JPG"><br><br>  In the workshops, basically everyone is the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/37e/448/d9737e4489a44ea9a6753226d395910c.JPG"><br><br>  This is a slightly thinner and slightly more even version, but still not perfectly flat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/763/b5f/bbf763b5f1664a388a1f5b446ceb1707.JPG"><br><br>  If you don‚Äôt bother too much, then such an alternative would solve my problem, it would just look like if someone began to look into your bundle, which in itself is absurd, less elegant. <br><br>  But, in pursuit of that grace, I found a flat, flat mark.  It is a little wider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e5/074/357/0e50743571ed48e9ad9da2a1e3824ca4.JPG"><br><br>  But ideally thin, under the size of a key, and equal on both sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25a/3aa/324/25a3aa32473248e8ac3147f4688232ad.JPG"><br><br>  This label - another 200 rubles to the cost of a large SmartPoket'a. <br><br>  Operation ‚ÄúFlash Drive‚Äù was also not free.  For me, a flash drive is something like a talisman.  Clouds, Yandex.Disk - everything is cool, but for some reason I always carried a flash drive with me, and decided that it should be so.  I had a flash drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28f/44a/ebc/28f44aebc9b743f8b8b77e1ee1692c5c.JPG"><br><br>  But, like the label, it was not even.  And it was going crazy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64e/9a6/7c0/64e9a67c04e44c339232da97999b0bfa.JPG"><br><br>  She was perfectly cleaned, got, did not interfere ... but she was upset.  Therefore, welcome to Oldie.  There remained Kingston perfectly flat flash drives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c7/949/b6b/9c7949b6b21c4ec78c6f05c25bfea2db.JPG"><br><br>  The only thing, but their eye is a little wider.  The plastic gasket basically closes it completely, but under pressure, when you start to wrap the design, one edge can be bent inwards.  Therefore, as the gasket, I used the mail key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d6/4eb/d46/8d64ebd46e534beabf12b3c0c751c4be.JPG"><br><br>  The bunch from the new place of residence is not very large.  I manage two keys, the key to the mailbox and flash drive.  The flash drive, by the way, was not inserted the first time: at first it ‚Äúraised‚Äù the computer, so I had to twist it.  It is better to measure once, in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ace/18c/4a7/ace18c4a762b4156a80ee6810e4b5d7d.JPG"><br><br>  So, ... a flash drive and a tablet from the intercom.  Thus, only 5 units. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0f/11e/b37/b0f11eb379b345ff83822e61c09a322b.JPG"><br><br>  Yes, by the way, a flash drive is about 500 rubles to the cost of the Smartpocket.  So that the big key could be removed evenly and freely and could be pulled out from both sides, it was necessary to compensate for the distance with complete rings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/2a7/495/8d22a7495c7449d199e03a9d8a3cef8f.JPG"><br><br>  As a result: I got two neat bundles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/f33/9c6/8e7f339c61e84df5aef159039b6886e6.JPG"><br><br>  Keys are conveniently pulled out from both sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d67/561/afc/d67561afc1e64a368f7a2cff7f212e02.JPG"><br><br>  Someone will reproach that he has more keys.  It is true, it happens.  We proceeded from the calculation that, on average, a person has 1 big key and up to 3-4 small ones.  Otherwise, you can do as I do: make a couple of bundles of pockets.  It's still more convenient than just a pair of keychains. <br><br>  I want to note that I was one of those who "stoked" at the very beginning for Aliexpress.  However, I was the first to give up their organizers.  First, they do not solve the main problem: compression.  Since the key holders are smaller in size, the ends of the keys are in contact with the ‚Äúheads‚Äù on the other side, and in the end you get this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/448/01f/60a/44801f60a27249308c65df2ca67e5485.JPG"><br><br>  On the whole, I was not satisfied with the quality of the material, which can be cut with ordinary scissors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c1/c25/1b2/2c1c251b27dc4005a806639fb7d07a04.JPG"><br><br>  Nevertheless, I consider it necessary to remind once again that there are a lot of Chinese organizers and you can easily find them.  I am sure that you even know where. <br><br>  <b>Phantom key</b> <br><br>  "Smartpocket" is like a continuation of the key, its handle.  This is convenient, but I got used to it for a while.  At first there was a feeling of some kind of ‚Äúphantom key‚Äù, when you hold not directly by the head, but by the plates of the ‚ÄúSmartpocket‚Äù. <br><br>  In all other respects - it is very convenient, although it may require additional investments for "optimization".  However, I found some entertainment in this.  And the last thing I would like to say is that the label through the plates does not take, and I have to take it out every time. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In the catalog</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-organajzer.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoket">Little</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/smartpoket-l.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dsmartpoket%26utm_campaign%3Dsmartpoketlarge">Big</a> </li></ul><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403349/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403349/</a></p>
