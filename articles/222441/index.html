And this story is about how I could find peace in madness.  Although I was fond of computers since childhood, but having a talent in another field, I took the path: languages, sales, VIP service. <br><br>  Having received a diploma from a VIP-service humanities specialist, I did not find anything else but how to get a job at a local wholesale company as a regional sales manager.  The company is good, but taking into account the specifics of the goods, we had to communicate with a large number of people who considered it their duty to cheat, to be rude. <br><br>  Every day began with about 50-60 cold calls, then meetings followed, and then the customers themselves called, dissatisfied with the state in which the products were sent to them.  Claims were to me, but in fact these were the problems of our warehouse and transport company. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Exit problem </h5><br>  Having worked for six months in this company and accumulated savings for the purchase of a car, I raised enough money to realize my dream: to open my content project, which was supposed to give me financial freedom and happiness. <br><br>  As many people have, I overestimated growth and scaling opportunities too much and struggled for a whole year to reach a level of self-sufficiency.  Then, due to the nature of the project, I came up against the level of profit, and now I knew exactly what I needed for further development and income growth.  But it all came down to a significant amount of money that was needed for development. <br><br><h5>  Passing the black abyss </h5><br>  To better understand the IT area, I got a job as a sales manager at 1C franchisee, where, to my chagrin, the work was even tougher and more ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù than in the previous company.  In it, I was able to go through the career ladder from an ordinary salesman to the head of the service department, but I had moral reasons to leave this job: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215545/">habrahabr.ru/post/215545</a> <br><br>  The level of income from my project and a number of other initiatives allowed me to look for work more freely, and the main criteria for me were: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ IT area; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Honesty towards people; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to bring benefits. <br><br>  And after 4 months of searching, I received an offer to become a technical support specialist in one startup, which, to my joy, survived the initial stage and has now turned into a solid Saas project with tens of thousands of clients. <br><br><h5>  How do you feel at such work fit </h5><br>  At first, I was very worried about the fact that I would have to communicate every day with a huge number of people who have certain questions and complaints.  But, to my great joy, the majority of webmasters and IT specialists turned out to be polite people who clearly and clearly explain their problems and are well aware that it takes time to solve each problem. <br><br>  And the most beautiful thing was that when a person calls you and you help him cope with the problem, he, in turn, thanks you for your help.  For two years of work in the position of sales specialist, I have never heard a word of thanks in my address. <br><br>  You really feel that you are a useful and useful person when you are thanked for help, and not sent after the next cold call.  And this is a wonderful feeling. <br><br><h5>  Current state of affairs </h5><br>  Now I just enjoy my work and find it beautiful.  At the same time, I let the vector of development of my project in such a direction that people began to show their gratitude for what my project does for them. <br><br>  And you know, I have never felt like such a happy person who can really be proud of his work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222441/</a></p>
