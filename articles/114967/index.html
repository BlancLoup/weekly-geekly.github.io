  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selection of key phrases for narrow subjects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sometimes you come across a situation where you have to engage in attracting an audience to a site with the help of contextual advertising and search engines in a very narrow topic. <br><br>  Hand on heart, it can be said that even having squeezed out all the possibilities, it is often impossible to collect at least some significant traffic.  Therefore, focusing only on search engines is not worth it. <br><br><h4>  How to make a list of key phrases? </h4><br>  It is quite clear that the main tool will be systems for selecting search phrases of search engines: <br>  <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">wordstat.yandex.ru</a> <br>  <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal">adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal</a> <br>  <a href="http://adstat.rambler.ru/">adstat.rambler.ru</a> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      However, you should not mindlessly enter into them everything that comes to mind. <br><br>  I advise you to make an initial list of the main phrases of your subject in a separate document, and then consistently enter them in the statistics collection systems. <br><br><h4>  If this is not enough, then here are a few options for iterating: </h4><br>  1. Different parts of speech (computer - computer) <br>  2. Synonyms (I advise you to use synonyms dictionaries) <br>  4. Variants of writing phrases - abbreviations, "household" (computer - comp), transliteration (toyota - toyota) <br>  5. Associations in selection systems (the phrases that were requested by users to refine their queries are displayed) <br>  6. More common words and phrases.  Here you need to be careful, because the use of such keywords blurs the audience of the site, which means it impairs its quality.  Concerning the cut-off of ‚Äúleft‚Äù phrases, read our note ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/onlinepro/blog/112754/">How we clog TOP</a> ‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Not enough to be! </h4><br>  Another option is to analyze keywords used on competitors' sites.  I am sure that the best of them have passed through a large amount of information. <br><br>  In order to get more complete information, I advise you to use alternative statistics tools for key phrases, for example, <a href="http://pastukhov.com/">the Pastukhov database</a> . <br><br>  Despite the fact that for most of the requests there are no additional data that are stated in the ‚Äúzamanuha‚Äù on Pastukhov‚Äôs website (the cost of a click on Yandex.Direct and others), this tool has one very cool advantage for selecting keys in narrow topics: Yandex does not show phrases which were entered by users in previous months, but were not requested in the current. <br><br>  This means that when selecting keys in Wordstat, some of them can simply not be seen, and the base is assembled for a long time.  Although the price of this product, in my opinion, is greatly overestimated, and the data in the columns ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù and others cannot always be trusted, since  it is not clear at what point they were received. <br><br>  Additions from <a href="http://alekseo.habrahabr.ru/">Alekseo</a> : you can analyze what words are advertised in the context of competitors.  Some counters contain key phrases, you can also use them.  Not all months in the Pastukhov base are parted.  For example, in the 170-millionth few September requests.  This is worth considering for seasonal requests. <br><br><h4>  Results </h4><br>  In general, search engine promotion on a narrow topic often cannot be used as the only way to attract visitors. <br><br>  For many customers, SEO is like a drug, but you need to remember that this is still a form of sales advertising, and the audience coming from search engines has its own special qualities. <br><br>  Forget about the other options - contextual advertising, the use of thematic sites and communities, media advertising - i.e.  all that forms the attitude towards the product and the company is impossible, because  any advertiser knows that the work of several advertising channels in the amount gives an order of magnitude better effect than individually. <br><br>  Different ways of advertising and sites are always different audiences, whose behavior is often very different from others. <br><br>  By the way, the proposed method can be used when drawing up a list of key phrases for contextual advertising.  Often Direct in such topics is much more profitable than search engine promotion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114967/</a></p>
