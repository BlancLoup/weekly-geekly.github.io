Write a few posts a day.</strong> <br><br>  Determine the time when you are most productive, and you can write a few posts on your blog, naturally of high quality and on the topic of the blog.  And write until your fingers hurt, write and write. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are days when the muse comes, and the posts themselves are created in the head, a lot of great ideas, thoughts and suggestions.  Having written several posts in advance, you do not need to post them in one day, just leave them in the drafts, which will allow you to always have on hand a couple of excellent posts for your readers.  This will free you time for the next few days, for a holiday, or for some work offline and of course for thinking about new topics and ideas.  This advice is given by many professional bloggers, and many people write this in their blog.

      <strong>2. Write less, read more.</strong> <br><br>  Very often, we are recommended to write every day, write more often, so that you would be read and made links.  Many popular bloggers, do one post a day, regularly.  But there are also others who write 3 times a week, or even more rarely, which does not deprive their blogs of popularity.  You decide what advice you use.  But please note that quite often users refuse to subscribe to RSS due to the fact that the feed is full, they just do not have time to read what you write.  According to statistics, in order for a post to spread across the blogosphere, it takes about 2 to 3 days. It is during this time that the post will read the greatest number of readers, and receive the most links from other bloggers. <br>  So it makes sense to try to reduce the frequency of writing a blog to 2 - 4 times a week and at the same time improve the quality of the information that you give to your reader.  In this case, it is important not to forget about the regularity of writing to the blog, even if you decide to write once a week. <br><br>  <strong>3. Enough statistics.</strong> <br><br>  I am sure that you, like me, very much enjoy watching the statistics of your blog.  Now I try to control myself, and view blog statistics only twice a day, in the morning and at the end of the day.  Before that, it was just a nightmare.  In the morning we go to Google Analytics and start exploring who links to us, how many visitors today, how many views, etc. and so on.  It would seem that this is quite normal, but you count how much time it takes just to study statistics.  I could start writing a post, then stop and see who else had come in or put a link to my blog, then you start walking on someone else's blogs, then bam!  and already forgot about what he wrote.  But besides the statistics services, there are many more ratings and directories. <br>  Teach yourself to spend less time viewing your blog statistics, just skim through it in the morning, and learn more at the end of the day.  Remember, statistics will not go anywhere, statistics accumulates on the server and is always available for you. <br><br>  <strong>4. Organize your workplace.</strong> <br><br>  Get organized on your desktop.  This also applies to the one on your computer screen and the one on which your computer stands.  Nothing superfluous, everything that is often used is kept at hand, nothing that can distract us during work. <br><br>  Get organized in your browser.  Disable all unnecessary buttons, panels and plugins, organize your bookmarks, keep bookmarks to sites that you frequently visit in a separate folder. <br><br>  Use the editor to write blog posts.  This will allow you less distractions than when writing a post directly in the browser.  There is no temptation to open in one more window, some page, as it happens when writing through a browser.  We write, write, decide to check something, or just clarify some kind of thing, opened a couple of pages, and you don‚Äôt write anything you‚Äôre already reading and forget about what you‚Äôve just written.  It is very bad when when writing a post, the train of thought is interrupted. <br><br>  <strong>5. Make a schedule.</strong> <br><br>  Very often, people who blog, tend to check email every 15 minutes, look in the RSS reader, in search of updates in other blogs or comments to their read news and etc.  All this also takes a lot of time, which you could spend for other useful purposes, for example, by doing some housework or doing some task on your main job or simply writing another post.  As a rule, all these actions are never necessary, therefore, to save your time, you can make a small schedule of your work with news, mail and comments. <br><br>  For example, in the morning, we check statistics, earnings for AdSense or other systems through which you earn money, skim through news and mail headlines, read comments and new links to your blog.  If there is nothing important, close the browser and go about your business.  All this can be allocated about 30 minutes of time. <br><br>  At lunchtime, you can respond to letters and comments, chat in forums and social networks, depending on your time you can devote an hour or a little more. <br><br>  In the evening, when you returned from work, read RSS, write posts, think over ideas for new posts or projects.  Even if you are not visited by the muse, in the evening you can spend the most time on your blog, because you have the whole night ahead.  I can take up to 4 hours for this part of the work. <br><br>  Having made such a schedule, you will be able to save great daytime, which is usually necessary to perform work offline. <br><br>  <strong>Now you.</strong>  Tell us what traps of your time you encountered while working with blogs and how you organize your time. <br><br>  <em><a href="http://blogproblog.com/">blogproblog.com</a></em> <br>  <em>On this post, I pushed similar posts on blogs <a href="http://bloggingtips.com/">bloggingtips.com</a> and <a href="http://problogger.net/">problogger.net</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16381/</a></p>
