True, some people do better in buying and selling, others do differently, but here, as they say, who has studied for what and for whom, or ‚Äúeveryone cannot be equally successful‚Äù.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  I myself sometimes buy some content through virtual trading networks.  At the same time, I very much appreciate the clarity in this matter recently: the product must be the same as it was set up, and its value must be equal to the declared value.  Because once, as they say, ‚Äúgot lost‚Äù: I bought one program somehow, for SMS, and the cost of SMS seemed to be 30 rubles, however, the sellers ‚Äúraked‚Äù my phone bill for some reason already 270 rubles, , the program password was sent right away.  Probably because wholesale ... <br><br>  <b>Stop running wild!</b> <br><br>  Why am I doing this?  Yes, everything is to the same: to the urgent need to give to commerce in the virtual world ‚Äúcivilizational norms‚Äù, rather worn out in the real world, but, nevertheless, mostly acting on this side of the monitor. <br><br>  So that I, you, he, she, like "together a whole country" could, by paying money, get what this money paid for, and not "an unknown little animal in a bag." <br><br>  In general, until recently, I was very suspicious of selling content and tried my best to avoid paying anyone or anything, especially through SMS.  Preferring to spend time searching for free alternatives, albeit moving to my hard drive at a snail's pace, but honest towards me. <br><br>  Kill me, but I am a skeptic with regard to the sale of goods and services for SMS.  More precisely - was such.  But the thing is this ... I just don‚Äôt like it very much when there‚Äôs an intermediary between me and the seller or between me as a seller and some buyer as a cellular operator who grabs the lion‚Äôs share of what he‚Äôs not supposed to do, in principle he is here - the "fifth wheel in a cart." <br><br>  However‚Ä¶ <br><br>  <b>The monster of the ...</b> <br><br>  It so happened that I noticed ZipMonster.ru almost in the first days of September 2010, i.e.  literally right away, as this paid archiver went onto a wide Internet path.  At first, it seemed to me that before my eyes was a typical product of a typical desktop. <br><br>  But the further I climbed into the jungle of what I saw, the more I changed my attitude towards the sudden monster. <br><br>  First of all, I could now pay, figuratively speaking, with Mongolian tugriks or pre-Columbian cocoa beans, and at the same time receive what I was in dire need.  In any case, ZipMonster guaranteed me such a right: pay at least POISON, even WMR, even PayPal, even if it is a devil in a mortar, but we will agree. <br><br>  <b>Law of honor</b> <br><br>  I definitely liked this accent in ZipMonster, that, they say, we will not have any malicious thoughts, that neither pedophiles, bestiality animals, nor other anti-legal and anti-moral spirits with their unnatural thoughts have any place here, that like that - have in view in front of all law enforcement agencies. <br><br>  And also the fact that any attempts of fraud with the help of the system will be stopped once and for all by means of the eternal blocking of the account of an unscrupulous partner. <br><br>  Such austerity is not everywhere, moreover, many resources selling content packaged in archives are not particularly scrupulous in matters of conscience, morality, and in the end - the law.  I did not get it myself, but I heard about the fact that people paid for M. Gorky‚Äôs ‚ÄúMother‚Äù and received 90 minutes of pornographic experiments in a packed archive in some St. Petersburg secondary school. <br><br>  <b>ZipMonster, as the master ...</b> <br><br>  The fact that more than 3.5 gigabyte archives are not yet subject to ZipMonster - garbage, compared to something politically obscene, because in the near future this nonsense, as promised by the creators of ZipMonster, will be eliminated, and it will be possible to archive at least the full contents of the two-layer drives with almost any content. <br><br>  It is very important that the archive created with the help of ZipMonster is not necessary to place ZipMonster on the host itself, it can be placed on your website, in a blog, on another host, or thrown into the file sharing service, counting in the latter case on an additional profit. <br><br>  <b>Made a deal</b> <br><br>  I installed, of course, ZipMonster at my place.  The interface is clear, as they say, for those who have just come from the street, and far from being urban. <br><br>  You specify paths, file names, you hint about your own appetites, i.e.  - for money that is not against getting.  And - you place the content where the soul desires.  Who needs your good, transfers the money to ZipMonstra, and ZipMonster to you, certainly on Fridays, if you are informed about this no later than Thursday. <br><br>  <b>Big - big swimming</b> <br><br>  As elsewhere, large customers are offered special conditions in the form of bonuses.  But the large ones, only cannot get rid of the rest: at present, Zip Monster has spread its tentacle wings over 236 countries, and it must be assumed that its expansion will not stop there. <br><br>  Service about money, if not omnivorous, then very consistent.  Almost all e-currencies are accepted for payment, and if something is not there, then the watchful eye of a consultant looms around the clock, who will answer and support online, if that. <br><br>  The site ZipMonster.ru claim that not from the moon fell, and that if for five years as part of an organized group doing the right thing, that is,  - carry informational light to people.  There are no reasons not to believe in it, painfully the developers are behaving professionally, and not as beginners who need everything now.  These claim that they came in earnest - and so on. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In general, first visual proof, so to speak, earnings: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/071/8c7/a72/0718c7a72eef83c2a12695d599becf90.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Not being a prominent specialist, but, nevertheless, being a mediocre specialist, I will take the liberty of recommending to pay attention to this development of a team of St. Petersburg and remotely adhered programmers.  ZipMonster firmly stood on the shoulders of the titans, who were before him, but resolutely went on. <br><br>  So next?  See for yourself. <br>  As for me, then - forward: both sell and buy. <br><br>  Because the gift will be only yesterday, i.e.  under communism, and then not all, not always, and at an exorbitant price. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108813/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108813/</a></p>
