  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Who works in Innopolis?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Innopolis is a city where an enthusiastic professional community of young and ambitious people gathers.  The average age of high-tech city residents is 26 years.  Therefore, it is not surprising that an absolute majority of the company's employees are yesterday's graduates.  We are launching a series of stories about the inhabitants of a young city.  Who are they, how did they get to Innopolis and how are the IT industries useful? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The story of Elmira Khalitova, director of international cooperation at Innopolis University, with the light hand of which the strongest partnerships with leading universities in the world are under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c93/290/5ad/c932905ada7844b18291c47ebb17e6b0.jpg" alt="image">

      The first impression Elmira makes is an ordinary young girl.  Who does not personally know her, having met the romantic nature at the university, may mistakenly assume that she is still a student.  In fact, the girl is already ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù at Innopolis University.  She joined his work at the very start of the project and was among the top five creators of an IT university.  In February, she turned 3 years old as she leads international communications of a young Russian university. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInternational relations and international law can not be divided‚Äù <br><br>  Elmira was born in Kazan.  She graduated from Kazan Federal University with a degree in international relations.  And after that she won a grant from the Government of the Republic of Tatarstan and the German Academic Exchange Service and went to Germany to study in the magistracy.  At the University of Hamburg, Elmira received a master's degree in European law.  A diplomat and a lawyer in one person, with the qualification obtained, the girl returned to her native Tatarstan in search of work. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI lacked experience for Innopolis‚Äù <br><br>  About Innopolis Elmira learned quite by accident.  Then, 4 years ago, in Kazan IT circles, the project of the future city had the code name ‚ÄúIT Village‚Äù.  He assumed a maximum population of no more than 50 thousand people.  And already in the process of developing a master plan, it was decided to develop the project to an IT city with a population of up to 155 thousand people.  But it all started with the village.  A graduate of the University of Hamburg was offered to join the project's founding team.  But Elmira was convinced that she, as an aspiring specialist, had little competence.  And she refused.  The girl went to Moscow.  ‚ÄúShe worked for a year in the Plenipotentiary Representation of Tatarstan in the Russian Federation in the department for coordinating international and economic relations,‚Äù she says.  - And even there constantly faced with Innopolis.  This is a landmark project for our republic.  I told about him to all the guests and potential partners.  And over time, I myself became interested.  And my own interest only grew, I wanted to join the global project and do something really meaningful.  No matter how trite it sounds (laughs). ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe worked and didn‚Äôt notice how spring came‚Äù <br><br>  After upgrading competences in Moscow, Elmira returned to Tatarstan and became part of a very small team of Innopolis University, which only laid the foundation for a new IT university.  Then the university worked director, rector and his assistant.  Elmira has taken over the global external relations sector.  The new university was faced with the task of training world-class specialists.  And this is possible using the experience of international universities.  Elmira coordinated cooperation with Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA (Carnegie Mellon University).  It was this university that was chosen as the main project launch partner.  The partner today provides expert support in the development and implementation of training and research programs, as well as in the training of faculty members at Innopolis University. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb8/c1c/baa/bb8c1cbaac4d427d94306069afad838d.jpg"><br><br>  For the formation and development of the educational and research base of Innopolis University, cooperation with a world-famous university was not enough.  Therefore, the search for partners continued.  ‚ÄúI was looking for friends around the world,‚Äù says Elmira.  - It was not so easy, because we did not have a reputation and a meaningful history.  But if you want, you do it.  If not, even reputation will not help.  We focused on rating indicators, although this method may seem controversial.  But it‚Äôs still a recognized indicator. ‚Äù <br><br>  Today Innopolis University cooperates with a number of reputable universities and scientific institutes of the world.  The international department of Innopolis University, which is now headed by Elmira, was able to provide an academic exchange of students and teachers for integration with the international academic community.  Some students take a full course of study at partner universities.  ‚ÄúThis is not an export, but an investment.  For example, a good cyber security program is being implemented at the National University of Singapore.  This is one of our key areas.  In Amsterdam, at the Institute of Informatics, we are also interested in the program for the development of secure systems and networks.  Our students study at these universities.  After graduation, they will return to Russia and will help us implement this program (or, better, develop this area) ‚Äù. <br><br>  The next stage is to fill the relationship with meaningful projects.  ‚ÄúThe apogee of our work is joint higher education programs.  We want our students to study at several universities and receive several diplomas, having the opportunity to build an individual training program in accordance with their professional and personal aspirations.  This will contribute to the growth of scientific knowledge and ultimately lead to a rise in the innovative development of the IT industry in our country. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60b/d07/7be/60bd077be0ea4e36ad4ee64c17a3a2e5.jpg"><br><br>  All this was preceded by a long work.  While Innopolis was being built, the university was located in Kazan.  First, in the IT park, then moved to the office on Profsoyuznaya street.  Elmira recalls that in the bustle of her entire working life she once even missed the onset of spring.  ‚ÄúWe left after work, and it's already spring outside.  We did not notice how she came. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúInnopolis is growing before our eyes, like a child‚Äù <br><br>  The move to Innopolis took place in April 2015, 2 months before the official settlement of the city.  ‚ÄúThe pace of development then very impressive.  The city was changing before our eyes.  Who has children, they will definitely understand.  This is an indescribable feeling when the child begins to crawl, then takes the first steps.  The same analogy can be drawn throughout the city.  We went to work, there was only one picture around - we built houses, arranged paths, planted trees.  In the evening, walked back home - and the path for pedestrians is ready, and the construction of houses was approaching delivery ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be3/9f4/47c/be39f447cc9043f7bb86311a7c1ee70d.jpg"><br><br>  At first, the city was not crowded.  Not counting the builders, no more than 50 people.  Everyone knew each other and went to visit in the evenings.  Now more than 800 people live in Innopolis.  The city is filled with life.  Opened kindergarten, school, IT Lyceum.  Appeared shop, beauty salon, pharmacy.  ‚ÄúThe other day at a gathering of citizens, the mayor of the city told the residents what had been done over the past year.  I was impressed. ‚Äù <br><br>  Their job is to look for friends around the world. <br><br>  Now the department of international relations of Innopolis University employs 3 people.  Elmira heads the direction, in her team - Irina Lyamina and Sergey Karapetyan.  For them, February was a landmark month.  Exactly 3 years ago Elmira herself came, a year ago Sergey joined.  In February, Irina celebrates her birthday.  And this month fell the professional holiday of diplomatic workers.  The guys without doubt identify themselves with this profession, because their main occupation is to look for friends around the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/277363/">https://habr.com/ru/post/277363/</a></p>
