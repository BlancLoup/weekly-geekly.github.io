The cost at that time was 8000 p.  per month.  In addition to these costs, the client separately paid the cost of texts and references.  The total amount for the client was ~ 18000 p.  per month (depending on the volume of purchased links and texts). <br><br>  <b>Start</b> <br><br>  Such results were in the first month. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fc/a31/0be/2fca310beed47afa0bba2ec39a4c933c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is approximately 6 people per day from both search engines.</i>

      <b>Second start</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/fa0/b42/ef7fa0b42449b7da24e54b0ebe9e9983.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It can be seen that after optimization the traffic increased approximately 1.5 times.  Unfortunately, this is not the result that the customer expected.  Lead with SEO really was not.  The client had to spend money on advertising. <br><br>  <b>Key decision</b> <br><br>  Since the average check in a niche is ~ 40000 r., The client could afford to work all over Russia.  It was decided to create several sub-domains for the main regions.  It was Krasnodar, Kaluga, Tula and Rostov-on-Don. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This decision led to even greater costs for content, it was necessary to write unique texts for each site so that they would not be glued together (this is when Yandex combines the same sites and recognizes only one of them, usually the very first). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/78c/e51/7ce/78ce517cecdd2452be7a4806c16ef62b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The graph shows that at the beginning of the year traffic dramatically increased to 70-80 visits per day.  I note that we purposely worked with Yandex, since the regional strategy on Google (my opinion) is doomed to failure. <br><br>  <b>The main advantages of the subdomain strategy are:</b> <br>  1. Zoning competition.  We have a good site, why not show it to every region, not just Moscow?  There the competition is lower, the sites are still from 2000, and companies (in our niche) do not see prospects on the Internet. <br>  2. Transparency for the client.  You can see my every action in full view.  Man understands what he pays money for.  He sees a subdomain, sees texts, links and other changes. <br>  3. Unlimited scalability.  Almost every city in Russia is in the regions of Yandex, and personal extradition is issued for each.  For small cities, for example, for Glazov or Sarapul, you can do nothing at all to get to the TOP.  Enough to register meta tags and that's it, in a month the site is in the first positions. <br><br>  <b>The main disadvantages of the subdomain strategy are:</b> <br>  1. The biggest minus - labor-intensive, expensive.  In order for sites not to stick together, it is necessary to unify your content.  This is a new text each time.  You can, of course, take template schemes, but not the fact that Yandex will like it.  We try to make unique articles or rewrite. <br>  2. The conveyor structure of the work.  This is a plus and a minus.  Working with large amounts of text (up to 400 articles per month) implies multi-level control.  Here is what you need to do to achieve an adequate result on the texts: <br>  1) write; <br>  2) check; <br>  3) agree / send for revision; <br>  4) place; <br>  5) optimize (perebinovka, mega-tags, pictures). <br><cut></cut><br>  At each stage there are difficulties.  Sometimes authors simply cannot write 100 texts on the same topic, they fade.  Have to change.  And the replacement of the author is a constant refinement, conflicts, erasure, etc.  By the way, you can add to the list item 0 - this is a search for authors. <br><br>  3. Resource-intensive work.  Here are the main cost items. <br>  1) copywriter; <br>  2) proofreader; <br>  3) content manager; <br>  4) links. <br><br>  Paid software that we use: <br>  1. Key-collector - collection of fam.  kernels; <br>  2. <a href="https://orfogrammka.ru/">orfogrammka.ru</a> - check for errors; <br>  3. Content-watch.ru - batch uniqueness check; <br>  4. Advego.ru - texts and text analysis service; <br>  5. Comparser - bulk check tags, relink.  In general - a universal program for working with the amount of data. <br>  6. Other situational programs (not always paid), for example, analysis of links from megaindex or checktrust. <br><br>  Results after another 3 months: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b93/72b/45a/b9372b45a2fc43a2d4f34ddf71c190cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is more pleasant traffic.  Along the way, several more subdomains are created. <br><br>  As a result, all the regions needed by the client are fully covered by our sites.  Practically in every region (Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Tula, Voronezh, Krasnodar, Simferopol, Kaluga, Ryazan, Vladimir, Ivanovo, Sevastopol, Maikop, Yaroslavl, Vologda, Volgograd, Smolensk, Saransk, Penza, Bryansk, Kazan, Kursk , Lipetsk, Yoshkar-Ola, Tambov, Penza, etc.) we are in the TOP 10 for the main requests.  For example, "Engineering surveys" or "Engineering surveys price." <br><br>  The picture for the year looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97c/e9f/aff/97ce9faff48ebd23706dd7ba4a16bca3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Further development</b> <br><br>  It was decided at this stage to develop not in depth, but in breadth.  That is, to create several more projects on the subject and work in a similar way.  What came out of this can be seen in the screenshots (they are by region). <br><br>  In numbers, it is difficult to determine how the CTR increased from finding two or four additional sites in the issue.  No tests have been conducted.  But at least 2-3 times exactly. <br><br>  <b>Customer benefits</b> <br><br>  After a year of progress, we managed to achieve quite good results.  Two main indicators: <br>  1. 30-35 calls of target customers per day; <br>  2. Savings on advertising (about 300,000 rubles a month); <br><br>  The client completely refused to advertise this project.  It works exclusively at the expense of SEO promotion and consistently brings calls from all points of Russia. <br><br>  But the result is far from perfect.  We covered only 20-25% of the semantic core.  For other requests, our sites are not ranked.  In addition, the issue was attended by competitors who also actively used their subdomains. <br><br>  <i>Below are screenshots of additional sites in the TOP.</i>  <i>Each screenshot is a separate region (you can see by snippets which one).</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fcc/95f/895/fcc95f895eec73451ccffdd5222cfff6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6b/223/f34/b6b223f34c9bd68bd7439ecad8251a01.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a1/8b3/9b2/3a18b39b2e23ae294707dde341c82ce9.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/8a9/6de/0038a96de36db07e2843b4fe1882398c.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/709/d1f/53b/709d1f53b1fb16ff725d951899509d28.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442520/</a></p>
