The basis for it was a large-scale analysis of examples of using the new features of the 8th version of Java in real projects.  Practice shows that they are often used "for evil, not for good."  The report by Nikolai and Oleg will help avoid common mistakes with Java 8 and will enable developers to significantly improve the quality of the code.  In such a reading, the topic was never touched at industry conferences, and the Kharkiv Java community will be the first audience to present this experience. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sY0JocJOlec" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The subsequent part of the event will be held in <b>2 streams and includes 12 technology sessions</b> that cover a fairly wide range of Java topics.  There will be plenty to choose from both for development enthusiasts and those interested in application testing issues.  For them, the second part of the forum will be especially valuable, where, in a block of three reports, strategies and features of integration testing from <b>Nicholas Frankel (SAP Hybris)</b> , using Groovy language to generate test data, and using Groovy-based Spock Framework for testing purposes will be considered. a framework that can significantly ‚Äúmake life easier‚Äù for a development team, comparing its capabilities with JUnit and TestNG. <br><br>  You can hear about the magic of aspect-oriented programming and, in particular, its use in Hibernate immediately after the key report, but this does not end the topic of Hibernate.  <b>Nikolai Alimenkov (EPAM)</b> and <b>Igor Dmitriev (Luxoft)</b> , considering the actual performance theme, will tell <b>why Hibernate and other ORM frameworks sometimes work slower</b> and make much more queries to the database compared to the usual SQL, which are the "pitfalls" in using of these tools, and how to get around them correctly by building interaction with the database using Hibernate in the most optimal way without sacrificing performance. <br><br><h3>  Second stream </h3><br>  On the second thread at this time, <b>Big Data and Enterprise</b> will rule in the image of Spark, one of the most promising in this area.  <b>Boris Trofimov (Sigma Software),</b> on the basis of his considerable experience, will talk about using Spark to scale data and functionality in projects.  Also within the framework of a separate session, the development of InsightEdge, created by EPAM specialists, will be presented, which allows to increase the performance of Spark queries many times (up to 30 times faster than Spaimage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/904/c23/14d/904c2314df974e90b08e720b2079d189.png" alt="JavaDay 2016"><br><br>  And those developers who want to continue the line of improvement of the code, which started from the first key JavaDay report, are awaited by the session of <b>Sergey Morents (Provectus IT, Inc.)</b> entitled <b>‚ÄúThe ideal code.</b>  <b>Fiction or reality "</b> using best practices and approaches, illustrated by many practical examples. <br><br>  Also on the second stream, during a live coding session, expert in DevOps and cloud technologies <b>Anton Kranga (Accenture Latvia)</b> will demonstrate the use of Amazon Web Services to deploy a secure, scalable and fault-tolerant application, as well as point out the possibilities and limitations of this platform that are worth paying. attention to the developer. <br><br>  <b>Oleg Tsal-Tsalko will</b> complete the ‚Äúgood code‚Äù logical line on JavaDay with his hit parade of violations of the Clean Code principles gathered from many years of code review experience on real projects.  In addition, forum participants are waiting for sessions dedicated to building a high-performance development team from <b>Krzysztof Ras from Green Dynamics (Poland)</b> , as well as automating the assembly, deployment and release management for various environments in 15 minutes based on the Microsoft Azure platform from Anton Boyko, MVP using this technology since 2014. <br><br>  The final chord for the Kharkov JavaDay this year will be an incendiary report from <b>Vladimir Tsukur (Zoomdata)</b> , dedicated to the rapidly gaining popularity of the Lombok framework, which allows the developer to write much less code, use annotations instead of trivial code, significantly reducing development time.  In this thematic session, live coding format will be actively used to demonstrate the advantages and features of the effective use of Lombok. <br><br><h3>  Accents from the organizers </h3><br>  At JavaDay 2016 in Kharkiv, good and bad Java 8 practices are waiting for you; active Hibernate users should definitely visit the performance tuning report to truly understand the principles of how this tool works.  Anyone interested in testing your application is advised to choose the first stream, and behind Big Data (Spark) and cloud technologies it is worth going to the second.  We also recommend that all participants attend one of the ‚Äúclean code‚Äù sessions - the hit parade Clean Code Violations or The ideal code.  Fiction or reality. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309338/</a></p>
