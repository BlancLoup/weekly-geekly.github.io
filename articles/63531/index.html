  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Did the Russian Post receive a dilom for information technology?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00e/6f8/11b/00e6f811be134fcf02ac744c6117aad2.png" alt="image"><br>  Today, I accidentally wandered onto the UFPS site of the Primorsky Territory (a branch of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù) and found there wonderful news from yesterday's number - ‚Äú <a href="http://www.postpk.ru/news/%3Fid%3D85">The Russian Post received a dilom for information technology!</a>  ".  I can not refrain from commenting on this amazing text. <br><blockquote>  Following the results of participation in the fourth international Asia-Pacific exhibition ‚ÄúInformation Technologies and Communication 2009‚Äù, the Primorsky branch of the FSUE ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù received a diploma for participating in the exhibition and contributing to the development of information technologies in the Primorsky Territory.  The exhibition organizers acknowledged that the Russian Post in the most unique way approached participation in the exhibition. </blockquote><br>  Do you think that ‚Äúin a unique way‚Äù means the most advanced technologies were demonstrated?  Ha!  Read on :) <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  This year, for the first time, the exhibition ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù worked in the post office mode, where it was possible to use postal services - buy stamps, send a letter, cash out plastic cards. </blockquote><br>  Well, I understand that ‚Äúsending a letter‚Äù is a connection.  But where is information technology?  And what is so ingenious about displaying a letter at an exhibition in the 21st century? <br><blockquote>  Taking into account the fact that the exhibition was held on the eve of the Day of the city of Vladivostok, the postal service, in addition to the thematic content of the exhibition stand, also took care of entertainment events for visitors.  So, at the opening of the exhibition, the exhibition hall included five girls in clothes made from postal consumables - postcards, scotch tapes, paper, nylon tow, drawing all the attention of the press, organizers, guests of the exhibition to the stand of the Russian Post.  Such a non-standard solution of the stand presentation was the occasion to mark the postmen with a diploma for the outstanding participation in the industry exhibition. </blockquote><br>  HERE !!!  Here it is!!!  Aaaaaa !!!  Hold me up five!  That's what I understand, information technology! <br><blockquote>  According to the concept, already after the opening of the exhibition, the posters of the Russian Post began to work actively with the previously invited guests - they demonstrated the work of the franking machine, capable of processing up to 1,500 letters, told about the public Internet access points, most of which are working in rural Primorye today. </blockquote><br>  We are silent about the Russian language, okay? <br><blockquote>  It is worth noting that the special attention of the guests of the exhibition at the booth of the Russian Post attracted unique postcards and envelopes, as well as a special stamp with a festive stamp depicting the emblem of Vladivostok, which were issued specifically on the eve of Vladivostok Day.  ‚ÄúEvery year the exhibition‚Äú Infotechnologies and communication ‚Äùbecomes more large-scale and interesting.  The Post of Russia is a regular participant of this exhibition: we have been exhibiting here since 2006. The active introduction of modern technologies is a strategic focus of the Russian Post, so we are certainly very interested in participating in such an exhibition and forum, ‚Äùsaid Olga Ryzhkova, Deputy Director of the Federal Post Service Directorate of Primorsky Territory - a branch of the FSUE "Russian Post". </blockquote><br>  Envelopes, postcards, stamps - it's all cool, I also at school collected stamps and cards with a special quit.  But for this purpose it is not necessary to do in all branches the points of collective access to the Internet.  Why?  Probably so that people can take advantage of modern technologies, the introduction of which is a strategic direction.  There is, there are modern technologies at the Post of Russia, but what about that!  Right on the main page of the site of this UFPS on the left you can find nice pictures with the words ‚ÄúDepartures 1 class‚Äù, ‚ÄúEMS Russian Post‚Äù, ‚ÄúCyberPoshta‚Äù and ‚ÄúCyberMoney‚Äù.  Four links to four modern technologies.  But only all of them, alas, lead to the page that says ‚ÄúError!  There is no such page! ‚Äù.  So what is it?  Could there have been at least a picture of five girls in clothes from postal consumables, eh? <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/962/982/3de/9629823de9788f6058ecd3b556cfb846.png" alt="image"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  PS When I already added this note, it became interesting to me what ‚ÄúEMS Russian Post‚Äù is.  In order not to miss, I went to the main site of the Russian Post - <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/">www.russianpost.ru</a> .  And what do you think? <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e6/cfa/293/9e6cfa293d9edd6703f23afe3538561f.png" alt="image"></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  So the Primorye people were lucky ... </div>
