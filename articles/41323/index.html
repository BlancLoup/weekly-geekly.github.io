      And I was lucky - I am now working with just such a person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have been thinking for a long time that it is necessary to work with the customer in this way;  but he showed me how it is implemented in practice.  Zhenya, if you read this (which I doubt), thanks;) <br><br>  Of course, the situation is taken for the printing industry and a bit idealized (I was lucky), but the approach can and should be projected onto any orders.  Later I will discuss in more detail some moments, if it turns out to be necessary for someone.  In the meantime - in general!  :) <br><br>  <b>So, step 1: Preliminary agreement.</b>  The fact that there is such a work, you need to do something like that.  We pretend how much it can cost, and we make an appointment. <br><br>  <b>Step 2: Wow, what are the letters.</b>  At the meeting, the customer transmits all the materials for the work and explains what exactly he needs - clearly and with examples.  Somewhere here, representing the volume (it seems, the Internet eats my literacy) of work, we get the price. <br><br>  <b>Step 3: Preparing the template.</b>  We sit at home and collect pages, trying to reproduce what the customer wants.  As a rule, this is not possible for us, so we proceed to step 4 with draft material that can be moved, adjusted, repainted, etc.  <i>If you are able to impose this disc in 10-15 minutes - <s>it</s> is <s>better</s> to do it right ‚Äúwithout departing from the cash register‚Äù, so as not to meet with the client once again and save a lot of time and effort for both of you.</i>  <i>Then steps 2-4 are <s>remarkably</s> combined into one :)</i> (UPD) On the other hand, not every customer, having noted such quickness to himself, will be able to adequately assess your efforts.  Somehow I don‚Äôt want to give a lot of money for work done in 10 minutes :) <br><br>  <b>Step 4: The bride.</b>  The client sees what you brought to him and, as a rule, this is not exactly what he had in mind.  But now, having all the material at hand, you can move and poke right on the spot under his (client) watchful supervision.  At the same time, the more active the client takes part in the process, the more he will like the result (psychology!). <br><br>  <b>Step 5: Layout itself.</b>  Having a ready start, we impose ALL the work.  Call and make an appointment again. <br><br>  <b>Step 6: Points on I.</b> The client carefully considers the result of your (common with him) work, giving a list of comments.  If you have worked together correctly before, the list will be minimal (in my case, select here, switch places).  It is advisable to show the work of the entire office (let them spend 10 minutes of their time) - so surely for sure. <br><br>  <b>Step 7: Correction.</b>  The resulting list of edits is entered into the layout - everyone is happy.  If you worked actively and correctly, there will be no new iterations.  Otherwise, steps 6-7 may be repeated several times. <br><br>  <b>Step 8: In the morning, the chairs - in the evening money.</b>  The customer receives the final version.  We get money - this is my favorite moment :) <br><br>  <b>The result:</b> spent a minimum of time and nerves.  The customer is satisfied and will return to you again.  You are satisfied and will be happy to return to the customer! <br><br>  Taken from the <a href="http://kitich.in.ua/blog/13">blog's Just Kitich</a> :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41323/</a></p>
