This person gave an invite for fasting in the sandbox, for which I am sincerely grateful. <br><br>  Good afternoon, dear habrasoobschestvu! <br>  I want to submit to your court a tiny Qt library written to simplify the programming of database applications.  Using it, I made one database to order, and although it was just a term paper, she helped me hone and think through many points.  Now I am writing another database, already real, for serious organization.  Little by little, I bring new features to the library.  You look, sometime something good will turn out. <br><br><h5>  Preamble </h5><br>  Since the summer of 2009, I have been actively studying Qt.  And you know, really happy to program in this environment.  She solved all my major problems.  For example, I did not know how to build the interface of the program, I was especially annoyed that each control in the same Builder needed to be leveled, dragged, adjusted in size and position.  With Qt, you can forget about it - and engage exclusively in aesthetics without any routine.  In addition, I like STL for its cunning approach (although I still don‚Äôt really know it), and in Qt it is, as well as its own containers, use it with pleasure.  And ‚ÄúKyut‚Äù is a very well-thought-out library, all such OOPs are high-tech and technologically advanced.  And I really respect and respect the PLO, as well as the design patterns ... <br>  At the end of the summer I get an order for the database.  The question of what to write is not worth it.  Of course, Qt!  Practice will help to learn what is still hidden.  I start working on the application.  It seems that the beautiful forms are obtained, the code is convenient to write, everything is there ... And I should be happy, but here it turns out noodles from SQL-C ++ code.  Mistaken, accompanied by a difficult, seemingly miserable ... How then do people see in their eyes and call themselves a programmer? <br>  So was born the projector.  Yes, a small project designed to save from all this disgrace.  Fortunately, the path is well-trodden, and for all programming languages, for all platforms there are already similar things.  Well, okay, that is.  I want my own, especially under Qt I did not find anything sensible.

    <h5>  QST: QsT SQL Tools </h5><br>  This is a toolkit, or rather, a library, or even better, a set of classes, which saves the programmer from ‚ÄúSQL noodles‚Äù in the code.  Naturally, using query generation, but not simple, but through special DFD descriptors, which gives many, many useful buns.  Somehow: we refer to the fields of the database table by name, extract any data, have different DFD descriptors for different requests, work with representation models, encapsulate all of this into handler classes, and they still know a lot of things, they are inherited from AbstractModelHanlder ... <br>  But - in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Dfd </h5><br>  I developed a concept called <b>DFD</b> : <b><i>‚ÄúDeclarative Field Descriptor‚Äù</i></b> .  (I want to add L [anguage] to it, but does it pull on the language? ..) The concept of generating simple SQL queries from descriptors.  The easiest way to explain it is by example.  We want, then we create such a query: <br><br> <code>SELECT [ID], LastName, FirstName, ParentName, SerialNumber, Number, DocType_ID <br> FROM tPersonalDocuments <br> WHERE <br> [ID] &gt; 30 <br> AND <br> DocType = 1 <br></code> <br><br>  And it will look like this: <br><br> <code>SqlBatch batch; <br> batch.addSource("tPersonalDocuments"); <br> //  1 <br> batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("[ID]", fv_invisible, fr_id) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("LastName", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 120) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("FirstName", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 120) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("ParentName", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 120) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("SerialNumber", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 45) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("Number", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 70) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("DocType_ID", fv_invisible) <br> //  2 <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("[ID]", SqlValue(30, fo_greater), fp_where) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("DocType_ID", SqlValue(1), fp_where); <br> <br> //  ‚Äì .  0      . <br> SqlQueryDescriptor queryDescriptor(batch, sql_select, 0); <br></code> <br><br>  As you can see, the list for <b><u>FROM is</u></b> loaded using <b>SqlBatch :: addSource ()</b> , and then fields, fields, fields ... Everything is simple.  The <b>SqlField</b> class is loaded <b>into SqlBatch</b> , which (section 1) is responsible for a specific field, the role of the field, its presence / absence in the Qt's view, the heading for the column in view and the width of this column.  For example, the ID field is key, and this is an important point, and we give it the role of a key: <b><i>fr_id</i></b> .  And it should not be displayed in the view, i.e., we want to hide from the user what the key of the entry is.  No, if we don‚Äôt want to hide, so please, no one will interfere ... In section 2 we describe filters for <b><u>WHERE</u></b> , and to distinguish them from others, there is the <b><i>fp_where</i></b> parameter belonging to <b>enum SqlFieldPurpose</b> .  For the filter, you must specify the field and the value - a special class <b>SqlValue</b> .  In the example, we see integer values;  here: <br><br> <code>batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("[ID]", SqlValue(30, fo_greater), fp_where); <br></code> <br><br>  specified comparison functor "more", and here: <br><br> <code>batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("DocType_ID", SqlValue(1), fp_where); <br></code> <br><br>  the functor is not specified, so the default for integer is <b><i>fo_equal</i></b> . <br>  Yes, yes, everything is good, but what about the other types, especially with the string and dates?  Everything is possible!  These snatches of SQL query: <br><br> <code>FirstName LIKE '%' <br> AND <br> Birthday BETWEEN convert(datetime '20.01.2009', 104) AND <br> convert(datetime '15.05.2009', 104) <br></code> <br><br>  with a flick of the wrist turn into elegant lines: <br><br> <code>batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("FirstName", SqlValue("", fo_like, fb_right), fp_where) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("Birthday", SqlValue(QDate(2009, 1, 20)), SqlValue(QDate(2009, 5, 15))); <br></code> <br><br>  (The date is automatically converted according to the pattern specified in the constant.) <br>  Recall that in addition to the <b><u>WHERE clause</u></b> in a simple <b><u>SELECT</u></b> , there can also be <b><u>ORDER BY</u></b> and <b><u>GROUP BY</u></b> .  The <b>SqlField</b> class has constructors for these cases: <br><br> <code>SqlField("Birthday", fp_order_by) <br> SqlField("Birthday", fp_group_by) <br></code> <br><br>  (However, for <b><u>GROUP BY,</u></b> we should indicate aggregating functions and only those fields that participate in them - but we will leave it on the programmer‚Äôs conscience if he has a valid SQL query or not.) <br>  The query itself is generated by the <b>SqlGen</b> and <b>SqlQueryComposer classes</b> .  In fact, it generates only <b>SqlQueryComposer</b> , and <b>SqlGen</b> determines the order of the fields and provides a high-level interface for generation.  (By the way, if you wish, you can rewrite the <b>SqlQueryComposer</b> class under another SQL dialect.) Here‚Äôs how you can get a <b><u>SELECT</u></b> query, passing it our <b>SqlBatch</b> class filled with fields: <br><br> <code>SqlGen gen; <br> QString selectQuery = gen.query(batch, sql_select); <br></code> <br><br>  And if we write something else instead of <i>sql_select</i> , for example, <i>sql_update</i> , the generator will try to generate an <b><u>UPDATE</u></b> request, taking only those fields that are allowed for it.  What kind?  Well, those with the <b>SqlFieldPurpose</b> parameter instead of <b>|</b>  along with others.  Here is an example of such a field: <br><br> <code>SqlField("Age", SqlValue(10), fp_where | fp_update | fp_insert) <br></code> <br><br>  Accordingly, with <b><i>sql_update there</i></b> will be a picture like this: ‚ÄúSET Age = 10‚Äù, with <b><i>sql_insert</i></b> something like this: <br><br> <code>INSERT INTO ‚Ä¶ (Age) <br> VALUES (10) <br></code> <br><br>  and for all other cases - just a filter for <b><u>WHERE</u></b> : <br><br> <code>WHERE <br> Age = 10 <br></code> <br><br>  The concept of DFD descriptors is starting to clear up, right?  And it is true that it is very similar to other approaches.  I was not eager to originate ... <br><br>  But this is all bullshit.  The question is - how to use our garbage.  Here, in fact, where there are amenities for which you read everything on top. <br><br><h5>  AbstractModelHandler </h5><br>  In my library there is a certain abstract class <b>AbstractModelHandler</b> .  It contains a lot of good things, and nobody and nothing can work with DFD descriptors better than it.  Suppose a programmer wants to encapsulate work with the table of branches of arms <b>tArmyTypes</b> .  To do this, it creates the heir class <b>h_ArmyTypesHandler</b> : <br><br> <code>const int ARMY_TYPES_QUERY = 7575; <br> <br> class h_ArmyTypesHandler : public AbstractModelHandler <br> { <br> public: <br> h_ArmyTypesHandler(); <br> <br> private: <br> <br> virtual SqlQueryDescriptor _selector(const SqlQueryModelTypes &amp;modelType = mt_plain, const int &amp;queryNumber = 0) const; <br> virtual SqlQueryDescriptor _inserter(const int &amp;queryNumber = 0) const; <br> virtual SqlQueryDescriptor _updater(const int &amp;queryNumber = 0) const; <br> virtual SqlQueryDescriptor _deleter(const int &amp;queryNumber = 0) const; <br> virtual SqlQueryDescriptor _executor(const int &amp;queryNumber = 0) const; <br> }; <br></code> <br><br>  The virtual functions <b>_selector (), _inserter (), updater (), _deleter ()</b> and <b>_executor () are</b> inherited from the base class.  It is they who contain DFD descriptors and issue them at the request of other <b>AbstractModelHandler</b> 's functions.  For example, here is a typical redefinition of the <b>_selector ()</b> function: <br><br> <code>SqlQueryDescriptor h_ArmyTypesHandler::_selector(const SqlQueryModelTypes &amp;modelType, const int &amp;queryNumber) const <br> { <br> SqlBatch batch; <br> <br> batch.addSource("tArmyTypes"); <br> <br> if (queryNumber == ARMY_TYPES_QUERY) <br> { <br> batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("ID", fv_invisible, fr_id) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("ShortName", fv_visible, fr_none, "", 90) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("Name", fv_visible, fr_none, " ", 100) <br> <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("ID", value(ID_VALUE), fp_where) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("Name", value("Name"), fp_where) <br> &lt;&lt; SqlField("ShortName", value("ShortName"), fp_where); <br> } <br> else <br> if (queryNumber == LAST_ID) <br> { <br> batch &lt;&lt; SqlField("max(ID)", fv_visible, fr_none); <br> } <br> else <br> { <br> Q_ASSERT(false); <br> } <br> <br> return SqlQueryDescriptor(batch, sql_select, queryNumber); <br> } <br></code> <br><br>  We see here something new: a certain <b>value</b> function <b>()</b> .  Perhaps someone has already guessed that it returns by name the previously written <b>SqlValue ()</b> value, for example, passed to <b>h_ArmyTypesHandler</b> somewhere in the form class: <br><br> <code>h_ArmyTypesHandler th; <br> th.setValue("Name", SqlValue("__", fo_not_equal, fb_none)); <br></code> <br><br>  That is, we save the value by the <b>setValue ()</b> function under the desired name, and then in the descriptor we retrieve it using the <b>value ()</b> function (both from the <b>AbstractModelHandler</b> class).  Now, when generating the query, we will have parameterized DFD descriptors. <br><br>  The penultimate line of the example sheds light on the third parameter of the constructor of the <b>SqlQueryDescriptor</b> class: this is the request number.  With the same <b>_selector ()</b> function, you can generate different requests, at least two, at least ten: for each situation, your own request.  And this is good.  Once you need such fields, another time you need such;  then you would like to call a query with aggregation functions, and when it‚Äôs just a query, not from that table at all.  It is enough for you to determine the request number for each DFD descriptor, and voila! <br>  A natural question arises how to generate and execute SQL queries in general.  Well, for example, like this: <br><br> <code>‚Ä¶ <br> const int ARMY_TYPE_INSERT_QUERY = 5; <br> const int ARMY_TYPE_UPDATE_QUERY = 68; <br> ‚Ä¶ <br> <br> h_ArmyTypesHandler th; <br> th.setValue("Name", SqlValue("__", fo_not_equal, fb_none)); <br> th.Insert(ARMY_TYPE_INSERT_QUERY); <br> <br> th.setValue(ID_VALUE, SqlValue(10)); <br> th.Update(ARMY_TYPE_UPDATE_QUERY); <br> th.Delete(4); <br></code> <br><br>  At the same time, the corresponding functions are <b>called</b> : <b>_inserter ()</b> , <b>_updater ()</b> and <b>_deleter ()</b> , where the descriptors lie.  Then the abstract parent of the handler generates SQL and executes it with Qt.  It's simple. <br><br>  However, more often you have to work with <b><u>SELECT</u></b> queries, which you cannot fulfill into emptiness, because you need to see the result of the selection!  We wish, for example, that the TableView displays a table of arms of service.  No problems! <br><br>  ... But first, a retreat.  Qt implements one type of <a href="http://doc.crossplatform.ru/qt/4.3.2/model-view-introduction.html">MVC pattern</a> , which requires a data model for <b>QTableView</b> .  Those are in Qt, and it is possible and to make the.  I admit honestly, I am not strong in programming my models, but for the library I wrote the simplest tree model, which I lacked so much - <b>SqlTreeModel</b> .  Yes, in Qt there is no tree model that meets my requirements, or I just don't know much.  Anyway, in QST there are two models: <b>SqlTreeModel</b> and <b>SqlQueryModel</b> , the latter only slightly differs from <b>QSqlQueryModel</b> , inheriting from it.  Models are actively used in the <b>AbstractModelHandler</b> class. <br><br>  Now we need to delve into another concept of the QST library: data source.  This is, in fact, a bunch of DFD - Model - View.  Each data source is named, the name is set by the programmer.  To display in our TableView the table of the types of troops, we create a data source in the form class: <br><br> <code>‚Ä¶ <br> h_ArmyTypesHandler _handler; <br> SqlQueryModel _model; <br> ‚Ä¶ <br> <br> void f_ArmyTypesForm::loadArmyTypes() <br> { <br> _handler.reloadSource(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ARMY_TYPES_QUERY, &amp;_model); <br> _handler.setTableView(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ui-&gt;TableView); <br> } <br></code> <br><br>  And that's all.  Columns with specified widths and headers will appear in the TableView table.  And these parameters are set, therefore, in the function <b>h_ArmyTypesHandler :: _ selector ()</b> .  I will list the columns that appeared: ‚ÄúShortName‚Äù with the name ‚ÄúAbbreviation‚Äù and 90 wide;  ‚ÄúName‚Äù with the name ‚ÄúKind of Troops‚Äù and a width of 100. But the ‚ÄúID‚Äù field will not be displayed because it has fv_invisible ... In other words, the <b>reloadSource ()</b> and <b>setTableView ()</b> functions will do the entire programmer‚Äôs routine for formatting the table. <br>  ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE is the textual name of the new data source.  However, if you call <b>loadArmyTypes ()</b> again, the source will be ‚Äúoverloaded‚Äù: the <b>_selector ()</b> function will be called again, a <b><u>SELECT</u></b> query will be generated again, and the data model will delete old lines and take new ones from the database.  When calling the following functions, we get two different sets of lines: <br><br> <code>void f_ArmyTypesForm::someFunc1() <br> { <br> _handler.setValue(ID_VALUE, SqlValue(10)); <br> loadArmyTypes(); <br> } <br> <br> void f_ArmyTypesForm::someFunc2() <br> { <br> _handler.setValue(ID_VALUE, SqlValue(111, fo_less)); <br> loadArmyTypes(); <br> } <br></code> <br><br>  Yeah, yeah, that's not enough for me.  <b>AbstractModelHandler</b> allows you to create multiple data sources (otherwise why would we give them names?!.).  Suppose, in addition to the <b>TableView</b> , we also have a <b>TreeView</b> and a <b>ComboBox</b> on the form, where we want to output the same.  No problem!  We write something like the following: <br><br> <code>‚Ä¶ <br> h_ArmyTypesHandler _handler; <br> SqlQueryModel _model; <br> SqlQueryModel _modelPlainForTreeView; <br> SqlQueryModel _modelForComboBox; <br> ‚Ä¶ <br> <br> void f_ArmyTypesForm::loadArmyTypes() <br> { <br> _handler.reloadSource(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ARMY_TYPES_QUERY, &amp;_model); <br> _handler.setTableView(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ui-&gt;TableView); <br> <br> _handler.reloadSource(TREE_VIEW_SOURCE, ARMY_TYPES_QUERY, &amp;_modelPlainForTreeView); <br> _handler.setTreeView(TREE_VIEW_SOURCE, ui-&gt;TreeView); <br> <br> _handler.reloadSource(COMBO_BOX_SOURCE, ARMY_TYPES_QUERY, &amp;_modelForComboBox); <br> _handler.setComboBox(COMBO_BOX_SOURCE, ui-&gt;ComboBox); <br> } <br></code> <br><br>  And so what, you ask.  Like what?  Are different models transmitted?  Various.  Therefore, there are also three data sources.  Only the handler is shared, the queryNumber is the same - ARMY_TYPES_QUERY, therefore, the requests are generated the same.  But we can do magic things!  For example, such: <br><br> <code>//     ComboBox: <br> QVariant id = _handler.keyValueOfCurrent(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ui-&gt;ComboBox); <br> <br> //     TreeView: <br> QVariant id2 = _handler.keyValueOfView(TREE_VIEW_SOURCE); <br> <br> //   Name    ID == id2: <br> h_ArmyTypesHandler th; <br> th.setValue(ID_VALUE, SqlValue(id2)); <br> QVariant name = th.SelectToValue("Name", ARMY_TYPES_QUERY); <br> <br> //    TableView    (    ): <br> _handler.DeleteCurrent(ARMY_TYPES_SOURCE, ui-&gt;TableView); <br></code> <br><br>  And even select the data list: <br><br> <code>h_ArmyTypesHandler th; <br> th.setValue(ID_VALUE, SqlValue(id2)); <br> <br> QVariantMap valMap = th.SelectToMap(QStringList() &lt;&lt; "Name" &lt;&lt; "ShortName" &lt;&lt; "ID", ARMY_TYPES_QUERY); <br> <br> ui-&gt;LineEdit_Name-&gt;setText(valMap["Name"].toString()); <br></code> <br><br>  And not a single SQL query in the code!  Beauty!!! <br><br><h5>  In conclusion‚Ä¶ </h5><br>  Of course I do not disclose many details.  Even in such a small library they are more than enough.  Unfortunately, a lot of <b>QST</b> can not.  Strongly lacking a normal tree model;  the one that is, maybe with errors, and it also behaves strangely when interacting with <b>QTreeView</b> signals: it crashes under certain conditions, getting into someone else's memory.  I can not find a mistake.  I even have an example with which I addressed people in two Qt forums to help me, but so far no one has said anything. <br>  While there is no place in the DFD and more complex queries.  Now I am thinking about how to add an OR condition to the <b><u>WHERE</u></b> section.  Perhaps you should think about <b><u>JOIN</u></b> 's, which are very necessary.  Not that it is impossible to circumvent these limitations with the available means - it is possible, the SQL language is quite multifaceted, - however, it is also necessary to develop. <br>  Additionally, the library includes a class for working with database connections ( <b>DBConnection</b> ), as well as a class that sets the codec for the <b>tr ()</b> function ( <b>Cyrillic</b> ).  Well, a self-made <b>TreeItem</b> with borrowed ways to work with nodes.  I honestly do not like the class.  And <b>SqlTreeModel</b> does not like it.  I do not like when <b>new</b> and <b>delete are</b> scattered by code.  If we are working with memory, then through the principle of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">"Getting a resource is initializing</a> . <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">"</a>  You look, and rewrite everything in the mind.
