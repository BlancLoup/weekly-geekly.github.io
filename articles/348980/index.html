  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Biz Breeze # 1. Subjectively - on the news CRM and IT business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr√© publishes many interesting and different digests that we read every week: about events, mobile development, design, programming, etc.  It seemed strange to us that there are no stories about IT in business.  And yet, more and more banks, shops, insurers, and industries consider themselves not to be their industries, but to IT companies, because they use (and, importantly, create!) Programs, applications, complex solutions, and integration.  The topic is as close as possible to us, so we decided to create our own digest according to our own rules - without hundreds of references, lists and formalization - informal reading about interesting CRM events and not only.  Try it - suddenly like it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18e/e1a/2b9/18ee1a2b937380ca8e8239890b4d7428.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A few reservations in the first issue </h3><br>  We ourselves do not like everything in existing digests, so we decided to work in our own way.  Let us explain the basic principles of the releases of our Biz Breeze - all that caused a light wind of news towards <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">the RegionSoft team.</a> <br><br><ul><li>  We will choose the most interesting in our opinion news about IT projects and CRM systems, talk about them and comment a little. <br></li><li>  We do not promise weekly issues (at least for now), but we promise interesting ones - so subscribe so you don‚Äôt miss anything. <br></li><li>  We want to hear your opinion and are ready to discuss the materials of the issue in the comments. <br></li><li>  We will never tell about cryptocurrencies and ICO.  Well, if only some vendor from among the magic quadrant of Gartner does not come out on ICO. <br></li><li>  Most likely, we will talk exclusively about foreign projects - everyone is already able to read about Russians in our native language.  Although ... wait and see. <br></li><li>  We are doing a digest so that Habr's readers get a little more information about IT in business and, inspired, can create their own cool projects.  Why not? <br></li><li>  And yes, we open the eponymous channel in Telegram <a href="https://t.me/bizbreeze">t.me/bizbreeze</a> , in which we will throw news, judgments and something else.  And every day.  Come on light. <br></li></ul><br>  We are waiting for responses, ratings, suggestions for release - all take note.

    <h2>  Go! </h2><br><h3>  About CRM </h3><br><h4>  CRM for dating investors and startups </h4><br>  Venture Fund Dorm Room Fund released <a href="https://vcwiz.co/">VCWiz</a> , a tool with which startups and business owners can find an investor who is ready to invest in a company.  In fact, this is a kind of online CRM-system in which you can enter information about a startup, register your industry and even specify some wishes for an investor.  There you can also find a project for the investor himself or spy on what competitors you have to compete with, read the reviews.  Information about recent investments, co-investors, deals, etc. is available to certain user groups.  The mechanism of this CRM suggests the possibility of moving through the stages of the transaction: from negotiations to closure.  The system works with external sources, social networks and uses machine learning to recommend start-ups to investors.  By the way, this system was developed as part of the MIT master's thesis. <br><br>  <b>Our comment:</b> The idea is successful, implementation at height.  Such bases make the relations between the parties open and transparent, eliminate the influence of the human factor and accelerate business processes within the investment order.  In addition, such interactivity gives additional contact in a relaxed atmosphere outside of calls and correspondence, which means everyone has time to think and analyze. <br><br>  Of course, this is not a CRM system in the sense in which Russian business has become accustomed to seeing it, but it is CRM in terms of managing customer relationships.  It would be nice if similar solutions were implemented for the B2C sector, for example, in insurance. <br><br><h4>  CRM takes the patient to the doctor </h4><br>  The technology company working on marketing automation solutions in the health care industry Trilliant Health has released an iCRM class system ‚Äî intelligent CRM.  The company sees its mission to give hospitals and other medical institutions a tool that will save on marketing and make the impact more targeted.  The system collects data from different sources and allows you to understand the most subtle needs of a person in the field of health care and does so at the level of the best CRM for business.  CRM analyzes data on consumers' claims and their employers and identifies each potential patient (we remember that there are no healthy people, there are under-examined ones).  Based on the array of information, the system offers a communication channel (and exactly the one to which a person is likely to react) and individually selected content, which should point and successfully attract the client (excuse the patient). <br><br>  <b>Our comment:</b> The solution is cool, however, we failed to find out the prices for it and other software of the same company.  You can joke about what our healthcare automation systems are and what they have, but this is a stupid joke, because our health care system and private clinics are different (no worse and no better - just different).  As for what they announced in terms of functionality, this is a very good and thoughtful approach based on data.  And this is an excellent application of data in business. <br><br>  Of course, personification today solves almost everything, so the system is doomed to success.  We think that this CRM-system carries an important social function: such an approach will definitely contribute to the early diagnosis of diseases that have not yet begun to alarm a person. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">But we, in between times, remembered an old bike about automating our life.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">By the way, CRM in its purest form.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Hi, I want to make an urgent order.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Please dictate your personal identification number.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- 73650283-74-6253-08</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Thank you, Mr. Vasily Petrovich Ivanov.</i>  <i>You live in Moscow on the street.</i>  <i>Shakhtostroiteley, d. 5, bldg. ?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Yes I am at home now.</i>  <i>And how do you know all these phone numbers?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We are connected to the State Reference System</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúOkay, do you have meat pizza with mushrooms?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We think it will not suit you.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- According to the Ministry of Health, you have high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Well, what can I do?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We are sure that you will enjoy soy-yoghurt pizza</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Why would it suddenly?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Last week you ordered a soy diet recipe book online, and last month you bought a yogurt maker.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúOkay, and how much is this pizza?‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- You are now at home with your wife and two children, so you need to order two large pizzas, which will cost 600 rubles.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Go, pay on credit card, write down the number</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- According to information from your bank, you have an account overrun, so you need to pay in cash</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- It's good that I managed to withdraw some money from an ATM</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- According to information from the ATM and information about your previous purchases, you can not pay for the delivery of pizza at home, but you can pick up your order yourself.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Go, dictate the address, and I'll drive up in a car in half an hour.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- It is better to use a bicycle, because you have not extended the policy of compulsory insurance, so you have no right to drive your car.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- @ #% / $ @? #!</i>  <i>I completely forgot.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- You need to watch your speech, because the term of administrative punishment for using foul language in the subway, which was fixed by the tracking system, has not ended yet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(sniffs into the phone)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Great, your order is accepted and will be ready in half an hour.</i>  <i>Anything else?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Customer:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Nothing, but your ad promised to each pizza a free bottle of Pepsi.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Operator:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- We are sorry, but the Pension Fund regulations prohibit the provision of this drink to diabetics ...</i> <i><br></i> <br>  (Version with Pikabu). <br></div></div><br><h4>  Based on the reasoning of Manash Chaudhuri, ConvergeHub about blockchain in CRM </h4><br>  Have you gotten used to backend-as-a-service (BaaS)?  BaaS is now a blockchain-as-a-service.  Sophisticated guys have already noticed <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/solutions/blockchain/">this</a> Microsoft <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/solutions/blockchain/">page</a> (someone has already used similar in work, share?), But other corporations will soon offer BaaS.  And by the way, it is expected that the blockchain will find its place in CRM systems.  One of the biggest problems with CRM systems is incorrect or duplicate customer data.  The blockchain will allow to realize the principle ‚Äúone client - one block‚Äù, and thus the information will be unified and accurate, and all transactions will also relate to this block.  Thus, sales, marketing and support will get rid of the hated duplicates in the systems.  And of course, advanced customers and business customers will more trust, for example, purchases in your online store, if the blockchain is used in CRM.  Plus, the blockchain will help to make exclusively personalized offers and unique loyalty programs. <br><br>  <b>Our comment:</b> Unfortunately, while the blockchain is associated (and sometimes confused) with the bitcoin among the majority of the population.  Meanwhile, this is a promising technology for situations where potentially unsafe transactions are made.  Blockchain in CRM-systems is still difficult to imagine, but in banking and online retail - quite.  The main thing is that the use was not nominal - we have already seen several examples of how software vendors declared neural networks onboard their development, and in fact, all this turned out to be not a particularly sought-after business.  So far, the Russian small and medium businesses do not have a very high culture of automation, the words ‚Äúblockchain, bigdata, neural network‚Äù will only suggest that he buys an expensive solution and overpays for unnecessary functionality.  So the technical implementation of the blockchain in CRM is far away, and the transformation of technology into a marketing piece without real implementation is digging the grave for ourselves.  However, we do not exclude experiments with the same Salesforce. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">IT companies</font> </h3><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">Elections, elections, candidates - leaders</font> </h4><br>  The popular site of reviews and ratings of software G2 Crowd has issued a rating of TOP-100 development companies.  Details on the categories you can see <a href="https://www.g2crowd.com/best-software-companies">on the site itself</a> , and we give the 10 most-most, already with our subjective comments: <br><br><ol><li>  Slack Technologies, Inc.  - Messenger, which took its place absolutely deserved.  Excellent functionality, chat rooms, convenient management of tasks, files, status, the ability to make calls, etc.  - a workable solution for business, conferences, seminars, etc. <br></li><li>  Shopify is a developer of systems for online and offline retail, creating convenient and useful applications.  The undisputed leader, moreover, in the winning industry - retail builds up its muscles, and in a society of endless consumption is not going to deflate. <br></li><li>  Google - well, cool guys who argue.  Even this text we write and agree in Google Docs. <br></li><li>  Mailchimp - mailing service, convenient, with good analytics, with fine settings.  We have repeatedly appreciated its worth - and this despite the fact that we in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> have an in-built mail client of our own design.  By the way, we know the service is not worse - Sendgrid - we even made integration with it into RegionSoft CRM. <br></li><li>  Salesforce is an icon of style, and this is an icon of CRM and SFA.  High-quality, sophisticated, intelligent product with a sound ecosystem.  They have a lot to learn from all the CRMs of the world. <br></li><li>  WordPress Foundation - no comments, each of us knows the value of this blogging platform. <br></li><li>  SurveyMonkey - survey service.  In principle, good, but we preferred Typeform in due time.  Although we do not exclude that we will look towards the application again. <br></li><li>  Adobe doesn't need comments either.  In short, the company covers all media needs of any business. <br></li><li>  Zoom Video Communications is a video conferencing service.  We didn‚Äôt use it and can‚Äôt say anything, but in our time of distant employees, distributed teams and online trading, the importance of video calling is hard to overestimate. <br></li><li>  HubSpot is a service that covers all the tasks of 360-degree Internet marketing, including SEO and social networks.  We are somehow away from such things, but it is obvious that this is an extremely popular service. <br></li></ol><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">Asia trusts "figure", and "figure" is looking for security guards and analysts</font> </h4><br>  No less <a href="http://connectedfuture.economist.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Whitepaper-ConnectingCommerce.pdf">interesting statistics</a> came from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), which also rated the cities according to the degree of acceptance of the digital environment (trust in the digital environment).  It is significant that the top 10 "trusting numbers" cities included 8 Asian centers, such as Shanghai, Bangalore (1st place), Beijing, New Delhi, etc. <br><br>  By the way, in the same report there is a list of the most sought-after IT skills.  In principle, everything is pretty obvious - and of course, the business demand for specialists in the field of development and technology is extremely high, but the market for candidates is also extremely sad.  Alas, it is difficult to find a good developer, even with good money, especially in the regions.  We advise students to pay attention to this schedule - in 5-6 years you will be able to enter these areas with professionals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d69/977/8cd/d699778cdfeda5cf84f893d56737580d.png"><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Two paragraphs</font> </h3><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">Amazon presses</font> </h4><br>  Walmart cuts to 1,000 jobs at headquarters.  Optimization caused by the growing threat from Amazon.  The first wave of reductions at the beginning of 2018 amounted to 500 people, and marketers, HR specialists, merchandisers, real estate managers and others fell into it.  The second 500 people out of the expected 1000 will be cut in 2019.  At the same time, operations will be carried out to reduce the real estate pool to form a new headquarters. <br><br>  <b>Our comment:</b> Amazon is destined to crush more than one giant and radically change more than one rule of business and technology.  To confront him in the American and European markets is extremely difficult.  Literally in mid-January, at CES-2018, it was possible to observe how Amazon Alexa was introduced in almost every iron and refrigerator, how hard she struggled with Google's voice assistant.  And Amazon will determine how retail will become for a few more years. <br><br>  Regarding the structure of reductions at Walmart, it reflects the market as a whole: managers, marketers and HR are in many ways able to replace automation, companies are better focused on investing in IT infrastructure. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#cc0000">Whatsapp man</font> </h4><br>  WhatsApp has launched a separate application for small business owners called WhatsApp Business.  The application helps small businesses easily connect to customers and has features such as intelligent messaging.  In addition, the cards of the companies will contain all contacts, information about the business will be verified.  WhatsApp Business is also compatible with the WhatsApp website and is free and available to Android users. <br><br>  <b>Our comment:</b> On February 1, the number of WhatsApp users exceeded 1.5 billion people.  Every day through the application, users send about 60 billion messages.  Through this messenger with users communicate hundreds of thousands of small companies around the world.  Therefore, it is important that companies are verified and have accounts with detailed information - so will increase confidence and loyalty.  Messenger works for people and for small business, it is the correct and competent vector. <br><br>  Here is our first IT mosaic.
