Perhaps no fewer visitors to this site are also addicted to reading science fiction.  Probably many of you have read the wonderful <a href="https://fantlab.ru/autor5710">cycle of</a> novels of Nikolai Nikolayevich Gorky ‚ÄúAstrovityanka‚Äù.  These works, perhaps, are more suitable for a teenage audience, but they are wonderful to read at any age. <br><br>  Few people know that Nikolai Gorky is not just a talented writer, but a serious physicist.  The most famous of his works is the development of a model of the resonant origin of thin rings of Uranus and Saturn, carried out in collaboration with A.M.  Friedman.  This work made it possible to predict a whole series of satellites of Uranus, which were discovered during the flight of Voyager-2.  He currently lives and works in the United States, and is a director and senior fellow at the privately held Greenwich Institute for Science and Technology (GIST) in Virginia.  More information about scientific achievements can be read on the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/ru/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">wiki</a> . <br><br>  Not so long ago this author had another work, this time again in the scientific field.  On July 13, 2016, he published a curious <a href="http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/461/3/2929">article</a> in which he considered the solution of the Einstein equations for a system consisting of merging black holes.

It follows from the cyclical model, or the interpretation of the Big Bang theory, according to which the emergence of our Universe was the result of the collapse of some ‚Äúprevious‚Äù Universe.  In this hypothesis, it is assumed that the expansion process is periodically replaced by contraction, singularity and a new Big Bang.  But what mechanism controls these processes?  Many have heard of the dark energy of a galaxy scattering in the Universe, but its nature is still incomprehensible. <br><br>  The readers of ‚ÄúAstrovityanka‚Äù probably remember how the heroine of the novel expounded in her letter to a scientific journal a rather interesting hypothesis, with which she explained the nature of the ‚ÄúBig Rebound‚Äù.  In the course of the evolution of the universe, a huge part of its matter somehow gets into black holes.  In the process of compressing the universe, these BHs begin to collide.  As is known, when they merge, some of their mass (about 5%) is carried away by gravitational waves.  If we consider the stage of compression of the Universe, at which black hole fusions should be a frequent occurrence, then it can be shown that during the collapse a large part of the Universe can turn into gravitational radiation. <br><br>  What happens to the gravitational field of a system that quickly loses its gravitational mass?  It‚Äôs probably worth even quoting the words of the heroine of the novel - Nikki Greenwich: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúDuring collapse, all the ordinary matter of the world turns into gravitational radiation, because the generation of gravitational waves - in a contracting Universe grows inversely to the fifth power of the radius! ... Universe or the Big Bang.  Take the classic, two-dimensional simplified model of the gravitational field - a rubber film, bent around a heavy ball.  The light balls roll on a curved film to the central ball, illustrating its ‚Äúembarrassment‚Äù.  Sharply pull up a heavy ball with a film attached to it - a sharp curvilinear "cone" will be pulled up behind the body, and light balls will sprinkle in different directions, rolling down its slopes.  The ‚Äúcone‚Äù arose due to the finite speed of propagation of the disturbance along the rubber surface: the distant parts of the film with a delay learn about the rise of the central ball or about the disappearance of its gravitational mass.  We got a rubber illustration of a repulsive gravitational field near a declining mass. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  I once liked this hypothesis.  It was clear that in the mouth of a young girl, the author put his idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the universe appeared.  And now, eight years after the appearance of ‚ÄúAstrovityanka‚Äù, Nikolai Gorkavy finally publishes an article in which shows how a strong repulsive gravitational force arises in the system of merging black holes, which transforms the compression of the Universe into a Big Bang.  From a mathematical point of view, in a well-known equation for Newtonian attraction, proportional to the inverse square of the distance, an additional repulsive term appears, which is proportional to 1 / R and depends on time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61a/0c4/92c/61a0c492ca372540d16cd6fe18222016.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The calculations show that the repulsive force decreases with time, but persists for many billions of years, which can be explained by the current accelerated expansion of the Universe.  This means that the accelerated expansion of the Universe is connected not with the current state, but with the relic gravitational fields arising in the process of the Great Compression. <br><br>  Thus, the Big Bang and modern expansion can be explained in the framework of the classical theory of Einstein, without introducing new fields and exotic substances like dark energy.  More information about the article in Russian can be found <a href="http://don-beaver.livejournal.com/173482.html">in the blog of the author</a> . <br><br>  I was also very pleased to see how ideas from the pages of science fiction novels are embodied in our real life.  I hope this hypothesis will be confirmed in scientific observations.  And I, as a fan of the work of this writer, will wait for his new works. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396601/</a></p>
