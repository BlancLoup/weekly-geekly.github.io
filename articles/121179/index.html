Are there a lot of Eastern specifics, or am I wrong? </h2><br>  As for Dubai in particular, and the UAE in general, yes ... I consider this city as a place of permanent residence) Actually here, I already live for a year (almost).  And I am going to stay as long as possible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, the United Arab Emirates (namely, the United Arab Emirates, and not Oman, Saudi Arabia) is a victim of prejudice.  Dubai, for example, is quite a European city.  Here everyone speaks English, girls do not need to wear hijabs (black clothes, mandatory for local girls) or cover their heads, there is relatively no problem with alcohol :).  Dubai, a tourist city and local "learned to forgive" the inhabitants of other countries. <br><br>  Yes, there are some limitations.  Clothing should not be provocative, you can not appear drunk in public places.  But all this is tolerable :)

    <h2>  Is there any way to independent immigration? </h2><br>  You can not get citizenship.  And even if there are local relatives, it‚Äôs far from a fact that it will turn out to make citizenship.  The maximum that you can get is a resident visa.  It is issued by the employer for the entire duration of your work.  As a rule, this is considered a very good chance to stay here.  Because for a company that wants to break a contract, there will be a large number of problems.  It will be necessary to pay a penalty, which must be specified in the contract (well, on the other hand, if the initiator is an employee, he will also have to pay a penalty :)). <br><br><h2>  What is the labor market for IT specialists? </h2><br>  It seems to me that it is easier to find work here than in European countries.  Not because it is more, rather the opposite.  And due to several factors: <br><ul><li>  Each company must have on its staff one Arab per four foreigners <br>  What is more democratic than, for example, in Germany. </li><li>  Now IT is becoming more and more important here. </li></ul><br>  Opposite of my office are Sony, Intel, Cisco, Microsoft, HP and many smaller companies (like mine). <br>  Almost every day new branches are opened, companies ... But, there is one thing ... If you want a good salary (a good one is more than $ 3k), and in order for the company to rent an apartment for you here, you have to be a very good specialist. <br><br><h2>  What does it mean to "have to be a very good specialist"? </h2><br>  This means that if you made a website for Baba Lyuba with a attendance of 100 people per year, no one will take you.  Even will not be considered. <br><br>  Here a few things play a big role: <br><ul><li>  Recommendations of previous employers. <br>  If they are in Russian, translate, notarize. </li><li>  Experience in famous projects. <br>  Even if you just painted the icon, but for Yandex, feel free to write about it.  (Well, you don‚Äôt have to write like that, but something like: Developed a design for Yandex on a remote site).  If you also receive a letter of thanks from them, it will be perfect :) </li><li>  International certificates of "quality." <br>  Certificates from Zend, Microsoft, Cisco are very much appreciated here. </li></ul><h2>  What do you like to live there so much? </h2><br>  You know, yes.  Here I am not afraid to walk the streets (even late at night), here is a great service, here people are friendly (the brain actively suggests that cars are also cheaper, yeah).  Not to mention that here the "sea" is within walking distance. <br><br>  In general, if it were not for the minuses (about them below), then I would say that this is the perfect place to live. <br><br><h2>  What are the cons that do not like? </h2><br>  Well, the first thing that comes to mind is heat.  This afternoon, plus 40-45.  Last September, it reached +55.  With high humidity, it is difficult to be on the street for more than 2 minutes.  Of course, every small building has an air conditioner, but somehow it is also necessary to move. <br><br>  Next, it is of course Indians.  No, not as programmers, but as the vast majority with whom you have to communicate.  These are taxi drivers, and sellers, and security guards, and many more.  Arabs rarely undertake such work.  Basically, when they pay a lot for this (and then ... only for taxis, they don‚Äôt take up the rest of the work: below their dignity).  Their English is terrible.  Often you have to ask again.  To specify.  Even you may not understand. <br><br>  Well, and probably boredom.  Because, by and large, there is nothing to do here.  Except for a large number of shopping centers where you can spend money. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  Asked to add. <br>  On the Internet there is censorship (any porn there, yeah).  In particular, partially blocked access to Skype.  For a similar reason, they tried to ban the use of Blackberry phones. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> <br>  A lot of questions about the salary indicated by me at ~ $ 3. <br>  I have specified the minimum bar about which it makes sense to talk. <br>  Specialists who meet the criteria described above, get a lot more.  In general, the average salary of an IT specialist in the region is ~ $ 5-7.  And these are not tops. <br>  It turns out that I forgot to mention in the topic that the standard contract includes housing rental by the company that invited you. <br><br>  Something like that. <br>  Ask, I will answer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121179/</a></p>
