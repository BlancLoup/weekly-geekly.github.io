There are a lot of violators, since the population of the city is 12 million people, and, consequently, they negatively affect the quality of traffic in the metropolis.  Those who cross the road in the wrong place or at a red light, endanger their own and other people's lives. <br><br>  It is clear that at every crosswalk or other part of the road you will not put a policeman, so they decided to fight with the help of technology.  Namely - artificial intelligence and facial recognition.  The traffic violator, who was ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù, will receive an SMS with a warning.  In addition, the culprit will receive a fine, the amount of which is not yet known. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In China, there are no special problems with the use of personal data of citizens - at the request of the authorities, any Chinese service is obliged to provide any data of a specific user.  At the time of violation of the rules, a negligent citizen is transferred to a specialized system that is controlled by the police.  Then the person is compared with the base of photos in the largest social services of the country, including WeChat, Weibo and others.

      As soon as the user is defined, a <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/jaywalking-china-facial-recognition-surveillance-will-soon-fine-citizens-text-861401">message</a> is <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/jaywalking-china-facial-recognition-surveillance-will-soon-fine-citizens-text-861401">sent to</a> him - it can be a regular SMS or an instant messenger.  Crossing the road in the wrong place pedestrians - a headache for the police.  Many Chinese are crossing the road as a god to the soul put, not paying any attention to traffic on the road.  The reason for this is negligence, indiscretion or simply stupidity.  But all this leads to emergencies on the roads. <br><br>  The combination of technology and psychology, according to the police, should solve the problem of incorrect crossing of the road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f15/608/036/f156080362ee903dd8d56c651d8aecc3.jpg"><br><br>  Face recognition in conjunction with artificial intelligence has already been used by the Chinese to control traffic.  True, in relation to drivers - negligent car owners who violated the rules, identified and promptly punished with a fine. <br><br>  A decision has now been made to act on pedestrians.  By the way, in addition to fines and SMS, they are acted on in a different way - the faces of violators are shown on the big screen installed at a pedestrian crossing.  Of course, such screens are not everywhere, as they are quite expensive.  But in the most lively places they are still installed.  The authorities began to implement this project in 2017. <br><br>  Installation of cameras in Shenzhen is engaged in Intellifusion, which provides the system with a resolution of 7 million pixels.  The cameras track in real time the movement of crossings across the road, and then, as mentioned above, drive pictures of violators' faces through specialized bases. <br><br>  The project is already undergoing a pilot phase.  For 10 months of work, 13,930 violators were recorded, whose faces were shown on the big screen.  Moreover, they are also shown on a specialized website launched by the police several months ago.  The site contains the names of the offenders, and their IDs are partially shown so that people are not confused.  Well, a step with the warning of pedestrians with the help of SMS and personal messages was made in order to further increase the pressure on violators. <br><br>  The system detects not only one offenses.  "Road recidivists", that is, pedestrians who violated the rules several times, receive a reduction in the social rating (a corresponding article was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283208/">published</a> on Geektimes).  In short, the lower the social rating, the fewer opportunities available to the citizen.  The worst offenders can be banned from going abroad, as well as leaving the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresidence on any type of public transport. <br><br>  According to the police, even the demonstration of their faces on the screens near the road acts on the Chinese.  AI and face recognition are not perfect, besides, there are many tourists in Shenzhen, residents of other regions who have not yet entered the base and just random guests.  Therefore, the probability of the system triggering may be about 10%.  But the measures taken by the police help to fight with those pedestrians whose faces are not recognized by the system. <br><br>  In the near future, however, the databases of residents of different regions of China will be merged into one, so that the fight against offenders will become nationwide, going beyond the boundaries of the metropolis.  Over time, the police promise to hone face recognition technology and expand the database of photos of citizens. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371383/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371383/</a></p>
