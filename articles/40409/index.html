  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First site at a young age</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, my name is Anton.  I am 14 years old, I am fond of and love motorcycles.  I wanted to create my project and what came out of it, read on. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the middle of the summer I really wanted to create my website, because in the summer I did not go to the camp, I just sat at home.  There were no problems with the choice of topics, immediately decided that the site would be done about motorcycles.  Because  I know this subject more than any other.  I consulted with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/whitempak/" class="user_link">whitempak,</a> he approved my idea and I was even more firmly established with the desire to create a site about motorcycles. <br><br>  While reading Habrahabr, I came across a great <a href="http://www.explay.su/">explay</a> site management system.  Immediately realized this is what I need because  I am not yet able to do my cms to the extent of my illiteracy in this direction.  Without thinking, I downloaded the release.  I started testing on <i>localhost</i> , how to test, rather learn  not yet familiar with PHP programming.  At that time, it seemed ideal for the realization of <i>my desire</i> .

      The question arose which domain to register, so that it would be interesting and remembered by users.  There were many options, but chose two of them: motorisha (everyone probably remembers the cartoon) and motoyou.  I thought that <a href="http://motoyou.ru/">motoyou.ru is</a> more suitable because  The main idea was that users wrote about their motorcycles.  The next day I registered a domain.  Marked site. <br><br>  Wrote a description to make it clear to users about what the site. <br><br>  <i>Our Motoyou.ru network is created for motorcyclists and its goal will unite present and future motorcyclists.</i>  <i>Our network has a rating system - both articles, comments, and motorcyclists.</i>  <i>Each motorcyclist has the opportunity to publish his articles, leave comments, create clubs and meetings, all this gives a good exchange of experience for both beginners and experienced motorcyclists.</i>  <i>Beginner motorcyclists can always count on the help of experienced people.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br><img src="http://motoyou.ru/images/articles/1221631313_1.jpg"><br><br>  On the first day, June 1, he wrote several publications about motorcycles, notified his friends and they pulled up.  On the same day I sent an <i>insider</i> to <a href="http://roem.ru/2008/07/04/addednews6942/%3Fc">roem.ru</a> , there I received many positive and negative comments.  Many users have registered and wrote about their motorcycles.  At the request of users, draw a new design for the site instead of the standard template.  But after the level of visits I slept and it made even more time to be engaged in the site, to fill it with interesting publications, which I still do today.  Now the site has about 50 users and 150 publications.  Of course, you probably say with one voice - that in this such just screwed the engine and crammed articles, for me this is not so.  I can not describe that it is for me, but something larger than a set of letters. <br><br>  Most of all, I was encouraged to create, talk by Denis Kryuchkov and Igor Denisov on the topic <a href="http://blog.styleru.net/prodyusirovanie/98/">‚ÄúProducing a project on creating thematic social networks‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  <i>I myself am from the Moscow region of <a href="">Pushkino</a> .</i>  <i>I study at school number 2.</i>  <i>Thanks to everyone who was not too lazy to read, maybe I'm not writing well and I'm not interested in reading, but forgive me for that.</i>  <i>I have long decided to write here, but today I decided.</i>  <i>Sorry if that is not the case.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40409/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40409/</a></p>
