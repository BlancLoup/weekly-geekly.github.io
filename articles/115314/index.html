  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SQA Days Conference: how do (not) ordinary testers change the world?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In April of this year, the <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/content/339.htm">9th SQA Days Conference</a> will be held in Kazan.  As always, it will bring together leading minds, gurus and experts in the field of testing.  Its participants, as always, will be the most active representatives of the field of quality control.  On it, as always, everyone will get what they want: tons of information, centuries of consolidated experience, terababytes of motives. <br><br>  All of the above listed baubles and buns will not surprise anyone who has ever attended a competent conference.  However, at the same time, there are many truly amazing things in SQA Days: stability, pace of development, a wide geography of holding ... and people! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  SQA Days History </h4><br>  The first SQA Days were held in Moscow.  I knew nothing about the first, but I came to the second.  Autumn of 2007 - a little more than 3 years ago.  Small room, problems with sound, about 40 participants.  I remember that all this reminded the club of anonymous testers.  Everyone felt a little embarrassed, the only stream made me miss the first and last reports all day, as the others didn‚Äôt have much interest for me personally.  The lack of choice was depressing, multilevel speakers and a colorful audience from TMs to ‚Äúpotential testers‚Äù too.

      But even then it was clear: this is a breakthrough! <br><br>  Testers gathered together.  The word "tester" is not in Russian.  In universities do not teach our specialty.  The majority of Russian companies do not understand why we are needed.  The last normal Russian-language book on testing was published in 2001, (and its first version was written in 1988!) And we still got together, discussing bug tracking and automation!  And we all want to do our job better. <br><br>  The conference began to grow.  It took place in two capitals of Russia, in Belarus and Ukraine.  Instead of one stream, there are three parallel - the problem with boredom is gone, the problem of choice has arisen.  The number of speakers is also growing, and now the program committee chooses the best, not the only ones.  Michael Bolton, the generally recognized research testing guru, has already attended the conference as a speaker. <br><br>  And now - Kazan!  Why Kazan?  This choice also has its own unique story.  Kazan testers just really wanted a conference in their city.  They organized everything to the maximum, and the details of this choice, this decision <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoNXtOsVDRwE%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">can be viewed in a 15-minute video from Kazan TV</a> . <br><br><h4>  Why it happens? </h4><br>  Why is there no universally accepted conference in development?  There are web and dot conferences, computer games and Agile, ADD and Software People, but not universally accepted one?  Why did analysts have 2 conferences, and the ninth one is waiting for us? <br><br>  The simple answer is: "because we are in vests."  :) The answer is more complicated: because it is vital for us.  Education, literature - what is there!  We even in understanding basic terms often do not agree.  Compare the number of books on development, analytics and testing.  We need productive communication and exchange of experience.  That is only confirmed by a <a href="http://software-testing.ru/local-tester-groups">rather big list of regional communities of testers</a> . <br><br>  At the conference, you can hear the personal experience of the speakers, and it will not be blinkered books ‚Äúthat's right!‚Äù, But real life examples.  Often - contradictory, and therefore even more valuable! <br><br>  At the conference, you can "get infected" by testing.  A routine turns into a passion when it becomes clear how MUCH INTERESTING you can do it! <br><br>  At the conference you can ‚Äúreport back‚Äù yourself - and, in addition to the hackneyed ‚Äúauthority, pontovaya line in the resume and fifty business cards‚Äù, you can get something else, much more valuable: feedback from the audience, positive from the speech, pride in your experience and knowledge. <br><br>  I want to say a big thank you to Vlad Orlikov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vldcorp/" class="user_link">vldcorp</a> ), thanks to whom on SQA Days it is always so cozy and tasty.  I want to thank the Kazan guys, thanks to whom the nearest conference will be held in such a building :) I want to say a big thank you to the speakers who do not spare their time, knowledge, and decide to speak before a perfectionist-critical public :) <br><br>  It's great that we have a <a href="http://software-testing.ru/local-tester-groups">community</a> , <a href="http://software-testing.ru/forum/">forum</a> , and <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/content/339.htm">conference</a> .  Because together we are strong! <br><br>  And yes, we really are in vests!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115314/</a></p>
