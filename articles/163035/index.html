Thieves can be understood: the laptop is expensive, it‚Äôs easy to steal and then sell it.  However, this is not easier for owners of laptops because, until recently, there was no software and hardware that could seriously complicate the lives of criminals.  Now, through the efforts of Intel, such a system has appeared - it is called Intel Anti-Theft.  About it a lot was written in the news, the review was in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/137529/">our blog on Habr√©</a> , but practical reports about its use are almost absent.  We decided to fill this annoying gap, and when a new ultrabook from the Russian company Desten - <a href="http://desten.ru/production/ultrabook/easybook_x354/">X354</a> came into our hands, we not only tested it from all sides, but also launched Intel Anti-Theft on it.  Read the report on both stages of verification in this post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f34/951/0e9/f349510e9b74fba195e0d698531c7bf0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Desten EasyBook X354 </h5>  Desten EasyBook X354 - a representative of a new generation of ultrabooks, assembled on the basis of the third-generation Intel processor Ivy Bridge.  The model has very few configuration options, our sample specifications were as follows: <br><ul><li>  Processor - Intel Core i5-3317u 1.7 GHz; </li><li>  Chipset - Intel HM77; </li><li>  Display - 14 inches (1366x768 resolution); </li><li>  Memory - 4 GB DDR3 1333 MHz; </li><li>  Video - Intel HD 4000; </li><li>  Storage device - 120 GB SSD; </li><li>  The operating system is Windows 8 Home Edition. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f4c/681/31e/f4c68131e8b576aa805fa84d3c449c23.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the characteristics, X453 occupies a middle position in the line of ultrabooks.  A large volume SSD drive without an additional traditional HDD attracts attention, which is typical for top models.  The lack of HDD increases the battery life, but, of course, somewhat limits the amount of data transferred.  The ultrabook has a well-known and well-proven SSD Kingston SVP200S37A (passport read speed is up to 535 MB / s, write speed is up to 480 MB / s, maximum IOMeter performance with queue length = 32 is about 40000 IOPS).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0d/79b/cd5/f0d79bcd524717c8b8ffb4637428c6f4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/32c/f37/82b/32cf3782b8c58f088bceeb7b501629d8.png"><br><br>  As already mentioned, the "heart" of the ultrabook is the Intel i5 processor with a standard frequency of 1.7 GHz.  In fact, as with all modern laptops on the Intel platform, the SpeedStep technology works in full height on the X354, and the i8 multiplier (effective 800 MHz) is supported in the inactive state, while the peak load due to Turbo Boost is x24 (2.4 GHz).  The cooling system is quite ‚Äúresponsive‚Äù, the fan is audible even with a brief activity, although it still rarely goes to full capacity.  Noticeable heating of the case is not felt anywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04c/3ba/23f/04c3ba23fc75bc1a602dd7d464c2166f.png"><br><br>  According to the results of the PCMark 7 complex test (version 1.0.4), the X453 showed the result of 4314 parrots.  This is comparable to the estimates of the top models, for example, the Samsung 900X3C has 4553 points.  By the way, some tests of earlier PCMark 2005 under Windows 8 were categorically refused to work, so the comparison was not entirely complete - but what is there is enough to say: the X354 ultrabook tribe will not be confounded.  If you look at the results of the Windows system test, it turns out that least of all the OS appreciated the capabilities of the integrated graphics for applications and, in my opinion, in vain - they‚Äôll have enough of the built-in HD4000 for the eyes.  But what may not be enough is the memory, but the manufacturer assures that it can be expanded.  Well, let's check what Russian doesn‚Äôt like to unscrew the cover to see what‚Äôs inside?  Well, we see something like the following. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb0/22e/48e/fb022e48e8e1f5e8b89a4e84a369c582.jpg"><br><br>  We were not deceived - to get to memory and replace it is easy.  SSD is also easily accessible, so the upgrade space is extensive. <br><br>  Now about autonomy and mobility.  The manufacturer claims battery life - up to 7 hours.  According to the Mobile Mark 2007 test, work time is 6 h 44 min, this is a typical and normal figure for ultrabooks.  During testing, I used the X354 as a workstation, it confidently kept on the battery the whole working day with a certain amount of falling asleep while inactive.  Let me remind you that there is no HDD in this ultrabook, so there is no reason to fail at the mobility exam of the X354. <br><br>  Rounding out my small review, I want to note that in the face of X453 we see more than a good workhorse - this manufacturer specializes in this kind of living creatures.  With a recommended price of 22,000 rubles.  (without OS) it has almost no equal, analogs are almost one and a half times more expensive.  The cost of Windows and retail mark-ups reduce the space somewhat, but in any case, the Desten EasyBook X354 remains one of the most affordable ultrabooks with a single storage ‚Äî SSD (they would have said ‚Äúwith one spindle‚Äù before; now there are not any).  At the same time, the drawbacks of the model are not obvious: well, it will not surprise with the appearance - it is not required from the ‚Äúhorse‚Äù.  The bundle is rather weak, just charging and carrying a case - but exactly the same for many devices it is more expensive.  Most likely, apart from a little-known market for the brand, you will not find the minuses of the model.  Although, for someone, and it will be a plus - for those who do not have the desire to overpay for the label. <br><br><h5>  Intel Anti-Theft Technology </h5>  We now turn to the description of the functionality of Intel Anti-Theft.  To use the technology, you must first register to get access to your <a href="https://home.mcafee.com/">personal account</a> .  Trial free license works for 90 days and is valid for one computer.  The program can be downloaded directly from there.  Download, run the installer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c7/2b2/1e9/6c72b21e9495b2051496725b81da1939.jpg"><br><br>  Note that Intel has included Anti-Theft in the McAfee security product package.  So the interface of the product is now dual. <br>  During the installation, you will be prompted for a username and password from the personal account you created, and will also be asked to set a password to protect the ultrabook that will be entered for unlocking.  The password can then be changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/349/903/e0d/349903e0dfe6a9525848c35316005adc.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, the client window looks like this.  After synchronization with the cabinet, it will display the connection status and the time elapsed since the last synchronization.  The client does not have any settings, all management is carried out through the web-interface of the account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/70f/b13/642/70fb136428f08bc72acef12b542c4a50.jpg"><br><br>  Let's go now to your personal account.  If you tick, the program tries to track the location of the ultrabook and show it on the map.  Accuracy is not God knows what, it is still not GPS, but the city is correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a6/b14/37b/8a6b1437b73be45473915b684253ff0b.jpg"><br><br>  Settings menu.  In another, additional menu, you can temporarily disable the Anti-Theft lockout (if you do not plan to turn on the ultrabook in the near future and do not want the protection to work). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2ed/ccd/384/2edccd384aee0379e4dc351dd6261d53.jpg"><br><br>  As you can see, the system does not require any configuration, it works almost completely automatically.  Your task is to press the big red button in time.  Let's now "steal" the ultrabook - in vain we tried? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a02/1e2/91d/a021e291d6a24d823fcc2758489cee3d.jpg"><br><br>  The line with the message to the habrabra has been lost among others, but still it can be customized.  When you press the big red button, there are two options.  The first is that the laptop is locked and turned off as soon as it receives a signal (after a minute or two).  The second is that the device is not blocked, but it tracks its location and asks for the unlock password on the next reboot.  The second mode is clearly for tablets with GPS / 3G, they will be able to determine their location much more accurately. <br><br>  So, the theft of the ultrabook, or rather the opposition to it, was successful.  Now you know how it works. <br><br>  <b>We thank the company <a href="http://www.desten.ru/">Desten</a> for providing the ultrabook.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163035/</a></p>
