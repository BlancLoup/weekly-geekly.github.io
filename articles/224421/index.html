But this is what you most likely do not know: a <b>Russian scientist from Kemerovo, a physiologist Artem Galeyev</b> , is working <b>with this innovative Canadian company</b> , whose developments will be used in new MIO products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02f/f4f/e5a/02ff4fe5aac1157bb6781c7af7264c55.png"><br><br>  Since childhood, Artem was interested in biology, went to a circle of zoologists, in the ninetieth he entered the biological faculty of the Kemerovo State University and got into the laboratory of biochemistry.  There a new passion was added to the passion for biology - the love of programming.

      There was a computer in the laboratory, a sensor was connected to it that analyzed the hemolysis of red blood cells - the breakdown of blood cells.  Artem was fascinated by new opportunities, and he wrote a program that turned data from the sensor into meaningful information. <br><br>  In 1993, while studying at the university, Artem became interested in <b>studying heart rate variability as a way to analyze health</b> .  And only two years later, the first major scientific work on this topic came out, confirming the prospects of this area. <br><br>  Here, I'm sorry, can not do without a small educational program. <a name="habracut"></a>  Heart rate variability is the change in the interval between heartbeats of the heart.  The interval changes in response to the impact of any factors, both external and internal. <br><br>  Back in the sixties, scientists realized that by studying heart rate variability, one can get a lot of information about the human condition.  But then the computers were weak, and manually processing the information from the sensors was too difficult. <br><br>  Unlike body temperature, variability is individual.  If a person has a temperature of 38, it is obvious that he is sick.  But the same indicators of variability for different people can mean completely different things. <br><br>  In cardiology, variability analysis was used in the diagnosis of heart disease, and scientists thought about how to expand the scope of these data.  In the fourth and fifth courses, Artem studied heart rate variability in children, trying to understand how this affects their academic performance and physical condition. <br><br>  After university, he enrolled in graduate school, but research was relegated to the background - he began to engage in advertising, establishing his own agency with a full cycle of outdoor advertising services. <br><br><blockquote><h2>  The crisis of 1998 helped the development of Russian science: problems started in business.  And Artem just defended his thesis. </h2></blockquote><br>  He created software that made it possible to maximally efficiently calculate the data coming from the sensors, and make recommendations based on this data.  Initially, the <b>program was designed to assess the functional status of children of school age</b> .  The challenge was to provide optimal physical exercise and improve the overall condition of children. <br><br>  The scope of development could be much wider - for example, as a device for amateur athletes, which will make training more effective.  Over time, Artem collected a serious database that contained information not only on children, but also on adults. <br><br>  For two years, Artem tried to find an investor in Russia.  The project reached the final of the contest of the magazine ‚ÄúExpert‚Äù, but did not win a prize.  With investors, the situation was even worse.  Here is how Artem himself describes this period: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúNow the venture capital market is there.</i>  <i>Then it simply was not.</i>  <i>It was possible to talk for months, for years, and someone could even show interest, but since the market was damp, no one was willing to invest in startups, especially those related to iron.</i>  <i>Those with whom we negotiated were ready to invest in a ready-made business, which already has income, while somehow calling it venture investment, although venture investment offers a contribution at an early stage of the company's development.</i>  <i>Even now, almost all venture capitalists want the company to show some kind of income, but then it was just the rule. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  While Artyom was looking for money, he learned how to sell his software - they bought it mostly outside Russia.  Using the revenues, Artyom still engaged in iron, having developed a project of his own sensor, which could read data from the cardio-belt in real time, allowing you to plan your workouts properly.  This project has already won the competition "Start", Artem and his team received a grant, which invested in the organization of production.  But then it became clear that there are not so many athletes, the market is narrow, and to reach a mass audience, you need to be able to read data all the time, and not just during training sessions - then it would allow, for example, to analyze the level of stress. <br><br>  It was hard to set up production and build infrastructure for such a device.  The Russian market of fitness enthusiasts is not comparable with the world.  Therefore, Artem tried to go to Western venture capital funds.  He turned to the leader in the production of heart rate sensors - the company Polar.  But there he was not even answered. <br><br>  But in the MIO answered.  MIO is a company that since 1999 has been manufacturing devices that help train without unnecessary trouble.  <b>The company's founder, Liz Dickinson, set a goal to make a convenient heart rate monitor</b> , she didn‚Äôt want to run with a belt on her chest.  And she achieved the goal. <br><br>  Early models, however, required from time to time to put fingers on the device when they wanted to measure the pulse.  This made it unnecessary to wear an uncomfortable belt, but was far from ideal.  Over the years, the company managed to create an Alpha MIO watch without chest belts that worked in all conditions, at high speed and under water. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43c/4fc/716/43c4fc716a93c6f4cd1b942ff5f29c17.png"><br>  <i>Sports watches for a reason were developed in Vancouver.</i>  <i>Here one of the favorite types of recreation is hiking.</i>  <i>On photo 286, the Grouse grind trail 2.9 km long hiking trail.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ac/fc4/f6f/6acfc4f6f2b65465cfaaf13d426c3906.png"><br>  <i>Vancouver is a green city.</i>  <i>This is the Pacific spirit park just three kilometers from the office.</i> <br><br>  MIO has big plans: among them is the intention <b>to release a watch that would record heart rate variability</b> .  Therefore, the company and interested in the development of the Russian scientist from Kemerovo. <br><br>  MIO acquired the technology of Artem Galeyev and hired him as a physiology consultant.  The developments of the Russian scientist will be used in the companion application to the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/pulsometr-mio-alpha/">MIO Alpha watch</a> , which will give training tips based on heart rate variability.  So the heart rate monitor will turn from just a measuring device into a personal virtual trainer (which Artem helps to create). <br><br>  There is still a lot of work.  At the junction of mobile technology and medicine, you can create many interesting services that can really change people's lives.  One of the exotic, but also interesting directions is ‚Äú <b>digital yoga</b> ‚Äù.  In essence, this is the development of a system of exercises based on biofeedback and designed to reduce stress levels.  Word of Artem: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe patient measures the parameters of heart rate variability, which characterizes the state of his nervous system.</i>  <i>And they are rendered in real time to some kind of image on a computer or phone screen.</i>  <i>For example, in a flower.</i>  <i>The program analyzes the human condition and understands that its parameters are not optimal.</i>  <i>Then the closed flower is shown.</i>  <i>The inscription appears on the screen: "Relax and try to flower bloom."</i>  <i>A person looks at a flower and tries to find internal sensations that will lead him to such a state that the flower blooms.</i>  <i>If he doesn‚Äôt succeed, there are several ways to help him.</i>  <i>It has been scientifically proven that after ten such workouts, a person develops a stable stereotype of behavior, and if he begins to experience stress, then his body subconsciously uses this technique to relax or to correct his internal state.</i>  <i>I assume that in 2015 this system will already be on mobile platforms and maybe will be built into the clock. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Sounds cool, right? <br><br>  The company MIO, where Artem works as a consultant, is located in Vancouver, and he lives in Kemerovo.  Mostly, of course, he communicates with his colleagues via the Internet, but sometimes he goes (flies) to the office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/a76/3c5/bd9a763c582f71bf07bd288f265789e5.png"><br>  <i>Typical office atmosphere mio.</i> <br><br>  Artyom says that now he has almost perfect working conditions - there is money and free time to engage in innovative projects.  In parallel, he works in a scientific institute that studies cardiovascular diseases.  It also coordinates a number of projects developing other innovative things.  Madrobots team wishes him every success. <br><br>  At the end of the text are a few spirit-lifting words from Artyom: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúScience is an incredible thing.</i>  <i>When you open something really new, it is an indescribable feeling.</i>  <i>When you receive data first in the world, it is exciting.</i>  <i>This is a game, but it affects reality.</i>  <i>People with a certain mindset are carried away by it.</i>  <i>And the trajectory of my development allowed me to come to the place where I found myself, and it could not be otherwise. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224421/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224421/</a></p>
