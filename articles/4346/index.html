  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Danny Sullivan leaves Search Engine Watch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most famous experts in the field of search engine optimization Danny Sullivan leaves his famous site <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/">Search Engine Watch</a> , to which he gave ten years of life. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a <a href="http://daggle.com/060829-112950.html">farewell letter,</a> Danny explains that the reason for leaving was a conflict with the current owners of the site, <a href="http://www.incisivemedia.com/">Incisive Media</a> .  According to him, they could not agree on the terms of the new contract. <br><br>  In addition to the site <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/">Search Engine Watch</a> , Danny Sullivan, most likely, also leaves his organizational position on the <a href="http://www.searchenginestrategies.com/">Search Engine Strategies</a> conference series. <br><br>  To understand how one of the most famous experts in the world found itself in such a sad situation, it is necessary to follow the <a href="http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060417-130526">development of his career</a> from the very beginning.  Danny Sullivan since the 80s.  was interested in how search engines work.  In the early 90s, he spoke in specialized forums, and in 1996 he founded his own website dedicated to search engine optimization.  It was one of the first educational sites of this kind.  Thanks to the literate and interesting Sullivan articles on search engine optimization, the site rather quickly became popular among SEO specialists (then this science only took the first steps).  In 1997, Danny Sullivan <a href="http://www.jupitermedia.com/corporate/releases/97.11.19-search.html">sold his website to a</a> company that is now known as Jupitermedia.  The same company later founded the Search Engine Strategies conference series.

      It is not known how much Danny Sullivan got from the deal, but in 2006 his site was <a href="http://www.jupitermedia.com/corporate/releases/05.08.02-jupitermedia-ses.html">resold</a> to Incisive Media along with other media assets for $ 43 million, and the founder of the site wasn‚Äôt even allowed to negotiate and did not receive any dividends. <br><br>  Under the terms of the 1997 deal, Danny Sullivan remained an independent expert who, although he received a large salary, was an ordinary hired worker and worked under a contract.  After the sale of the Incisive Media business, the founder of the site tried to secure more favorable contract terms, but he did not succeed.  In addition, he felt extremely uncomfortable with the new owners, who could easily resell his site (and himself) to someone else.  I had to leave. <br><br>  Danny Sullivan, who was born in California in 1966, later moved to a small village in England, where he now lives with his wife and two sons.  According to him, he is absolutely satisfied with his financial position (he also has a consulting business).  Now Danny decides how to occupy the vacated time.  The fate of the legendary search engine optimization guru can be followed through his <a href="http://daggle.com/">personal blog</a> ( <a href="http://feeds.daggle.com/daggle">feed</a> ).  He will also continue to release <a href="http://dailysearchcast.com/">Daily SearchCast</a> daily podcasts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4346/</a></p>
