  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RFID Implants: Hello, Matrix!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Yes, RFID implants are no longer a sensation.  This is already there and soon enough will be available to almost everyone.  Another technological marvel along with computers, mobile communications, GPS and many other achievements of the human mind.  And, worst of all, perhaps this is the last "brick", which is lacking to create a full-fledged Matrix.  Holistic, stable and manageable. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  But let's start with the concepts.  What are RFID implants (for those who still do not know), and why are they so scary?  An RFID implant is an RFID chip (a small but smart chip), a small antenna and a ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù that allows the entire farm to be safely maintained in a biological organism (for example, in a person or some animal).  What does <i>RFID</i> stand for?  And it means that the microcircuit is so ‚Äúsmart‚Äù that it can ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù on the radio channel with its owner and some electronic devices (for this, the antenna mentioned above is needed).  The unpleasant feature of this device is that its real owner of this device is not at all the person into whom it was embedded, but an external control panel or, more precisely, the one who presses its buttons. <br><br>  <i>RFID</i> stands for <i><b>R</b> adio <b>F</b> requency <b>ID</b> entification</i> - radio frequency identification, because the original RFID chips were developed as a means for contactless identification of goods, cars, animals.  As <i>RFID</i> <i>tags</i> .  Actually, in this capacity they have been used for more than one year, and almost everyone has probably come across this.  Indeed, it is very convenient!  The bookseller simply puts the book on the panel on her desk, and the cash register already knows which book you want to buy.  And if she does not do this, then when she tries to take the book out of the store, an alarm will work.  When you enter the subway, you simply attach a contact card to the turnstile (you can not even pull it out of the bag), and the turnstile will record the fact of payment, and the card will remember that you have one less trip left.  The introduction of RFID chips saves us from the hustle and bustle of many unnecessary movements, because a sufficiently large number of purely technical actions, formalities occur very quickly, and, most importantly, automatically, implicitly.  That is, without our direct participation at all.

      <br>
      This is the catch.  The dialogue between the RFID chip and any external device is completely unnoticeable for us.  Moreover, the need to bring the ticket directly to the turnstile panel (even if not pulling it out of the bag) is only a deliberate convention, an artificial restriction.  Without difficulty, you could make it so that you passed through the turnstile, without making any special manipulations at all: the RFID chip could ‚Äúnegotiate‚Äù with the turnstile even at a distance of ten meters.  Just for public transport, the option of <i>contact</i> cards is more convenient.  And false positives are excluded, and does not provoke the paranoid fantasy.  But when using a special technique, the RFID chip and its owner can carry on a dialogue even hundreds of meters away.  Well, unilaterally, without receiving a ‚Äúresponse‚Äù to thousands of RFID chips, any command can be sent even from a satellite.  And these actions without the use of special measures (which are not always available to everyone), no one can fix, control or stop. <br><br>  This is the tragedy and pathology of technical progress.  The more complex the technologies and mechanisms that we create, the more difficult it is to manage them, the more difficult it is to find a common language with them, the harder it is to control them.  If a mechanical clock can still be called a relatively uncomplicated device, even a non-expert can understand if you wish (with a very big desire!), Then the microcircuit is already a microcosm that is no longer directly accessible to us.  Black box.  We cannot look inside it and see what is happening in it.  To some extent this is possible only for a specialist, in the laboratory, using special equipment.  We can only interact with her outside and try to understand the logic of her work, but what <b>really</b> happens inside her, what she <b>actually</b> does, only her creator knows.  But even he may not understand the essence of some phenomena.  Of course, we can not be afraid of the uprising of microcircuits, but our electronics leads our ‚Äúsecret life‚Äù now. <br><br>  And now, perhaps, it is worth for a moment to get distracted and voice a few questions: for many, they probably are already spinning in the language.  Because of what, in fact, fuss?  What is the Matrix?  With a capital letter ... In our time!  Well, yes, everyone knows the movie.  Watched.  Super-intelligent robots, colossal plantations of human biomass, virtual reality of a planetary scale ... But is it not nonsense?  Is it paranoia?  In the movies, and something like that happens!  And anyway, what have the RFID chips? <br><br>  A fairy tale is a lie, as they say, yes there is a hint in it ... This should not be forgotten, because a lot of what science fiction writers write comes true one day.  What we see today in science fiction films, our children or grandchildren may well see it awake.  And in order to make only good and bright fairy tales come true, terrible ones need to be well known and from time to time be compared with the reality around us: do we not accidentally notice some similarities?  Is it time to look at old tales in a new way?  Until they gained flesh and power.  Or maybe it's time to sound the alarm? <br><br>  But back directly to the topic.  What is so terrible in this context RFID-chips / tags / implants, and how they are associated with the rampant fantasies of writers and directors?  In order to make it easier to answer this question, clarify the concepts and a little imagination ourselves. <br><br>  Since the word "The Matrix" from the "character" of a science fiction film imperceptibly grew into a term, in the beginning it is necessary to determine exactly what we associate with this term.  Initially, in the film, the program supporting the virtual world was so called, but along the plot, the meaning of the name imperceptibly expands, and soon it embraces the virtual world itself.  For us, this approach would be quite convenient.  In the general case, we can define the <i>virtual world</i> as an aggregate of people, that is, the inhabitants of this world, the rules in accordance with which it exists, and its ‚Äúwrong side‚Äù - the technical support and organizational measures necessary to maintain it.  And the <i>Matrix</i> is one of the variants of the virtual world, its highest form. <br><br>  If we compare the above with what surrounds us, it seems that to create a virtual world already today, nothing supernatural is required.  It is enough to gather in a certain place a group of people, to lucidly explain the ‚Äúrules of the game‚Äù to them and give them to ourselves, in the future only by monitoring the observance of the rules, so that they do not scatter.  Does this remind us of anything from our world?  Immediately come to mind such "institutions" as military service, prison and sect.  In the first two cases, this is really just a similarity: people who are in these ‚Äúrealities‚Äù clearly understand their boundaries and their place in the outside world.  That is, they clearly share the real reality and the artificially created.  The latter option is much more perfect: in sects, due to the hard targeted influence on the consciousness and subconsciousness, virtual reality with its own world order and laws often replaces the real one.  And if the virtual world is able to completely replace the real, it can rightfully be called the <i>Matrix</i> . <br><br>  Thus, it turns out that almost everything is ready for creating the Matrices.  Almost ... There are people, there are many ways to organize them and transmit new ideas to them.  There are plenty of ideas and even models of virtual worlds: the variety of religious patterns, science fiction novels, as well as computer games will satisfy any Architect.  You don‚Äôt even need to invent anything: take whatever you like, merge into a pile.  The tale can endure.  And you can do even easier.  After all, which virtual world is the most stable?  Either the easiest, or the closest to the real.  And the truth is most similar to the truth, even if it is corrected in the right places.  And the best virtual world, respectively, is a slightly adjusted real one.  You just need to convey to everyone a new world view and make them believe in its reality.  There is not enough of a small connecting element that will revive the illusions and relieve unnecessary doubts.  It is only necessary to skillfully and subtly affect the minds of people.  Carefully, imperceptibly, but quickly and in large numbers.  In other words, you need a small Trojan horse that everyone wants. <br><br>  This is a rather unpleasant and scary conclusion, but RFID implants are one of the most suitable technologies for this purpose.  Are in the person, imperceptible, are operated remotely.  All that is missing is to teach RFID chips to influence the psyche of people purposefully, and implant these chips to them.  The first is probably the most difficult.  With good luck, it can take from 5 to 20 years.  And maybe even less: special services and secret laboratories rarely shout about their achievements.  The second is easier.  Strengthening controls and security measures associated with the intensification of terrorism / extremism / banditry;  introduction of new opportunities for mobile communications and cashless payments;  protection from the next (specially prepared) fatal disease (who would refuse the saving pacemaker, when some ‚Äúresonant atypical arrhythmia‚Äù mows people around the world?) ... Properly organized PR campaign ... The main thing is to spice up everything with a rather tasty sauce, and people themselves will be asked to implant a RFID implant.  Moreover, they will be willing to pay a lot of money for it. <br><br>  The first generation of RFID implants will be ordinary, without secrets.  People need to get used to them, get comfortable.  Understanding that living together with an RFID implant is not just safe and convenient, but simply vital.  That RFID implants give them new, completely unprecedented opportunities and even privileges;  they are constantly being improved, and in order to keep up with life, it is necessary to update their ‚Äúlittle friend‚Äù from time to time.  That RFID implants are needed both for adults and children, and those who do not have them and oppose them are inadequate and dangerous because they oppose themselves to society.  What you need to fight them.  At this stage, the soil will be prepared.  And then, one day, during the next update of the model range, people will receive RFID implants with a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù, with a hidden undocumented function, the presence of which even experts will not know.  And a little later, when the vast majority of people will be ‚Äúequipped‚Äù with RFID implants, some of the satellites, in clusters hanging in near-earth orbit, will receive a conditional radio signal that all RFID chips will ‚Äúhear‚Äù.  And their secret function "come to life".  And, waking up in the morning, people will open their eyes and see that their familiar world has become incredibly beautiful.  And a soft pleasant voice will say to them: ‚ÄúGood morning!  Matrix welcomes you! ‚Äù  And happiness will illuminate their faces.  And people will become robots. <br><br>  After all that has been said, the impression may be that the whole thing is exclusively in RFID implants, that they are a world evil.  Of course not!  That would be too easy.  They are just one of many gears.  Rather, they are ready to become it.  But there are others.  Think, for example, about mobile networks.  More precisely about the towers.  And about the coverage area.  And remember the "Inhabited Island".  If not a book, then at least a movie.  There are some similarities, right?  After all, who can prevent their owners in the course of introducing new equipment to provide new generation mobile communication (3G-4G-5G) instead of the usual transmitter to put "unusual" - able to emit besides the standard frequency range also at the frequency that, for example, suppresses aggression and will?  Moreover, neither mobile operators, nor equipment manufacturers will know anything about this function: the manufacturer assembles transmitters from ready-made cubes (specialized boards or even finished devices) and will not find a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù if it does not purposefully search for it.  Operators of the subtlety of the work of "iron" are generally of little concern: from their point of view, the towers themselves are also "cubes", which should stand in their places and just work well.  But the one who developed one of the specialized boards, hidden in the bowels of the radio transmitter, knows that if she is told the ‚Äúmagic word‚Äù in a certain way, one of the microcircuits will ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and the transmitter will work completely differently: the signal from the satellite ‚Äî and the population all more or less large settlements of the country or even many countries in a matter of seconds turns into a dull obedient herd.  After that everything is possible.  For example, to order people in the shortest possible time to appear in the "points of modernization", urgently deployed everywhere, and implant them all the same RFID tags.  Even the simplest.  To facilitate remote identification and location control.  To the sheep did not run away.  What's next is not important.  This is where the story ends.  And the fact that such a scenario is quite possible is a fact.  For this, too, almost everything is ready. <br><br>  According to various information that soars in the air, it can be judged that studies of the influence on the human psyche of various radiations, sounds, odors and other factors are being conducted since ancient times, and are continuing quite successfully today.  Many of the achievements of our distant ancestors were lost, but left their mark on history.  And the mysteries of the past spur the enthusiasm of modern researchers like distant lighthouses.  Lighthouses calling in the Matrix.  So - in the abyss. <br><br>  Paranoia?  Not.  Warning.  For who is warned, he is armed.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãmultivariate.  Even if the black cat, which we allowed in the black room, is not a cat at all, it makes little difference.  From the totality of signs, it can be concluded that we may soon begin to eat.  And I would like to avoid this.  We only have scattered facts.  But if you put them together (and here, after all, only a small part of them is shown) and to make logical connections, the picture is frightening.  You can, of course, dismiss all of this, tell yourself that all this is nonsense, paranoia and bullshit.  That this can not be, because this can never be.  Can.  Today.  But tomorrow it may turn out that this problem no longer interests anyone.  Because a terrible tale has become an inevitable reality. <br><br>  So what to do?  The eternal Russian question ... Let us have another Trojan horse into our lives (as we have already let in TVs, computers, mobile phones and the Internet) or not to let them in?  After all, modern Trojan horses are much more dangerous than the Greek in that their impact is usually hidden, uncontrollable and unpredictable.  But at the same time, it is extremely difficult to refuse them, because they are very useful: they help us accumulate, process and transmit unthinkable amounts of information, communicate freely and fantastically enrich our leisure time.  So how should we be?  Probably, the question should be put differently: do we have a choice?  Most likely no.  It is pointless to fight with new technologies, because all useful things have a downside: the RFID chip, the knife, and the match.  Any thing can be used for good and for evil.  And progress is swift and implacable.  And the one who does not try to keep up with the time, very soon falls out of society, from his time and becomes an outcast.  All that remains for us is to fight for the openness and controllability of potentially dangerous technologies and to defend our independence from devices and technologies that can subordinate us to ourselves and our owners.  If it does not save humanity from the Matrix, then at least it will delay its creation for some time.  Or it will allow to make participation in it purely voluntary, if its coming is inevitable. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87650/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87650/</a></p>
