  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simon Sink How to talk so as to encourage action (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  The previous part is thesis: <br>  1. Successful inspiration begins with enthusiasts. <br>  2. We wake up every day to inspire people and make the world better together. <br>  3. The best use of their abilities in helping others. <br>  4. Speech is like a trip.  Driving a car without any direction, is like speaking without a plan and idea.  Pre-planned route is always easier. <br>  5. Try acting classes and be careful about what you don't know. </blockquote>  And this is actually the rest of the translation of Simon Shink's brochure, <i><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hv9y7vkvys1oftm/Speak%2520to%2520Inspire%2520Action%2520V2.pdf%3Fdl%3D0" title="Original">Speak to Inspire Action</a> ‚Äî tips that will help you speak and point out a path that will inspire others to join your work.</i> <br><br><h4>  6. Do not rush to speak </h4><br>  Speaking too quickly is easy, talking too slowly is almost impossible.  What do you feel when listening to an experienced announcer?  It is likely that what he will say will seem reliable.  This is because the announcer is confident in himself and is not trying to prove something, simply communicating what he knows. <br><br>  An experienced speaker, often speaks slowly and thoughtfully.  A slow narration does not mean less interest in the question, but in fact guarantees the listeners to assimilate what you are talking about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the best ways to master such a manner of presentation is sound recording.  Surely anyone who has ever heard himself on the recording was surprised at the sound of his voice.  Listening to the recording, note the following: <br><ul><li>  Pace - will it be able to catch everything you say for the first time a person listening to you? </li><li>  Expressiveness - the best way to highlight meaningful thoughts is intonation attached to them. </li><li>  Pauses - are pauses sufficient to emit powerful utterances and ideas to assimilate their meaning? </li><li>  Volume - Does the volume of the voice increase or decrease when the pace of speech slows down? </li></ul><br><h4>  7. Speak at once with only one person. </h4><br>  Most people do not know that Simon is an introvert who does not tolerate crowds.  So, how does he manage to speak so calmly in front of an audience of hundreds or even thousands of people?

      The secret is that at the same time he speaks with only one person.  Instead of panning the entire hall, he establishes eye contact with one person and utters the whole thesis for this person.  Then, he chooses another pair of eyes, and repeats the same technique with the following thesis.  In fact, the entire presentation consists of several one-on-one conversations.  Such an approach requires practice. <br><br>  During your talk, you may find that some members of your audience are <i>‚Äúcaptives‚Äù</i> .  They all take hostility and are present in the audience against their will.  Do not focus your attention on them or trying to convince them.  You will feel much calmer and more comfortable when talking to interested people.  Allow their energy industry to fuel your presentation, in turn, to increase inspiration for the audience as a whole. <br><blockquote>  Any audience consists of three types of people: <br>  1. <i>Prisoner.</i>  He does not feel the slightest desire to be present in the hall, he perceives everything with hostility. <br>  2. <i>Tourist.</i>  Here, by chance, he may perceive some ideas and theses, but he is easily distracted. <br>  3. <i>Partner.</i>  Sincerely interested in what is happening.  Differs in the presence of a laptop or other recording device. <br></blockquote><br><h4>  8. Be human </h4><br>  You are the same person on stage as you are outside.  One that genuinely speaks and acts regardless of where it is.  Instead of worrying about who thinks about you, be yourself.  As long as you are sincere, the audience will not change you, and will be located to you even in case of errors.  Otherwise, appearing as a different person will incur the distrust and intolerance of the audience.  The best result is achieved by those who control their emotions. <br><br><h4>  9. If you lose your mind, calm down. </h4><br>  Some speakers, including Simon, rarely use notes.  Many of them know that, despite the freedom to speak, the lack of notes from time to time can lead to the loss of the thread of the story.  Losing thoughts on stage can be a scary event, but it is not fatal.  Recall that the audience knows about the subject of the speech only what you told them through verbal and non-verbal channels.  The audience will know that you have lost the thought only if you tell her yourself about it. <br><br><h4>  Tips </h4><br>  A. <i>If you have lost the thought, do not fuss.</i>  At such a moment, try to avoid interjections and lowing.  A short pause will not hurt the performance. <br><br>  B. <i>Take a sip of water.</i>  Before the show, make sure that water is available on the stage.  A short pause for a sip of water is quite acceptable, and may give additional time to bring the performance in order. <br><br>  B. <i>If nothing comes out.</i>  Hold the glass in your hands and pause, follow the advice number 8.  Do not forget - <i>"You are just a man, just a man!"</i> <br><br><h4>  10. Enjoy </h4><br>  When you have fun, you can inspire more people.  Be grateful for the opportunity to share your ideas and enjoy it.  For some, easier said than done.  Often, we allow negative emotions to prevail over positive ones. <br><br>  The symptoms of nervousness are similar to the symptoms of simple excitement.  But the interpretation of signals remains with us, and this is a matter of choice.  If there are symptoms, interpret them to your advantage in order to gain in them an additional source of inspiration and courage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/5bb/1fd/bde5bb1fdced46588c86946c48d1d40b.jpg" alt="Stark3" align="left"><h4>  11. Applaud </h4><br>  Applause you will receive after the presentation as a gift.  Accept them with gratitude!  Often, the speakers reject applause, trying to calm the public or just leave. <br><br><h4>  Applause carries several important functions: </h4><br><ul><li>  Measure the impact of your performance.  Applause will tell about the results of the report, and this is very valuable information! </li><li>  Thus, the audience expresses appreciation.  Refusal of applause is tantamount to refusing a gift. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>Ideas alone do not change the world for the better.</i>  <i>This makes inspirational ideas for action.</i>  <i>By sharing such ideas, we can build a better world.</i>  <i>And sincerely wish us success in this!</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/16240/">The first part</a> . </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291358/</a></p>
