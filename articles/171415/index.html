The conversation will be about a <b>compact</b> and <b>powerful</b> enough computer assembled by hand as much as in October 2011.  Initially, a little about the reasons for this and the history of creation. <br><br>  <em>Carefully, there are a lot of pictures in the article.</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e0/d3f/dda/6e0d3fddaac5037a7f4c13f1bf677534.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  I needed a compact and powerful machine for the following reason.  I am closely connected with work in three-dimensional space and visualization.  Well, as a kind of hobby - I love an hour or two to play a good shooter.  The requirements for the car with such components are clear.  The need for mobility of the machine is dictated by the following: it is often necessary to work at home, and a computer for people like me is always more than a box in the office.  Because of this, for a long time I bought "top" laptops - the so-called.  Workstations, for the price they pulled for 80 tr.  I had two of them: the first is still working successfully, delighting with a good screen, the second was under repair twice, but still ‚Äúdied‚Äù.  But when a friend tried a stationary computer with a really powerful iron, it came to understand that not a single laptop could be compared with it - a workstation, and there is still a high for working at a hospital, large monitors, full-fledged keyboard and freedom on the table.

      As a consequence of this understanding, I decided ‚Äúto climb on the Christmas tree and eat the fish,‚Äù to assemble the most powerful and most compact computer.  With the help of a three-dimensional program, sorting through many different elements of the layout, I designed the optimal computer for me. <br><br><h5>  Specification of computer components (prices for October 2011): </h5><br><ul><li>  Motherboard (Gigabyte GA-H67N-USB3-B3) - 3562 r. </li><li>  The processor (Intel Core i7-2600K, 3.40GHz, 8MB, LGA1155, OEM) - 9437 p. </li><li>  CPU cooler (Thermalright AXP-140 (RT)) - 2090 p. </li><li>  Random access memory (DDR3 8Gb (2x4Gb) PC3-12800 1600MHz Kingston Hyper X Genesis DIMM, BOX) - 2260 p. </li><li>  Video card (AMD Radeon HD 6970 2048Mb MSI, PCI-E, DVIx2, HDMI, miniDPx2, Retail) - 10180 p. </li><li>  Hard disk (2.5 "120 GB SATA Solid State Disk (SSD) Intel 510 MLC) - 8730 r. </li><li>  Power supply unit (ATX 600W Cooler Master GX Lite RS600-ASABL3 (purchased later)) - 2300 r. </li><li>  Wifi usb adapter (TP-LINK WN722NC, 150Mbps 802.11n) - 430 p. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Total accessories</strong> - 38989 p. <br><br><h5>  Additionally: </h5><br><ul><li>  Case (Silver Stone Sugo SG07), had to sell - 6887 p. </li><li>  The hard drive (2.5 '' 320Gb Seagate Momentus, SATA 3Gb / s, 5400 rpm), was already - 1440 p. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42c/e63/0bd/42ce630bd4466cf4ead7e3130f33a74a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3cb/bff/999/3cbbff999d7b80ae7a21159488c83260.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/558/aaa/bd4/558aaabd47e4c5d92d3b8b3305f65122.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/937/30a/898/93730a89836b9ef2f3dc1ec0a0e27ebb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Assembly </h4><br>  The question rested in the manufacture of the case.  Needed a completely individual.  Firms laser cutting and bending of metal, seeing the drawings issued such a price tag that Apple and Dell just relax.  I became sad and went along the simplest way - I assembled everything in the most compact package, which generally existed and still, as I understand it, exists for machines of similar capacity - <strong>SilverStone Sugo SG07</strong> . <br><br>  In general, the assembly in this case was completed quickly and successfully.  But the ‚Äúworm‚Äù was gnawing: this body, in my opinion, was not designed rationally, both from the point of view of the layout of computer ‚Äúgiblets‚Äù and from the point of view of the need for some components specifically for me.  Alas - product costs for the mass consumer.  In short - I decided to make the case myself.  Hands seem to grow from where it is necessary, and in school I didn‚Äôt pick my nose at work.  It didn‚Äôt change me right away, I wanted to cut metal first, etc.  Then it came - you can buy aluminum corners, and collect them on screws, cutting threads with a tap.  Aluminum metal is soft, there should be no problems.  Urgently, the computer project was adapted to the changed conditions. <br><br>  <sub>The largest box in the pictures is the size of the Sugo SG07.</sub> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/576/a6f/e83/576a6fe83d084f58144b4a471fe91301.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d7/860/60f/6d786060fe2fe1eafe505776e332f11c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd1/d0c/ef7/bd1d0cef7a9af950a2fa88b883cc0769.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/264/07e/4c2/26407e4c29917b5f900166806a874fe1.jpg"><br><br>  Not cheap body Sugo SG07 with a very good power supply, I had to put up for sale.  Until now, by the way, no one bought - even a pity. <br><br>  A new power supply unit, Cooler Master of the GX Lite series, was purchased, with a ‚Äústrong‚Äù + 12V line, opened and ‚Äúslightly‚Äù optimized.  Namely: extra wires were removed - Molex, appendix FDD.  One branch of SATA is muted and reserved in case there is something else to connect in case of need.  And of course, all other branches are shortened to the required length.  Cut and solder each wire.  Ideal option is to remove from the connectors and re-compress each wiring (connectors 24 pin, 4 pin "mother" and 6 + 2 pin "video").  It is very easy to remove them, but it is impossible to compress without the appropriate equipment and new "pins".  I repent - I did not find a thin shrink, so the welded ends of the wires wrapped with tape.  With SATA wires, everything is simple - their connectors with knives are opened and reinstalled where necessary.  It is clear - with such manipulations, we had to forget about the guarantee of the unit (as much as 3 years!).  Therefore, the unit chose initially quite reliable. <br><br>  What else?  The store bought an aluminum profile (a corner of 15x15x2 and a strip of 15x2 with a length of 2m, both), a bunch of cogs and two taps (The price for everything is ‚Äúthree kopecks‚Äù).  Next - build.  Everything went like clockwork.  Thanks to the 3D-model, all the details are guaranteed to come together.  I had to slightly upgrade the video card as well: I arranged the additional power for the wires soldered to the board - standard connectors would stick out too much above the case.  As a new plug used a conventional terminal block.  Plus - completely removed the metal landing bracket video card (where the connectors connect monitors). <br><br>  By tradition - I apologize for the pictures of the ‚Äúassembly stage‚Äù.  First, I did it not for the article, but for myself - so as not to forget where that.  Secondly, did them by phone.  Then, of course, "pulled" in the editor, but all the same - "like".  But it is good that even these remained. <br><br>  <i>Pictures of the assembly stage</i> <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> , <a href="">3</a> , <a href="">4</a> , <a href="">5</a> , <a href="">6</a> , <a href="">7</a> , <a href="">8</a> , <a href="">9</a> , <a href="">10</a> , <a href="">11</a> , <a href="">12</a> , <a href="">13</a> , <a href="">14</a> , <a href="">15</a> <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  That's what happened.  The dimensions of this unit are 290x210x130 (h) mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d47/e78/2dd/d47e782dd0c9fb06ec21d265c8ea434c.jpg"><br><br>  In theory, on the top of the computer you need to do, order in the same laser cutting, a decorative grid.  And there is a drawing, but there‚Äôs no way to find time.  From the bottom and the side to do exactly nothing.  Behind, on the BP fan, screwed the usual ‚Äúgrill‚Äù.  As time has shown, and the computer has been in operation for over a year, even the upper grille is needed more for beauty (no one sticks into the cooler and the power supply), but this will complete the computer as a product, give it a finished look and some chic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60a/45b/f05/60a45bf05bc033204df69639bc1efdf6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f5/d7b/7e6/9f5d7b7e6234e94c1d8d8ad3f8fcf082.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d64/70e/273/d6470e2731aa6543d0e4cfd2dcb0e703.jpg"><br><br>  What we have in the bottom line.  Very compact computer with parameters that a year later, it is quite a nothing.  Especially for this unit was bought a small bag.  A couple of cords and any small things like flash drives, etc. fit there.  For ease of use - it is more convenient to carry than a bag with a laptop, in terms of weight - almost the same, 100 grams back and forth does not matter. <br><br>  Two monitors at work and one at home, two sets of clavs and mice, at home wired.  Of course, there is no built-in sound here, but it is built-in to me and is not needed.  At work - a monitor with speakers (via HDMI).  At home - high-quality headphones with a headset, and when I watch movies, I connect the TV panel and speakers (5.1 sound). <br><br>  In general, the unit is very satisfied, the decision was made unambiguously correct, not to compare with the laptop.  Well, at the price of the issue - you can see for yourself, even taking into account the cost of the additional monitor, keyboard and mouse, it turned out very ‚Äútasty‚Äù.  At the same time - uncompromising power and real mobility.  In principle, in this case even a computer upgrade is possible, although it is hardly needed.  Technologies are developing so fast that soon we will connect smartphones to monitors and work on them. <br><br>  I still wonder why such things are not made by body manufacturers.  Their possibility, what a "candy" could be made!  And buyers for sure would be. <br><br>  Well, in the end, a couple more details about the equipment when assembling a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, if anyone is interested.  For a long time I was looking for the power and reset buttons.  I did not find the finished ones, I even wanted to buy the old building.  The case helped.  In the "zagashnik" were wiring old with nozzles on pins - just what you need.  I bought the power-on button myself at the store, it was for a car, with a pipe painted - a file blew off a pipe.  To reboot, I soldered the touch button from the old mouse, I made a short stub - a centimeter and a half from the plug to the button.  Thank God, do not have to restart.  The power LED also came in handy, as without a decent computer?  In general - attention to detail, accuracy, everything on the styzhechki, etc. <br><br>  <i>Additional pictures:</i> <a href="">1</a> , <a href="">2</a> , <a href="">3</a> , <a href="">4</a> , <a href="">5</a> , <a href="">6</a> , <a href="">7</a> , <a href="">8</a> , <a href="">9</a> , <a href="">10</a> , <a href="">11</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c8/5a4/267/6c85a4267a40ab0b88990aed9358e4ef.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171415/</a></p>
