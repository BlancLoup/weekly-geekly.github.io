Such a gadget is very convenient in everyday use for those who like to take interesting moments and post on blogs and in various other places.  Now all the leading electronics manufacturers are trying to release such a device.  <a href="http://chinalab.ru/">And I really love everything Chinese!</a>  My camcorder is naturally Chinese.  Immediately, I note that it is quite competitive! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d6/a15/682/2d6a15682c85f41b79d2703ec02d648e.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Product manufactured by <a href="http://www.chintaho.com.tw/">Chintaho Technology Co.</a>  <a href="http://www.chintaho.com.tw/">Ltd</a> , this factory is a major OEM manufacturer for different brands.

Our camcorder is sold under various Chinese brands.  Initially purchased for use in a car as a DVR (what is a "car DVR" and what does it need <a href="http://chinalab.ru/blog/5.html">to read here</a> ).  But on certain points did not fit, about this - later.  So, the camcorder comes in this form. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ub28YEKT7Ec%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQ8nGbpnQmvNmIyo9DQpxTUBePFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Completeness <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cc/2d8/048/3cc2d80481d23c82fadcc40c39dc682c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It happens in two colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e27/703/f6b/e27703f6bae246879ae52a9524e50aad.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dde/3c6/a42/dde3c6a42a16e5fe8beac9835b7002af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The build quality of the gadget is excellent, nothing dangles at all, the battery cover closes with a click, there is no backlash!  The lens deviates by 30 ¬∞.  There is a bright LED backlight (LEDs 4 pieces).  All connectors are closed with a rubber stopper that fits tightly in place.  There is a macro / infinity switch, switches with a click.  The memory card is inserted from the bottom, sunk quite deeply, sometimes it requires some object, such as a toothpick, well, or who has long nails, they can cope without it.  The camera uses a battery, such as NOKIA BL-5C, with the search for which, in the event of a breakdown, there is no need to strain.  The purpose of the controls is clear from the instructions (you can download it <a href="http://www.rapidshare.ru/1432033">HERE</a> ).  There is a standard threaded hole for mounting on a tripod.  There is a small RESET button, never used.  When charging and shooting is not very hot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/194/bfb/f37/194bfbf37377c40e96baf3f31ee6a567.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To start recording, just press the POWER button, the gadget makes a sound: ‚ÄúTry-try‚Äù and after 3 seconds the camera is ready to record, press the convenient, round REC button, to the left of the joystick.  To stop recording, press this button again.  Menu items are available in English and Chinese. <br><br>  Menu in "RECORD" mode <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/391/cf7/367/391cf73670775c52d44c9edba36ba544.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee6/b42/de0/ee6b42de0de9f1fa410a728ae7a6bad4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SIZE - shooting modes: 1920x1080, 1440x1080, 1280x720, 848x480. <br>  EV - exposure: from -2 to +2. <br>  WHITE B - white balance: AUTO, FLUORESCENT, TUNGSTEN, CLOUDY, SUNNY. <br>  CONTRAST - contrast: STANDART, SOFT, HARD. <br>  SHARPNESS - sharpness: STANDART, SOFT, HARD. <br>  EFFECT - effects: OFF, VIVID, MONOCHROME, NEGATIVE, SEPIA, ART. <br>  DURATION - time limit for recording: NO, 45 minutes, 30 minutes, 15 minutes.  After this time, the recording stops. <br>  RECYCLE - ‚Äúdimensions‚Äù of the segment of the recording file: NO, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.  An interesting mode that allows you to use the camcorder in DVR mode, writes in blocks, when space on the memory card runs out, overwrites the old blocks and writes new ones in their place.  Pause in video recording between blocks for 2-3 seconds, i.e.  This time, falls out of the record.  This sin all DVRs. <br><br>  Menu in the "PHOTO" mode <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1b/d9e/601/a1bd9e60192cecc7852624527087b941.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37c/d83/813/37cd838132832294129bef7e6793cedf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SIZE - photo size: 8M, 5M. <br>  EV - exposure: from -2 to +2. <br>  QUALITY - NORMAL, GOOD, FINE. <br>  WHITE B - white balance: AUTO, FLUORESCENT, TUNGSTEN, CLOUDY, SUNNY. <br>  CONTRAST - contrast: STANDART, SOFT, HARD. <br>  SHARPNESS - sharpness: STANDART, SOFT, HARD. <br>  EFFECT - effects: OFF, VIVID, MONOCHROME, NEGATIVE, SEPIA, ART. <br>  SELFTIMER - self-timer: YES (10 seconds), NO. <br>  BURST - continuous shooting: 5 pics, 3 pics, NO. <br><br>  Menu in the "System Settings" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/038/92e/4d9/03892e4d99ef94303e5584c60eee974e.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c12/1f8/c7d/c121f8c7d3d7a569b6556fef06942b89.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  VOLUME - sound volume: from 1 to 8. <br>  LANGUAGE - language: 3 kinds of Chinese, English. <br>  DATE is the date. <br>  CLOCK - time. <br>  FORMAT - formatting a memory card. <br>  SYS.RESET - reset to factory settings. <br>  AUTO OFF - auto power off: OFF, 5 minutes, 3 minutes, 1 minute. <br>  LIGHT FREQ - mains frequency: 50Hz, 60Hz. <br>  STAMP - date stamp on pictures: ON, OFF. <br>  VERSION - firmware version: V.200906261 <br><br>  In viewing mode, it is possible to rewind, which works fine.  There is a ‚Äúviewing mode‚Äù that allows you to see video and photo thumbnails on the screen and select the one you want to view.  In the "VIDEO" mode, by tilting the joystick, you can quickly turn on the backlight or view the last captured video.  In the ‚ÄúPHOTO‚Äù mode, the tilt of the joystick switches the backlight (AUTO, ALWAYS ON, TURNED OFF).  Pressing up / down is digital zoom.  The joystick is too small, but rather elastic.  When you turn off the camera, the system settings are saved, everything else is reset.  There is a flaw (in my firmware, in new versions fixed), the camera does not allow shooting when charging is connected, so using the camcorder in car DVR mode is not very convenient, this is a software limitation.  But if you plug in the charging while recording, then the charge goes and the camera takes off, but before the first stop of the recording, then the magical passes have to be redone.  When the camera is connected to a computer via USB, it is defined as a regular removable disk and is being charged.  You can also connect to your TV via AV cable or HDMI. <br><br>  Here is the camcorder matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81a/820/066/81a820066c883710552dd61b777df8ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's get to the point.  And what can our camcorder.  Specially removed from the car to show all the weaknesses.  In ‚Äúgreenhouse‚Äù conditions, with a tripod, on a bright sunny day, the camera on the phone also takes a good shot.  In the camcorder there is no stabilizer, and there is no software.  When shooting at a maximum resolution of 1920x1080 in motion, the picture floats, this is a feature of all inexpensive camcorders and their matrices. <br><br>  Video 1920x1080 in motion.  Everything is floating.  If you want to fix in the car on the windshield, then it must be done on a hard tripod, since all the shaking of <a href="http://chinalab.ru/blog/1.html">flimsy tripods</a> is transmitted to the camera. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/10585871&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgwqU2pa51O6WvWqKebOxf1ZJSxw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Untitled" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  When walking with hands.  1920x1080. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/10585976&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjgebHL16Y-g_d-5gw0jIUhmhlLTg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Untitled" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video 1920x1080 shot from one point "with hands". <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/10599018&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiHDzT-hZxoh9lYwfXiWBBHRp1i8g" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="1920x1080" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video at night "with hands" 1920x1080. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/33NBWd-xy3Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhibP_lzhu4T23kHw_5S7S3EIub5tw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Photos from hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46c/ee9/189/46cee9189b5319e6d851d07acdbbe915.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Same subject, with maximum digital zoom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95e/80c/937/95e80c9372de348dd2889f48591bff1d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will make a small conclusion.  For shooting in motion, and even ‚Äúwith hands‚Äù, at maximum resolution, these devices are not very suitable.  By lowering the resolution of the shooting, the matrix quite ‚Äúkeeps up‚Äù with abrupt changes in the frame.  I deliberately did not spread the video with a tripod, because  As part of a portable device, it is perfect.  Now a new model has been released - HD DV500, it has the ability to shoot ‚Äúupside down‚Äù (for ease of use in the car as a DVR, the picture turns 180 ¬∞) and charging in shooting mode.  Chinese gadgets (factory performance, good, large manufacturers), it is worthy, and in terms of quality and performance.  Calmly compete with famous brands.  And for the price - there is no equal.  This camcorder can now be purchased for US $ 115 with delivery to Russia (‚ÄúTEMPORARY‚Äù difficulties with Russian Post are not taken into account).  There is one subtle point - service and warranty, but sellers always give a guarantee, and in which case, you can always send back, and if you consider that gadgets are two to three times cheaper, then this nuance can be neglected.  And yet, often the Chinese do unique things that can only be bought from them!  So why pay more!  For myself, I made a conclusion for a long time and successfully use electronics from China! <br><br>  PS Initially, I uploaded a lot of videos on YouTube, but for some reason everything ‚Äújumped and shook,‚Äù in fact, the quality is much higher and video hosting sites squeeze and re-encode content, on Vimeo, the limit is 500mb per week for uploading HD video, so there are not many examples .  It should be noted that in real life the picture doesn‚Äôt twitch like that, I don‚Äôt know why it happens like this after uploading to hosting, it‚Äôs probably compression artifacts of the .mov format </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89531/</a></p>
