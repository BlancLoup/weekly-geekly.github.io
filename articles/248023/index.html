  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Disco on the project, or rhythm as a means of project management</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely you have seen the orchestra playing.  Have you paid attention, how do all the participants co-operate?  How to play in the same rhythm?  At first they begin to create a musical rhythm, and then the musical rhythm sets the pace of performance and the order of actions of the musicians.  Talk about the influence of music can be a lot.  To deny, or even simply ignore, its influence is unwise ... <br><br>  Let us take as a basis for further clarification the fact that music is a manifestation of rhythm.  Rhythm is present in all processes and in the change of seasons and in our daily life and, following the inexorable logic, it also exists in automation projects (rhythm). <br><br>  The essence of the phenomenon, which will be discussed further, is a very well shown video "DJ from the sky."  At the time of this writing, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4b3gm4sB_Ao">link</a> was relevant.  However, you can easily find this video yourself, if you want.  When you watch, pay attention to the music, in this video it just reflects the rhythm of the process. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Noticed how it changes in the last action (where the old man sets the ball with the new RHYTHM)? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      In fact, the processes of automation, and any processes, are no different from the task of the sky guy from this video.  Want the same tools of influence as his?  No problem. <br><br>  Any rhythm is a wave motion characterized by amplitude and long wave (or oscillation frequency) - to whom it is as clear as possible.  What do these quantities mean in the process of automation?  Frequency is time, amplitude is the quality (amount of energy) that people achieve in the project. <br><br>  Set the rhythm yourself! <br><br>  How to do it?  Refer to the analogies of life.  How to set the rhythm of the rushing stream of cars?  Yes, there is nothing easier - traffic lights.  Like, for example, I did this on my own projects: a weekly working meeting of the project team.  Employees do not have time?  Distracted by other things?  Doing wrong and wrong?  Influence the rhythm of the process - a working meeting every three days.  Few?  Start each working day with a small working meeting on the project - set tasks for the employees only for one day, and in the morning check the results and analyze problems and errors and again for one day.  As soon as people start to do and do what is necessary (they will enter the desired RHYTHM), reduce the number of meetings.  Now RHYTHM will manage people.  You just need to support it - for example, once a week.  Remember the same orchestra and conductor - yes, first people create music, but then the music ‚Äúmakes‚Äù people play at the right rhythm. <br><br>  And what to do, if you only weaken the control - the quality immediately drops?  So someone is "fake"!  He does not know the "party", does not know how to perform, but simply does not want to work.  The pioneer organization of the Soviet times had the following motto: if you can‚Äôt, we can teach, if you don‚Äôt want, we will!  Remember about the second characteristic - the amplitude of oscillation?  Here it is!  How to influence the amplitude?  Set the required quality parameters at each controlled stage: the number and volume of documents, the final list of system / device functions, the order and nature of meetings, etc.  and so on ... The main thing - it should be "countable" value. <br><br>  And finally, a little about real music ... Remember how people dance.  Yes, at least in a disco, what music - such and dancing!  Music itself has an impact!  In Soviet times, music was played in the factories in the morning, asking RHYTHM for the whole day.  Why not adopt this technique?  Tell me, inconvenient, difficult to implement, not applicable to our reality?  Where is the creative approach? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248023/</a></p>
