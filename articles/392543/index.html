  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Helmet for shielding radiation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Modern civilization can not imagine its existence without advertising.  Thousands and thousands of advertising messages in time units attack the average person.  The advertising budget of many projects is so high that these same projects may not charge for the basic services they provide.  Advertising technologies are also developing all the time.  In the good old days, advertising messages were printed in newspapers, dictated by voice, shown on television, and it was easy to avoid their annoying influence.  But now there are completely new technologies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/4b9/ace/5604b9ace9a44619a514ae5db6723a4c.png"><br>  <i>Advertising poster in Schelkovo</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Methods of contactless transmission of information to the brain were developed as early as the 10s of the 21st century and roughly divided into three types: ultrasonic, first demonstrated by Sony, electromagnetic (radio wave), developed by Google and released under a free license, as well as combined, developed by the Fraunhofer Institute.  The energy transmitted by ultrasound or radio waves in the millimeter range, focuses on specific areas of the brain and excites certain neurons responsible for visual or auditory effects.  Modern advertising thought projectors track in real time the head position of 10-50 people moving at a speed of 0 to 25 km / h at a distance from the projector to 15 meters. <br>  So, we have a problem: we are overtaken by the omnipresent mental advertisement.  For those who did not want to listen to the usual advertising, there was a way out: you could close your eyes and not watch it, or plug your ears and not hear it.  Mystery advertising is not fooled.  It is useless to run away from her.  Need another way. <br>  The foil cap, which was used during the early experiments with mental projectors, saves only from the most low-power electromagnetic models.  In addition, the foil is quickly wiped, and holes are formed in it, comparable to the length of the millimeter-wave waves used, as a result, the cap stops protecting.  From ultrasonic projectors, it does not save at all. <br>  A soft hat, for example, a hat with a hat, protects to some extent from ultrasonic thought projectors.  But in the hot season it is inconvenient to wear.  The motorcycle helmet is made of solid material and perfectly resonates in the ultrasonic range, and, therefore, protects only thanks to the air gap between it and the balaclava. <br>  The solution may be the creation of a special helmet, which equally protects against both types of influences, and at the same time is comfortable to wear.  You can see the 3D model of the prototype of such a helmet below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/dc1/5f7/04fdc15f7ace49efa53238a7db55418d.png"><br>  The helmet is made with the current trends of minimalism.  No designer has worked on its creation, its form is completely determined by its purpose and the functions it performs.  The helmet is painted in light gray according to RAL7035. <br>  The following illustration shows its section and individual elements.  Balaclava conventionally not shown. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/647/641/f7e/647641f7e47446f1b95724a58eaaba2e.png"><br>  The bearing body of the helmet 1 is made of special graphitized foam fluoroplastic.  The material provides a high degree of suppression of the ultrasonic and electromagnetic waves of the range used, it is light, strong, chemically inactive, and at the same time, it is well breathable due to its porosity.  To improve the suppression of low-frequency ultrasonic waves and a low-frequency magnetic field, rings 2,3,4,5 of a composite material are fixed on the body: silicone rubber with a high viscosity containing permalloy powder.  The width of the rings is optimized for suppressing waves with a length of 100-10 mm. <br>  The helmet has a nose shield 6 to exclude excitation of the visual center of the brain from the lower hemisphere.  In the cavity of the shield can be placed a standard carbon filter for the purification of inhaled air from smog. <br>  Outside, the helmet is covered with a shielding multilayer coating 7. The coating based on thin films of gold and silicon oxide effectively reflects 99.9% of radio waves with a length of 10 mm - 0.1 mm with a small mass.  The inner surface of the helmet is also covered with a post-reflective coating 8 containing a thin silver film.  The film additionally serves as an antiseptic. <br>  The helmet also covers the eye area.  Triple observation glasses made of Plexiglas with a conductive coating are provided for observation.  Between the glasses there is an air gap to absorb ultrasound. <br>  So, for radio wave thought projectors, the helmet provides protection: 9.5% of the waves are absorbed by rubber-metal rings, 80% by the external reflective coating, 10% by the helmet body material, and 0.5% comes to the internal reflective coating.  According to the simulation results, the degree of absorption in the range of 100 mm - 0.1 mm exceeds 60 dB.  This is more than enough to stop viewing ads. <br>  The radiation of ultrasound thought projectors is absorbed by the helmet in this way: 15% is absorbed by rubber rings, 24% is lost at the air-helmet interface, 60% is absorbed by the helmet body, and 1% is lost at the helmet-air interface inside the helmet.  Simulation shows less ultrasound suppression, just 48 dB.  But this should be enough so that the thought projector does not act on you. <br>  The design of the helmet is not limited to the above sketch.  Its components can be arranged in a different way.  The wide distribution of such helmets will relieve billions of people from suffering.  It is necessary to organize their mass production as soon as possible.  It is advisable to have time by April 1.  :) </div>
