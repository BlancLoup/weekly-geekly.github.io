  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GitLab 8.10 released</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hello.  This time, the delay in the release of the release post turned out just 10 days, and it pleases. <br>  This time he <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/chebureque/" class="user_link">translated chebureque</a> , for which he was very grateful! </p><br><p>  In short: Increased productivity, appeared protecting branches from changes using masks, improved diff display, added manual actions to CI, mass subscription to tickets, improved support for Slack, and added more emoji. </p><br><p>  The text of the translation itself: </p><br><hr><br><p>  The main task of GitLab is to allow you to go from an idea to a ready-to-use product as quickly as possible.  Each of our releases is aimed at making this path even easier, and version 8.10 especially succeeded in this! </p><br><p>  GitLab 8.10 simplifies review and merge code processes: now you have even more convenient diffs and additional features to protect branches from accidental changes.  And when it comes time to deploy the finished code, you can use the function of manual checks before you deploy your code with one click. </p><br><p>  Our July ( <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/mvp/">MVP</a> ) - Winnie!  He helped us a lot by correcting bugs and putting order in our <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests%3Fauthor_id%3D14714%26scope%3Dall%26sort%3Did_desc%26state%3Dmerged">issue tracker</a> . </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="zaschita-vetok-ot-izmeneniy-s-ispolzovaniem-masok">  Protection of branches against changes using masks </h2><br><p>  To protect the branches from accidental deletion or modification, they can be protected.  This mechanism, among other things, allows you to allow or deny access to the branches for writing, depending on the rights of users - for example, you can prevent ordinary developers from pushing or merging into production and release branches. </p><br><p>  In Gitlab 8.10, you can now set up such automatic protection using masks that will be applied to branch names.  This greatly simplifies working in repositories with a large number of branches. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fc/eb6/eae/9fceb6eaee014326bf479ee21e02521f.png"></p><br><p> For example, if you put a protection on a <code>release-*</code> mask, all branches whose name begins with <code>release-</code> will automatically become protected.  When developing GitLab, we use this feature to protect our stable branches using the <code>*-stable</code> mask. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/wc2.png"></p><br><h2 id="merzh-v-zaschischennye-vetki">  Merzh in the protected branches </h2><br><p>  As mentioned above, the branch protection option allows you to distinguish between who can push into important branches and who cannot.  By default, push and merge to protected branches is available only to users with <code>Master</code> permissions and above. </p><br><p>  In previous versions of GitLab, users of the 'Developer' group were automatically allowed to push into secure branches.  Starting from version 8.10, you can independently give <code>Developer</code> members rights to push separately and separately to Merge. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e6/4db/877/3e64db87708a48e5a191e89872724a44.png"></p><br><p>  In this example, members of the <code>Developer</code> group may have merge requisitions, but cannot directly push into the specified branches.  That is, these branches are protected from direct pushing, but for accepting a merge-request, they do not need to wait for a user with a high level of permissions.  Please note that this functionality is available only from the web interface and is not available from the command line. </p><br><p>  Here you can also add approvals from the Enterprise Edition, which allows you to require a review from several people before accepting changes.  In this case, a merge-request must be viewed by several developers, but any user from the <code>Developer</code> group can nevertheless accept it. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/protected_branches.html">Read more about secure branches.</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="uluchshennye-dify">  Improved Dify </h2><br><p>  Regardless of whether you are writing code, doing code review, or even working not with code, but with some other text content, you most likely have to work a lot with diffs.  It is very desirable that the diffs work quickly and be comfortable.  In GitLab 8.10, diffs began to be rendered much faster and learned a few interesting things. </p><br><h3 id="bolee-udobnye-side-by-side-diffs">  More comfortable side-by-side diffs </h3><br><p>  We have improved the side-by-side diffs, and now they show the changes in an even more visual form. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/side1.png"></p><br><h3 id="inline-diffy">  Inline diffs </h3><br><p>  If the changes affect only part of the line, we will show you exactly its modified portion (and not the entire string): </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/inline1.png"></p><br><h3 id="shlapyvaemye-diffy">  Shattered Diffs </h3><br><p>  Now you can slap diffs by clicking on the file name.  This will help you conveniently view the changes file by file. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/cdiff.png"></p><br><p>  Large diffs ( <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab_git/merge_requests/101">&gt; 10kb</a> ) will always be shown collapsed (but you can deploy them at any time).  This should be a great help if you constantly have to look through a lot of big changes in a lot of files. </p><br><h2 id="ruchnye-deystviya-dlya-zapuska-konveernyh-zadach-pipeline-jobs">  Manual actions to run pipeline tasks </h2><br><p>  Of course, you have already set up a <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/pipelines.html">pipeline (pipeline) for Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery</a> ?  Using such an automatic pipeline for production deployment may not be the best idea.  Automatic deployment to staging is quite a normal practice, but before porting the code to production, it is better to do at least a few manual tests to finally make sure that everything is working fine. </p><br><p>  Now you can set manually activated conditions for deployment in production.  The <code>when: manual</code> option adds a new action to the web interface that needs to be activated manually ‚Äî and the pipeline will continue to be executed only after this manual action.  For example, your release manager will click this button after manually making sure that staging is working fine.  Any job in your pipeline can be marked with the <code>when: manual</code> option. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/ci_manual1.png"></p><br><p>  These actions are also displayed in environments to make it easier for you to translate assemblies from staging to production. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/ci_manual2.png"></p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/quick_start/README.html">About the CI / CD system in GitLab</a> <br>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/environments.html">Environments in CI</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="mnogostrochnyy-sintaksis-dlya-citat-v-markdown">  Multiline syntax for quotes in markdown </h2><br><p>  If you want to mark several lines in your markdown file as a quote, you no longer need to add to each line <code>&gt;</code> .  Now for this there is a multi-line syntax: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs ruby"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;</span></span>&gt;       .      . , ! &gt;&gt;&gt;</code> </pre> <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/markdown/markdown.html">Read more about GitLab Flavored Markdown</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="neskolko-tochek-montirovaniya-dlya-repozitoriev">  Multiple mount points for repositories </h2><br><p>  Now you can spread the data of your repositories across several mount points.  Just enter all the necessary mount points in the <code>gitlab.rb</code> file: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs php">git_data_dirs({ <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"default"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"/var/opt/gitlab/git-data"</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"alternative"</span></span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"/mnt/nas/git-data"</span></span> })</code> </pre> <br><p>  After that, in the GitLab admin panel, you can specify under which mount point each new repository should be stored. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/administration/repository_storages.html">Learn more about multiple mount points.</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="massovaya-podpiska-na-tikety">  Bulk subscription to tickets </h2><br><p>  Now you can subscribe (and unsubscribe) to a large number of tickets at the same time.  This is useful in cases where you want to dive straight into a new project and be aware of everything at once, or vice versa, want to be in silence from constant email notifications. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/bulk_sub.gif"></p><br><h2 id="individualnye-urovni-opovescheniy-dlya-grupp">  Individual alert levels for groups </h2><br><p>  In the previous version (8.9), we added <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/06/22/gitlab-8-9-released/">individual alerts</a> so that you would receive notifications only about project events of interest to you. </p><br><p>  In GitLab 8.10, you can manage these settings for project groups by setting the same alert settings for several projects at once (do not forget that individual project settings take precedence over group settings). </p><br><h2 id="ticket-based-kerberos-authentication-dostupno-tolko-dlya-enterprise-edition">  Ticket-based Kerberos authentication (only available for Enterprise Edition) </h2><br><p>  Prior to version 8.10, GitLab users who wanted to use Kerberos authentication had to enter the login and password of their Kerberos account on the GitLab login page.  Since version 8.10, GitLab Enterprise Edition allows Kerberos users to log in to GitLab without entering a username and password - now you just need to click on the "Kerberos Spnego" button on the login page. </p><br><p>  This is made possible by the new OmniAuth provider for SPNEGO authentication via Kerberos.  This provider uses the <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/6">CERN Institute for Nuclear Research</a> , with which it became possible for GitLab to do git clone using ticket-based authentication via Kerberos. </p><br><p>  If the user's browser "understands" the Kerberos protocol, and the user himself has a valid Kerberos ticket on his machine, the browser will automatically log in to GitLab without asking anything from the user. </p><br><p>  Detailed information on configuring ticket-based authentication via Kerberos for GitLab Enterprise Edition is available in the <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/kerberos.html">corresponding documentation section</a> . </p><br><p>  In the next release, we will remove password-based authentication through Kerberos, so if you use it, we recommend that you switch to the ticket-based option as soon as possible. </p><br><h2 id="podsvetka-sintaksisa">  Syntax highlighting </h2><br><p>  The syntax highlighting in GitLab 8.10 is even better. </p><br><p>  We updated <a href="https://github.com/jneen/rouge">rouge</a> from version 1.11.1 to 2.0.5, and in the process of this update added <a href="">new lexers and fixed several bugs</a> .  Now we have the backlight for Docker, F #, IDL, and the already available backlight for praat, <br>  JavaScript, Java, C #, Shell, Liquid, Tulip, Markdown, Ruby, Python and YAML have become even more beautiful! </p><br><p>  By the way, now you can redefine the ‚Äúguessing‚Äù of the language for highlighting and set it explicitly using the entry in the <code>.gitattributes</code> file. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/project/highlighting.html">All details are in the relevant documentation</a> . </blockquote><br><h2 id="zapret-na-zapros-dostupa">  Deny access request </h2><br><p>  Now you can prohibit users who are not members of a project or group <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/06/22/gitlab-8-9-released/">from applying for membership there</a> .  By default, such requests are allowed. </p><br><h2 id="uluchshennaya-integraciya-so-slack">  Improved Slack Integration </h2><br><p>  GitLab can now notify you about various project events via Slack - whether it be a comment to a ticket, the creation of a new merge request or a broken build. </p><br><p>  Slack service now allows you to configure which Slack channel will receive a message about each event. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/slack.png"></p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/project_services/slack.html">Read more about Slack Service here</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="novye-emodzi">  New Emoji! </h2><br><p><br>  We have upgraded to <a href="https://github.com/jonathanwiesel/gemojione">gemojione</a> for 2016, and now emoji has become even more. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/new_emoji.png"></p><br><h2 id="chernye-spiski-dlya-domennyh-imen">  Blacklists for domain names </h2><br><p>  Now you can blacklist domain names, and email addresses from these domains will not be able to register with your GitLab instance.  The settings associated with the blacklist are in the admin panel. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/admin_area/settings/sign_up_restrictions.html">Read about it here.</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="vklyuchenie-i-vyklyuchenie-protokolov-dostupa-dlya-git">  Enable and disable access protocols for Git </h2><br><p>  Now you can independently manage access protocols to Git: you can only allow access to the repository via HTTP, only via SSH or simultaneously via HTTP + SSH </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/user/admin_area/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html">Read more</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="otobrazhenie-video-v-tekste">  Display video in text </h2><br><p>  If the text of the ticket, commentary or merge-request contains a link to the video, then GitLab will display this video directly in the text. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/markdown/markdown.html">Read more about GitLab flavored markdown</a> </blockquote><br><h2 id="preduprezhdeniya-warnings-pri-sborke">  Warnings during assembly </h2><br><p>  As you know, the CI pipeline can be configured in such a way that errors when performing certain tasks (jobs) in it are <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ce/ci/yaml/README.html">not considered fatal</a> .  When such errors occur, the CI pipeline displays warnings (warnings).  In GitLab 8.10, these warnings will be visible to you on the merge request that caused them </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/warnings.png"></p><br><h2 id="statistika-ispolzovaniya-tolko-dlya-gitlab-enterprise-edition">  Usage statistics (for GitLab Enterprise edition only) </h2><br><p>  To better understand how customers use GitLab, 8.10 EE regularly sends anonymous statistical information to GitLab, Inc. servers.  If you don‚Äôt like the idea, turn off this option on the "Application settings" page (on the same page you can see what data will be sent to our server. </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/license_report.png"></p><br><h2 id="uluchshenie-proizvoditelnosti">  Performance improvement </h2><br><p>  From release to release, GitLab is getting better and better in all respects - including speed.  This month we accelerated the display of tickets by 2-2.5 times and diffs by a third: </p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/perf1.png"></p><br><p><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/8_10/perf2.png"></p><br><p>  For those interested - here is a list of significant changes in version 8.10 and links to the corresponding requests. </p><br><h3 id="backend">  Backend </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/3666">HAML has been replaced</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4984">Certain Git operations are now cached pipelines when finding CI pipelines</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4996">Multiple operations</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4997">Files</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5020">If you‚Äôre quoting SQL queries</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5083"><code>projects</code> column.pushes_since_gc</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5093">If you‚Äôre an avatar is present</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5102">Checking if you have a single project has been optimized.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5151">These queries are now cached per request.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5305">Wiki is now online</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5311">Performance of Markdown has been improved.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5070">Checking whether to have a system note has been optimized</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4982">If you‚Äôre commenting, you‚Äôve been cached to prevent multiple lookups.</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="frontend">  Frontend </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4776">Rendering of UI elements when necessary</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4883">It is also possible to reduce the amount of load per page.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4978">Cropper.js has been separated from the main JavaScript file.</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5113">Hen‚Äôt want to get</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5130">Discussion notes are not rendered when it is requested using Ajax</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5140">The code used to check</a> </li></ul><br><h3 id="monitoring">  Monitoring </h3><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4871">Sidekiq latency is now tracked</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/4993">Redis cache hits and misses are now tracked</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5038">The Markdown syntax highlighting filter is instrumented</a> </li></ul><br><h2 id="runner-v14">  Runner v1.4 </h2><br><p>  From now on, runner releases will be synchronized with the monthly major GitLab releases.

During the update, several columns in the database will be renamed, and several migrations will be performed to correctly update the data.  In order not to damage your data during the migration process, the GitLab instance will be stopped for the duration of the update. </p><br><h3 id="obnovlenie-konfiguracii-nginx">  Nginx configuration update </h3><br><p>  The default Nginx configuration for GitLab now overwrites the HTTP headers 'Host' and 'X-Forwarded-Host'.  This adds an extra layer of protection against header injection attacks.  If you installed GitLab from source, then you will need to update your Nginx configuration.  If you installed GitLab using Omnibus, the configuration will be updated automatically (unless you override the 'Host' and 'X-Forwarded-Host' <code>gitlab.rb</code> in the <code>gitlab.rb</code> file). </p><br><h3 id="git-hooks-pereimenovany-v-push-rules-a-takzhe-ustarevanie-git-hooks-api">  Git Hooks renamed Push Rules, and obsolescence of Git Hooks API </h3><br><p>  What used to be called Git Hooks is now called Push Rules.  In addition, the Git Hooks API is now marked deprecated.  This API will be completely thrown into GitLab 9.0, so we recommend that you switch to <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html">Push Rules</a> as soon as possible. </p><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://docs.gitlab.com/ee/push_rules/push_rules.html">Learn more about Push Rules</a> </blockquote><br><h3 id="umolchatelnoe-povedenie-pri-obnovlenii">  Default behavior when updating </h3><br><p>  <em>Warning The</em> information in this section is relevant if you are upgrading to GitLab 8.2 from a previous version.
