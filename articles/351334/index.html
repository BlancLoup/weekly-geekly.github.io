The economic situation, as well as the law on the storage of personal data of Russian citizens on the territory of the Russian Federation, stimulates the development of domestic data centers and the growth of cloud providers.  Many of our companies, meanwhile, are only at the very beginning of the journey and quickly get lost in the variety of different technical capabilities.  On the one hand, they understand that cloud solutions and corporate mobility will support their business at no extra cost.  On the other hand, they are concerned about data protection, which is also correct.  How to use technology safely and efficiently - I am telling in my trial material.  Please read! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8c/d5/9e/8cd59ewee81jn8imne_5zrhjy2y.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Mobility - significant benefits with proper management. </h3><br>  It is quite natural that employees of companies use mobile technologies in their daily lives.  Also in professional activities, they increasingly rely on these devices and constant access to applications and data.

      For modern specialists, the place and the official framework of working time no longer matter, the main thing is the result.  The more freely and flexibly they can build their working day, the more productive and motivated they will work.  In addition, some industrial companies are not located in the center of large cities, but on the outskirts or in general outside of them.  A long way to the place of work is inevitable for many.  Together with the mobile concept of work and the corresponding IT infrastructure, the company can give employees the ability to access the necessary data from any place at any time.  At the same time, mobile devices should not necessarily be provided by the employer - a well-thought-out strategy will allow integrating personal devices into daily work.  In this case, it is important to remember that personal laptops, tablets and smartphones require special attention from the point of view of data security belonging to the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/cf/wh/tmcfwhndhatyhhmfyfjvy_hobhw.jpeg"><br>  <i>Photo ekb-room.ru</i> <br><br>  Mobility of business processes is a distinctive feature of the company not only from the position of an attractive employer, but also in terms of competitiveness.  After all, the one who quickly and - responds to requests, will be able to - get customer loyalty.  This advantage is achievable only if mobile processes are efficiently built and integrated into the existing IT landscape. <br><br><h3>  Hybrid IT landscapes and information security </h3><br>  In addition to mobility, there is another trend that a business is starting to get to know - cloud computing.  The public cloud offers companies clear advantages: high investment costs for IT equipment are declining, the cloud service provider takes care of maintenance and upgrades, and flexibility increases due to the possibility of using services depending on business needs.  But enterprises still have great doubts about security, so many customers rely on their own cloud systems. <br><br>  Private cloud is designed for peak loads.  However, the cost of ownership of this infrastructure is charged in full, even if it is not maximally used.  An alternative are hybrid IT landscapes, when public clouds are combined with local solutions.  So confidential data is securely stored in the company's private cloud.  And if the IT infrastructure is faced with peak loads, for example, due to increased customer requests at certain times of the year, then you can use the services of a public cloud.  Thus, system performance remains stable without compromising security. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1s/ug/pk/1sugpkhogj04i3vn5iznpy2o0pi.jpeg"><br><br>  Also, when exchanging sensitive data through the cloud, companies should not compromise on security.  There are solutions through which information can be safely delivered to any device, synchronized and shared among colleagues, partners or customers. <br><br><h3>  Economic efficiency - IT centralization as the key to success </h3><br>  Business has to constantly balance: as a rule, in the IT departments of companies a small staff, budgets are limited and, despite this, the business must respond to such current trends as the transition to digital technology in order to remain competitive.  The key to cost reduction is the centralization of IT, as with the help of new virtualization solutions, you can significantly reduce the cost of managing desktops.  In this case, the benefits of centralized desktop virtualization will be combined with a personalized PC environment.  As a result, users gain access to data and applications regardless of location, network, and device, and IT administrators, in turn, can quickly deploy applications and updates remotely.  Thus, you can quickly respond to new requirements, save money on upgrading client equipment and use existing devices as long as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hp/kz/us/hpkzus-4drmon7wugxpz3ybwvpg.png"><br><br>  The complexity of strategic IT initiatives is constantly growing, be it corporate mobility, cloud computing, or cost optimization ‚Äî a business faces a number of difficult investment decisions.  Management faces a difficult task - to optimize business processes with the help of technology, without undermining the company's budget.  When building a new IT strategy, you need to ask yourself: are the planned investments really going to speed up workflows and increase employee productivity?  This is the only way to pave the way for new business models and secure a competitive advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351334/</a></p>
