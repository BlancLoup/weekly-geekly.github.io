We read a lot of comments on social networks and here on Geektimes with requests to show real reviews of the GPS tracker and Mishiko activity.  We heard them, and decided to make a full test drive of the device. <br><br>  We did a review together with one of the first Mishiko users, Irina and her luxurious Corso dog named Angel.  The guys followed the project from the very start, and kindly agreed to help us organize a visual test ‚Äúin the fields‚Äù with them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/234/84a/bf4/23484abf4851453787cbc935248be068.jpg">

      Before going with the device to the site, we decided to show you how the tracker works indoors.  The Moscow office of Mishiko is located in the house-book on Novy Arbat, 21 - and the more interesting it is to show the work of the tracker indoors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  We test on office rats </h3><br>  After a short charge (up to 100% of the device is charged in three hours, but for the test we limited ourselves to half an hour of charging), we checked the signal from the satellites in the office. <br><br>  As a first, more complex case, we went into the corridor surrounded by walls.  Open the application, look at the map - and after 10 seconds we get the following image: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/a17/d2a/0aca17d2af51efc4aa20bd6433dda74d.jpg"><br><br>  Yeah, not bad!  As you can see, Mishiko did not catch the GPS signal through the walls, but showed the device‚Äôs location based on information from the cellular network towers (the so-called LBS positioning).  We checked with the iPhone and got the same picture - in the buildings of the GPS signal, no matter how you dance with a tambourine, there will not be: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/272/8e1/1602728e1f9a47459b0e658b73c9dd62.jpg"></div><br>  <i>For comparison: Yandex.Maps screenshot inside the same room.</i> <br><br>  In the center of the city there are so many cell phone towers that the accuracy turned out to be high: exactly in the center of the ‚Äúapproximate‚Äù location we are.  If you leave the city, the error may be about 500 meters, but only until the device again does not catch the data from the GPS satellites. <br><br>  We continue the experiments: we approach the window in the office, open the map in the application.  Yeah, already interesting! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/591/f08/2c2/591f082c2dbc42acaeaa9ad24f4e3440.PNG"></div><br>  GPS earned, the location is displayed as one "point" on the map.  Meter to meter!  For the purity of the experiment, we go out and see the working GPS again. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c5/238/bf4/5c5238bf4305830fedd2586be50269ba.jpg"><br><br>  It's time to move to the dog :) But this is already tomorrow! <br><br><h3>  Oh, dog, where are you? </h3><br>  Upon arrival "in place", we decided to clarify in the application data about the dog.  There are two options.  The first is to manually enter the breed, weight, height at withers, age, and other parameters.  All of them are taken into account when calculating the activity rate for the described dog. <br><br>  As an express option, you can choose one of the ‚Äúpre-installed‚Äù options: for small, medium and large dogs.  I went this way, chose a ‚Äúlarge‚Äù dog and the device automatically substituted the data almost perfectly: weight of 55 kg (actually - about 53 kg), height at withers 65 cm (actually about 70 cm).  You can ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the settings manually, but not necessarily.  The main thing - to clarify the breed and date of birth. <br><br>  While I was walking from home to the subway, and from the subway to the dog at the test site, the device ‚Äúcounted‚Äù activity points during my own walk.  But since I am not a test subject, for the purity of the experiment, we recorded the time and level of activity that Mishiko ‚Äúcounted‚Äù while I was carrying him. <br><br>  So, we started with <b>2396</b> points ( <i>or 935 meters, or 31 minutes of activity</i> ).  On the clock 12:51. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/004/769/3d2/0047693d2182a4933f408161921974d1.jpg"><br><br>  We put the device on the dog.  Fortunately, the strap is easily adjustable in length and, after a straightforward adjustment, went even for Angel‚Äôs impressive neck, 56 centimeters in girth. <br><br>  I must say that a couple of times during the walk, we held Angel by the collar, and nothing foreshadowed troubles: the plastic latch is very strong, and the fabric, though not too thick, but wide enough to withstand even a jerk of very great strength. <br><br>  The ‚Äúears‚Äù of the device are large and allow you to thread the collar without difficulty, and the base is aluminum, so there was no need to worry about the reliability of mounting the device on the collar. <br><br>  A couple of minutes, and you're done: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ec9/005/a2b/ec9005a2b5c8127619b6b52958121ac9.jpg"><br><br>  The dog reacted quite calmly to the new product, but I did not feel the additional 40 grams of Mishiko around my neck, at all. <br><br>  Before starting the testing activity, checked the GPS.  We walked on the dog site in the Nagornaya area, and Angel quickly found the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d62/c84/236/d62c842364e72650a106df1fd5ba86ff.jpg"><br><br>  Okay, then we continue to test the activity.  How exactly?  Yes, like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/29b/7a4/ef3/29b7a4ef3f2cbe7e576dbac7150fb73d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b70/5b9/74e/b705b974e191c50b2d8349ca69e11ddb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/638/8d7/4e5/6388d74e502664104e2735fbb5a39bcf.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike many bluetooth trackers on the market, Mishiko uses cellular for data transfer.  So, it is <b>not limited to a distance of 10-15 meters</b> .  Mishiko is not even limited to a country - while sitting in Prague, you can follow your pet‚Äôs walks in Moscow or Moscow region via a smartphone. <br><br>  Super comfortable. <br><br>  But back to the test.  As you can see, we did not spare the dog and our own strength and "broke off" as it should.  The dog ran almost without interruption, took away toys, climbed the hills and had fun. <br><br>  Summing up the subtotal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/713/5e7/113/7135e71136036d179f412aee287580f3.jpg"><br><br>  On the clock - 13:01.  Mishiko shows 4469 points (don't forget, we started right away with 2396).  That is, we ‚Äúran through‚Äù in 10 minutes of the test of 2073 points - approximately 7-8% of the daily value. <br><br>  Interestingly, we walked on a relatively small area, and even though the dog was winding round and round, the distance was really not very large.  Judging by Mishiko, in the first 10 minutes we ran about 800 meters.  It looks realistic. <br><br>  We continue our studies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/c39/177/310c39177539421b88baa8ec8c7655db.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42f/c5c/72e/42fc5c72e04a49de8f5b2eefc15a7ed4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a0/47d/427/7a047d427de5b298fa89d2855027be61.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fe/1ba/8d2/2fe1ba8d2a76750d90914d0cff487704.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9a/15b/e79/f9a15be791e92e175fb41c16bb24669a.jpg"><br><br>  The time is already 13:24.  We run for 34 minutes, and the activity counter shows an impressive 9522 points.  If we subtract our initial "error", then we have already run <b>7126</b> points.  This is almost a third of the daily rate! <br><br>  The last half hour - as the device shows - the dog was super-active.  Difficult to argue, and in the face (face?) Angel becomes clear that a third of the norm, it seems, and really ran off: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c80/7eb/6f0/c807eb6f0e22a67bedc73a76d2ed7066.jpg"><br><br>  Judging by the peculiarities of the breed and the way Angel felt at the end of the walk, he really walked perfectly on that day. <br><br>  Two or three such walks per day, and the dog will feel great.  Incidentally, I also walked on ten out of ten.  The dog's owner says that with Mishiko, walks become a real ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù: day after day, you want to complete your daily ration of points.  And that means - to play more and walk longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c32/b2c/1ad/c32b2c1ade57b92bbfaa39cf9c74281f.jpg"><br><br>  - Especially for those who read to the end (you have a dog, or are you just interested?), We have prepared a promotional code for a 10% discount on the device.  Here it is: <b>MishikoFriend2017</b> <br><br>  In Russia, you can buy a device only in the official online store at <a href="https://mishiko.net/ru/shop/gps_collar_mishiko/">this address</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401793/</a></p>
