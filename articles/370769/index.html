Yes, of course, he was already elderly (at the time of his death he was 66 years old), but in many countries this age is far from old age.  Anyway, the writer could still tell a lot to his readers. <br><br>  Well, the other day a hard drive with unfinished novels and all the data related to the writer was <a href="https://twitter.com/Wiltshire_flo/status/902536668170866688">destroyed by a</a> roller.  No, this is not an accident and is not the work of the intruders.  Pratchett himself indicated in his will that he would like to destroy personal information, including unfinished novels after his death.  The destruction tool was not the usual modern asphalt paver, but an old steamroller called Lord Jericho. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: absolute; visibility: hidden; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;"></twitter-widget><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" data-twitter-extracted-i1551867211875742016="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">  It was no <a href="https://twitter.com/terryandrob">matter</a> <a href="https://t.co/iLZjuRZnnD">what the</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/terryandrob">industrial</a> <a href="https://t.co/iLZjuRZnnD">revolution</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/terryandrob">would have been.</a> <a href="https://t.co/iLZjuRZnnD">@</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/terryandrob">Rollerthrob</a> <a href="https://t.co/iLZjuRZnnD">pic.twitter.com/iLZjuRZnnD</a> </p>  - Richard Henry (@Wiltshire_flo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wiltshire_flo/status/902536668170866688">August 29, 2017</a> </blockquote><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  About what happened, it became known only a couple of days ago - the manager of the Pratchett estate, Rob Wilkins, spoke about the destruction.  ‚ÄúThe Lord Jericho skating rink proved that modern technology succumbs to the might of the Industrial Revolution,‚Äù Wilkins wrote.

The remains of the media will be on display at the <a href="http://www.pratchetthisworld.com/">Terry Pratchett: HisWorld exhibition</a> dedicated to the author‚Äôs life and work. <br><br>  During his life, Pratchett wrote many works - more than 70. Without a doubt, the most famous of them are those that have become part of the "Flat World" cycle.  This is the whole universe, which includes 41 novels and additional editions.  Based on his work, films, games, comics were created, plays were staged in theaters.  It is estimated that the total circulation of Pratchett books is about 70 million.  His novels have been translated into 37 languages.  Books about the Flat world can <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580">be divided</a> into several topics, each of which has its own characters and place of action (with the storylines often intersect). <br><br>  He himself died not from chance, but because of a disease that affects many older people - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D1%258C_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">Alzheimer's disease</a> .  After Pratchett learned about the problem, he thought about the possibility of euthanasia, as reported by the Daily Mail.  The writer began the paperwork, allowing to go to a Swiss clinic, which is engaged in "planned departure from life." <br><br>  For several years in a row, Pratchett has been promoting the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlegal retirement of hopelessly ill people.  He proposed, in particular, to create specialized judicial bodies that would consider each specific case of an incurable disease and decide whether to allow a person to die or not.  According to Pratchet, the main goal of such bodies is to study the situation and try to make sure that the person who applied to the relevant authority understands the consequences of his action, is in his right mind and is not under the influence of third parties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/861/7ba/dee/8617badeecf1d0b889372e2bba573f3c.jpg" width="1200"><br><br>  A few years after his statement, Pratchett continued to work, dictating the texts of the works to his assistant, who eventually destroyed the hard drive with the unfinished works of the writer at his request. <br><br>  By the way, the last Pratchet novel "The Shepherd's Crown" was released after the death of its creator.  This is just the 41st in a series of novel series "Flat World". <br><br>  The series was conceived as a parody of the fantasy of the 70s.  Most of his works are satirical, although the cycle itself includes many serious ideas that attracted many readers.  Pratchett until 1987 worked as a journalist, but after that he left everything and started writing. <br><br>  The merits of Pratchett in art are great, the Queen of Great Britain Elizabeth II even knighted the writer.  This happened in February 2009. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370769/</a></p>
