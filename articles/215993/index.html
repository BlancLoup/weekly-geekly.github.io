I needed access to the then-popular Varez-FTP ‚Äú <b>Typhoon Epicenter</b> ‚Äù (I found out later in Hong Kong).  Of all friends and acquaintances, only one person could organize access - ‚Äúa <i>friend of a friend of my friend</i> ‚Äù.  He turned out to be Chinese by faith and passport, and we talked for a while tightly.  It was after meeting him that I began to treat the Chinese with passive interest. <br><br>  They are crazy in terms of bringing their skills to the absolute.  Actually, we respected them for this, because they had ‚Äú <i>brains</i> ‚Äù, which we sometimes lacked - not in terms of intelligence, but in terms of personnel.  And there were a lot of them ... a hell of a lot.

      Most often, the Chinese caused us 3 types of emotions: respect, envy and irritation.  In the years 1997-2004, any pirate who rolls the ‚ÄúBest Soft 200x‚Äù blanks would give a kidney for access to a pair of China's warez servers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Respect </h4><br>  Maybe it is the education of the Communist Party or a feature of all Asians, but they know how to work.  If the Chinese team takes on the case, then we can safely assume that it will cope with the task (sooner or later, one way or another, honestly or not).  We respected the fact that they could spend months on one task and issued a solution, to which others with the words ‚Äú <i>yes it went to Tagil</i> ‚Äù did not reach because of lack of patience.  But, in my opinion, they are weaker in defense.  Most of their PE packers were removed in stride, but, of course, not all.  Immediately, <b>NSPack</b> and <b>Upack</b> come to <b>mind</b> , which in themselves are not bad, but they have nothing to do with protection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a1/569/8c7/1a15698c7974df966055b0e958f84fff.png" alt="ror" align="left">  Work is in their genes.  ‚Äú <i>Professional slaves</i> ,‚Äù as one of the <b>CORE</b> members put it. Several times I had the need to write one or another tool, but my knowledge did not allow me to realize everything I needed.  Then I turned to the team <b>LWK</b> (Lifework Krew) and those within a day (!) Sent me a project, written from scratch only on my curve TK. <br><br>  By the way, one of the members of LWK was involved in such an association as <b>China Serials 2K</b> .  They often organized their communities in support of any idea and did not allow it to be bent after the ‚Äú <i>official world funeral</i> ‚Äù of this idea.  Even when <b>S2K</b> died all over the world, this database was updated regularly in China.  It is possible to call this the ‚Äú <i>law of Chinese jelly</i> ‚Äù - when it enters China, technologies acquire a very large amount of inertia. <br><br>  Another reason for respect is the almost complete absence of ‚Äú <i>Ponto</i> ‚Äù among the majority.  They quietly and calmly rejoice in their success.  You respect it at the beginning.  But there is also a minus here - there are drunken devils in the still waters.  Because they are quiet, even if the Chinese do something for the glory of the Communist Party, then they are very reluctant to admit their guilt and mow under the morons, pretending that they have forgotten even the Chinese.  They seriously succeeded in stealing other people's ideas, more on that below. <br><br><h4>  Envy </h4><br>  There was something to envy, because they had and have the largest servers with warez - this is at least.  But envy usually extended to hacking tools.  As soon as another supercryptor appeared, after a maximum of half a year, the Chinese had a tool for unpacking ( <b>iPB</b> - cool guys).  And let this tool be a curve, beat 40% of ekzeshnikov, but this was enough to crack even distributions of the cryptor itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cc/64c/f9b/8cc64cf9bd9db7b7379146959f4ef495.png" alt="ipb" align="left">  The Chinese were very reluctant to share their work, although they sometimes condescended to public releases of certain bodies.  At the same time, they could easily hang on the public release protection.  And I had to break it ... sometimes for a long time. <br><br>  Another reason to envy them was their forums, where they laid out the very tools, articles and releases.  There are two types of Chinese forums: public and closed (where they are allowed only by invitation), not indexed by search engines, and even in Chinese.  Among the "non-Chinese" access to private forums can get units.  There was a case; one such forum was attempted by the guys from the <b>Czech Hacking League of Class</b> .  Their goal was attaches.  Hacked, but very grieved when they saw that all attachments are rar-archives with password-hung, which change every week and are announced on the forum channel in IRC, where access was exactly ordered.  Another way is to use one miraculously obtained account for collective reading.  But the administration of the forums (at least those 2x where I was) quickly stopped this practice, seeing that the user enters the forum from Sweden, then from Kazakhstan, then from Ukraine.  Readers had to put a VPN.  :) Particularly cunning tried to pump out the entire archive of the forum through Teleport.  Did not help.  Maximum 2-3%, after which the automatic ban forever almost the entire subnet. <br><br>  Access to public forums was open to everyone, but even there they tried to restrict foreigners.  They created sections for ‚Äú <i>English speaking public</i> ‚Äù, but the most interesting topics, of course, were raised in the Chinese section.  With the advent of automatic web translators it has become easier, but still not easy.  Moreover, each of your posts required the blessing of the Chinese moderator, and these people seeing the world through a crack could not approve your text simply because they did not like your nickname.  But this is probably not envy, but irritation, about it later. <br><br>  Revenge was "terrible."  :) A weighty weapon was their ignorance of Russian and English - they most certainly did not understand ‚Äú <i>Olzbanian Yezig</i> ‚Äù.  And it often helped.  No seriously.  For example, a couple of times the ‚Äúhot‚Äù public articles were written in ‚Äú <i>Olban</i> ‚Äù so that the Chinese could not translate.  Although it is worth saying that in these articles the Chinese were not exposed in the best light ... therefore they wrote in such a way that they did not understand. <br><br><h4>  Irritation </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/313/16f/36a/31316f36a5fd823d0445262fce98e39d.jpg" alt="ftp" align="left">  Mostly annoying reluctance to let us into their parties, forums, servers.  They tried to isolate themselves from the rest of the world.  This is understandable, the people in China are full, their own huge party.  In addition, the language barrier is a problem for them.  But, when you are banned from the Chinese forum just because you are European or Russian, it is fucking furious.  And when you see the tool you have been looking for for 2 months, lying in the forum attachments, but you can‚Äôt download it, because  your status is ‚Äú <i>foreigner</i> ‚Äù, then you can safely beat your head against the wall.  The Great Wall of China exists not only in the real world, but also in the virtual world, and you can learn a lot from each other. <br><br>  Another annoying habit - the inhabitants of the Middle Kingdom loved to take Russian (yes any) tools, translate the interface into Chinese, modify the GUI a bit and pass it off to their own design.  For example, it was with the program <b>Quick Unpack</b> , which was written by <b>FEUERRADER</b> (in this example, his name was still saved, lucky) and many others.  They put their logos, links to websites, some Chinese readme.txt and other garbage to the archive without a twinge of conscience, the logo of some website is inserted into About, and all references to the author are discarded.  After this, such a disgrace is sent to the free swimming with a remarkable note inside: " <i>If you want to get this info file included, thank you</i> ."  And this is despite the fact that they themselves deleted everything they could. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1f/f38/9a8/c1ff389a8109d724589678049273a42b.png" alt="Quick unpack"><br><br>  By the way, one of the reasons why Chinese hackers and crackers didn‚Äôt rush into European teams is the ignorance of languages.  Units, at least knowing English, are interested in what is happening in other countries.  From time to time, teams from the sky open doors for new people. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/55a/c3a/b2b/55ac3ab2b5b4a48f27c313b9162f6b1a.png" alt="apply" align="right">  This is usually associated with the search for burglars for some vacancies and then candidates can even be from Uruguay.  Usually, Chinese teams fill in this way only specific positions, because  all the rest they have enough.  For example, the <b>aSx</b> (Asian Sound Express) team had at least 4 divisions: software, pda, games, and music.  Many teams work only on the domestic market with local content, without even trying to crawl out of China.  I will say more, <u>90% of the Chinese teams are not known anywhere</u> except China. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cc/79e/fcc/4cc79efcce2bb27c7b52b7cfb3838246.png" alt="RVN" align="left">  But back to the English language.  Those who know English are more active.  They read English articles themselves trying to write something.  They are usually more open to communication and collaboration.  A number of English-speaking Chinese (those who can even connect a couple of words) have settled in Russian teams, from <b>REVENGE</b> to <b>TSL</b> . <br><br>  Along with closed servers, the Chinese have a huge number of public web sites where warez is laid out.  All sorts of 9down, <a href="http://www.ttdown.com/">ttdown</a> , <a href="http://vdown.cn/">vdown</a> , 123down, etc., why none of the Chinese could explain me to the word "down".  The volume of pirated traffic that flows in China is enormous.  These are terabytes of data, hellish thousands of releases.  What is the content?  Half - mainstream software, music, movies.  The second is Chinese music, software and movies.  But these are details ... <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  It's time to bring some kind of result.  The Chinese scene has always been as close as possible to the community, and what happened there we learned only from some screenshots of forums, IRC logs or infrequent English-language updates of nfo-files of Chinese teams.  Over the years, nothing has changed, and so far China has been hanging apart from everyone, sipping rice tincture.  Their human resources, the ability to work - this is what gives them a huge advantage, but the main thing they have not yet learned is to generate original ideas that are still borrowed from the rest of the world. <br><br>  The Chinese scene is a complete package of all emotions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215993/</a></p>
