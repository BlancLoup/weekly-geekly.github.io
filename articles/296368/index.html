      Work in such a company can be a real test for novice applicants, especially for heavy drinkers. <br><br>  Here are collected 11 examples of experiences from those who ventured to become part of the tech-industry (these unfortunates shared on Quora and Glassdoor). <br><br>  <b>Warning:</b> some of the situations described below can cause very unpleasant emotions, so be careful.  Not for the faint of heart. <br><br><h4>  <b>1. All lounges are often occupied.</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fe/534/e0a/6fe534e0a5d54efead8b4b7479198f63.jpg"><br><h6>  In an ideal world, a long afternoon nap would be the norm - but for some reason, the laws of this world do not apply to rest rooms that are always occupied.  The time you spend on waiting is about 60 minutes, well, or you have to go to another floor.  Or take a nap in the massage room.  There is no normal alternative. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. Restrictions on the consumption of free sushi</b> </h4><br><h6>  Sushi Day is, of course, cool, but only 6 tricks in one go?  And if you want more?  This is really very bad.  Will not work.  You have to get in line again.  But sometimes there is no queue and you get another batch right away.  Humiliating. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. Lack of deadlines</b> </h4><br><h6>  No, there are some deadlines (and sometimes there is really no time limit), but you set them up for yourself and that makes absolutely no sense.  If you do not have time to do something, then you just have to set another deadline.  This is a rather unpleasant experience. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. Complicated toilet system</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c1/430/1d1/3c14301d1d0342ecbc1a81e4b4069403.jpg"><br><h6>  You thought that learning HTML would be difficult, but try learning how to use this sophisticated cleaning system.  You break your brain.  However, it will be possible after this to leave work early.  Everything is good. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>5. Gifts that disappoint</b> </h4><br><h6>  You probably dream of a new phone or tablet, and so you get it, but not quite the one you dreamed of.  And even if this is the same gift that you have been waiting for, you will have to pay taxes yourself. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>6. People talk too loudly in the shuttles.</b> </h4><br><h6>  There is nothing worse than loudly chatting colleagues on a bus between San Francisco and Silicon Valley.  But if we talk about something that could be worse, it is a bad wi-fi in these same shuttles. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>7. Small selection of desserts</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/aa2/00a/2fdaa200a1e1463ba6c906f6ca2b8ce3.jpg"><br><h6>  Little creme brulee, lemon triangles, lime pie - but where is the gluten-free chocolate cake?  Oh, here he is.  But why the menu for the table with desserts do not change more often?  There is nothing worse than predictability in the choice of sweet. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>8. Stolen weekends (when more than 30 days have accumulated)</b> </h4><br><h6>  You think unbridled labor will be rewarded with a weekend, but the truth is that they will take away all the weekends from you when they are over 30. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>9. Sparkling water is not sparkling</b> </h4><br><h6>  Sometimes sparkling water in vending machines loses its carbonation.  Imagine how you pour this plucking liquid into a glass and find that it looks more like water that was simply stored in a refrigerator.  Awful feeling. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>10. No massage on corporate yacht</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/811/8d6/667/8118d6667ea246a79bdc1843cfcf6cdd.jpg"><br><h6>  Private yacht trips are great, but why don't you get a free massage during them while you look at the bay and enjoy Margarita?  This is probably done for security reasons.  But he sets up all of us every time. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>11. Break with reality</b> </h4><br><h6>  It seems that this is the worst part of working in a tech company: you quickly lose touch with the real world.  You will begin to complain about such strange things.  No one will understand you.  You will soon become an alien, an outcast, you will have to spend even more time in the lounge (of course, if at least one of them is free). </h6><br><br>  If you are just starting to work in a large company and do not yet understand <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/na-kakom-yazyke-govorit-ofis-sleng-21-veka-dzhobizdan-i-desi/">what language the office speaks, then read our material</a> .
