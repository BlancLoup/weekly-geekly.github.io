      <b>About the highly successful capture of HDD by the secret services:</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>The importance of the evidence was so great that to get a laptop I had to play the whole scene in the library where Ulbricht was taken.</i>  <i>FBI agents (male and female) began a public quarrel.</i>  <i>Ulbricht was distracted to look at them - and at that moment another agent quickly pulled the laptop out from under his hands.</i>  <i>Then the standard arrest was made.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the following hours, the FBI IT specialists carefully examined the laptop and took pictures of the screen, carefully checking that the laptop did not go into sleep mode (with encryption of information).</i>  <i>Then they made a copy of the contents of the hard disk.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The computer has copies of Ulbricht's passports and driver's licenses, payroll payroll records for Silk Road employees, staff activity logs, scans of Silk Road admins IDs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Ulbricht‚Äôs personal diary began in 2010, when Ross had the idea to create the Silk Road site and sell there cheaply hallucinogenic mushrooms that he grew.</i>  <i>Ulbricht describes everything he did on a daily basis, including personal goals, daily work, and drinks with friends.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  Imagine: you are already sawing the door (the manufacturer of which guaranteed that it will be sawn for at least 30 seconds), and you have a lot of interesting things on the hard disk.  What are your actions? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Mechanical destruction </h4><br>  <b>My first thought:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c35/924/d10/c35924d10d8541929aa39798ddd7f366.jpg"><br><br>  But for this you need: a) to get to the HDD (from 10 to 100+ seconds) b) the disk starts to spark after 20 seconds.  So attackers can get not completely baked "pancakes" <br><br>  The second thought is to walk with a hammer prepared in advance at the desktop.  A computer case is always unscrewed and hard not bolted, and hangs on the wires.  For the laptop, it makes sense to put a cross in advance where to hit.  According to my estimates - 10 seconds to make a chop.  But something lately the cases of the disks are especially durable (especially the laptops), but there are still a few facts compromising physical abuse. <br><br>  There are professional hard drive puncturers, it looks very impressive: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qtxfkWgHmcM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjkwdJx4aImhcPes3-z4dwowa7Cvg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And there are uncles in white coats and clean rooms with atomic force microscopes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aac/280/65a/aac28065a75ef55fd3cc8d11160d5140.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>There is a way to visually remove information:</b> <br>  A pair of droplets of a colloidal suspension of Fe <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3</sub> particles is applied to the hard disk plate with a syringe.  Then, using a special cover glass, the suspension is smeared with a thin layer over its surface, on which magnetic contrast appears in reflected light.  It is, in principle, sufficient for even the naked eye to assess the presence or absence of information - in the figure you can clearly see servo marks dividing the disc into sectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9d/68e/38f/a9d68e38fc4f4145a2e1e087cfddafe8.jpg"><br><br>  At 800-fold magnification of an optical microscope, separate servo marks become clearly visible, the data tracks recorded with a weaker field stand out a little worse. <br><br>  And then there is residual magnetization (on flexible media, but who knows, maybe there is such a vulnerability on the HDD too): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e5/239/165/3e52391651bf4115b52812755c9e4f20.jpg"><br><br>  In 2003, instead of the shuttle ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù, this is what landed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/883/295/845/8832958457bb4f0888dab62c4f29d488.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When the ashes were blown out and the case opened, they found the disks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/518/ee5/bcd/518ee5bcd8d297793dd0d0c1872f1cb6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Restored 99% (400 mb) and even published the work in the journal based on the extracted data about the experiment in space. <br><br>  If you engage in mechanical destruction, then at least to such an extent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/857/fe4/e15/857fe4e1596741f59504afb53da99ee9.jpg"><br><br>  I, for reliability, still would fill in with acid and boiled.

At the edges, it is very low, and with a geometric progression decreases with distance from the plane, even in the center. <br><br>  And so that the disk does not fly into orbit, it (for tests) was strengthened with a clamp. <br><br>  Inside the coil looks like this (next to the HDD and the graph of the distribution of field strength at a distance from the center): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78f/902/12f/78f90212f0554d6e9a9349194b080450.jpg"><br><br>  At a distance of half a distance from the center to the edge, the field more than doubles and goes to the edges to zero.

Conveniently so that you do not accidentally press.  After activation, the device is restarted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf9/bd8/0d1/cf9bd80d11664be286fcfe09d00cda62.jpg"><br><br>  The instructions say that it is forbidden to activate the Samurai several times in a row, and we honestly kept 10 minutes between activations. <br>  After 7 activations, the device clicked loudly and smoke began. <br><br>  <b>Peal</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5d/fa8/dbd/c5dfa8dbdfc44a99b1ea7afb93ebc228.jpg"><br><br>  Power button and activation button (activation works ALWAYS regardless of whether the device is fully charged or not) <br><br>  <b>Pulse</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58e/390/73c/58e39073ce3243c1a183a87d331d5535.jpg"><br><br>  After switching on to the network, the device charges for 56 seconds, after which it is ready for activation. <br><br>  There is protection from the cleaning lady: to activate erasing, the button must be pressed and held for more than 3 seconds.  Heard "peep" says only that the button is working, and the device has understood that it is pressed.  Moreover, the button starts to blink quickly, indicating that it is pressed and waits 3 seconds before the start.  By pressing the button and quickly releasing, you can make sure that it is operational, but do not activate the system. <br><br><h4>  <b>Test</b> </h4><br>  As Dr. House measures the temperature of a policeman, we will also push the probe into each device. <br><br>  Since we are going to measure the field in 2 types of field emitters, then according to the theory inside the solenoid, the field is uniform, it is enough to measure it in the middle of the carrier by introducing the device probe to different depths.  Measurements will be made with a probe with a sensor perpendicular to the plane of the solenoid.  The probe is inserted into the solenoid.  For convenience, the probes are calibrated with a centimeter scale. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/146/405/e1f/146405e1f73a427790782aad6ae32a88.jpg"><br><br>  The impact of a planar radiator strongly depends on the measurement site, and, since there are 4 information plates in our disk, how far the disk is from the radiator.  will depend on the measurement result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/cde/9cc/05dcde9cc5ce4a28b110660cef69912e.jpg"><br>  Slotted probe with a sensor perpendicular to the plane of the coil. <br><br>  And here are the coercimeters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d3/7a1/5a1/1d37a15a126844b1ab24d48b44f71915.jpg"><br>  Domestic milliteslameter TP2-2U, American GaussMeter GM-2. <br><br>  Both devices have a laboratory class, that is, applicable for research measurements, have approximately equal characteristics, both record pulsed magnetic fields, both have probes for measuring the field perpendicular to the plane of the coil and parallel to the plane of the solenoid.  Measurements are made by GM-2 in Gauss, TP2-2U in milliTesla.  The main difference - the American captures pulsed fields from 2 ms, domestic - 0.1 ms. <br><br>  One of the tasks was to make from it a device for measuring the power of the field INSIDE of the disk, that is, on the plates itself, where it affects the recorded information.  The corpus is supposed to make its own adjustments to the behavior of the field, and we will try to get a result close to the combat one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b0/c59/f8c/4b0c59f8c3fe479198736611b6645264.jpg"><br>  We even sawed the disc to take into account the screening <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9d/906/167/f9d9061679474f31baeed68aa956b4cb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Probe me in hard drive!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e5/8bf/30b/4e58bf30beca4739959c7d8e7bc6c1fe.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>results</b> </h4><br>  <s>Samurai burned so little data for him</s> <br>  The conversion factor is 1 millTesla = 10 Gauss = 0.796 kiloampere / meter.  Based on the field standard - the value should be at least 500kP / m = 628mTl = 6280G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/08c/274/411/08c2744115d34215b89af8afc1c74d51.jpg"><br><br>  For Impulse, we performed 2 types of test: we simply measured the field inside the device and, together with the drilled HDD, in order to estimate the attenuation coefficient from the body of the HDD itself.  TC "Peal" works on the same principle, the attenuation coefficient should not differ much. <br><br>  It can be seen from the table that the power of the field to the edge of the disc goes down sharply to the edge of the disc, while the pulse of the Impulse is less than 10% and even at the edge is included in the standard 500 kA. <br><br>  The samurai has a giant value of tension in the center and no less a giant weakening as it moves away from the ‚Äúepicenter‚Äù. <br>  (The coil and the hardcore pancakes were not coaxial, and the center of the solenoid hits somewhere in the region. Perhaps due to the fact that there are two constructive types of hards. In this respect, the bulk solenoid doesn‚Äôt matter where the pancakes in the disk covers everything.) <br><br>  Often, before storming, the light is cut down and the cellular and radio communications are jammed.  A samurai, without autonomous power, becomes useless. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Appendix: magnitude of the coercive force of magnetic carriers</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The table lists the magnetic media with the corresponding coercive force * of the carrier material.  On the basis of this table, you can determine the necessary power to erase media. <br><br>  Since each type of carrier has its own level of coercivity, it is important to use a device that erases enough power to reliably erase data.  The power of the erasing field must be at least twice as high as the carrier's own coercive force.  For example, if you want to erase a VHS tape with a coercivity level of 650 oersted, you need an erasing device with a capacity of at least 1300 oersted.  The power values ‚Äã‚Äãof the erase devices with an overlap ratio of the coercive force of the carrier K = 2.5, which ensures guaranteed erasure, are given. <br><br>  Magnetic field power required to erase magnetic media <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/7a5/1fa/f537a51fab464b76a7ad3e33a00a300c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59f/63c/e4d/59f63ce4d21f40e38e91706e0b545817.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  ‚ÄúBrilliant‚Äù scene about emergency data erasure - 1:40:30: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MPQMVFieocw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhJlsF0OsiRDaZ9aaeE8P4tA6lr6A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254671/</a></p>
