  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Appeal to readers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last time, I‚Äôm worried about one problem - in our blog (and indeed not only in ours) too many ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù started up.  Not those who really know their business and have a wealth of experience, but those who are ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù only in the comments, such as those recognized only by Pro Tools or Logic, although they probably have never seen either one or the other.  I would like to talk about this behavior. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <em>First of all</em> , everywhere you look, there are some professionals, one smarter than the other.  But at the same time only a few can prove their competence.  The rest either carry nonsense, or solemnly declare that they are too steep to prove anything to anyone.  There are still amateurs, ‚Äúsemi-professionals‚Äù and beginners - they are great.  They talk on business, ask and share experiences.  Honor and praise them. <br><br>  <em>Secondly</em> , why turn Habr into a stupid forum?  Nothing to say on the case?  Go away!  In RuNet is full of forums where any flood is welcome.  No need to minus the topic in which there are errors.  If the author was able to tell about something, albeit crookedly and with errors, but if no one has touched on this topic before him, it is better to point out the mistakes - the next time it will be better.  Otherwise - write your topic on this topic, which will be 2/5/10/1000 times better than before.  You can not?  It's a pity.  Then shut up and read what they give.  Or do not read at all. <br><br>  <em>Thirdly</em> , I certainly understand that everyone loves to praise their software and their hardware, but have the same conscience.  No need to solemnly declare that everything that is not available to you (or, on the contrary, is too cheap for you) or does not like, is unworthy shit.  No need to declare that labor musicians should use only professional equipment for n thousand dollars, by this you only confirm their incompetence.  A person who works only with midi and samples do not need a super mixer with 32 channels and iron effects.  Remember this.

      <em>In the end</em> .  People who consider themselves professionals think again.  Why are you fooling yourself claiming to be right?  Thus, you are depriving yourself of the opportunity to move on, to become better (we are after this here, right?), Because you set yourself up for the fact that you are only better than eggs.  And if Self-Importance does not allow you to even imagine a more experienced person than you, then you have only two ways.  Either share your Infinite Wisdom with everyone by creating an interesting topic, or leave the blog alone. <br><br>  PS Sorry for the fact that sometimes rude - emotions do their job. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61104/</a></p>
