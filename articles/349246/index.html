      It is worth noting that this post will contain many screenshots of real correspondence with people and companies who offered us their services in the process of preparing the ICO project.  As well as the fact that we did not sign any agreements and did not make promises to keep the correspondence private.  We believe that the information we provide in this topic is publicly available.  For the simple reason that no one asked us to respect the confidentiality of this correspondence. <br><br>  Please do not take the correspondence or the mention of this or that service as PR or advertising.  The purpose of the post is to tell about what we have encountered in the process of preparing the project, initiated by the forces of 2 people, in the context of parallel support of the operating activities of the business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Bro, why do we need a business?  Let's trade in brooms.  After all, they are used in every yard! </blockquote><br>  I heard this ‚Äúbusiness idea‚Äù from my cousin 5 years ago.  It would seem, what could be easier?  Naturally, then I twisted my finger at my temple.  And now I will do the same.  BUT.  There is something in these words.  I remembered them quite recently.  When analyzing the seven-month process of preparing an ICO project for our business.  But let's go back to these words a little later. <br><br>  In June 2017, we began to study such terms as blockchain, ICO, tokens.  At that time, we had absolutely no idea what it was and why it was all needed.  HYIP around the blockchain did the trick. <br><br>  In the process of preparing the project, it seemed to us that people who give us advice or offer their services have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it works.  Watching the truth, we were very much mistaken.  I don‚Äôt deny that we ‚Äúused‚Äù these people to get answers to our questions and form our own idea about the blockchain technology and to get the necessary knowledge. <br><br>  As it turned out, 99% of all offers are banal sample mailings, spam, an absolute unwillingness to even superficially study the project, as well as offers of services for crazy money.  All these people just project their approach on us.  And I understand that.  Why bother, do analysis, study projects, when you can just send 100k sample letters and catch a customer who will pay.  Just because of the collected $ 10m for such advertising "services" allocated ~ 1m $. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c1/ld/qt/c1ldqtpqe7ajwzzqzru7itruai0.jpeg" alt="image">  <i>I apologize in advance for the format of screenshots that may look fine on laptop screens.</i>  <i>Any screenshot can be opened as a picture in a separate window.</i> <br><br>  It is difficult to respond adequately to the ease with which within 5 minutes people want to get - ‚Äúagree‚Äù and money.  Especially in the conditions of the fact that during the seven months of the project preparation we forgot about what a dream is, not to mention the financial profit of the proposed venture and financial burden on the business. <br><br>  <b>Icos.</b>  These guys just hit us.  Destroying the banal logic by the lack of any logic in their sentences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/su/fb/qi/sufbqilrmzrh1h1mr51z0ilpba0.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  What is your soft and hard cap? </blockquote><br>  This question is asked by a person who, a day ago, claimed that he had familiarized himself with the project and had studied all the project documentation.  A person offering services valued at <b>$ 2 million.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vj/kf/gb/vjkfgba4gzjolk1yauhqr3vjmzu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  A personal meeting in the office (even in ours!) For ICOS representatives, for some reason, <s>unacceptable luxury is</s> impossible.  Perhaps the guys simply do not want to spend time and use modern technology to transfer the amount equivalent to nearly two million dollars. <br><br>  It is worth noting the fact that the project that we display at the ICO is not just an idea generated on the sidelines of the employer's office.  Our project is based on a real, operating business that has existed for more than 3 years and in which more than $ 150k has been invested.  We have an address, you can come to us, we can have a tasty meal and meet personally with the founders of business in the real world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_p/g-/ly/_pg-lytdaueiff9o_w5li-vfqve.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Perfectionism.</b>  Sometimes it greatly interferes with work.  But we could not but study the examples that were presented to us as a portfolio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u-/kl/_k/u-kl_kwx2ryw-nicfkmos9z9nsc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the first time we spent a lot of personal time on communicating with representatives of various services, trying to convey the essence of the idea, the essence of the project, trying to interest, invite to the project, find like-minded people.  But, in the end, we began to reduce the dialogues to short correspondence, consisting of 3, 4 messages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0s/9n/ny/0s9nnyxsasak9rozjtvsl-lmyge.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  True?  :) <br><br>  Attempts to convey our position as the founders of the project and the approaches we use in business, our philosophy, at times, led to complements.  But, no more than that :) ‚ÄúFree‚Äù because no one wants to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/ki/9b/oeki9bis638zv9y3tpjv7syvzme.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  A good case in our life is the fact that over the years, we have repeatedly offered tasting sets to customers <b>for free</b> .  But only those <b>whom we have chosen</b> .  What are the principles?  Analyzing the prospects of cooperation with potential customers and taking risks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/k_/3z/jdk_3zn5kdjw6gvgixc0j-xtpbu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  And just do Alex, of course I will send.  You are a pleasant person, through your thoughts you can feel the soul that you invest in your products. </blockquote><br>  Frankly, this is the best comment I received from a person who wished to offer his services.  But, unfortunately, on this comment our communication ended.  And, of course, he did not send me anything. <br><br>  In addition to a large number of dialogs in telegrams, we spent our time parallel to studying other projects.  It was very disappointing to see projects whose goal was the banal collection.  So ended Milcoin.  So, most likely, will end the grain.  Examples of mass. <br><br>  Studying other projects, we even managed to find time to compile analytical reports of projects from the real sector (we were interested to study colleagues and ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù) in order to show microinvestors (people who want to buy altcoins) - what principles should be guided in studying projects what to look for.  Explain why you should not wait for the rise in the cost of the token and warn against projects in which the probability of losing your money is high.  Here is a reference to an example of one of these reports. <br><br>  A separate story will be devoted to the bounty of the company.  Looking ahead, I will say that we deliberately and convincingly canceled the bounty.  For which they were severely punished by the emotions of people who so wanted to get "free tokens". <br><br><blockquote>  Bro, why do we need a business?  Let's trade in brooms.  After all, they are used in every yard </blockquote><br>  <b>I do not want to trade brooms</b> and do not see any future in this.  Our business is complex, as are the components of projects, ideas, strategic plans, ambitions and the very sphere in which we operate.  We do not choose easy ways and do not expect instant results.  Step by step we move forward and develop organically. <br><br>  We will continue to search for like-minded people and partners.  People who will share our approach, philosophy and principles.  If you feel that our idea is close to you, I personally, with great pleasure, will answer all questions, criticism and comments. <br><br>  I hope this article will be useful to those who have not yet encountered the services in the preparation and conduct of ICO.  And also to those who decided to make money on the HYPE. <br><br>  PS HYIP around the blockchain and cryptocurrency makes the "housewives" think about buying one or another crypt.  In most cases, such actions will lead to the loss of their own money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349246/</a></p>
