      Today our guest is Andrei Shorin from <a href="https://hh.ru/">HeadHunter</a> .  A quarter of the day Andrei spends on self-education and training courses.  When he needs to rehearse a speech for a public speech, he pronounces the entire text to the music. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  Infrastructure: these are servers, external communication channels, switches, data center. <br><br>  The second is interaction with the development.  It is a process that affects the speed and reliability of the layout, deployment and, ultimately, the business. <br><br>  The third is resolution of incidents, because failures happen, you need to react, understand, fix ... Users will not wait for us. <br><br>  <b>One word (phrase) that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Integration. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  Intensive work - approximately 4 hours a day.  The rest is interruptions that cannot always be assessed.  And about one and a half to two hours a day is spent on self-development, training, courses. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  I want to sleep 8, but I wake up after 7 hours usually.  But I am working on it (smiles). <br><br>  <b>A lot of time goes on the road?</b> <br><br>  Maximum - 40 minutes if by car.  On foot - steadily 30 minutes. <br><br>  <b>What do you do at this time?</b> <br><br>  If I walk, I read.  I have a Yotaphone, it‚Äôs convenient to read books on the second screen.  If I go in the car, then I just think. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  This is MaxDone.  He was created by Maxim Dorofeev with his magnificent Jedi technique.  This allows you to clear the brain and make room for new creative thoughts. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager do you use / issue tracker / repository?</b> <br><br>  JIRA and wiki from Confluence.  Repository - GitHub. <br><br>  <b>What tools, frameworks do you use for development?</b> <br><br>  We bought a corporate account Slack.  Also use Ansible.  It is written on the layout.  For automated testing we use Jenkins. <br><br>  <b>Do you have any internal projects or libraries in your department and why were they created?</b> <br><br>  When we introduced Ansible, we had to seriously refine it, because it did not solve the questions that need to be.  Many commits were made in upstream.  It was the same with libCurl with c-ares and Tornado for Python.  The guys also sent their improvements to the upstream. <br><br>  All these improvements are now actively used in the company. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  Delays and expectations associated with stillness of thinking. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  Shchedrovitsky, "Organizational Thinking".  Back in Soviet times, when nuclear power plants were built, it was not easy to organize construction, logistics, and management.  He teaches that the object of the manager‚Äôs activity is the structure of the organization, not micromanagement. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Both.  On the road, I have a Yotaphone with e-ink.  Generally I like warm tube paper books.  Sometimes I read one book at the same time in two versions.  On the road from the phone I read, and then I go through the paper house and continue with it. <br><br>  <b>What technology (computers, tablets, smartphones) and operating systems do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  My wife and Android, including on the tablet.  At work Mac Book.  Home computer - Windows. <br><br>  <b>Do you listen to music when you work?</b> <br><br>  I listen when I get ready for a performance.  The rhythm of music helps me to build the rhythm of speech.  When I speak first to one music, and then to another, then during the performance this rhythm is preserved and helps maintain the mood of the audience. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  First, go to bed before midnight.  Secondly, in the morning do a 15-minute meditation.  It helps to collect thoughts in a single point. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can you do without in your work or in your personal life?</b> <br><br>  Evernote. <br><br>  <b>What would Andrei Shorin write 10 years ago in a letter to the future to himself?</b> <br><br>  I hope every minute when you work or rest, you are happy. <br><br>  <b>You have come a long way.</b>  <b>And someone is now at the beginning of this path.</b>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Choose the job from which you get high.  You spend at work a third of your life.  It will be with you always.  Try to love the work and the people around you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316690/</a></p>
