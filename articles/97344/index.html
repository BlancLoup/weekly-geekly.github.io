  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How will Russia respond to cyber attacks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The problem of cyber attacks in the world due to the difficult political situation is becoming increasingly widespread.  In the US, this is clearly understood, so they created cyber command - a special structure responsible for repelling computer attacks.  Around this fact a huge PR-bubble has already inflated.  Americans are struggling to shake public opinion around the problem of cyber attacks, taking on the nature of a natural disaster. <br><br>  According to the head of the American cyber command, Keith Alexander, Pentagon computers are under attack about 250,000 times an hour, more than 6 million times a day.  Most likely this is an exaggeration, but it gives the newly formed cyber command the right to rock the boat in its favor, so that the US Congress will allocate an additional budget to it for the formation and further work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is also necessary to globalize the problem in order to show the ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù again and once again show who is the boss on the planet.  For example, NATO experts, led by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, said that the States would respond to cyber threats with air strikes.  Then, however, they replayed and decided to use ‚Äúcyber diplomacy‚Äù, informing that they would discuss threats with Russia.  Everything is good.  There is something to discuss.  The case remains for small - with whom to discuss?

      Russia in this regard is completely unprotected and will never be able to adequately respond to cyber threats.  Who will do this?  As Andrei Masalovich, an expert on Internet security, once noted in his speech, ‚ÄúThe American special forces of the information war, that is, people who are fighting hacking, number 20,000 people from 11 special services.  There are fewer such specialists in Russia ‚Äù.  They are smaller, but they are.  But apparently, our government is not particularly interested in solving the problem of Internet threats. <br><br>  The same Masalovich gave a very adequate example (I quote): ‚Äúif you take an inventory of the threats that have been in recent years, then it becomes clear: it‚Äôs time to act.  Let's remember two or three of them.  So, 2000 - the virus "I love you" hit 10 percent of all computers in the world.  In 2001, the Nimda virus captured 22 million computers, and it took him 22 minutes to do it.  Despite the best efforts of services from different countries, mass attacks are still possible.  And here is just a recent example - the frequent attacks in connection with the "bust" in Kyrgyzstan.  It is possible that they were ordered (good cheap - 100 bucks for the attack) or disgraced President Bakiyev, or the same Americans who have their military bases in Kyrgyzstan, and they would not want to lose them, and under the new government it‚Äôs not very clear that with them will be. <br><br>  The CSTO paid attention to the problem, but nothing became.  And it still does not do it, although right now, when America is pumping huge funds into cyber command, Russia needs to create its own.  What does the president think when he says that in 2015 we will all live in the system of ‚Äúelectronic government‚Äù and watch digital TV, if the main problem is not solved - information security.  If the "neighbors" strike us, then no government will help, neither ordinary nor electronic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97344/</a></p>
