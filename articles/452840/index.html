  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VMware EMPOWER 2019 Conference: how was your first day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On May 20, VMware EMPOWER 2019 conference started in Lisbon.  The IT GRAD team is present at this event and broadcasts from the scene in the <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog">Telegram channel</a> .  Next is a report from the starting segment of the conference and a <b>contest for readers of our blog on Habr√©</b> . <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/452840/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yz/lw/61/yzlw61fphh3k3jcfireuriwicsc.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Products for users, not IT professionals </h2><br>  The main theme of the first day was the Digital Workspace segment - discussing the capabilities of an analytical digital work environment for clients of IaaS providers.  In particular, VMware experts talked about the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/352238/">Workspace ONE</a> platform.  This is a cloud service that analyzes company and application data. <br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúThe expectations of users from the work environment have completely changed the approach to the IT infrastructure, eroding the concepts of local network and corporate resources‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Networks of companies are becoming more complex - this trend is associated with the growth of the multi-cloud and hybrid infrastructure market, as well as the proliferation of mobile devices from which employees work remotely.  In VMware, they are heading for solving problems related to centralized administration and monitoring of geographically distributed infrastructure.  VMware will focus on usability and constant global availability of services.  It is an analysis of the expectations of employees of client companies that is stated as a key priority for the development of solutions in the Digital Workspace segment.

    <h2>  Intelligent solutions to help sysadmins </h2><br>  VMware is actively working on a product line for centralized management of hybrid infrastructure.  The company creates intelligent tools that automate the work with virtual machines, security policies and user profiles. <br><br>  VMware plans to use artificial intelligence systems to monitor infrastructure and route packets.  The IT giant will double the number of smart tools for administrators. <br><br>  The company pays special attention to the usability of intelligent systems: cross-platform development (including for mobile OS), reliable web services and protection of corporate data.  VMware seeks to optimize UX and UI: reduce the number of control panels, simplify work with licenses, accounts, certificates and encryption keys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/tf/og/fytfogzaphong7e-sptxmkihssq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/47400163%40N05/14970954801/">Media Evolution</a> CC BY-SA</i></font> <br><br><h2>  Information Security Time </h2><br>  With the development of IaaS, the number of attacks on virtual infrastructure has increased.  To counteract social engineering and attacks related to the interception of sessions, VMware develops solutions for active protection and authentication of clients. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚Äú <i>A system administrator or data protection specialist is always ready to limit the functionality of the system for the benefit of security.</i>  <i>Ordinary users, as a rule, perceive this topic very painfully and are not ready to sacrifice usability.</i>  <i>This behavior sometimes opens loopholes for intruders "</i> </blockquote><br>  VMware does everything to minimize user involvement in configuring devices and access policies to corporate resources.  At the same time, the requirements for working with multifactor authentication, user certificates and encryption keys are being tightened.  The concept of Zero-Trust Network is actively developing. <br><br>  Security products received such IT giant products as Horizon, Workspace ONE Enterprise Management Platform, Cloud Access Control Platform, VMware Identity Manager, Horizon vRealize, AirWatch, and many others. <br><br><h2>  The end of the NSX-V era </h2><br>  Not spared and network technology.  Special attention was paid to intelligent traffic routing in the context of unstable WAN connections and packet protection during data exchange between data centers. <br><br>  High hopes in this regard are placed on the VMware SD-WAN solution.  The system automates the management of user devices and makes business processes more transparent.  For example, using SD-WAN, you can extend the same security policies to different cloud environments. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúMigrating a data center from NSX-V to NSX-T without downtime is easier than it might seem‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  We talked about a smooth transition from VMware NSX-V to NSX-T.  Network virtualization with VMware NSX-T opens up new opportunities for multi-cloud and hybrid environments.  The NSX-T platform is not tied to vCenter / vSphere, which allows it to be used as a standalone solution for various types of infrastructure.  Moreover, now virtual networks built on the VMware NSX platform are compatible with third-party hypervisors. <br><br>  The IT giant has significantly changed the packet encapsulation method.  Replaced the NSX-V VXLAN came the Geneve protocol, which does not have backward compatibility.  For this reason, many VMware clients are postponing the transition to NSX-T.  However, representatives of VMware claim that the migration can be performed with a network unavailable for no more than three minutes.  How to do this, we will tell in one of the subsequent habratopikov. <br><br>  The first day of the conference turned out to be very rich and informative.  But the most interesting - practical sessions, demostands and lectures for cloud providers are still ahead.  "IT-GRAD" will take an active part in all major events, <a href="https://t.me/iaasblog/223">fresh posts are already coming out</a> in our Telegram-channel. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>If you have questions that you would like to ask VMware techlides, write them in the comments.</i>  <i>We will ask the best of them to the representatives of the company at the conference and give answers in one of the subsequent posts.</i>  <i>From among the authors of the questions with the greatest number of pluses (in the comments), we will choose a habrazhitel to whom we will present a thematic T-shirt.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Of course, the question should be related to the areas discussed at the conference.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Posts from the Telegram channel with VMware EMPOWER 2019 news:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/220">About migrating a data center from NSX-V to NSX-T</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/223">Self-driven Data Center - hot topic</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/216">How are things with Workspace ONE</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/452840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/452840/</a></p>
