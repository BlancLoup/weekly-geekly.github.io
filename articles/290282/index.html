    <h5>  So, first, about the benefits of being the only girl in the men's team of future IT people </h5><br>  Well, first of all, March 8th.  I remember, in the first year, the guys took off and gave me a mobile phone.  It was very cool!  My first phone.  I was extremely happy. <br><br>  In general, there is always some concern in the men's team.  Everyone wants to help, opens doors for you, gives a hand at the exit of the tram, invites you for a walk, gives way.  Well, what girl would not like it? <br><br>  Anticipating the questions of many, I will say that on February 23rd I also relate to pluses.  I have always been prepared very carefully.  After all, it was necessary to come up with something unusual, pleasant for everyone and at the same time the student budget did not allow to turn around.  In the first year I ordered a big cake on which congratulations were written to the group mates.  I agreed with the dean about allocating the audience, bought disposable dishes, juices and we sat very well. <br><br><h5>  Of course there are downsides </h5><br>  By cons, you just need to get used to.  I was always annoyed by the condescension with which some of the teachers treated me.  In most cases, everything was ok, but some instances who considered that ‚Äúthis is not a woman‚Äôs business,‚Äù were met.  No, they did not underestimate the grade, did not fill up on exams.  They just treated somehow condescendingly.  And bringing ‚Äúexel‚Äù in the record book, they did it with the following look: ‚ÄúThis is my present to you‚Äù. <br><br>  Now I understand that it was necessary just not to pay attention.  I didn‚Äôt have any particular problems with the performance and digestibility of the material.  Without undue modesty, I would say that I studied best of all in the group.  But I think many would agree that theory is not a practice.  And with the theory, girls, due to their more diligent attitude to learning, usually have fewer problems. <br><br><h4>  First job </h4><br>  After the third course I realized that I needed practice.  Despite the 3 years of study, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtheir future specialty was more than vague.  Assembling and disassembling your computer and pulling the network in a hostel was clearly not enough.  I looked through all the job ads and I was interested in the position of systems engineering in the company Thunder.  Spent on writing a resume all day. <br><br>  I remember that they called me back almost immediately and invited me the next day for an interview.  In the corridor, there were 5 more people waiting for their turn. All guys.  They looked at the girl in a sundress and heels for the position of systems engineering with interest. <br><br>  When I was invited, I took a smart and proud look, but it was scary at the same time was unreal. <br><br>  A young guy waited in the office (about 5-8 years older than me), he was just a senior systems technician, and the girl was a personnel manager.  I think the guy was more worried about me. <br><br>  - Did you collect your own computer? <br>  - Yes (I‚Äôm lying; in fact, we talked to the general conversation for a week, choosing my first computer). <br>  - And what is the motherboard? <br>  - Asus P4P800 SE Gold (remember how it is now). <br>  - And do you know how to crimp a twisted pair? <br>  - Yes (I‚Äôm not lying here, I‚Äôve been trained). <br>  - And what is the order of colors? <br>  - White-orange, orange (ooh, now I don‚Äôt even remember. And then, before the interview, he wondered by heart). <br><br>  In general, in this vein passed the interview.  At the end, they said that they would call me back and report the results.  I went home.  After 40 minutes I get out of the tram and the phone rings. <br><br>  - Hello? <br>  - Hello, my name is Andrew.  I'm from Thunder.  I would like to talk with you.  Can you drive up? <br>  - Can!  I'll be there in an hour! <br><br>  15 000 rubles!  I was offered 15,000 rubles!  To be honest, my mother then earned less.  And the post of technical support specialist in the main building of the company.  It was very, very, very cool. <br><br>  For the position of systems engineering took someone else.  As it turned out, I got the job more abruptly.  The essence of the work was the remote installation of updates, tracking errors and attempts to eliminate these errors together with the testing department. <br><br>  I constantly kosyachila, did not understand much, but I tried my best.  Later, I was entrusted with a super responsible business: remotely changing firmware on wi-fi routers and setting them up.  It was very interesting. <br><br>  My then boss is a terrific manager.  I do not understand how he had enough patience to mess with me.  On other employees, he could break, shout.  Apparently, education didn‚Äôt allow me to shout. <br><br>  Once I come to work in the morning with high spirits.  And he sits and looks at me so gloomy.  The look is so expressive that the hands immediately began to shake. <br><br>  - What? <br>  - Did you rewrite the router yesterday? <br>  - Well yes. <br>  - Did you click the Save button after setting? <br>  - Probably ... I do not remember. <br>  - Sleep well? <br>  - Mmm?  Yep <br>  - But I've been restoring wi-fi all night. <br><br>  Bliiin ... How embarrassing it was.  It's a shame.  Wow!  She turned to the monitor, her hands tremble, tears in her eyes.  I didn‚Äôt dole anymore. <br><br>  And here is another case from the series ‚Äúthe difference between women's work and men's work‚Äù.  On the table the disassembled sistemnik, I dig in it standing (I do not remember what I did).  The office is suspiciously quiet, but I don‚Äôt pay attention to it, I do my own business. <br><br>  I collected the computer, turn it on, check the mail. <br><br>  I see a letter "without a theme" from the director of the department.  Oh, something, apparently important.  I open it, I remember the text almost verbatim: ‚ÄúAnya, try not to wear such short sundresses.  And then the guys do not work for half a day, they are watching you. ‚Äù <br><br>  I turn around, everyone has happy faces, smiling.  And I'm ashamed terribly.  I remember upset then.  I thought even to quit, so it hurt me.  Now I remember this case with a smile, I understand that no one tried to offend or humiliate me somehow.  On the contrary, a kind compliment was made. <br><br>  I generally recall with warmth and a smile those 4 months of work in Thunder.  But everything comes to an end.  The study began, it was impossible to agree with the dean's office.  Working half a day, I obviously could not cope.  You will come to work, you will do a couple of things and it's time to run to study.  Therefore, I was constantly embarrassed, it seemed to me that everyone around me felt that I was taking advantage of the position of my boss (I have such a fad) and do not do anything.  So I quit.  They let me go with the words: ‚ÄúConsider that you take a long vacation.  We are waiting for you back. " <br><br>  And I returned a year later. <br><br><h4>  The beginning of a professional career </h4><br>  I returned to the department of information security, which was just then formed.  In fact, we built the department from scratch, 3 specialists and the head.  I worked in the office with my former colleagues, so I quickly joined the team. <br><br>  During the work was a lot of good and bad.  Of course, there are certain differences in the work of a guy and a girl. <br>  When a new equipment arrives that needs to be tested and configured, most often I can connect it myself, rearrange where needed. <br>  But, bearing in mind the case with a sundress, I try not to distract the whole office from work, crawling under the table.  Now I ask someone from colleagues to help.  By the way, I always thought that guys help with the hunt.  And by the way, this is another advantage in that you are a girl in the IT sphere.  If something is not clear, one has only to ask - and everyone will eagerly help, explain, prompt.  This is also a familiar feeling of caring that you experience when you study in the men's team. <br><br>  In the post I mentioned above, Vika posted a photo of a set of women's shoes.  I have a slightly different situation.  One replaceable pair is enough.  But if you look into the drawer of the bedside table, then immediately it is clear that a girl works here.  Hand cream, nail file and cosmetic bag are simply indispensable attributes. <br><br>  During my work in the department of information security, I managed to finish university and get a great experience.  I quit after 1.5 years.  There were several reasons, but the main one is a new colleague.  From the same series as teachers at the university, who believe that a woman in IT does not belong.  It became hard for me to work in such an atmosphere, and then an interesting position turned up - an information security specialist in the field of personal data.  By that time, for about six months I was fascinated by the topic of personal data protection and decided to try myself in this area. <br><br><h4>  Work in the public sector </h4><br>  Work in the public sector is AD.  The reasons are many, ranging from low wages and ending with a walk. <br>  In total, the organization employed about 50 people, of whom in the IT department there are 10 people. All those who are not in the IT department are women, who even in 30 years insist on being called by their patronymic name. <br><br>  I first got into the predominantly female team in my life and experienced all its charms.  But I had a very interesting task - to develop uniform rules for the processing of personal data for the regional medical institutions.  Starting from the papers and ending with the setting of the equipment.  I lost my head and did not notice how nearly a year had passed. <br><br>  Then another disappointment came - the stage of implementation.  There is no funding, the specialists are just zero.  I constantly conducted training seminars, went on business trips, wrote recommendations on how and what to set up.  But the "dullness and bitchiness" of the atmosphere oppressed more and more. <br><br>  Then I was offered to make a very big project for the protection of personal data in the network of car dealerships.  I agreed, 2 months worked for wear, finished the project.  At the same time, she earned a little more than her annual salary and realized that I could retire with a calm conscience. <br>  By that time, my husband had already opened his own company a half.  I rested a month and joined him.  I have been an entrepreneur for 3.5 years now.  Completely changed the scope of activities, which I absolutely do not regret.  We do internet marketing. <br><br>  Well, colleagues are in a hurry, it's time to wrap up.  Just today we celebrate 5 years from the date of formation of the company. <br><br>  PS read the sequel: <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/234751/">Family business in IT</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/235497/">Family business in the field of IT.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/235497/">My three golden rules</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/237205/">Family business in the field of IT.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/237205/">Time making money</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/238041/">Family business in the field of IT.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/238041/">Who is Energoslon?</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290282/</a></p>
