I see surprised faces.  Yes, it also seemed to me that this question is irrelevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b40/2a1/ce4/b402a1ce4dbfcbe126a44bc4db2b0fe5.jpg"><br><br>  But statistics show: any irritant that diverts work, takes <strong>from 3 to 10 minutes of working time</strong> .  If you are working on a mockup, you answer something in icq, the attention is scattered and in order to get back to work, you need some time.

      And having 5-10 such irritants by hand, we can lose up to a couple of hours a day to irrelevant matters.  So, how can we not be distracted while working? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h2>  Mail and icq </h2><br>  It seems to us that by responding to the time from meeting friends in ICQ, we do not lose time.  In fact, every potential slacker from the list of contacts, which also throws references to the <strong>photo in the contact</strong> or cool videos <strong>from YouTube</strong> , will make your time. <br><br>  An analogous situation with the mail: in TheBat settings, I indicated that the mail was checked every 10 minutes.  Now imagine: every time one or two letters arrive (notice from a lj, comment in a blog, newsletter and more).  All this makes you move away from the bottom line and see the letters, delete unnecessary ones, reply to important ones, etc. <br><br>  How to deal with this?  For myself, I found a very simple solution: I installed a scanner <strong>every 60 minutes</strong> , and in the icq I created a visible list, and only people in it have the right to disturb me.  In critical moments, the icq (as well as the mailbox) is turned off. <br><br><h2>  Surfing </h2><br>  I don‚Äôt know how now, but at the time of my youth surfing was called a trip to the sites.  Sometimes sensible, and more often - thoughtless.  I opened one site, with some went to the other and went back.  It turned out - not the plaster of course, but it was not an hour of time.  Sign up?  <strong>Me too</strong> <br><br>  How to deal with this?  Particularly responsible residents already, I think, have decided this question for themselves - the attendance of entertainment sites during the working hours simply did not work.  But what to do, if you refuse a second-grader, a rutub, a little lady and a teeter <strong>zeez</strong> ? <br><br>  For users of firefox there is a different solution - add-on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/uk/firefox/addon/4476">LeechBlock</a> , which can <strong>not allow the</strong> browser to the specified sites at the right time.  It is easy to turn it off, but I will try to say that it helps to focus on the work. <br><br><h2>  Surrounding </h2><br>  In two hours of work in peace and tranquility, you can have time to do <strong>more</strong> than 6 hours when you do and do.  But nevertheless, there is a cat / dog, a boy / girl, children (shuffle), who <strong>constantly</strong> want to put their nose in the monitor, invite them to drink tea, watch TV or go to the store. <br><br>  If the ball invites you to go for purchases, here I can‚Äôt help anything, and with other things you can do it quite simply: get yourself a working place in a room <strong>with a door</strong> , you can lock it for a while. <br><br>  If noise interferes, wear headphones for a while.  And it is not obligatory to play bilan there, the equipment still got to us and we can listen to the radio.  For example, I love the radio beacon.  <strong>And you?</strong> <br><blockquote>  Choose something in the soul can be from here: <br>  <a href="http://audio.rambler.ru/radio.html">Rambler-Audio</a> <br>  <a href="http://moskva.fm/">Moskva.fm</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  Telefon </h2><br>  It is not for nothing that some people call it the scourge of modern society, because with a mobile in your pocket everyone can reach you <strong>at any time of day</strong> and at any place. <br><br>  I think that someone will be surprised, but during the day you <strong>can turn off the phone</strong> or at least put it on the silent mode and check the sent messages every 2-3 hours and answer ‚ÄúI the same to you‚Äù on sms to 5 different subscribers. <br><br>  Again, judging by myself - turning off the phone <strong>saves</strong> me a lot of time.  Need to?  Write by mail or in icq.  Do not need?  So why call. <br><blockquote>  A small <strong>offtopic</strong> : the way the Bolsheviks said so much, they proved.  Mobile phone is really <strong>harmful to health</strong> , especially for male joys (the phone is often carried in a pocket of his pants) and brain (at the time of the rant). <br><br>  And the younger the body, the more powerful the effect of radiation on non-radiation.  Let me rely on my work experience in one of the mobile surgeons. </blockquote><br><h2>  Music </h2><br>  Some people can not work without a player, others are more comfortable working <strong>in silence</strong> .  I will cope with the second, because  in the time of work, any sounds <strong>disturb</strong> me, so that silence is itself. <br><br>  The only thing I can say according to this: in the morning, the lively music helps to relax, but it is better to work without it.  By evening, turn on the switch, but <strong>something more convenient</strong> .  Such a scheme will more likely fit the majority of people. <br><blockquote>  On the question of ‚ÄúWhat for example?‚Äù, I can offer mixes of our well-known <a href="">Dj Hemul</a> .  Relaxes and does not interfere with work. </blockquote><br><h2>  Smoke breaks </h2><br>  <strong>Stop smoking</strong> if you haven't done it yet.  And if you cannot, do not justify yourself by saying that smoking relaxes you.  Until they prove to me that this can calm, <strong>I will not believe it</strong> . <br><br>  Together with a smoke break it is better to do exercises, drink tea, or count a white blouse in red behind a window. <br><br>  Contrary to the smoke breaks the following is said: they <strong>do not</strong> usually <strong>go</strong> for a smoke break.  Who offers one, the rest agree and go together to breathe smoke and half a thousand thousands of chemical compounds and resin.  In this case, everyone is disconnected from some business, which does not contribute to a concentration on work. <br><br>  If it is necessary, then go to smoke breaks or rest whenever possible, when some part of the work is already done and you can move away. <br><br>  I am guided by these rules in order not to distract from important matters.  <strong>I want to hear your comments on this topic.</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43168/</a></p>
