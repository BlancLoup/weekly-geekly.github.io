      <font>The biggest disadvantage of Windows as a mobile platform: it is formed by itself, it is a PC operating system.</font>  <font>This means that most applications are installed on the computer and run on it.</font>  <font>Programs that would be used exclusively on a portable device without access to the Internet, units.</font>  <font>In fact, all the power and performance of the "windows" is wasted.</font>  <font>The second drawback: all programs that run on a specific device, they require resources specifically from this device.</font>  <font>There is no small application to access the service, where the entire service is online.</font> <br><br>  <font>Third: for Windows, you can make a program that will work with the network, but for a successful and long life it must be developed.</font>  <font>Must undergo a localization process, and it can be delayed.</font>  <font>So that users can flexibly customize this program for themselves, regardless of where they are located.</font>  <font>And these everyday things that a person needs every day - to see, buy, pay - in each place are different.</font>  <font>All of these services must be very flexible.</font>  <font>To be able to realize all this, the program must be open in order for anyone to rewrite it, add to it, or make a review about it, test it.</font>  <font>The function of the head office is to filter all these requests, select the best and constantly improve the application.</font>  <font>Such a community is a constantly working collective mind, this is one and a half million people who every day, not for a moment, stop, do something with it, constantly improve it.</font>  <font>In Windows, there is no such thing as an OS, it has a closed code, since it is the intellectual property of Microsoft.</font>  <font>The basis of Windows itself today is the office, and Windows itself is just a platform on which this office can be launched.</font>  <font>And in principle, people take it for work.</font>  <font>Here we have, on the one hand, good programmers, on the other - a million people.</font>  <font>A good programmer has started the program and thinks about how to improve it.</font>  <font>And Google launched the idea ‚Äúto the masses‚Äù - and in a month everything improved and refined returned to it.</font>  <font>Of course, Google has a huge staff of testers, but it receives so many volunteer testers, no one can compare with this number.</font>  <font>And this is not only people, the community includes various companies - HTC, Sony, Asus, Samsung, which develop and, under the terms of the license, spread and give out all their improvements, everything new, that they have worked out.</font>  <font>Even if they released a very good, but ‚Äútheir‚Äù product, it is naked - it's just a good program that works on a particular phone.</font>  <font>Behind him there is no loop of changes for the better, there is no community.</font>  <font>The same applies to cloud technologies, closed services with self-limitation in development, on the one hand, and on the other hand, Android - a homogeneous platform open to all changes - this is the main guarantee of the "eternal" development of Android.</font> <br><br>  <font>Many will say that there is Windows 7. But does it have perspective on mobile devices today?</font>  <font>Hardly ever.</font>  <font>Of course, an alternative system may be running, it will be called Windows, but it will have nothing to do with the desktop Windows that we have now.</font>  <font>Do users need a third mobile operating system?</font>  <font>We saw a great example - SymbianOS, which was perfectly adapted for mobile phones, much better than Windows - on Nokia.</font>  <font>And where is Symbian now?</font>  <font>Is it possible to say that she has prospects?</font>  <font>In my opinion, if a third operating system for mobile devices appears, it can cause curiosity only among geeks, and no more.</font> <br><br>  <i><font>Chinese Chinese discord</font></i> <br><br>  <font>Also an ambiguous topic.</font>  <font>But again, I venture to say - the main problem of Chinese goods is that they are not adapted.</font>  <font>There is no Google in China, so Android, which is tied to Google Service, almost loses its meaning.</font>  <font>If Gugloservisy, such as Picasso or Yutoub, are disabled, then the tablet is not a suitable toy for real tasks.</font>  <font>For some geek "to look."</font>  <font>And all the options with flashing are always risky, no matter what anyone says.</font>  <font>Although we cannot order in-depth development, we do not have our own production for semiconductors, we do not write our programs, but we can adapt them, make something that works normally in our market.</font>  <font>Our devices are maximally adapted to the domestic user.</font>  <font>In addition, around the Raccoon is already formed some kind of community - the people who twist it, write not just reviews, but help to improve it.</font>  <font>Well, for example, people are already looking to have a genuine Raccoon, and again, Raccoons, with a deficit, sell for a hundred dollars more than they did in online stores.</font>  <font>This is an indication that we were not mistaken in our decisions.</font> <br><br>  <i><font>A few words about the new model Raccoon 131</font></i> <br><br>  <font>In this article, the mini-presentation of the new tablet model is Raccoon 131. The model continues the concept of the model 121. Tablet 131 is a relatively inexpensive tablet, has the fastest single-core processor, and maximum sharpness for the Internet and reading.</font>  <font>The 121st model is more versatile and cheaper, the 131st is more specialized.</font>  <font>What are the differences?</font>  <font>The first - on Raccoon 131 screen with a resolution of 1024x768, which gives an increase in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe visible part of the screen almost doubled.</font>  <font>In a word Raccoon 131 - more imprisoned for multimedia.</font> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34d/13a/0b8/34d13a0b8678d1cbd04496871e5d7d11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <font>Second: 4: 3 aspect ratio, so this model is much better for reading and for surfing the Internet.</font>  <font>This ratio makes it possible to almost completely place the page without scrolling.</font> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bc/d36/e55/4bcd36e55521c08eb7ac9470f4ef8378.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <font>Third: on the 131st model, a full USB connector.</font>  <font>We did not install the built-in USB-modem, because then the model is very expensive - almost $ 100.</font>  <font>And this model continues the line of the 121's ‚Äî relatively inexpensive affordable models ‚Äúfor home and family‚Äù, so they simply made a full-fledged USB so that they could optionally connect a modem, and do it simply, without any adapters or laces.</font>  <font>The model supports all modems that we have declared on the market.</font> <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12f/6d5/c7c/12f6d5c7ce6c0518dd79ac4d845cf26b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><font>A few words about the processor: why not two cores?</font></i> <br><br>  <font>In Raccoon 131 - a new 2918 Rock Chip processor, plus a graphics co-processor with 512 KB of cache.</font>  <font>Today (and forever, because single-core processors are already leaving) is probably the fastest single-core processor.</font>  <font>Its level is approximately equal to Tegra-1 in terms of characteristics, but at the same time, it is much cheaper.</font>  <font>This is the maximum that can be squeezed out of inexpensive single-core processors.</font>  <font>But, actually, why single-core?</font>  <font>There is a wonderful Tegra2?</font>  <font>Of course, but there are nuances that lie in architecture.</font>  <font>Not that, of course, which helps to create wonderful buildings, but in the processor building.</font>  <font>As we all know the RISC architecture, this is a processor architecture with a simplified instruction set.</font>  <font>This allows you to make pipelines in RISC much more efficient and allows you to raise the clock frequency.</font>  <font>Here it is, Hurray!</font>  <font>Tegra 2 taxis, but in this barrel of honey, there is one tarry spoon that is not visible to the simple consumer.</font>  <font>If everything is simplified, in architecture x 86, at the kernel level, the decision is made as a program to scatter.</font>  <font>Moreover, the decision that is made is not a constant for a decision that is made in a parallel stream.</font>  <font>That is, these are absolutely parallel computations that do not touch each other and allow you to run several applications simultaneously.</font>  <font>In addition, with the same success tasks can be connected.</font>  <font>Of course, this requires significant resources and energy, but makes the architecture much more versatile.</font>  <font>RISC - this is a shortened command sequential, one team comes after another.</font>  <font>We must either make a program in which to indicate that these commands are here, on this core, and these are on this.</font>  <font>Or then just all the commands go one core.</font>  <font>Then the frequency of a dual-core processor will be equal to the frequency of a single core, and it will work as a single-core processor.</font>  <font>It will be just a single-core processor with a frequency of 1 GHz in a standard, not adapted for 2 cores, application.</font>  <font>If there are no special applications, such as, for example, on NDIDIA Tegra, it means, other things being equal, it will consume more power, it will cost much more and work more slowly than a good single-core processor.</font>  <font>That is, today dual-core processors without infrastructure, without good cheap games and without programs written for two cores are useless.</font>  <font>Two cores are an advance.</font>  <font>In addition, a game or program written in Tegru will not necessarily go to processors from other manufacturers, and therefore the costs of its development will not pay off.</font>  <font>So, we will wait for a universal platform, and while we don‚Äôt want to make tablets in advance, we are doing things today and now.</font>  <font>And today and now - this is the minimum price, the highest quality and maximum performance that can be squeezed out of an inexpensive model.</font>  <font>This is a real maximum, this model can be compared with any model.</font>  <font>Since this is my personal point of view, I am quite categorically, I can state the following, in terms of price-quality ratio - this is the best model on the market.</font>  <font>It will be only 20-30 dollars more expensive than the 121st, that is, it will invest in the same price limits.</font>  <font>I also forgot to mention the important thing - the Raccoon 131 tablet has two cameras.</font> <br><br>  <font>P.S.</font>  <font>Not to be unfounded, with regard to what, they say, "there are no analogues."</font>  <font>In the hotline, he scored the characteristics of Raccoon 131 - only 1 Chinese nouneym fell out, so it was not for nothing that such a tablet was made: <a href="http://hotline.ua/computer/planshety/17134-17147-17175/">http://hotline.ua/computer/planshety/17134-17147-17175/</a></font> <br><br>  <i><font>Well, here are my thoughts on OSes, processors and a mini-presentation of a new model in one bottle.</font></i>  <i><font>If you have questions I will answer in the comments.</font></i> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service -
