      Many words have been said that the number of Mac users is constantly growing, but it is important to look not at the numbers, but at the products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ed480f8f/22ddf050/f624943d/e031ec69.png"><br>  A new version of the package iLife - iLife'11 <br><br><h2>  iPhoto </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bc1bde34/850a4c5f/8e157a2c/219a50d5.png"><br>  IPhoto added full-screen viewing mode, integration with Facebook, new beautiful slideshow modes (some of them are almost video clips), a new selection of books for printing, postcards.  Increased application performance.  Improved integration with maps, the slide show can now beautifully show the places where the photos were taken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/43eb410a/4d47bbcc/edf77202/05a6360f.png"><br>  You can now select several photos and send them by mail as a postcard (there are several templates to choose from). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dbfc03b6/9279e133/ed820f6f/c2f0d1b6.png"><br>  Integration with social networks has been done - a list is now displayed in a separate panel - you sent a photo to facebook / twitter, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9106b6e3/b010316d/c9a8ee1c/51542b06.png"><br>  Photos can be beautifully organized into albums; all projects for organizing photos are beautifully displayed by analogy with the iBook application for iPhone / iPad.  As before - created albums can be printed.  Postcards can now also be sent to print. <br><br><h2>  iMovie </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/76d0291b/68589b29/27e8c96d/5e4cdd73.png"><br>  In iMovie added the ability to edit audio, search for people marked in the video, the ability to make trailers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d45ecf1e/67aa4173/7983b2b5/b98eb7be.png"><br>  The sound level in Video can now be adjusted.  For sound, a graph is displayed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/cd642d8e/7e5b0ca8/35dc3fb9/58725fa0.png"><br>  For audio processing added various audio effects. <br><br>  Also added are the so-called ‚Äúone click effects‚Äù - effects that can be applied to a selected video fragment in 1 click, for example, slowing down a fragment, or making a flash at a certain place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b8d827c7/66768027/f38fffad/5614bddd.png"><br>  The trailer creation mode allows you to create trailers from templates - enter ‚Äúcaptions‚Äù, add a studio logo.  For the trailer creation mode, the London symphony orchestra specially recorded sound effects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/aacb8b88/a88a0628/23146a1b/145ecb27.png"><br>  The mode allows you to select a fragment of a video for a specific template markup and assign it to a template scene.  As a result, you will get a video trailer already mounted from your frames.  The result, demonstrated from the big screen, is impressive.  Included are several ready-made templates for trailers of different genres. <br><br><h2>  GarageBand </h2><br><br>  In the new GarageBand added new guitar effects and "kombik." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f56cf77e/a4052241/9766e5f2/550ebfb8.png"><br>  Added new audio editing features - you can adjust the rhythm of the drums and the rhythm of the guitar (and other instruments) - this feature is called Groove Matching <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/be7adb12/56b6013e/2d0107fb/d6444e67.png"><br>  The new Flex Time feature allows you to "smartly" increase or decrease the time of the audio fragment <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f405bd19/70c018b9/0a0de246/2e0d65aa.png"><br>  Instrument lessons have been improved - piano lessons are shown step by step - where to press, as well as notes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ac81f4fc/739c480a/539f16b2/47677666.png"><br>  GarageBand shows you in real time how well you play the lesson. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/309c4f28/cef897e1/9fde878a/c7dac016.png"><br>  GarageBand also keeps a history of your classes and shows you how your skills improved. <br><br>  <b>iLife</b> : will cost 49 dollars.  On sale today.  With the new "Poppies" will traditionally be delivered free of charge. <br><br><h2>  Facetime </h2><br><br>  The FaceTime video feature introduced in June on the iPhone 4, and later on the iPod Touch 4G, now has 19 million users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8ca2053f/d1b06441/826d9ad5/2e023bc2.png"><br>  Now you can use FaceTime from a Mac.  There is a full screen mode.  Looks like Apple has released a rival Skype on the Mac platform.  With a Mac, you can call someone on the iPhone, and back.  The application automatically receives information from the interlocutor‚Äôs device if it has turned the phone to a horizontal position. <br><br>  FaceTime for Mac will be available today on the Apple website. <br><br><h2>  Mac os x lion </h2><br><br>  Over the past decade, there have been 7 major releases of Mac OS.  Today is the 8th version of Mac OS X - Mac OS Lion. <br><br>  Philosophy - in the image of Mac OS, iOS was created for the iPhone, then the iPad appeared, and now the iPad has to meet with the Mac - therefore the name of the conference is Back to Mac. <br><br>  Some ideas from mobile devices are now moving to Mac. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c3c1fee7/266a9a6b/47568c9c/597c20a5.png"><br>  Apple is opening the Mac App Store. <br>  It looks very similar to the App Store for iOS.  The principles are the same - download in 1 click, update in 1 click.  All by analogy.  Programs from iLife are available in the App Store for Mac.  Installation is simple - just transfer the application from the App Store to the Dock and it is installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/37da86ec/54430724/9b8d482e/0b206d56.png"><br>  Programs are now organized in LaunchPad - an analogue of several screens in iOS.  You can also, by analogy with iOS, organize applications into folders by dragging and dropping. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9f563b3d/2572bbf9/27fa6017/9600f497.png"><br>  New feature - Full Screen Mode for applications, for example, to read PDF, you can open the full-screen mode ... To switch between applications, it is not necessary to exit full-screen mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dee70a51/8fab8dfd/0ca70501/3f174ac3.png"><br>  Dashboard, Expose, Spaces are organized into one feature called Mission Controll.  It allows you to conveniently switch between application windows. <br><br>  <b>Release Mac OS Lion</b> - Summer 2011. Announced more than half a year. <br><br>  Mac App Store promise for 90 days for Snow Leopard.  Developers already have access to some information on the Mac App Store on the Apple website. <br><br><h2>  Macbook air </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0f89e2bb/8b339a5f/b900a17b/639f4548.png"><br>  A mix of MacBook and iPad - the new MacBook Air. <br><br>  Thickness - 1.7 cm, in the thinnest place 0.3 cm. Thin, small.  Weight - 1.06 kg <br><br>  Body - one-piece aluminum construction <br>  13.3 inches screen, resolution 1440x900 pixels, Core 2 Duo in the heart, NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics card, full-size keyboard, multi-touch, FaceTime camera. <br><br>  No CD / DVD drive.

Core 2 Duo inside, video card - like the older brother - NVIDIA GeForce 320M. <br><br>  The differences in the battery - 2 hours less work when surfing the Internet (such a measure from Apple).  Waiting time is the same - 30 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/adbce61d/a984f3c4/3f037551/ec8d3435.png"><br>  Prices. <br><br>  Home sales today.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/specs.html">Specifications</a> on the Apple site. <br><br>  These are the updates from Apple. <br><br>  PS <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/lasthero/" class="user_link">lasthero</a> kindly suggested a link to FaceTime for Mac: <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/facetime/">www.apple.com/mac/facetime</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/106542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/106542/</a></p>
