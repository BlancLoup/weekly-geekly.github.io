Or how (and why) we launched our <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">delivery service</a> .  And some life hacking on the transportation of parcels from the US to Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02e/432/785/02e432785b584823abc5b488bfc8d2c8.JPG"><br><br>  Anyone can buy in the USA.  Even if the store does not accept Russian cards or bills, there are always workarounds.  Problems begin at the stage of delivery of goods from the store to the end customer.  It is here (by and large, it is here) that a mediator is needed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Need better and cheaper </h3><br>  Each forwarder has several problems associated with the transportation of goods:

    <ol><li>  cost reduction; </li><li>  reduction of travel time; </li><li>  reduction of customs clearance; </li></ol><br>  While in the weekly turnover of 50-200 parcels, the mediator is strictly tied to the existing market conditions.  And it works according to the rules for individuals.  That is, if a company cannot assemble a container, its main advantage over the buyer is the physical location in the country where the purchase is made.  And the main possibility of reducing costs for the buyer is the collection and repacking of parcels in a common container. <br><br>  Working in such conditions, taking into account the quality of the Russian post office, reminds of a small branch of hell.  It is virtually impossible to control parcels from arriving in Russia, and right up to the receipt. All the tags are given by the valiant post in fact, sometimes with considerable delays.  Exit - own collection, shipping and customs clearance. <br><br>  As soon as we started receiving several hundred orders, it made sense to open our own delivery service.  This is how ‚ÄúMail Express‚Äù appeared - our proprietary method of delivery from the USA to Russia.  Parcels sent by Express Mail are collected weekly in a warehouse on pallets and shipped to New York for customs clearance.  After verification, they are sent by direct flight New York ‚Üí Moscow.  At the airport, they are received by our Boxberry colleagues for delivery to you. <br><br><h3>  Differences "Mail Express" from other types of delivery </h3><br><h4>  Pros: </h4><br><ol><li>  control of delivery costs; </li><li>  full control over the course of each parcel; </li><li>  control over customs clearance; </li><li>  the possibility of a timely response at each stage of delivery. </li></ol><br>  If suddenly the parcel was wrapped in customs, or if the conditions for the passage of cargo suddenly changed (for example, as it was several times with batteries). <br><br><h3>  Logistics "Mail Express" - transparency and control </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e9/20a/c97/4e920ac978ca4bc8ab9896dd701294d7.JPG"><br><br>  Delivery is carried out without the participation of the Post of Russia - only <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> and Boxberry.  Thus, not only the number of intermediaries decreases, but also the number of real workers involved in the process.  The number of delivery stages is also reduced.  If ordinary postal services can change the logistics, or use complex routes, then the ‚ÄúExpress Mail‚Äù is simple and straightforward.  For 7-14 days, the cargo has time to go through all the stages, which are located only in 4 geographical points: <br><br><ol><li>  parcel from the store came to the warehouse; </li><li>  the package is combined with other packages of the buyer and is packed; </li><li>  the parcel is combined with other parcels; </li><li>  parcel loaded on a known pallet; </li><li>  the pallet is shipped from the warehouse to the customs at the airport in New York; </li><li>  the pallet is unloaded in Moscow; </li><li>  the pallet is cleared and entered the Boxberry warehouse for delivery to the end customer (4-7 days from the time the package was received at the warehouse); </li><li>  receipt of the parcel by the client. </li></ol><br>  We ship this service once a week, every Tuesday at 9:00 stock time.  You can get the package in two ways: <br><br>  "Mail Express" - delivery by courier to the door. <br>  "Express Lite Mail" - delivery to the point of issue of orders (with the possibility of selecting the nearest point of the EOF). <br><br><h3>  Delivery rules "Mail Express" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d2/284/692/9d2284692ff644b7b27c577f4d9200c4.JPG"><br><h4>  Weight not more than 31 kg, maximum dimensions - 120x80x50 cm </h4><br>  This type of delivery can not be sent: <br><br><ul><li>  any purchases that can be regarded as commercial cargo (including due to the quantity of the same goods); </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/279776/">electronics without notification of the FSB</a> (only USPS is possible); </li><li>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pochtoy/blog/280452/">batteries and rechargeable batteries</a> (separate from the main device) - otherwise, only USPS or sea delivery; </li><li>  perishable food and food products without original packaging; </li><li>  military clothing, shoes, accessories for military use; </li><li>  knives (except kitchen, multitools and penknives). </li></ul><br><h3>  How is the design of parcels "Mail Express"? </h3><br>  To send parcels by this service, you need to download a scan of the recipient's passport (main page and registration page).  Also, when filling in the declaration, reference to each product in the parcel, product item number (ASIN, SKU, etc.), product name in Russian and English are required. <br><br><h3>  Insurance "Express Mail" </h3><br>  In this case, it covers both cases of non-delivery of the package (complete loss) and the theft of investments.  Insurance is included in the cost of delivery at the time of payment of delivery.  Its cost varies from the value of the goods, more precisely, from the amount of insurance coverage (its maximum depends on the receipt from the store and cannot exceed it): <br><br><ul><li>  $ 0 to $ 100 = $ 2, </li><li>  from $ 100 to $ 400 = $ 4, </li><li>  from $ 400 to $ 700 = $ 5, </li><li>  from $ 700 to $ 1000 = $ 7, </li><li>  from $ 1000 to $ 1200 = $ 10. </li></ul><br>  The maximum insurance amount is $ 1200. <br><br><h3>  Why use "Mail Express"? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a6/479/eaa/8a6479eaa5a442a097c69e06efc07770.jpg"><br><br>  This type of delivery is best suited for small and fairly light loads.  Consumer electronics, smartphones, laptops (of course, you should attend to the notification - otherwise use USPS), clothes.  If desired, you can throw up to 5 developer boards a la Raspberry Pi Zero into the box. <br><br>  Devices, tools - it is better to leave the USPS. <br><br><h3>  Bonus for readers Geektimes </h3><br>  We give all our readers a promotional code ‚Äúgeektimes‚Äù for the free admission of incoming packages to <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> warehouse.
