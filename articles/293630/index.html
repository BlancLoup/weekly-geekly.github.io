So it is fundamentally important to understand what digital consulting is and why client companies need it, and agencies should develop in this direction. <br><br>  Before discussing further, we will define our concepts.  Digital consulting is not a service in the traditional sense of the term.  The consultant in this case must act on the basis of direct KPI business, and in this sense he is a full-fledged competent partner.  Digital consulting answers the questions ‚Äúfor what?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhen?‚Äù A specific business must be present in the digital environment.  Digital environment as a category covers everything connected with online: Internet sites, social networks, mobile applications and other, already working or not yet appeared channels. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why is digital consulting needed?</b>

      The digital environment is currently the most efficient and innovative, both in terms of communication with business audiences, and in terms of analytics and rendering capabilities.  Online, in principle, is a full-fledged independent sales channel.  But at the same time, this is the most dynamically changing environment, and not all channels can fit a particular business.  Therefore, Digital-Agency in this case acts as a partner, designed to track the most important trends in this area and offer exactly those solutions that will be effective from the point of view of the specifics of a particular business. <br><br>  <b>In other words, develop and propose a digital marketing strategy like:</b> <br>  - a set of technologies, tools and platforms for a particular business; <br>  - a set of mechanisms to achieve maximum results; <br>  - expertise on the best time and possibilities of using specific channels; <br>  - a sequence of steps based on analytics. <br><br>  Today, it is not enough just to make a website, place contextual advertising and think that sales will go.  All elements must be systematically linked with each other, be part of a well-thought-out marketing strategy. <br><br>  <b>In addition, a digital consultant</b> always focuses on the examination of the competitive environment and international practices when making decisions related to the development of a client‚Äôs business in a digital environment. <br><br>  And, of course, a professional partner will always take care of the ‚Äúface‚Äù of the company - the client‚Äôs website: <br>  - evaluate its functioning; <br>  - UX / UI; <br>  - conduct an analysis of key objectives; <br>  - offer advanced conversion enhancement services. <br>  Visitors are on the site 24/7 and how the Internet platform looks, how the brand positions, as it tells the success story, is of utmost importance. <br><br>  Thus, the client of digital consulting receives a single center of competence in the digital environment - this is the team that forms the strategic vision of how to develop the company online.  This vision is based on the formulation and solution of specific tasks and goals, the main one being the growth of business sales. <br><br>  So, the main idea.  Due to the fact that business is everywhere going online, it needs a digital consultant - due to the specifics of the online environment, the very model of the relationship between business and the agency is changing, today it is based on planning by objectives, justification, confirmation and elaborated strategy.  It is important to find a partner who can always competently and reasonably answer how businesses should develop in a digital environment.  A good consultant should be a trusted partner.  But it is a good, high-quality consultant who meets a variety of criteria - due level of expertise, experience, a clear success story, an adequate reputation in the market ... In other words, he must have the resources to work in the joint business building market and really live up to expectations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293630/</a></p>
