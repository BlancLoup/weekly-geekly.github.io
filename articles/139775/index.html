  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cebit 2012. Final Report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, dear habrazhiteli, I am ready to tell without reserve about everything that I saw at the exhibition CeBIT 2012, which was held in the German city of Hannover from March 6 to March 10 of this year.  If I didn‚Äôt see anything, do not be angry, write wishes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a88/ed3/3ce/a88ed33ce0b5212d1c0010d85b0537d1.jpg"><br>  Under the cut more than 100 photos.  Careful traffic! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The official partner of the current exhibition was the country of Brazil; therefore, colorful South American characters met periodically, and for the press they organized cocktails with caipirinas and other goodies. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/609/063/744/609063744427f2d4cc3fd39380dae74b.jpg"><br>  But, of course, it was not the main purpose of my visit to the exhibition city.  Pavilions with a huge amount of computer equipment were magnetised and were not allowed to turn aside. <br>  Just a few minutes after arriving at Hall 17, I went to the Zotac company's booth, where I got acquainted with new products and the trend of the company's development. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee3/efa/a35/ee3efaa35c35f401f49eef699ecf4c98.jpg"><br>  New NVIDIA video cards are not yet visible on the horizon, and therefore the lull is used for the development of other branches of business and in particular mini-PCs.  In the assortment of Zotac there are unsuited and variegated devices.  A working sample of the ZBOX VD01 with a remote control was demonstrated on the stand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/400/3a6/1bc/4003a61bcfccf314dda5b1e852388c30.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f0/acb/f16/3f0acbf16c843ec226e31b9d3a3975f5.jpg"><br>  The kid successfully coped with the demonstration of the video about himself.  But he was not a champion in size.  Top secret development, which is under a non-disclosure agreement can boast even more compact dimensions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98a/898/76c/98a89876cf41d869e32b150c0f94979d.jpg"><br>  Comparison with a jar of RedBull 0.25l <br>  The front panel of the device contains a power button, headphone and microphone jacks, a card reader for MemoryStick and SecureDigital cards (SD, SDHC, SDXC), as well as a USB / eSATA port. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19f/29b/f97/19f29bf974bd9b755ae66ccd6997585c.jpg"><br>  The reverse side boasts four USB ports, of which two are SuperSpeed ‚Äã‚ÄãUSB 3.0, a socket for connecting a power adapter, an Ethernet port and HDMI.  There is no data on the HDMI version, but we must assume that this will be HDMI 1.4a. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0c/d51/562/e0cd51562e5751b500212e30f75cb0f6.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1eb/d58/fba/1ebd58fbaf630bf43c3837118cfe73cc.jpg"><br>  I dare to suggest that inside the box is a new 22nm Intel Ivy Bridge processor, but so far there is no confirmation of this, as there is no data on the price or performance of the new ZBOX. <br>  One of the leaders in the global power supply market (in terms of quality, not quantity of sales), Enermax was pleased with the latest inventions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9c/dca/3c6/e9cdca3c6f6a3f6a3d9e0b2907c9622b.jpg"><br>  On this wall you can see top-end power supplies with Gold and Platinum certificates, as well as the new Triathlor budget series with a power range from 350 to 700 Watts and a Bronze performance certificate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28c/8f8/074/28c8f807491bac10e095d64fc380edf5.jpg"><br>  The prototype of the 2500 watt power supply aroused great interest and misunderstanding.  The purpose of the unit is to power huge screens in stadiums and other public places, dozens of such boards work in conjunction, creating enormous power. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/088/694/5b8/0886945b8dd00be0a5e5c820f87277c0.jpg"><br>  In the field of cooling systems, a novelty from Enermax is the water cooling system.  According to the developers, they used a new micro-channel technology, which will allow them to bypass competitors.  Let's wait for samples of such systems before judging their performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4cd/d28/e99/4cdd28e990e90866c1ae2b998fd2d25e.jpg"><br>  Traditionally, the range of peripherals has also been updated.  The new gaming mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse are made in the traditional red and black colors and will be presented on the market in the near future. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/825/f02/851/825f02851c61887f9611b4be46e038a5.jpg"><br>  The device called DreamBass is a USB low-frequency amplifier and is designed for owners of systems with integrated sound cards, such as netbooks or laptops.  The basis of the device is the sound codec from VIA - VT1620A.  A demo stand was equipped at the exhibition, where you could feel the difference in sound using the switch.  Even your humble servant, whom the bear came into his ear, was able to notice a deeper bass sound, but I will not undertake to estimate how clear the sound was. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/699/259/44d/69925944d505be8905bad824588ef44e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68b/5c6/88f/68b5c688fdb3c40b733e87a4f922e0fd.jpg"><br>  The expansion of the Enermax product line seemed small and another LEPA brand was created, which is supposed to be more affordable.  To begin with, a 1600-watt power supply and a four-color Casino fan were introduced. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a9/c43/d84/4a9c43d8412e3a8f936362e368ee9bd5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ff/d90/128/5ffd901284be13c05e8aebffe70f0661.jpg"><br>  After that, my colleagues and I were invited to attend the Asus conference, where we planned to introduce the press to the line of new motherboards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b7/788/253/5b77882535f73a30158326878ed806c7.jpg"><br>  Before turning to the entire line of cards, I‚Äôll draw attention to two products - the Asus Radeon HD 7970 DirectCU II TOP video card - the best of the best, the new object of overclockers and gamers, as well as the Asus Xonar Phoebus sound card included in the Republic Of product line Gamers and professional-oriented players. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb9/05c/38e/eb905c38ea07089826911fb0ac9d5626.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/735/e0a/460/735e0a460b0b615bf8b71ba5f5e6f5f5.jpg"><br>  And now about the boards.  Begins a series of new ROG-series - Maximus V Gene, a compact board with incredible overclocking capabilities. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/231/19d/1ab/23119d1ab1543b5b6aa6eec52bef60fe.jpg"><br>  The The Ultimate Force military series has been replenished with the Sabertooth Z77, which is covered with a plastic casing for additional protection and has a special cooling system. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4b/9d0/145/d4b9d014587e7236f8b0af6e612b7667.jpg"><br>  For those who are not looking for anything extra, but simply satisfied with the quality of Asus, the following options are offered in various formats - from ATX to mini-ITX. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/621/0fe/943/6210fe94386a74bf34b6d1fb17556a35.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9e/3ff/02d/e9e3ff02d2d11edb0889cba908ce8992.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/189/1f2/f3b/1891f2f3b1662e31fa9c04e436156654.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/917/3f3/c23/9173f3c23a8c61400cccb5d13176843b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f1/da6/c85/5f1da6c856029b8bbf20a9c4c9960bbf.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1a/8c7/07a/d1a8c707acd8835348155ebdde2b36c3.jpg"><br>  The conference was attended by the leader of the world rating of overclockers, one of the engineers at Asus Taiwanese Andre Yang.  He demonstrated the overclocking potential of the top motherboard - Asus Maximus V Formula.  There were many people who wanted to be photographed and talk to him, but there were also those who could talk with him on equal terms - at the moment the fourth number of the Russian Smoke rating has improved the moment and talked with a competitor. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/046/eef/92b/046eef92b947b2d97473e67b32c801d5.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/894/1cd/ae8/8941cdae8927257204c55b8076fa789e.jpg"><br>  Habrayuzer slamms meanwhile grabbed the board and posed for journalists = =) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2cb/7e1/e42/2cb7e1e42bb6a939841a44dd588e67b3.jpg"><br>  BIOSTAR cannot boast such a serious success in overclocking its motherboards, but nevertheless the full range of motherboards on the new Intel Z77 chipset has been presented.  Two new Extreme series will surely be tested by enthusiasts and get their share of fans. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/031/365/ef2/031365ef2ba618530d391e80da6eb2d1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4a5/c9f/0ce/4a5c9f0cead8aad1a19ba48727916376.jpg"><br>  Budget solutions were presented more widely, for different types of cases, for different wallets of customers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdd/002/025/cdd00202525be52c78427ee9eed09ff3.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b16/851/8b9/b168518b9e45217759609ea0368e89de.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68b/b6a/85a/68bb6a85a6faa6540c7827c4889cde7b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbd/e3f/3f5/fbde3f3f5fa4fce2c8e939f07a95abea.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe0/8d7/32a/fe08d732a3cd19f7090f666386094be2.jpg"><br>  The stand was also attended by the only model on the recently released Intel Socket 2011 platform - Biostar TPOWER X79 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b30/1ee/a01/b301eea01333befb837e3f10a5599f6f.jpg"><br>  The changes were also made to the model lineup for AMD processors - the boards for Socket AM3 + and FM1 + were updated <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f91/315/c17/f91315c1761a1c6053e169dd700ae269.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/823/8c2/7a9/8238c27a914aecdf835b9244172128e2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/009/416/cc7/009416cc7d569b7cde1a1790dfd1df45.jpg"><br>  The company Thermaltake was swept by a mania of white, almost all of the company's novelties were painted white or gray.  The Thermaltake Commander case was presented in three versions - Commander MS-II, Commander MS-III and Commander MS-I Snow Edition. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a25/4f7/7e3/a254f77e38f6d15b1cb356670ffad24e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c86/272/53c/c8627253cba32caa11c9cf3f3782cd68.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14b/211/5e3/14b2115e3a0bcfa693cd24bdfac06db0.jpg"><br>  The legendary case Thermaltake Level 10 and Level 10 GT received a successor - Level 10 GTS, which is the most affordable version of the series and of course has a white version - Snow Edition. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8c/e4a/45f/c8ce4a45fc89337fe6bda63621aa3b53.jpg"><br>  Keyboard Meka G1 was shown (you will not believe), also in white. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff9/88f/552/ff988f5521a33f93f33d372178bac802.jpg"><br>  One of the main directions of the company - power supply units, was replenished with ‚Äúplatinum‚Äù blocks of the ToughPower Grand and ToughPower XT series. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90c/3c9/4d6/90c3c94d6833effcdaa1509249286a2c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c17/c9c/aee/c17c9caee087555d27b42b0a9b45fce1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b0/d9a/7f6/6b0d9a7f6a2d0a7bb4bc37e9caf11a52.jpg"><br>  For special connoisseurs of style and luxury, a mouse was presented, the design of which was developed in the laboratories of BMW, Thermaltake Level 10M.  Uncompromising in its style and incredible in its value, the mouse will surely become a cherished device for many gamers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d4/eee/cd6/2d4eeecd622d2fd1825d36e3d9a81632.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d1/6e1/269/9d16e12695ae6f8927479fb7a46bceab.jpg"><br>  XFX brought the Radeon HD 7870 graphics card and several versions of the cards already released with the original Ghost cooling systems to the exhibition. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d35/c0a/8e2/d35c0a8e2ed40d6dc2e833dcea69bc16.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/605/987/e6e/605987e6eb3ad9a5ace8ced07af52406.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/612/878/06d/61287806dc49b065d9f30db157221e41.jpg"><br>  Business expansion is a process that many companies have launched, PNY, traditionally strong in the video adapter segment, demonstrated not only enthusiast GeForce GTX 580 variants, but also memory modules, SSD drives on SandForce controllers, but even iPhone cables.  What to do - if you want to live - know how to spin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c3/b0d/00a/4c3b0d00a6f151b11a178e8461d7d583.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02d/2d2/56e/02d2d256ef040932ccf0d150ec2e6566.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a00/579/824/a00579824bdf7ff3a29ebb792468ed29.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/754/870/408/7548704083842ef9b6fae4074019e339.jpg"><br>  About the novelty from the company Archos - I already wrote a home DECT phone based on Android in brief news releases, besides it and the previously mentioned tablet, a curious 3G modem with a non-social price of 50 euros was found on the stand. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d13/e4b/139/d13e4b139599eb5acfe6504f48f694ed.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58a/abe/c36/58aabec36fec908765a7eee6bf6411da.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a6/a4f/7f4/6a6a4f7f4a185e069b2aee3797afc4b8.jpg"><br>  MSI has pleased visitors with a new nettop - WindBox on AMD APU hybrid processors, a new line of motherboards based on Intel Z77 and new video cards, among which MSI Radeon HD 7970 Lightning, the flagship of the industry, was noticed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e5/275/be4/4e5275be424f75d074cb065fccc2e0b5.jpg"><br>  Like the XFX, MSI decided to showcase the new Radeon HD 7870 in its original Hawk performance. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20e/e41/33c/20ee4133c56fc2d54bda10dd2278999e.jpg"><br>  Motherboards traditionally differed from each other in functionality and equipment, falling into the sphere of interests of the buyer with any thickness of the wallet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de2/716/02f/de271602ffdf853b5d972610fc6d7da4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d1/cf4/1d6/0d1cf41d667fc94d1c4189260da7ea1f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93c/143/fbd/93c143fbd2c74fdb2321f6991576827d.jpg"><br>  And here is a potential legend, heaped up to the highest heights - MSI Radeon HD 7970 Lightning.  All previous cards of this family were very successful, so there is reason to hope for success this time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/790/521/435/790521435d0d89f35ed4b38e50511647.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/52f/13e/7c5/52f13e7c540e04d9a9263f4807607172.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54f/514/9f4/54f5149f40cabb82df1a75a33f4a43aa.jpg"><br>  Traveling through the halls, I stumbled upon the small stands of famous companies. <br>  For example, the whole Kingston exposition at the booth of one of the distributors - Wave Computers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9eb/3ad/c6e/9eb3adc6ee9e0fbc44e8ee27b6b86c95.jpg"><br>  But the novelty from the Austrian company Noctua - low-profile cooler NH-L12 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf5/d44/26a/cf5d4426a315001061659f42b9c13fd0.jpg"><br>  Cooler Master has pleased its fans with a new version of the Cosmos II case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6a/07f/aed/c6a07faedd11cb79ef9c70fe581d3157.jpg"><br>  Fortunately, not everyone reacted to CeBIT so - although Gigabyte reduced the size of the stand, they were fully armed.  The main focus was on ultrabooks on the new generation of processors and gaming motherboards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e9/836/f83/9e9836f837d8209a5fd79f1a20f2bba7.jpg"><br>  To demonstrate the performance of 22-nm processors is impossible, and ultrabooks were blocked with a screen size of 14 inches. <br>  The G1 gaming series received the addition of Assasin2 for Intel Socket 2011 processors and Sniper 3 for Intel Socket 1155 processors. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf7/674/d2a/cf7674d2a602fc1bac606dd7ccd4dc38.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c95/6bc/3bd/c956bc3bdae72d01ce4334e59ae43e87.jpg"><br>  A variety of new motherboards were diluted with server platforms, and judging by the variety of these, Gigabyte decided to seriously play in this sandbox. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/013/1a8/7fc/0131a87fc7a789a6ca7a409d7e0bf145.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/632/323/607/632323607116b8343209e40abfb757cd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/111/8f6/fcd/1118f6fcdb436c07f4941d7c78c97042.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44d/faa/d56/44dfaad564422d68428183ced23beb8f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c16/dbf/7fb/c16dbf7fb0f2c563e4a7602382d04f29.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f8/ee1/e66/2f8ee1e662a7b7b8e8df34522acf5249.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bd/3ea/ae3/3bd3eaae3af71e58c417828a0ef7bd08.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cea/2d1/c20/cea2d1c20dc7fce6ffad8ca2e060651d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90d/13a/604/90d13a604f1443566782011bab8534c2.jpg"><br>  The unit responsible for the video card pleased with the next version of the Radeon HD 7870 with cooling Windforce and the Radeon HD 7970, made on a PCB with Ultra Durable technology. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/478/ddc/f30/478ddcf30f27b894895d10f6bf694950.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68e/89c/061/68e89c06128d5ccf103210c030fdd317.jpg"><br>  Passing by the booths of Asian companies, it was often possible to find fun things.  Here, for example, waterproof covers for iPhone or iPad <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/965/2fe/bee/9652febee78efe471d398c0b7a5ebc4b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0b/3a4/227/c0b3a4227cc4bcbc95b3a77679c1e1d1.jpg"><br>  Representatives of the manufacturer included the film and lowered the device into the water, where he continued to show and work, it's a pity only without sound. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a3/e90/ee5/7a3e90ee54688ffe2cacc44eb3e9b848.jpg"><br>  The cooler of original design and performance met me at the stand of the Korean company Parang.  The fact is that it is machined and solid piece of metal.  I will check how effective this technology is in the near future, they promised to send me a test sample. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c80/73b/19f/c8073b19f9ea33d87e368107b3ba3415.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dac/7a1/c6a/dac7a1c6a2b6fbccf57ede787091f3e9.jpg"><br>  The Xilence booth attracted visitors with a view of the huge Interceptor Pro case, in which there is room for two systems at once - the mini ‚ÄìITX and Full ATX. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe3/14d/078/fe314d078ac4123419b0bf943f76f79b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d3/863/c8c/7d3863c8ca8b34e5e64136bb9a0bdb7f.jpg"><br>  In addition, the original power supply with an atypical case and cooling system was demonstrated to the general public. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/549/5e8/b16/5495e8b168416eb0963cc5fb7153cbf8.jpg"><br>  The stand of ASRock was particularly interesting to visitors, there were held demonstrations of legendary gamers - Fatal1ty and White-Ra and an overclocking show with the participation of Taiwanese overclocking master Nick Shih and Russian Smoke. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbb/9e5/655/dbb9e565578709e0cc99ea5776d5efb8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78f/fb9/662/78ffb9662029d69379233580c7bf36ac.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/516/a1e/a45/516a1ea45b63437fff971a6ec0e9d2b3.jpg"><br>  As for the products presented, the most lively was caused by the assembled stands on the ASRock Z77 Extreme 9 and ASRock X79 Fatal1ty Champion boards. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eae/72c/df1/eae72cdf17be029b0aef8633b7c5db6c.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/80e/eef/9ff/80eeef9ffedc4f4001bfc3de7e9d2189.jpg"><br>  In addition to them, the Fatal1ty series has expanded with models on the Intel Z77 and AMD 990FX chipsets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d52/650/801/d52650801b052c31fb9b22a6e8925732.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26b/14a/932/26b14a932972229c82ee29d25f926d3e.jpg"><br>  Having abandoned the production of RAM, OCZ became the leader in the SSD market.  This year, it is worth noting the new models on the Indilynx controller, as well as the hybrid RevoDrive with a crazy reading speed, but at the same time combining the classic HDD and solid-state SSD. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/847/583/ea3/847583ea344c25a2b618a3da96290864.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d06/4a5/eeb/d064a5eeb85b554d9ec5f560811d019e.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d19/0be/a11/d190bea11925b2500e39b8ecfe2fe143.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3c/b90/ed6/e3cb90ed602014e653765d1d4347ac93.jpg"><br>  The server segment was not left without new products - there were full-size disks and low-profile ones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f53/003/296/f53003296d2e3388a6f3b5ca38b6e850.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a5/ca6/9e5/8a5ca69e5154a810956a326c6ab2d743.jpg"><br>  Pretec demonstrated a 32 gigabyte memory card with an integrated Wi-Fi adapter.  Thus, you can turn the camera into an interesting device that can immediately dump photos on the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/253/6bd/a74/2536bda74857c59bbf9525a281075929.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the SSD line from Pretec has received a major update and expansion. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8e/e07/f35/e8ee07f3588d1697d46efeca73d0e389.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/559/68d/109/55968d10908b7ab1d31421e1d4dc079f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f27/7d4/1ae/f277d41ae8b339b28b111f2ca5ec113a.jpg"><br>  Of course, this is not all the devices that were demonstrated at the exhibition, but, unfortunately, it is impossible to embrace the immense.  Despite the fact that the format of the exhibition is changing and showcases give way to small meeting rooms, I am sure that many more new products will be presented in Hannover in the coming years. <br>  In conclusion I want to say a few words of gratitude. <br>  ‚Ä¢ First, thanks to those who read my opus to the end. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Secondly, thanks to Intel, thanks to which I was able to work quickly on the road on the Asus Zenbook UX31E ultrabook (I remind you that an overview of this wonderful device will be released soon). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Thirdly, thanks to Kingmax for the excellent 32GB high-speed CompactFlash memory card. <br>  Shl.  A small bonus.  At the ‚Äústand‚Äù of Vodafone, the magic Catherham cars were chasing, could not resist, took off on the iPhone and I hasten to share with you. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjpaWencCVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjCmCU8YG8OcGQ4oLxgGB0K-eOFaw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>
