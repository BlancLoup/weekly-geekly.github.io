  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A dream for a million</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share my dream.  I will write immediately the whole essence of the idea, and then delve into the details. <br>  I would like to have a system for the creation and operation of autonomous amateur researchers of the Earth. <br>  This dream is inspired by the rovers, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180745/">"Solar Impulse"</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/jelastic/blog/150377/">"Ocean Explorer"</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180495/">Platform Wind</a> and articles about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177435/">rover in the box</a> . <br>  It is already possible to create an autonomous module with a solar-powered source that can swim for a long time in the ocean, float in the air, ride in the desert, explore Antarctica and other low-habitable elements, while remaining in touch with a group of its users (let's call them "navigators" ). <br>  Navigators have access to a project management system, including budget control, strategic and tactical goals, technical, environmental and social monitoring. <br>  I dream of such a machine since childhood.  With a stock of energy, with a source of electricity, with a control panel of units, with a reserve of vitality and autonomy.  And with the opportunity to consult with friends, distribute the work, and then share the collected materials. <br>  It is clear that the electronic and system stuffing can be universal, and the chassis must adapt to the selected environment.  The robot moves, takes pictures and measures the world around it, transmits the collected data to the server.  Navigators process data, plan missions, manage, write to the researcher's blog, share advertising revenue ;-) <br><br>  Here I came across a fragment of the diary of one of the Navigators: <br><blockquote>  <i>In the morning, having a cup of coffee, instead of a newspaper, I turned on the tablet computer and made sure that during the light day the battery of my desert envoy on the other half of the planet was recharged to 83%, which means you can turn the night camera cooled by Peltier elements back and start the auto photo from the sensor movements.</i>  <i>There is a hope to catch the unknown night residents: entomology students are very requested.</i>  <i>They are still jealous of their neighbors from the zoological with photos of the podkustnogo polluted, which came to sniff the hermit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But my northern ‚ÄúSolik‚Äù, as his fans christened him, seems to be going through hard times.</i>  <i>Storm, overcast, the sun is low, it has long been dangling on the surface without movement, for a day of dim light is enough only for a communication session and the minimum heating of the batteries.</i>  <i>Well, he is at least thermally insulated, but he contacts him less and less, and I already regret that I agreed to send him to the Arctic.</i>  <i>The program of the shortest and most urgent return to warmer latitudes has already been sent, but it doesn‚Äôt include engines and every day saves every milliwatt.</i>  <i>I really hope that the sun will enlighten before the cheap batteries freeze.</i>  <i>Oh, would have a RTG watt 10!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Once again, I look at a small list of remaining current consumers.</i>  <i>Finally, I decide that you can turn off the GPS, the entire navigation module with a beacon.</i>  <i>Anyway, until it is charged, this information is useless ... "</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br>  Okay, then he writes again about some mischievous girl, let's dive in better and discuss various aspects of the implementation of such projects. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><h5>  Ground robot </h5></td><td><h5>  Flying robot </h5></td><td><h5>  Floating robot </h5></td></tr><tr><td>  Wheeled or tracked.  Designed for driving in the desert. </td><td>  Light aircraft with a large surface of the wing and batteries. </td><td>  Swims in the neutral waters of the open ocean.  Monolithic sealed monocoque with solar panels under the protective plastic. </td></tr><tr><td>  The cheapest and easiest option, not afraid of stopping, but vulnerable to vandalism. </td><td>  The most expensive and difficult option.  Very vulnerable to piloting errors and adverse conditions are likely to be banned. </td><td>  Able to dive and carry out underwater shooting.  In emergency mode, it pops up and charges until recovery. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design and production </h4><br>  For design, of course, I see the most acceptable option for Open Source development.  These are several parallel projects: <br><ul><li>  Electronic filling with universal open platform </li><li>  Plug-ins: photography, weather unit, probes, sensors, communication modules, etc. </li><li>  Chassis designs in a format for 3D printing or production orders </li><li>  Server Support Projects </li><li>  Firmware for onboard electronics </li><li>  Templates for Internet projects.  (models of attraction, advertising, monetization, etc.) </li></ul><br>  Naturally, no one bothers the big manufacturers to create separate proprietary components connected to an open platform through standard interfaces. <br>  Thus, the electronics should be used to the maximum standard, there is no need to buy radiation-resistant chips and spend on exclusive performance.  Software, of course, you need to add some, but the operating systems are quite suitable and ready.  Making chassis on 3D models, assembly and communication fees are perhaps the main expenses of the participants.

    <h4>  Launch of the project </h4><br>  It is clear that it is quite difficult to pull toys like this alone, especially at first.  (Although ... if you imagine an old millionaire who wants to see the world very much out of his mansion, anything is possible) <br>  How would this look if the first version of the software, the stuffing and the chassis were ready? <br>  A group of enthusiasts creates a project on RoboHub and begins receiving participants.  Participants can be of several levels: <br><br><ul><li>  Navigators - the main shareholders of the project </li><li>  Team - users who receive limited access to the system for a small fee. </li><li>  Observers - most likely free registered users interested in the project </li><li>  Public - unregistered visitors to the project sites. </li></ul><br><br>  Navigators and the team form the budget, determine the configuration of the robot, order the components, make deductions when using ready-made services (for example, RoboHub itself for hosting and licenses), buy a tariff plan for communication, and launch the board openly. <br><br><h4>  Organization of communication </h4><br>  Well run robots in Moscow.  I bought a sim card for 300 rubles a month and your robot is in touch.  You can even force a flying robot to establish a connection when flying over cellular towers. <br>  Not everything is so rosy in the ocean or in the desert: one cannot do without a satellite channel.  Of course, now it is expensive.  For example, Inmarsat wants $ 7 per megabyte.  However, it depends on what to compare.  I think Spirit or Curiosity silently envy the number 7 without the letter K. <br>  Apparently, for the control channel, in any one you will need to have a satellite connection.  For downloading photos, video and the rest, you can think about the usual satellite Internet or about a periodic approach to zones with a cheaper radio channel.  Although, who knows how many paid users will be, maybe $ 7 for uploading each photo will easily pay off ... <br><br><h4>  Autonomy and controllability </h4><br>  Since robots are aimed at use by amateurs in conditions of a limited communication channel, robots have the following modes of operation: <br><ul><li>  <b>Survival</b> .  Automatic program for the restoration of charge, the restoration of communication or emergency return to the service point. </li><li>  <b>Movement towards a strategic goal.</b>  In the case of the normal functioning of key systems, the robot automatically paves the route to the intended goals and moves towards them. </li><li>  <b>Self-preservation</b> .  Short-term mode to avoid collisions with unwanted objects.  (ships, large animals, vandals) </li><li>  <b>Piloting</b>  Manual pilot control in the presence of a stable communication channel. </li><li>  <b>Mission</b>  The execution of tasks. </li></ul><br><h4>  Device </h4><br>  It is clear that we have a pair of onboard computers, each of which is tenacious and resistant to failures on its own, and one emergency, the minimum energy consumption, is responsible for survival.  We have internal expansion modules that can be physically disabled in case of problems, and we have mounted modules that, if necessary, are shot by pyrobolts. <br>  The robot receives energy from solar panels and stores it in batteries.  Floating models are one of the largest, carrying a lot of batteries on board, and ground-based ones - smaller.  Drifting and stationary models without an engine do not waste energy on movement, but they also have a smaller battery area. <br>  Ground robots are most likely intended for the desert.  Therefore, they have a wheeled, tracked or combined chassis.  Overboard, we do not have Mars, so the main equipment inside a durable transparent body, at least mounted modules, and all of them are auxiliary.  Turtle, in general. <br>  The floating robot, mariner, has the main screw and backup propulsion (wheel or even sail), in case of screw breakage.  To allow the device to emerge in an emergency even with energy loss, we use a simple piston with a spring in the hermetic part.  The pump pumps water, the piston compresses the spring and air, reducing the volume, the device is immersed.  Magnetic lock holds the exhaust valve.  In case of an accident, the lock opens, the spring and air push the water out, expanding the volume, the device pops up.  Charges, communicates with the command center, continues the mission. <br><br><h4>  Community life </h4><br>  For project participants there is a website.  Visitors read reports, stories, look at pictures, graphics, worry about the fate of pets, watch ads. <br>  Observers have access to notifications, internal forums, can initiate data utilization projects - for example, classifications of inhabitants found in the depths. <br>  The team has access to technical information, collected data, discussion and formation of goals and missions, piloting vehicles, etc. <br>  Navigators manage the objectives of the highest priority, have the right to vote, have limited financial responsibility. <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  The most difficult, perhaps, aspect. <br>  No, of course, the communication channel is encrypted, and the command packets are signed with pre-stitched hardware keys.  And even from the attackers can learn to quickly evade. <br>  But what to do with the robbers of both types: with the state and its enemies?  Some people catch robots with the help of special equipment and demand a ransom, while others simply prohibit and do not disdain to shoot down our peace envoys from their armed UAVs? <br>  Again, what if only on other planets to launch robots? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179417/</a></p>
