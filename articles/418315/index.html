What was the best presentation of the devops conference?  What is this report and why is it recognized as the best?  Were there any serious performances in ordinary clothes? ‚Äù <br><br>  Serious was more than enough: if you are interested in the nuances of working with Kubernetes, Istio or Zipkin, in the post you will find all this, and the togs do not interfere with speaking sensible things.  The title of ‚Äúbest‚Äù depended on the audience: we compiled this top 10 based on their ratings.  And the answer to the first question is under the cut.

End of the day.  The audience has already watched six reports, this closing keynote remains.  Immediately after it will be a party, and after a whole day of active absorption of information, many probably want to go to it as soon as possible. <br><br>  And something hardcore at this point would have been difficult to perceive - but the ironic costume performance about devops, styled as a Greek tragedy, perfectly fit into the context, animating the entire hall.  At the same time, ‚Äúa fairy tale is a lie, but a hint in it‚Äù: the story of how a fictitious company faced a variety of difficulties as it grew, helped not only to laugh, but also to think. <br><br>  As a result, this very performance turned out to be the most highly rated by DevOops viewers.  To share their feelings, we recommend watching the video in similar conditions: in the evening of a difficult day, with a glass of something you love. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HiPSp2xf0yo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Extend k8s </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Nikolay Ryzhikov</b> <br>  <a href="https://niquola.github.io/k8s-devoops-2017-slides/">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Immediately after the previous point, there is as sharp a contrast with it as possible.  In the report, who took second place, instead of jokes and entertainment, sheer technical specifics. <br><br>  Kubernetes has become a key tool of our time (GitLab won because of him <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2018/06/25/moving-to-gcp/">moving</a> from Azure to GCP).  And while some are already using it with might and main, others are eyeing it with interest.  We recommend those who are ‚Äúeyeing‚Äù the beginning of the report with introductory information, and already using it will be interesting further: Nikolai says ‚Äúhow everything is inside‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to simplify ops for developers with the help of k8s‚Äù (ideally he would like would come to noops). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3BMTNx2xCtQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  one-cloud: OS-level data center in Odnoklassniki </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Oleg Anastasyev</b> <br>  <a href="http://assets.contentful.com/oxjq45e8ilak/1KdpcSwYEIm2mKW2wKKe4E/3d46ac21623680fd9d3a24186854640d/Oleg_Anastasyev_one-cloud.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  And who now, with all the popularity of Kubernetes, there are reasons not to use it?  In Odnoklassniki: looking at it, they came to the conclusion "it is easier for us to wash our own than adapting it for ourselves."  But they took Docker there.  All this happened within the framework of ‚Äúcreating your own cloud‚Äù: previously, the social networks used the principle ‚Äúeach server is busy with only one task‚Äù, however, over time, they decided to perform different tasks on one server.  And the report described this in detail. <br><br>  Will Odnoklassniki's experience be useful to others, if not everyone works in a company with several own data centers, and most of them have a completely different specificity?  Let's say this, it‚Äôs unlikely that you‚Äôll see the record with the feeling ‚Äúwe have to do the same thing,‚Äù but something from the report may be useful in a different context, and knowing ‚Äúwhat others are living‚Äù is useful for a common understanding of the industry. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJShMFzDV6g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  (Keynout) Come scale away with me: </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Corey Quinn</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/3gzXwMhOOcawoqOcUOse4e/54b036be09ae9a0aa8d736622900b11c/Corey_Quinn_-_Come_Scale_Away_With_Me.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Corey Quinn is known as the creator of the Amazon AWS <a href="https://lastweekinaws.com/">Last Week in AWS</a> .  In his texts, he is constantly ironic, dramatically different from the usual dry style of IT-materials.  But with all the jokes, his newsletter was so informative and useful that even Amazon employees often follow the news on it. <br><br>  Corey opened the conference with his keynote, and in his speech there was the same combination of ‚Äúironic and business‚Äù: one could hear about situations that are both laughter and devops sin.  ‚ÄúI once sat on a Netflix report, where they said they give all developers access to production in general.  A man sitting next to me warmly approved these words.  I looked at his badge and was horrified to find that he was working in a bank. ‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oplbmUaLUBw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Silicon chainsaw massacre (as I spent the weekend on duty) </h2><br>  Speakers: <b>Baruch Sadogursky and Leonid Igolnik</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/73TFhVRh04sGU2oG2sgCmq/aa627310b51637ba868539a73e8fdba5/Igolnik-Sadogursky_____Chainsaw_Massacre.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Again, Baruch Sadogursky and Leonid Igolnik, but without the Greek, and with a report on how to properly build the process of duty (and how it is often built instead).  There is no longer a solid ‚ÄúDevOps in scale‚Äù fun, but a more applied report with concrete conclusions.  But if you know Baruch, you already understand that the place of the show was found here.  First, the speakers do not simply list the theses ‚Äúhow to do it right‚Äù, but cite hypothetical stories as an example - and you can worry about her characters, recognizing yourself and others in them.  Secondly, all this is illustrated with gifs - and on the videotape you can hear from the audience‚Äôs reaction how accurate their selection turned out to be. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zbUlDkLVok" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Troubleshooting &amp; debugging production applications in Kubernetes (aka The Failing Demo Talk) </h2><br>  Speakers: <b>Baruch Sadogursky &amp; Ray Tsang</b> <br><br>  And again Baruch, but this time with another speaker (and, as you might guess, in another language). <br><br>  With presentations in which there is a ‚Äúlive demo,‚Äù there is always the risk that ‚Äúthis demo on stage may not suddenly work.‚Äù  And here they beat this complexity, deliberately making the demo ‚Äúas if they suddenly refused‚Äù - and further down the steps of figuring out what needs to be done to make everything good.  What goes well with the topic of ‚Äútroubleshooting &amp; debugging‚Äù: with debugging, it is interesting to understand a specific visual example. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LEWcySTSHNU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Success Story, or ‚ÄúDev + DevOps + Ops‚Äù </h2><br>  Speakers: <b>Artyom Kalichkin and Sergey Berdnikov</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/1ZTLIkD4o0i80YaGaI86GK/5323e63a50df9e40be17daec5e57b8e3/__________________________________________________________________________Dev_DevOps_Ops__.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  To praise the advantages of devops in conversations is easy.  It‚Äôs much harder to really go to them when there is a large company with well-established processes that cannot change instantly.  And if there are also circumstances like ‚Äúthis is a fintech, so safety is paramount‚Äù, the task becomes even more complicated. <br><br>  And here is a report from those who have already passed along this path, where they share in detail their experiences, moving from ‚Äúwas‚Äù to ‚Äúbecame‚Äù.  It turns out, among other things, the story that for a devops one cannot simply take it and go to other tools by the decree from above - changes must occur to people and come from them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/74bqTSmSI4E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Managing your microservices with Kubernetes and Istio </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Craig Box</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/4hM6NpHRCMsq60Gqw0Oow2/e1acc71e332e09427e66ad32cbdb58e0/Craig_Box_-_Managing_your_microservices_with_Kubernetes_and_Istio.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Although the previous paragraph reminds us that devops are not reduced to tools, of course, tools and the ability to handle them are important.  And this report is strictly about the use of two specific technologies.  If about Kubernetes is already spoken and negotiated (take at least the second item of this list), then here with Istio the situation is different: there are already over 9000 stars <a href="https://github.com/istio/istio">on GitHub</a> , but there are not so many materials about it.  The more valuable this report is from a Google employee - a company that is directly related to both Kubernetes and Istio.  If earlier they didn‚Äôt pay to Istio, now is just the right moment: version 1.0 is about to be released. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnBXQpo6Mjs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><br><h2>  How do you blame latency? </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Adrian Cole</b> <br>  <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/2M7YYzILDqMqWSyQ6SKMEY/dee738b162260421a7fdd77d5598d8c5/Adrian_Cole_How_to_properly_blame_things_for_causing_latency-_an_introduction_to_distributed_tracing_and_Zipkin.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Another technology report to help efficiently use the tool.  How do logging, metrics and tracing correspond?  How to properly deal with the third?  Why is the Zipkin tool so called? <br><br>  After the third answer, when the Twitter suffered from falls and showed the so-called ‚Äúfail whale‚Äù, the company called the tool created there by the word ‚Äúharpoon‚Äù, hoping to use it to defeat the ‚Äúwhale‚Äù.  And for answers to the other two questions, see the report. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6urcYnbXFI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br><h2>  From sysadmin to man </h2><br>  Speaker: <b>Alexander Titov</b> <br>  <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/oxjq45e8ilak/6dYt28v3B6EY4GcSkI4Qkk/2478105a9ef7b8403909235a5b7b29f5/Titov_Alexander_Ot_sysadmina_k_cheloveky.pdf">Presentation of the report</a> <br><br>  Alexander is a managing partner at Express 42, which "grows DevOps in technology companies."  With this kind of work, it‚Äôs not surprising that he has seen many approaches to DevOps, including many unsuccessful ones, and he can sum up what problems often turn out to be and what we should do with them.  What happens when devops comes exclusively from the system administrators?  And when only from the developers?  And from the business that heard the buzzword and said ‚Äúmake devops yesterday‚Äù? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FAyTAMjcCbI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><blockquote>  If you like these recordings, you will enjoy even more at the DevOops 2018 conference: there you can not only hear the reports, but also ask any speaker in the discussion area.  The conference will be held in St. Petersburg on October 14, we have already published a <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/415159/">detailed announcement</a> on Habr√©, and in the meantime <a href="https://devoops.ru/tickets/">tickets are</a> gradually becoming more expensive - so it‚Äôs worth thinking about them now. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418315/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418315/</a></p>
