When I visited the exhibition two years ago, it took up more space.  At least one pavilion.  Now occupies 4 rooms in two pavilions.  This is not very much, but if we consider that now the members of the big three are not participating (and they used to occupy a significant part), it is not that small.  There were practically no operators, there were more manufacturers and developers, and this is good news.

      Under the cut a short story about interesting products, companies and trends. <br>  Of course, with photos, wherever possible. <br><br>  Welcome! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One hall was fully occupied by manufacturers of copper and optical cable.  Another - manufacturers of navigation devices Glonass / GPS (albeit, goes under the flag of Navitech).  One - almost completely given to Chinese manufacturers.  Well, two more halls - the main pavilion. <br><br>  Official website of the exhibition: <a href="http://www.sviaz-expo.ru/">www.sviaz-expo.ru</a> <br><br>  See also the <a href="http://www.sviaz-expo.ru/common/img/uploaded/docs/guide_sviaz16.pdf">guide</a> .  It has a full list of exhibiting companies. <br><br><h5>  Russian switches </h5><br>  What first caught my eye was the abundance of Russian switches.  This is eltex, Angstrom Telecom, Natex.  Each has its own line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/6b5/a5d/7806b5a5d5974d65977321a36195eef5.jpg"><br><br>  And not only fast and gigabit ethernet.  Eltex showed new products - <a href="http://eltex.nsk.ru/catalog/mes5248.php">aggregation switches with 24/48 ports 10G and 40-gigabit uplinks</a> .  Made on the Broadcom chipset, but the cisco-like control is its own, samopisny, native (I believe eltex representatives with the word).  Eltex never ceases to amaze, actively expanding its lineup with cool solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90d/ec8/de7/90dec8de7ab8486f919a82e5c56f21fc.jpg"><br><br>  Chinese manufacturers, of course, were also represented in large quantities. <br><br><h5>  TS Computers </h5><br>  In general, the exhibition clearly shifted the focus towards the development of special devices: for military applications, special services, and even space.  For example, laptops in non-killed version with a core i7 on board.  The body is made of milled piece of aluminum.  Outwardly, something reminded macbook 13, but it is heavier per kilogram, and it will be even thicker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bae/068/fd3/bae068fd37d64900b953894419966815.jpg"><br><br>  Another novelty: a tablet that also works in a 20-degree frost.  Pretty normal sizes, especially considering its purpose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25a/732/5ff/25a7325fffcf447f956a22aba3fce6db.jpg"><br><br>  It is clear that the stuffing (boards, chips, displays) is imported.  But the undestructible construction is ours, <br>  maternal <br><br>  Company website: <a href="http://ts.ru/">ts.ru</a> <br><br><h5>  Elvis </h5><br>  They showed a new <a href="http://multicore.ru/index.php%3Fid%3D1335">1892BM14I</a> processor with two ARM cores, <br>  a h.264 / JPEG encoder, and a bunch of other cool chips, like two SpaceWire ports!  They say that it chases up to almost 1 GHz (normally 700).  Under certain conditions, of course.  The processor was shown in action on its debug board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b9/3b6/ea3/3b93b6ea318141b7bb1a29e12dc9aeb2.jpg"><br><br>  The board was ‚Äúraised‚Äù by Arch Linux and it was possible to press buttons on the stand.  I checked the contents of / proc / cpuinfo - on each core 1600 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BogoMips">BogoMips</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/516/ec7/333/516ec7333f3949e2b58625c297033c50.jpg"><br><br>  Most chips are made at the Russian <a href="http://mikron.ru/">micron</a> plant, but this concerns only the technology of 120 nm.  But 40 nm has to be ordered abroad. <br><br>  The price is very high so far (probably due to batch size), so the chips are suitable, most likely, only for special applications. <br><br>  But <a href="http://www.baikalelectronics.ru/">baikal electronics</a> and <a href="http://www.mcst.ru/">MCST</a> were not at the exhibition.  It would be very interesting to see all their stands and be able to ‚Äútouch‚Äù and compare. <br><br><h5>  Russian LPWAN </h5><br>  At the booth Skolkovo solution was presented Strizh.  It basically has LPWAN technology. <br>  Here it is - the Russian IoT in action.  This is already an end-user solution with marked prices. <br>  This is how the radio module's handkerchiefs look like (as far as I could find out on the stand): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a78/d70/9d4/a78d709d4fa9442d80c66cd566943f49.jpg"><br><br>  And immediately two devices on its base: <br><br>  Water meter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/752/eaa/a05/752eaaa05f81497e80fd6ad81362a088.jpg"><br><br>  Electricity meter <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/026/c45/9cc/026c459cca764f92a7d002e328fb4053.jpg"><br><br>  Information from the counters gets to the base station via LPWAN, and get to it <br>  Access is possible through the cloud service. <br><br>  LPWAN bitrate is extremely small (hundreds / thousands of bits per second) and is intended for telemetry.  Manufacturers claim a distance of 10 kilometers (!) In dense urban areas and about 40 km in open space.  And at the same time battery life is 10 years!  I already paid attention to the LPWAN technology in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/metrotek/blog/277873/">review of the Embedded World 2016 exhibition</a> , where the controller manufacturers announced plans to embed the LPWAN transmitters.  And then - the Russian development!  I honestly did not expect.  And I was pleasantly surprised. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://strij.net/">strij.net</a> <br><br><h5>  teltonika </h5><br>  Lithuanian contract manufacturer surprised with its power - hundreds of thousands of devices per month!  The guys claim that now they are very competitive against the backdrop of increased prices from Chinese manufacturers.  In this situation, it is easier for European companies to come to Vilnius with an order than to China.  But how important is European production for Russian companies is a big question for me. <br><br>  Yes, even these guys are expanding and want to go out to a million devices per month.  Impressive. <br><br>  They showed <a href="http://www.teltonika.lt/en/pages/view/%3Fid%3D17">their IoT devices</a> as manufactured <a href="http://www.teltonika.lt/en/pages/view/%3Fid%3D17">devices</a> . <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.teltonika.lt/">www.teltonika.lt</a> <br><br><h5>  FOD </h5><br>  The recognized leader among manufacturers of reflectometers introduced the <a href="http://www.fod.ru/7330.html">mini-OTDR 7330</a> , which works in both automatic and manual mode.  And also supports the connection of microscopes. <br>  Very compact size, two wavelengths, automation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/c8a/d39/490c8ad394d24db7ba5c716a6ef01db1.jpg"><br><br>  Responsive resistive touch interface and device start in 1 second (!).  I even took a video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SITBhOJpKfo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhXRn29fi5aQdn2JWVUUKOVyTKuFA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Colleagues said that inside - freertos.  And that inclusion is not from the suspend mode.  Not bad, not bad. <br><br>  Official website: <a href="http://www.fods.com/">www.fods.com</a> <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  We were at the exhibition for only one day, but still managed to ‚Äúcatch hold of‚Äù for interesting stands.  Of course, compared to the same Embedded World, the size is modest, but even at the current scale, it is not easy to go around (and communicate with everyone, to find out what's new) in a day. <br><br>  I would not like to catch up with the content of the exhibition, but I can not help but notice that our producers are still few.  Many things are borrowed and simply resold.  But there is already a positive shift.  We need many more years, even decades, to reach a level at least a little closer to the European one.  And for this, of course, it is necessary to stimulate not only the military and space industry ... <br><br>  Well, let's hope that over the years everything will change and we will go to the Svyaz-2016 exhibition for all three days, as well as to the European ones, and barely have time to go around them even during this time.  Let's hope that every year interesting initiative projects in Russia will become more. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  I hope it was interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283478/</a></p>
