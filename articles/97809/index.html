Combining branches 4270 and 4275 into one. <br>  2. The 4270 M2 now has a choice of 24x2.5 "SATA-2 / SAS-2 or 12x3" SATA-2 / SAS-2 hard drives. <br>  These are very good opportunities for startups!  The official brochure promises more than 1 TB of Flash storage capabilities or, respectively, other diverse configurations (12 TB of RAID 10, not bad for a business venture?).  Yes, and the cost will certainly be more profitable outdated Sun Fire x4540, but there is no specific price. <br>  All this in 2RU with a fairly low power consumption (~ 600 watts with HDD, ~ 400 watts with SSD). <br>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4270-m2-server-ds-079882.pdf">Info link</a> <br><br><h4>  But the enterprise gives the loot ... </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4470-server-077286.html">Sun Fire x4470</a> </h5><br> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4470-server-077286.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/97/a8/97a8d4720b2bf1391ad4909c18514db2.png" alt="image"></a>

      Well, ahem, in general, this is for those enterov who do not have a lot of $$$ on the account, and the park on Sun need to be transferred. <br>  In fact, an interesting model, occupies 3RU, consumes about ~ 1200 watts, costs about $ 49,500 for an average configuration. <br>  And the configuration is 64 threads on 32 Intel Xeon 75xx cores, 128 GB ECC REG DDR 3 1066 RAM, 2x 300 SAS-2 HDD. <br>  Actually, to consolidate, shove a flash accelerator (s) into it, connect an external SAS-2 Storage and start any project, and if not enough, please come to the next paragraph. <br>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4470-ds-079894.pdf">Info link</a> <br><br><h4>  And here nothing is necessary ... </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4800-server-077287.html">Sun Fire x4800</a> </h5><br> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4800-server-077287.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2b/24/2b24f4d7f20cbd52709ac9883795d50a.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And this is my size, 5RU!  The system takes the place of the previous monster (if anyone does not remember, x4450 with 4 4-core Xeon 74xx), however, not only the power affects the eyeball, but the price will probably hit the heart with the same discharge. <br>  Electricity eats system under ~ 3 kilowatts.  The cost will certainly be from $ 49,000 (this is the classic Sun-version of ‚Äújust for ...‚Äù) for the most cropped version. <br>  Configuration: 64 threads on 32 Intel Xeon X7550 cores, 1 TB ECC REG DDR 3 1066 RAM, 8x 300GB SAS-2 HDD and Hot-swappable PCI-E x8 slots (they are on the front of the system) and Hot-swappable ILOM (not could pass by). <br>  That is, if you have a Sun-based storage rack, then you can safely put one such system to them, clog it with the below-described flash accelerators and process everything that was previously processed by one completely clogged blade platform, but now on one system! <br>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/servers/x86/sun-fire-x4800-ds-079895.pdf">Info link</a> <br><br><h4>  Network final </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/networking/ethernet/sun-network-10gbe-switch-72p-079340.html">Sun Network 10GBE switch 72P</a> </h5><br> <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/networking/ethernet/sun-network-10gbe-switch-72p-079340.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4d/07/4d07f05c2e4dd9185733925ee66a051e.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  A 10 Gigabit switch for 72 non-blocking ports with a firewall and antidos worth $ 79,200 in the basic configuration of 8 SFP + ports and 16 sockets for 4x10 GbE or 1x40 GbE connections, with a throughput of 1.44 terabits per second and 1 billion packets per second and ILOM (yay!).  How much are whistles perdelki not know, unfortunately. <br>  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/networking/ethernet/sun-network-10gbe-switch-72p-ds-080666.pdf">Info link</a> <br><br><h4>  Post Scriptum </h4><br>  Optionally, you can purchase a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/products/servers-storage/storage/disk-storage/043966.html">Sun Flash Accelerator F20 PCIe</a> card for all servers, which is indispensable for working with databases and large ZFS systems.  In short, this is a 96 GB Flash card (4x24GB SLC Flash) with IOPS of more than 100 thousand. <br><br>  I‚Äôll add an opinion, as a Sun x86 user of previous generations (before Oracle), the vector is right, time is later, but better late than never. <br>  It can be seen that all PDFs have been drafted in a hurry (crooked images, in 4170M2 there is generally a picture from 2270M2), so the specifications may not be accurate.  Most and prices still do not, put up only for almost the most expensive systems. <br>  I hope for productive cooperation in the future with their luxury products. <br><h6>  If anyone wants to acquire similar systems in the European data center with an SLA of 99.9%, you are welcome in private </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97809/</a></p>
