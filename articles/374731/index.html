A strict engineering approach, faith in reason and humanity, and in that who is looking for, he will always find, I really liked in his works.  The heroes of his books are independent, thinking people, ready to stand up for themselves, their loved ones, and to realize the most amazing ideas. <br><br>  Heinlein was a big optimist on the achievements of mankind.  Unfortunately, all the terms of his predictions have already passed, and so far we have not colonized the moon, and it‚Äôs unrealistic to build a space rocket in the garage of our house.  Humanity has shifted its efforts to virtual reality and the film industry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With a twofold feeling, I took the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bryan-singer-tackling-sci-fi-778949">news</a> that Brian Singer will be filming the screen version of the novel by R. Heinlein "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."  Film rights acquired Twentieth Century Fox.  The film will be called ‚ÄúUprising‚Äù.  On the one hand, Singer is known as a producer, director and screenwriter of such decent projects as films from the ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù series (another film is being prepared for filming) and Dr. House series.

Usually, this is either an attempt to earn money on a successful franchise, or the hope that the book‚Äôs fame will attract people to the cinema, regardless of the quality of the film version.  In addition, the adaptation of the book - a matter in principle ungrateful.  After all, a good book is first of all reflections, acquaintance with the inner world of heroes.  The NF-book is thought experiments in unusual environments.  And cinema is a visual art, in it dialogue and actions are more important.  Hence the ongoing debates like ‚Äúthe book is better.‚Äù <br><br>  This novel has twice tried to bring to the screens - first it was done by Spielberg's DreamWorks company, and then by Phoenix Pictures.  But they did not achieve results, and the rights to the work were returned back to Heinlein's heirs.  In general, Heinlein's works have very few screen versions - given the fact that the percentage of high-quality works in his work is very large, and he has written enough novels.  The most striking film adaptation is considered to be the all-star shooter action ‚ÄúStar landing‚Äù, although very little is left of the book. <br><br>  The alarming bell is that Mark Guggenheim will be engaged in the adaptation of the book for the screen.  You can not call his work outstanding examples of scenic art.  Guggenheim worked on the TV series ‚ÄúCSI: Miami‚Äù (spreading cranberries), ‚ÄúArrow‚Äù (a fairy tale for children based on comics), ‚ÄúRemember what will happen‚Äù (unsuccessful TV adaptation of the NF-novel, the series is closed) and the film ‚ÄúGreen Lantern‚Äù (terrible a comic book adaptation. Even Sheldon Cooper didn't approve of it). <br><br>  The novel itself is full of interesting ideas and opinions, which, of course, cannot be fully transferred to the screen.  He is dedicated to the rebellion of the lunar colony, which is no longer willing to put up with the fact that every step of it is controlled from Earth.  At the same time, the libertarian moods of the inhabitants are due not only to the remoteness of the colony from the government, but also to the fact that the original settlers consist of criminals (including political), other outcasts, and their descendants.  In general, this is an obvious allusion to the independence of the American states.  Even the successful completion of the lunar revolution and the declaration of independence from the Earth takes place on July 4, 2076. <br><br>  But, without blindly moving the history of the United States to the Moon, Heinlein conducts other thought experiments.  For example, the intelligent computer HOLMES IV, nicknamed Mike (after the name of Brother Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft), helps the revolutionaries.  It is interesting that the computer, which was previously engaged in providing the lunar colony, almost accidentally realized itself and became rational. <br><br>  Further, in the colony of women two times less than men.  In connection with this, polyandry (polyandry) and group marriages flourish there.  At the same time, women have a sufficiently large power, and any encroachment on women ends very badly for men - they usually end up outside the gateway. <br><br>  In general, justice is most often administered locally, and colonists live according to the following code: repay debts, collect what you owe to others, maintain your reputation and the reputation of your family.  As a result, reputation is of great importance, disputes are resolved by local judges with a high reputation, and if you lose your reputation, it will be very difficult for you to find a job or borrow money (the system is somewhat like a credit history). <br><br>  At the same time, the revolution, unlike the American one, begins with secret "cells" and conspirators, which clearly refers us to the motives of the October coup in Russia.  Common Russianisms in the language and names of places like ‚ÄúNew Leningrad‚Äù hint at this. <br><br>  Due to the rather harsh living conditions allowed in the lunar society and the duel, however, they are needed very rarely - especially since the winner of the duel receives both all the debtor‚Äôs debts and the duty to care for his family.  And in general, one of the main themes of the work is TANSTAAFL - which stands for ‚Äúthere are no free dinners‚Äù (There Is No Such Thing As A Free Lunch). <br><br>  As a result, the author extols, as he himself called it, ‚Äúrational anarchism,‚Äù when freedom-loving individuals are reconciled with the presence of the state, as an inevitable evil.  On the other hand, he himself admits that such a relatively free society can exist only in frontier conditions.  The ensuing power of the law and the regulation of life stifles recalcitrant individualists. <br><br>  Well, what will happen as a result of Mr. Singer, we'll see.  In the meantime, there is time to read this novel for those who have not read it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374731/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374731/</a></p>
