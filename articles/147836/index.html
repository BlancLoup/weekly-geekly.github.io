Earlier, I already had the experience of buying cheap devices, which, as a result, did not work, but the DC-16 really showed how the emergency charger should work. <br><br>  So, Nokia DC-16 <br>  2200 mAh capacity <br>  950 mA output <br>  3 months of charge conservation <br>  23.3 x 23.3 x 120 <br>  75 grams <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  Recently, I began to experience problems with my Nokia N950.  The problem, most likely, lay in the fact that I was finally forced to connect unlimited mobile Internet, which I began to use quite actively.  In addition, at work I work tirelessly over the Internet via Wi-Fi, the phone reads updates from Facebook and Twitter, checks mail.  This leads to the fact that charging is enough until the end of the day, but not until the moment when the Internet may be needed again.  And, of course, this often happens when I am looking for how to get to a certain place using public transport.

      My experiments began long before that, simply because it was interesting for myself.  Searching a little on the Internet, I bought on eBay one of the cheapest charge that is powered by the sun.  Environmentally friendly devices are still a trend, and the very idea that it will no longer be necessary to pay for energy warmed my soul.  The package even included slots for various phone models, and at that time I was interested in fine charging from Nokia. <br><br>  The trend, however, turned out to be completely inoperative.  Recharge from the sun was, but the charge was enough for a short time, it seems, the phone battery did not even show changes.  In addition, charging worked through time, and therefore the device flew quite quickly into the basket. <br><br>  As time went on, I got the BlackBerry PlayBook and the Nokia N950, and in general, devices made according to the formula of a single charger became more common.  Life has become easier, life has become easier - you can take charge from one phone and attach it to another.  Although, the problem with the short battery life has not disappeared anywhere.  As a result, a new charge was found on eBay that can work with a modern port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbb/129/147/dbb1291479f6ea0179fd562872a7ed96.jpg"><br><br>  I decided not to go for experiments, I just took something that can stupidly get energy not from the sun, but via USB, and then return it at the right moment.  The choice fell on the white-colored device with eBay.  However, as you already understood, nothing worked.  Nokia charged for about 30 seconds, then it stopped.  Then you can again remove and insert the device, and again wait 30 seconds.  However, I quickly got tired of such a strategy, and the PlayBook refused to work with the novelty at all. <br><br><h2>  Nokia DC-16 </h2><br>  My failures in the field of shopping charge ended when I saw that the promised DC-16 was being sold in Finland at the beginning of the year in Finland.  In general, strange metamorphosis occurred to him during this time.  For example, judging by Google, the description stupidly disappeared from the official site, well, there is no such and that's it, but the description remains in the press release: <br>  <a href="http://press.nokia.com/products/559/nokia-universal-portable-usb-charger-dc-16/">press.nokia.com/products/559/nokia-universal-portable-usb-charger-dc-16</a> <br><br>  And even in Nokia Conversations: <br>  <a href="http://conversations.nokia.ru/2012/03/novyie-aksessuaryi-nokia/">conversations.nokia.ru/2012/03/novyie-aksessuaryi-nokia</a> <br><br>  The approximate price of 29 euros did not stop me, because it was already clear that all the crafts with eBay are completely non-working, and from Nokia we can expect that it will at least work, maybe it will apply to various devices of different companies.  So it turned out.  The store bought this absolutely small and light package: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/feb/942/f84/feb942f84f35f47a4e248c1596ecaeaa.jpg"><br><br>  There was nothing superfluous in it.  Namely, the device itself, as well as a USB-wire, which on the one hand connects to USB, and on the other to micro-USB.  It can be removed and inserted from the other side.  Thus, it can be charged or charged by itself.  However, I usually charge this device directly from the mains, because it is faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/391/712/ab1/391712ab16c3ed728c6ed6d6e3853644.jpg"><br><br>  By itself, it is a tube, which is quite light and can be held in the hand, although someone will probably say that it can be hard for this kind of device.  In turn, I put it in my bag, because I don‚Äôt notice it at all and only take it out when I need it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a79/855/715/a7985571553215a54224cfc486e98594.jpg"><br><br>  To check at what stage is the charge, you can use special LEDs.  They are triggered automatically during the immediate process, and at rest you can check the status by clicking next to the LEDs, then they light up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/38f/e00/d65/38fe00d65809864d16d7f2390e1fc88c.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted separately, as you can see, I bought charging in blue, as the most interesting.  In general, recently something pulls on the blue color.  However, for fans of other colors there is a line of colors in the style of Lumia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/688/c46/9eb/688c469eb22f3fee9d61c43989b58386.jpg"><br><br>  The device is charged up to 5 hours, but this is not a problem at all, because it happens much less often than a mobile phone sits down, and no one ever used it as a main source of power, so discharging takes place slowly in practice. <br><br>  While writing, I noticed that the text on the Nokia DC-16 is shorter than the background.  However, it is easy to explain this by the fact that my torment with Chinese handicrafts was long, and the Nokia charge just works like a clock. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Video from Galileo by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kuber/" class="user_link">kuber</a> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/99tk4whBRq4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg7h_V4dOUl1-5nr2JORIaUonT4Qg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147836/</a></p>
