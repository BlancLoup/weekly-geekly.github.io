We received your letter </h4><br>  Every time someone sends you an e-mail, you must notify him of the receipt in order to get rid of the anxiety ‚ÄúHave they received or not?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhen will they answer?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  We just received your request.  We will contact you as soon as possible.  Record your ticket number # 1234567.  Use it in further correspondence.

      Support team </blockquote><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Have you ever heard the word ‚Äúthank you‚Äù? </li><li>  The words ‚Äúinquiry‚Äù and ‚Äúcorrespondence‚Äù are too formal, unless, of course, you are writing to the Presidential Administration. </li><li>  Instead of making the customer worry about the ticket number, let him simply reply to this email to update the ticket. </li><li>  Personalization is important!  Even if you are part of a large support team, send email on your behalf. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Thank you for your message!  This is an automatic reply so you know that we have received your letter.  I will reply you soon. <br>  Thank! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  2. Requests for new features that you are not working on right now </h4><br>  Each team receives wishes.  If you are not actively working on them, so inform the client.  Be honest, otherwise customers will go to your competitors. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, support! <br>  I was looking for this feature and could not find it.  Do you have it?  If not, could you add it to the list of offers? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Thank you for sending us your wish.  We receive a lot of requests every day, so not able to answer all.  But know that we are reviewing every offer. <br><br>  Feel free to let us know if you have any questions or comments. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Thank them for using your application and offering ideas, not just ‚Äúsending‚Äù them, this is not the right word to use. </li><li>  Surely you do not study "every" sentence.  Throw out this phrase, because it is probably a lie. </li><li>  The last paragraph is too formal again.  Be more alive! </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  Thank you for using our app! <br>  We haven‚Äôt added this feature yet.  But I think this is a great idea!  With her, definitely &lt;write here why it would be great to implement&gt;. <br>  We are not working on this at the moment, but I will send your idea to the team, see what they say. <br><br>  If you have any other questions, just let me know and I will be happy to help.  Have a nice Tuesday! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  3. Requests for new features you are currently working on </h4><br>  Since you know that your team is working on this, report it to the client.  Even if you do not know the deadlines for implementation, the client will like that you are working on this new feature. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, support! <br><br>  I was looking for this feature and could not find it.  Do you have it?  If not, could you add it to the list of offers? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Thank you for sending us your wish.  We receive a lot of requests every day, so not able to answer all.  But know that we are reviewing every offer. <br><br>  Feel free to let us know if you have any questions or comments. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Exactly the same answer as the previous letter. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  Thank you for using our app! <br>  We have not added this feature yet.  But I think this is a great idea!  We really liked it so much that we recently started working on its implementation.  While I can not name the exact date, but judging by the latest update, we are already close to its launch. <br>  If you have any other questions, just let me know and I will be happy to help.  Have a nice Tuesday! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  4. Browser issues </h4><br>  Often there are problems with the behavior of the browser itself.  Outdated version, full cache and god knows what else.  Here's how to clarify this issue. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, support! <br>  My browser does not show your site in the correct format.  Looks like all colors, backgrounds and fonts are moving out.  What's the matter? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Usually, when this happens, it means that the data in the browser is damaged.  Could you try a hardware update and clean the cache?  This will help correct the situation. <br>  Let me know if this does not help. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  You have his name, use it! </li><li>  "Is the data corrupted", "hardware update", "clean the cache"?  Avoid difficult words. </li><li>  Make sure you give clear instructions on what to do with the browser.  Give a link to the support page, this will work best. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  This is definitely a strange situation!  I think there may be problems with the browser.  Could you try cleaning the cache, cookies and restarting it?  I know it sounds scary, but I have instructions that will help you. <br><br>  If after that does not work, you can try another browser?  So we understand, the reason is really in the browser or something else. <br><br>  If this doesn't help, or you have questions, just let me know and I'll be glad to help! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  5. Extensions on the way </h4><br>  Considering that many different extensions can be installed in the browser, one of them can become an obstacle to the operation of your application. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, support! <br>  My browser does not show your site in the correct format.  Looks like all colors, backgrounds and fonts are moving out.  What's the matter?  The only thing I did was update the browser extension in the morning. <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  It seems that this is due to the browser extension.  Talk to browser support to see what's wrong. <br>  Let me know if this does not help. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Comment</b> <br><ul><li>  Do not shift the responsibility.  In the end, help than you can. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi Ivan! <br>  Sorry for the problems with the display of the application!  If this happens after updating the browser, it may be a problem.  Could you cancel the update and then tell me if everything is fixed?  If the reason is in the browser, I will write to our developers, and they will see what can be done about it. <br><br>  Thank! <br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  6. Supported by new browser version only </h4><br>  As soon as browsers become better and better, your team begins to abandon support for the old ones.  Just explain why and encourage the client to upgrade to the latest version.  It is in his and your interest. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  I was offered to upgrade my browser from Internet Explorer 8 to 9. I would not want to do that.  Maybe there is some other browser compatible with your application? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Good afternoon, Ivan! <br>  In order for the application to work better, you need to run it in IE9, and not your current browser.  I apologize for the inconvenience. <br><br>  If you have questions, write. <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Explain why you support only specific browsers.  But in a way that they can understand. </li><li>  Stay away from the expression "inconvenience."  Right now, the client cannot use your application, because it has an old browser.  This is not just uncomfortable, this is a real problem.  It's like being locked out in your car. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  Thank you for using our program! <br>  Our application was created with the support of modern browsers, so we stopped support for older versions: they simply can not provide the same speed.  Support in these older browsers will mean that we cannot optimize our interfaces or provide advanced features to clients in our application ‚Äî this will mean slower progress, even less progress, and in some cases no progress.  We want to provide the best quality of the application for the vast majority of our customers, but support in older browsers would not let us move forward. <br>  Check for compatibility with browsers here. <br>  If you have any other questions, just let me know and I will be happy to help.  Have a nice Tuesday! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  7. Letters are blocked by firewall </h4><br>  If the client has a fairly strict firewall, email notifications from your application may be blocked. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  I no longer receive email notifications from your forum.  What's happening? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi Ivan, <br>  Follow these tips to fix the problem: <br><br>  1. Make sure that you have configured notification options. <br>  2. Check spam to make sure that the letters coming from us do not fall into this folder.  If there are any, don't forget to add our email domain to your safe senders list in your email account. <br>  3. If the letters do not arrive, please contact your provider to make sure that they do not block the traffic coming from us. <br><br>  If the problem persists, please let us know. <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  First, do not write like a robot.  But I think you can hear what sounds like a soulless robot. </li><li>  Go ahead and give them the IP addresses with instructions on how to transfer them to the IT department.  It will take time, but IT professionals can make sure.  that nothing is blocked from this address. </li><li>  If none of this helps, check the email logs and see if you are sending emails correctly.  With IT logs can always help. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  Sorry for the email trouble. <br>  Please, please check that both &lt;e-mail addresses&gt; are in the white list of your mail server.  Sometimes our forum notifications can get into spam filters.  Domain and IP from which messages are sent: [[insert domain / IP address here]]. <br>  If you send me a link to a message that you didn‚Äôt receive a notification, but should have, I would love to see our event log and follow the email path.  This will help IT professionals understand what the problem is. <br>  Thank! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  8. Online only </h4><br>  Customers will ask about using your application when they are on a plane or where there is no Internet access. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  Is your cable TV app available online only?  What if I don't have internet access? <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, <br>  Our application is only available online at the moment.  Sorry for the inconvenience. <br><br>  Please reply to this email if you have any questions. <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Again the phrase about "inconvenience" </li><li>  Show some sympathy.  Don't just unsubscribe. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  At the moment, you can watch the series only with an internet connection.  I understand how it can upset.  I myself do not have access to the Internet on weekends and know what to miss a series.  Yesterday, finally, I downloaded a new episode, and I hope that I will watch it soon! <br>  If you have any other questions, please reply to this email and I will be happy to help.  Have a good weekend! <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  9. Criticism <br>  You will always receive letters from disgruntled customers criticizing your product.  Some of them are similar, some have their own specifics.  Here is the best way to deal with them. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Your phone service is bullshit. <br><br>  Ivan </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, <br>  Sorry for the inconvenience with our service.  What exactly is not working for you?  I will pass it on to our specialists. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Say you are sorry.  You are here to help people, do not make them angry, starting not with that. </li><li>  Specify what they like and what they don't like.  This will help you understand how they use your service. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello, Ivan! <br>  I'm sorry, I apologize for making our service useless!  What did you like and dislike about it?  I will be more than happy if we can help in any way. <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  10. Gratitude </h4><br><br>  If you do your job correctly, each ticket will be completed to the end.  Do not leave your customers unanswered, even if you have already solved the question. <br><br>  <b>Ticket</b> <br><blockquote>  Hello! <br>  It is done!  Thanks for helping me fix everything! <br><br>  Petya </blockquote><br><br>  <b>poorly</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, Petya. <br>  We are glad that we were able to correct the problem.  Write if you have any questions. <br><br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Remarks</b> <br><ul><li>  Again the corporate robot wrote a letter </li><li>  Have fun!  Leave a memory of yourself, make him smile. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Good</b> <br><blockquote>  Hi, Peter! <br>  Great!  We are glad that everything was fixed. <br>  Just remember our email if you need help.  (Well, help with our application. I have no idea where you can relax in Alaska). <br><br>  Petya Ivanov, <br>  Support team </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  So, tips and tricks to use when writing answers to customers. <br><br>  <b>Use the name!</b> <br>  Customers like it better when they say ‚ÄúHello, Ivan!‚Äù Than the standard ‚ÄúHello!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHello‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Thank for using the application</b> <br>  The client usually has many options, but he chose you.  Thank him sincerely. <br><br>  <b>Talk like they</b> <br>  Do not use official vocabulary and words that you will not use in real life. <br><br>  <b>Write as you could write to a friend</b> <br>  Use short sentences.  Break long phrases into short ones.  Customers read the letter, not the novel. <br><br>  <b>If you can, tell us about the new features.</b> <br>  This will show that your team is constantly working on the application. <br><br>  <b>End the letter on a positive note.</b> <br>  ‚ÄúGood Friday!‚Äù - the specific date in the last line will make the client understand that you are a living person and are responding on that day. <br><br>  These "good" letters do not pretend to be the ultimate truth, it is not necessary to copy them. <br>  The main thing is to learn how to talk with customers using bad and good examples.  Be yourself, do not forget that you are the voice of your company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/248311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/248311/</a></p>
