  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crowd Democracy, Third Industrial, We will not keep up with the price and other top topics of April 2007</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Between Scylla and Charybdis</b> <br><br>  Many events of this month once again drew attention to the problem of the inconsistency between freedom of speech and the information correctness of social (social) sites.  Two of them occurred at the entrance and exit frontiers of April.  This, respectively, appeared the draft rulebook (Code of Honor) for bloggers and a revolution on the news site Digg. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Rudeness battle.</b>  The Code of Honor establishes the rules by which bloggers will be encouraged to lead discussions and argue.  The authors of the project are the inventor of the term Web 2.0 Tim O'Reilly and the creator of the free encyclopedia Wikipedia Jimmy Wales.  They said they plan to create not one, but three different sets of rules for bloggers who will differ slightly from each other.  The working version of the first set of rules consists of seven points, the main of which (from my point of view) is: ‚ÄúWe will not tell our network interlocutor what they wouldn‚Äôt dare to tell him at a personal meeting‚Äù.  With a slight modification, the Code of Honor can be extended to collective information self-service sites.  I have only one question left here.  Are the authors of the Code confident that users of public networks will never abuse each other during an in-person meeting?  I, personally, doubt it.  Although ... see below the topic "When the foam falls." <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>mob democracy?</b>  A revolution on Digg, a site that allows users to link, rate and comment on news and other web-based information, occurred after his administration removed the most popular post since the resource‚Äôs existence.  This post contained a link to information on how to crack the high-resolution DVD copy protection (HD DVD).  After removing this and many similar messages, outraged users "threw" Digg with other messages and comments to them.  In this case, the intensity of the input stream led to periodic disruptions in the work of the resource.  All this lasted until the owner of Digg appealed to the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù with a fiery appeal, in which he promised not to do anything like that in the future.  And here I, like many observers, have a question.  And what will Digg do when lawsuits are poured on it, as is happening now with Google and its YouTube? <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Radish you!</b>  <b>or where to send a bad person?</b>  Two criminal cases, both related to Live Journal, are being considered in Russia.  One of them - according to the statement of State Duma Deputy Alknisa.  He blames the blogger, who in the comments on the deputy‚Äôs blog sent him somewhere very far away.  I have a twofold feeling for this news.  On the one hand, politically Alknis is very unsympathetic to me since the time of perestroika.  However, on the other hand, I am a staunch opponent of rudeness on the Internet.  Therefore, of two evils, of course, I choose the first: Alknis, you are not my friend, but the Internet is more expensive! <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Talkers in the ranks!</b>  The locks on the Internet continue to strengthen.  Turkey has also joined the list of countries that have introduced censorship on the Web [9831].  Many government agencies, even in the most democratic countries, have begun to impose various restrictions on the use of social networks.  For example, the US Department of Defense banned servicemen from starting their own blogs without the knowledge of their superiors.  The official explanation is the possibility of leakage of secret information.  One can only guess about the unofficial one (against the background of the Iraqi events).  Government employees in some Canadian provinces at work are now strictly forbidden to use public sites.  What they are worse in this regard than other Internet resources, I do not know.  Maybe just popular?

      <b>Public web: it's time to maturity.</b> <br><br>  Many other news in April were related to Web 2.0. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Happy birthday to blogs!</b>  This month is the first anniversary of this phenomenon.  Ten years ago, the first Internet blog Scripting News appeared.  Its author Dave Weiner (Dave Winer) can be considered the first blogger of the planet. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>When the foam subsides.</b>  I don‚Äôt know if it was accidental, but it was in the very same month that an article appeared with a very interesting analysis of the state of the world blogosphere.  Its main conclusion: the popularity of blogs falls.  This is what gave skeptics a new impulse in the complaints about the bubbles of Web 2.0.  I, being a moderate conservative in engineering, am a supporter of another point of view.  In accordance with it, all the directions of the new Internet should go through the natural stages of the formation of any technical project: hype, confusion, understanding and rejection, stabilization, development.  Blog is the first web swallow 2.0.  Therefore, it is here earlier than in its other directions that we see a transition from the stages of sensation and confusion to the stages of understanding, rejection and stabilization. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Professional time.</b>  The pigtail girl, a typical blogger of the passing times, being carried away by new web toys, begins to give way to serious ‚Äúcontent carriers‚Äù.  Among them are large companies with their corporate blogs.  I look forward to the stages of growing up and other social areas of Web 2.0.  For example, IBM this month announced the Social Networking program, designed for millions of professionals.  By the way, that's when the time of the Code of Honor comes. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>And what about Runet?</b>  In this case, certainly by chance, but again, it seems that a report on the Russian blogosphere was published specially for the anniversary.  According to the report, about 80% of journalists are familiar with the blogosphere, and more than half read blogs regularly and systematically.  PR-professionals, for their part, are also well aware of the possibilities of the blogosphere, but it is still relatively rare to include blogs among their work sites.  Despite the fact that readers are generally skeptical about information from the blogosphere, each of them usually has a certain list of blogs that are more trusted than a similar reading circle in traditional media. <br><br>  <b>Outsourcing: the future is coming ...</b> <br><br>  The stage of understanding comes in the field of global outsourcing. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>The third industrial.</b>  It is this, speaking of global outsourcing, says the famous economist Alan Blinder (Alan Blinder), whose point of view is discussed by the author of a very interesting analytical article published this month by the Financial Post. As you know, the first industrial revolution, which took place from the 1770s to the 1860s . was associated with the creation of a steam engine.  The beginning of the second (information technology) revolution falls on the middle of the last century.  According to A. Blinder, the enormous influence of outsourcing on the development of the economy of the 21st century, as well as on the state of demography, politics and culture of the whole world, suggests that this phenomenon is quite revolutionary. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Fifth column in Indian.</b>  Continuing the theme of industrial revolutions, we can say that the leader of the first one was Britain, the second was America.  As for the third, she clearly has an Indian face.  Recently in the USA ‚ÄúIndian motives‚Äù began to sound in conversations about the fate of work visas.  In addition to the aspects already mentioned, Americans are increasingly alarmed by the fact that Indian specialists who have received H-1B visas are using their stay in the United States to establish the necessary contacts.  In this case, the focus is on the client base of US companies in which they temporarily work.  In one way or another, the leading outsourcing companies in India, Infosys, Wipro, Tata and others, are engaged in lobbying visas for their fellow citizens.  It is here, but for a permanent job, and Indian specialists are returning.  Comments, I think, are superfluous. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Microelectronics in line.</b>  As a second advantage of internships in American companies, Indians see an increase in their technological culture.  It is precisely because of this that India began to lead in the outsourcing of work requiring very high and fairly specific qualifications.  In particular, this development and research in the field of microelectronics.  If in the early stages engineering outsourcing to India was limited to computer-oriented tracing and placement when designing integrated circuits, then Intel recently admitted that out of the 3,000 staff of its Indian center, 2900 are directly involved in research and functional design of BIS. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>We ourselves with a mustache.</b>  For so many reasons, such a Russian Intel is unlikely to take place.  Russia, like Ukraine, continues to rely on programmer outsourcing.  Of course, India is still far away, but progress is still obvious.  An IDC study published this month argues that the advantage of Russian outsourcing companies is not only cheap labor, but also a high level of specialists, and most importantly (compared to India) that the West attracts, this is cultural proximity. <br><br>  <b>And what else?</b> <br><br>  A few words about other facts that the professionals spoke about: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>SaaS - offensive on all fronts:</b> <br>  - The SaaScon conference last month, according to 11230, 10115 of many analysts, finally drew a line in the dispute "To be or not to be SaaS?", Unequivocally answering to Be! <br>  - Microsoft has officially announced that all its new projects will, to varying degrees, include elements of SaaS <br>  - Every day more and more new software applications are moving to this area, for example, for recruiting <br>  - It is time for organizations and professionals specializing in IT services to start preparing for a new era.  Confirmed by the predictions of many that SaaS may be the most demanded precisely for small business. Due to the growing popularity of the new trend, there has been increased talk about the need to replace the very SaaS term with something more harmonious, for example, webware.  I'm afraid it's too late ... <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>M &amp; A - we will not pay for the price:</b> <br>  - In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe same SaaS this month, new deals were made by Microsoft, Oracle and SAP, which once again confirms the above conclusion about the prospects of this direction in programming <br>  - Bought another popular Web 2.0 resource, this time representative of the first Internet wave.  EBay Web Auction Buys StubleUp Bookmarks Website <br>  - Internal consolidation of businesses is also taking place.  For example, Technorati, the leader in search and ranking of blogs, buys The Personal Bee news aggregator to ‚Äúenhance the social functions‚Äù of its resource. <br>  - Reuter has acquired a company specializing in specialized search engines ClearForest <br>  - In connection with the tendency of movement of advertising flows in the Internet, its leaders rushed to buy advertising companies.  Yahoo buys Right Media, and Google pays a record $ 1.65 billion for DoubleClick, almost three times the amount Microsoft offered. <br>  - The latter, in turn, together with the WPP Group is going to buy advertising online company 24/7 Real Media, more than a billion dollars <br>  - By the way, Microsoft previously intercepted TellMe (voice recognition) from Google, opening a new front in the fight with its main rival, now in the field of mobile search. <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>Distribution of Webby.</b>  Winners of the Webby Award, one of the most prestigious awards for Internet projects, have become known.  This year, as last year, the BBC website was named the best news resource, Last.FM was recognized as the best music project, and Flickr received the award for the best community.  LinkedIn recognized as the best social network jury of Webby Awards (the audience award went to Facebook) <br><br>  <b>And for a snack ... Everything will be there ?!</b> <br><br>  The popularity of the Second Life website is growing.  Figures published this month show that the population of this virtual world has already exceeded 6 million inhabitants.  Of these, about a third lead a rather active life here.  Gradually, this space, the first users of which viewed it only as another playground, acquires more and more features of the real world.  Naturally, businesses rushed here.  Here are just some of the big companies that already have their ‚Äúrepresentative offices‚Äù here: Dell, Adidas, Nissan, Sun Microsystems, Reebok, Penguin, American Apparel, Reuters, CNET Networks, PA Consulting, Yankee Stadium, Bartle Bogle Hegarty.  In April, a virtual office of the Brazilian airline appeared in Second Life, and the chain of electronics stores Best Buy opened a computer assistance department here.  According to Mass High Tech, there are also employment agencies on the threshold.  According to a Gartner forecast published in April, by the end of 2011, 80% of active Internet users and almost all Fortune 500 companies will be present in the virtual world of Second Life. <br><br>  <i>The full note (with all links) is published at <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D14436">www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=14436</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8146/</a></p>
