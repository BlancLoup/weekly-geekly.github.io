And today, after an hour of communication with our lead programmer Alexander Yanyshyn, I once again became convinced of this and even thought about programming courses.  But then she decided that English was nevertheless more necessary ... and more realistic. <br><br>  I had to be like Sasha, but still the well-thought-out wording ‚Äúinterview for Habr‚Äù had some almost magical effect.  And this morning, over three cups of coffee, everything finally happened.  For what, Sasha, thank you so much. <br><br>  I cite everything almost literally.

      <i><b>- Sash, what is Action Desk doing?</b></i> <br>  - Light, you probably faced, more than once, with the support service of some company.  Take, for example, your provider whom you call in case of problems with the Internet.  So, your call was received, recorded and transferred to work.  But the employee - for one reason or another - does not take it in execution.  Maybe he has a headache or a girl dropped it.  And you're at home - nervous, because you have your urgent plans - download the sixteenth episode of the sixth season of Dr. House.  And you call the support service again, swear, complain to the boss and try to get the solution to your problem off the ground.  One or two such cases and what will you do?  The fact that all other normal people - to look for another provider that quickly responds to your requests. <br><br>  However, in my experience, finding such is very difficult - almost impossible.  In order for the support service to work clearly, the operator needs to know to whom to distribute this or that operation, taking into account the employee‚Äôs work schedule, his job duties, the load level, etc. In addition, constant monitoring of the boss is required.  In order to unambiguously solve the problem of ‚Äúhanging up‚Äù tasks / appeals, an automatic dispatcher at the <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/tour/8/">Action Desk</a> was invented. <br><br>  <i><b>- How it works?</b></i> <br>  - In essence, <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/">SolverMate</a> is a diary combined with the main working processes of a service company, and the <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/tour/8/">Action Desk</a> allows you to visually present tasks, sorting and distributing them automatically. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Thus, each employee always has a list of tasks and tasks before his eyes - right now.  At the same time, all meetings and tasks are distributed in a single timeline - one person and only two hands.  All cases are sorted by urgency - depending on the time of the request and the terms of the contract with the client, in the case of approaching the deadlines of the task, it rises higher and higher in the list.  All that did not have time today - automatically switches to the next day with an increase in priority. <br><br><img src="http://www.solvermate.ru/upload/habr/actiondesk2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Update <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/tour/8/">Action Desk</a> occurs every minute - and the dispatcher does not work with appeals / tasks, but with operations.  He finds all operations that are not taken into work, distributes between employees and allocates time for execution (the required time is set in the system).  If the operation was not completed on time, the automatic dispatcher takes away the operation and on the basis of some rules redistributes it to another executor. <br><br><img src="http://www.solvermate.ru/upload/habr/settings2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i><b>- What are the rules?</b></i> <br>  - Sveta, imagine yourself as a support manager.  Every day a lot of operations fall on you, and here you sit over it and think about whom to charge.  Yeah, the first step - there is a schedule of employees, we take those who are now working.  And here it turns out that the one you chose is busy solving a problem with one of the key customers.  The task returns and you are again thinking about what to do with it.  And this thought process of yours takes a lot of time and consumer patience. <br><br><img src="http://www.solvermate.ru/upload/habr/services2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The automatic dispatcher offers a task to those who have the <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/tour/8/">Action Desk</a> freer by the workload required by the operations.  Thus, all other things being equal, there remains a small list of employees to whom this task may be distributed. <br><br>  <i><b>- And if I'm not in the office, but in the schedule there?</b></i> <br>  - In <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/tour/8/">Action Desk</a> there is a rigid binding to active sessions in the system.  The priority ones are those in the system - and the automatic dispatcher sees this. <br><br>  <i><b>- Where is this dispatcher located?</b></i> <br>  - He lives in the <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/">SolverMate</a> system and is written in the Java language. <br><br>  UPD: Correcting - here is the <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/">site SolverMate</a> , but the <a href="https://chipndale.solvermate.ru/auth/%3Fone_click%3D32%26signature%3De0ee892a34cf7944286f0b56f728addcdb72f82e">demo access to the system</a> without registration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91625/</a></p>
