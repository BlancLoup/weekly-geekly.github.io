  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oh flat!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone has heard about making money on the Internet, but very few people really tried to earn money on the Web seriously.  Probably, in order to make cardinal changes in a person‚Äôs life, something is needed that would make him look at everything with different eyes. <br><br>  Four years ago, I led a measured lifestyle, went to work, got my honestly earned money, and didn‚Äôt really ask myself ‚Äúwhat will happen tomorrow‚Äù.  My life has already been planned: to meet a good girl, bring her to her parents' house, arrange my room for two, and eventually, for three.  I was well aware that my then making money does not leave me the opportunity to buy a car, go abroad, and even more so, I have no chance of finding my own housing. <br><br>  Everything changed on the day when the boss called me into the office and, without a single emotion in his voice, said: "We are forced to cut you down."  It was useless to argue, just like looking for a new job.  But, I was looking for.  Month, second, third.  I visited dozens of sites dedicated to the issue of employment.  I sent hundreds of my resumes, and my phone was treacherously silent.

      For the first time about earnings on the Internet, I read in a blog of one of the users of the Network.  Speaking to his readers about how to increase their earnings on websites, he mentioned <a href="http://thegreenppc.com/">The Green PPC</a> affiliate program.  By that time, work on the Internet no longer seemed unreal to me.  Having grasped the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãvirtual earnings, like a saving straw, I plunged into the study of the issue. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not without surprise, I discovered for myself the fact that working on the Internet long ago brings people considerable results.  I will not hide, I was seized with anger, anger at myself.  While I was vegetating with my beggarly salary, someone was raising his earnings on the sites.  Yes, why am I worse? <br><br>  And spun, it started!  I read the article of the blogger <a href="http://blog.dimok.ru/green-labell-ppc-samaya-zelenaya-ppc-partnerka">Dimka</a> again, read the reviews of other users of this affiliate program and decided it was - was not. <br>  Half a year before that, for fun, I opened my diary on the web.  The perennial passion for collecting miniature car models found a response in my notes.  My diary was visited daily, and I decided to use this in order to get my earnings. <br><br>  For the first couple of months, my earnings on the sites amounted to 2 times more than my salary.  It took me another 2 months to stabilize the money earnings, gradually increasing it.  Work on the Internet was boiling.  I developed my diary, switched to another topic and earning money, opened a couple more new sites, invested part of the money I had previously earned in their promotion and promotion, and waited for the result. <br><br>  Today, 3 years after all the events, I sit in a computer chair, drink the best sort of English tea with cognac, and enjoy the results of my work.  I bought a one-room apartment, spent a major overhaul in it, and because The Green PPC brought me a steady income, I feel confident in the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113282/</a></p>
