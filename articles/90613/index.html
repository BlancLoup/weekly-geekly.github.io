In the end, this resulted in an entirely home-made locker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a99/676/d37/a99676d37266d98ca44f332fc8e1d7ed.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  At first, my thoughts were spinning around a variant with a normal 19 "server cabinet or rack. The minuses are that the rack is ugly and the cabinet is too large and again it‚Äôs not aesthetically pleasing in the room. Plus, they are hard to find for cash.

      For this, there are 19 "music stands on sale. They are prettier, they fit perfectly into the interior. However, they usually have carrying perforations only in the front, and for fixing the shelves I need on both sides. <br><br>  In the end, all these searches had to be abandoned.  In connection with the emergency relocation, I decided to make a computer "locker" on my own.  The money was running out, and for this I just figured out what boards I needed, bought them at a large building site, and sawed them in my layout. <br><br>  Here's what happened: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a72/c89/636/a72c89636cdaf40a081d06a5235acb2d.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Bottom left stock for different wiring.  In the closet: Modern PC, Pentium2 / VFX1, 486, Amiga 4000, Amiga 1200, Yamaha receiver and tv-tuner. <br><br>  The locker is mounted on wheels and can be easily rolled throughout the room (after disconnecting the wires). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c01/479/3c0/c014793c02c52e300993499143182054.jpg"><br>  From the bottom you can see a simple habik, you need to change it for something more rekovoe, but <br>  until good options come across. <br><br>  All shelves are installed on the sliding rails, perforations are made in the side racks, <br>  Shelves can be set at any height. In the side walls, holes were marked and drilled every 2U.  The truth then turned out that 2U is too rare, a lot of space disappears between the shelves, and drilled every 1U. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5de/9e2/905/5de9e2905b529aa5ed7e369ef1d479d3.jpg"><br><br>  Any of them can be extended to connect the cable to the computer, <br>  dig in the guts and the like <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f99/8d9/ce3/f998d9ce3fc6cc3391e6ab144886a127.jpg"><br><br>  In order that the shelf could be safely extended, all cables connected to computers have a cable reserve at the back.  I would like to do for the cables ‚Äúmanagement arm‚Äù, like in servers, but so far there is no good solution from the materials at hand, so <br>  the cable is fixed on the shelf, in front of it, and sagged in the middle. <br><br>  The shelves in the cabinet should not be at full depth, because  from the back of the cabinet, on both sides of the shelves, all the wiring goes.  On one side of the power cable only: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e16/3e6/552/e163e65528b8e56733c71ba0852c15c3.jpg"><br><br>  On the opposite side, the layout of all information cables was made: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62e/215/9fe/62e2159fe34a8de84a00cdb896886536.jpg"><br>  Separate hardware for network and separately for audio / video cables. <br>  Platforms for screeds have been installed, but so far there are no reusable screeds on hand, so they are simply twisted with wires. <br><br>  Inside there is a small KVM Switch, it has one good advantage - besides the keyboard, the video and the mouse, it also switches the sound. <br><br>  Creature: <br><br>  Were bought the same sheets with a width of 600mm and a thickness of 18mm. <br>  At the base of the board is 630 * 600, sidewalls 600 * 1500, shelves 550 * 500. <br>  Bought actually for one run to the store. <br>  Houses are painted with the cheapest varnish, half a day for drying, a couple of hours for marking and drilling holes, a couple of hours for assembling and fitting. <br>  The sides are screwed to the base at the corners, the top cover on the furniture screws. <br>  To fix the shelves took retractable rails for boxes, a depth of 500mm.  On this shelf did the same 500mm in depth.  Fastened to the side walls with m5 bolts. <br><br>  Total: <br>  Maximum of equipment per less than square meter of housing.  There is a minimum of wires - only power is supplied to the cabinet, one keyboard / mouse / monitor and two wires to large speakers. <br>  Plus, the wardrobe in terms of colors fits well with the rest of the interior in the room - wooden bookshelves, desk, etc. <br>  It is worth noting that this is not a complete version: First of all, I want to find a suitable size piece of plexiglass and make a front door.  Also, there is a lot of dust in residential buildings, so there is an idea to make a window for the air with a filter from the bottom, and put a couple of large fans on top at low revs. <br>  Ideas and criticism are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90613/</a></p>
