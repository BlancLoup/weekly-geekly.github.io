  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Age of New Advertising (The New AD Age)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Social advertising knows everything about you.  And this is not necessarily a bad thing. <br><br><img src="http://img.pixs.ru/storage/0/7/2/HatImagejp_5496078_498072.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Throughout most of its history, advertising has had one-to-many experience.  Everyone sees tezhe ads in the print press or when driving past billboards on the freeway.  Magazine ads are based on the demographics of the subscribers of the publication, but each reader sees the same thing. <br>  The development of the Internet has fundamentally changed advertising.  For the first time, advertising can be customized according to individual preferences.  This key change, along with innovations from Facebook and Google, gave rise to social advertising.  Social advertising is the practice of targeting online advertising to specific individuals.  This technique began in 2003, when Google acquired the advertising software company Applied Semantics, which helped Google to improve the art of advertising by keywords.  You are looking for something and the keyword targeting algorithm leaves no doubt that the advertisement you see fits the search subject. <br>  But this is only half the story.  While Google‚Äôs approach gained power, it didn‚Äôt take personal accounts, preferences, and frendship into account ‚Äî everything that influences a buying decision.  This type of information remained inaccessible until the development of social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace. <br><img src="http://img.pixs.ru/storage/0/7/7/BelowImage_1966855_498077.jpg" alt="image"><br>  When people register on these sites they are asked to enter information about their musical preferences, hometown, education.  They build an online network by adding friends or accepting friend requests.  Information about the personal network of interactions is called a social graph. <br>  Now this social and personal information, along with the goals of the keywords, is used to create the most relevant advertising ever created. <br>  If you look at Facebook, you will see ads based on where you live, what university you attended.  Social advertising will become more and more wise, taking into account more and more of such factors in your account. <br>  Computers have begun to push the format of online advertising of the past.  Banners advertising clicked less and less.  And more time is spent on social networks.  From 2008 to 2009, the amount of time Americans spend on social networks has tripled, which is part of the reason why social advertising has increased by more than 100%.  Advertisers see the most effective way to reach a growing audience.  For many, however, social advertising raises the issue of privacy.  Do we want advertising that our favorite TV show knows?  Should companies be able to view our browsing history to improve the pitches of a product? <br>  Facebook Beacon, an experimental advertising program launched in 2007, allowing companies such as Sony and eBay to publish the buying activity of people on their Facebook profile, in the hope that their friends should see this and make the same purchase. <br>  Users rebelled, and a lawsuit was filed, which ultimately led to the death of the program.  Consumers do not want to publish all their purchases and do not trust companies with access to personal information or their social graphs. <br>  Nevertheless, while Beacon personifies our struggle with the rapid rise of social advertising, this incident is the exception rather than the rule.  Privacy technologies continue to improve, while society is adapting to the world of fleeting digital information.  You are still choosing the information that you place online, and those who see it.  At first, we are often afraid of a new technology, but its adoption in its own favor becomes obvious.  With social advertising is not otherwise.  Socially targeted advertising is the improvement of traditional advertising.  When you watch television, you are flooded with commercials for goods that you will never think about buying.  What if this ad is focused on your hobby and actual need?  Watching television is not only less painful, but also personally relevant. <br>  RockYou, a social application developer, is a good example of how this type of advertising works.  Using targeted social advertising, she was able to help an online game attract 1.5 million users in one month.  Even more impressively, she helped the yogurt company create a successful ad targeting women living 5 miles from Whole Foods. <br>  And this is only the beginning: we add more information to social networks - advertising will become smarter and more refined.  In fact, social advertising helps us discover the products and services that we really want through understanding who we are and what kind of purchases we prefer.  In the future, the difference between advertising and information will be small.  In addition, social advertising allows Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and many other websites to remain free.  Although there are still a lot of difficulties, we should not be afraid of a future in which advertising may eventually become an integral and useful part of our life, rather than an invasion.  We are in the midst of a social and advertising revolution that is rapidly growing, while the traditional forms of advertising are in the past.  Obsessive advertising comes to an end, and it will make our lives better. <br><br>  <i>Ben Parr, co-editor of the Mashable.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Original taken from PlayBoy (USA) for March 2010, p. 128.</i>

      <b>From myself</b> I just want to add that I liked the article for its originality, it convinces us of the usefulness of social advertising, which significantly differs from the opinions on advertising in general.  The author of the article, it seemed to me, calls for a waiver (within reason) of confidentiality in the social.  networks, which is also a controversial issue.  In general, I thought that there was something to think about and published a translation, despite the article already on the site.  The article is sharpened by a foreign audience, but this does not detract from its relevance to readers on Habr√©, and perhaps strengthens it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86320/</a></p>
