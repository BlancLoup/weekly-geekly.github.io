We were extremely pleased that all users met our development favorably and it was in demand - we received warm feedback and letters of thanks.  Moreover, colleagues from Yandex called our development the most beautiful mobile client for their service. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f7/5c1/6c5/3f75c16c502cbeabb9b048f2d63a059c.jpg" alt="image" width="300"><br><br>  We had Napoleon plans - we planned to make a version for tablets, watches and almost coffee makers :) There were a lot of ideas that we collected and carefully recorded to satisfy all the tastes of our users. <br><br>  But, after a while, we were overwhelmed by current problems and, having abandoned the development of the project, we focused on commercial projects that brought us real money.  Inertia continued to carry the project on the thumb, but changes in the versions of mobile operating systems, as well as in the specifications of the devices affected the work of some functions - and we were rained with reports asking to fix some minor flaws.  All this neatly evolved ‚Äúfor later‚Äù, because ‚Äúright now we will deal with matters and everything will be just super, then we will return to the project.‚Äù

      At one of the conferences held by Yandex, I talked with the guys who worked on the Metrics service.  We have a mutual interest - they get the project into the pool of mobile projects, and we monetize the history and make an interesting commercial project from the free application.  But I didn‚Äôt agree with Yandex - the vector of negotiations has changed, most likely due to internal changes in the company.  Thinking a little - we decided to close the project completely, which I <a href="https://www.facebook.com/alexey.poimtsev/posts/1001712686516215">wrote about on facebook</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e33/773/28e/e3377328e0b2486e61e4ff4467a6dc9b.jpg" alt="image" width="500"><br><br>  The project went to the archive.  For several months he was gathering dust, not bringing any benefit to anyone, and I regularly received letters ‚ÄúGuys, thank you ‚Äî everything is cool, but add pliz features and fix bugs.‚Äù  I replied that the project is down, there will be no support and generally ‚Äúgo away‚Äù :) <br><br>  But, you know, I decided that this is wrong.  As long as the project is demanded by people, even if you do not have the strength to deal with them - it must continue to develop.  And now I want to bring it to Open Source.  We are ready to review all your bug fixes and improvements, help you as much as possible, if you, colleagues, will be interested to continue the work that we began.  I hope that the output of the application in open access will give us new forces in the work on it. <br><br>  Until the end of the week we will lay out the source code in public access.  Currently, two main tasks are being solved: <br><br>  1 - cleaning the code from old artifacts (keys to the API, and so on) and easy cleaning of the code <br>  2 - issues license issues.  Most likely it will be a slightly modified L-GPL license. <br><br>  As I promised in the title - the project goes to the open source, the links are below (not yet working, I'll write separately when we make it publicly available). <br><br>  iOS - <a href="https://github.com/progress-engine/metrika_ios">https://github.com/progress-engine/metrika_ios</a> <br>  Android - <a href="https://github.com/progress-engine/metrika_android">https://github.com/progress-engine/metrika_android</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/276209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/276209/</a></p>
