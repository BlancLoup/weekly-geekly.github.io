  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Practical SMM or how NOT to conduct contests in social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a small Belarusian <a href="http://turi.by/">travel agency</a> .  And his leadership decided that it was necessary to keep pace with the times and step up work with social networks.  To do this, they took to the staff of the PR-box, created a page on Facebook and Vkontakte and waited for the result.  And when I got tired of waiting, in order to speed up the process, they decided to arrange a contest for their subscribers.  That's what came out of it... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  First of all, I‚Äôll make a reservation right away that the purpose of this publication is twofold - to share my small experience and problems in the process of holding a contest with the audience and try your hand at publishing on Habr√©.  Therefore, I ask you not to throw off the cliff right away from the cliff :), to finish reading to the end - I promise you buns, so beloved by SELF-DONE <s>tits,</s> at the end of the story. <br><br><h4>  Idea. </h4><br>  First of all, it was decided to follow the path of least resistance and cooperate with already existing groups in the national segment of Facebook.  This social network was chosen primarily for the fact that the audience there seemed to be the most targeted.  Vkontakte is too young and corrupted by a freebie, but Odnoklassniki did not make adequate tools for companies to work with their audience.

      The total audience of the Belarusian segment of Facebook at the moment is about 380 000 thousand, in the world ranking we are in 108th place, just between Angola and Haiti :) This is despite the fact that according to the latest data of all Internet users in Belarus 4.3 million, well and if you believe the official statistics of the Ministry of Statistics, then all 6.8 million :) <br><br>  Therefore, it is not surprising that in the most popular Belarusian group on Facebook there are only a little more than 10,000 ‚Äúfriends‚Äù.  This is despite the fact that most of them are "dead souls".  Therefore, the challenge for the competition was simple - to increase the number of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù by 500 in a month. Immediately I will explain where this figure came from: for two weeks, there was an advertising campaign using standard facebook tools - as a result, it was found that one new ‚Äúfriend‚Äù costs <b>33</b> cents. <br>  Therefore, with a prize fund equivalent to $ 250, simple arithmetic can be obtained a figure of <b>757</b> people, but considering the additional PR effect and attendant positive, work on building the brand and other <s>blah blah blah</s> arguments of the PR-manager, we agreed to round everything up to half a thousand. <br><br><h4>  The first pancake - a lump. </h4><br>  The mechanics of the competition was chosen the simplest.  Photo contest with the rest.  We chose a group of local photo services, in which 1,000 ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were noted, announced prizes for 2,000,000 Belarusian rubles and ... nothing ... SILENCE ... complete ... a day passed, second, week - 2-3 photos of our own friends were sent :( After that, I decided to intervene in the project, held several negotiations and as a result it was decided to connect the most popular tracker in Belarus to the competition, with the name, would you believe how - <a href="http://torr.by/">torrents.by</a> , hello cap! Evidence :) <br><br>  Accordingly, they decided to set the <a href="http://turi.by/foto">prize</a> also more specific - namely, a camera, actually a soap box, but, in our opinion, the best option for a holiday is the Fujifilm FinePix AV200. <br>  Then the people and threw it - on the first day the photos were sent four times more than the entire last week. <br><br><h4>  Not long music played </h4><br>  And then another problem arose, since the competition was held simultaneously in <a href="">facebook</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/club38132112">vkontakte</a> , a lot of time was spent on adding photos of participants.  They also began to vote actively, but most of all on VKontakte.  Facebook audience has traditionally been more restrained to the competition.  The number of friends slowly grew by 2-3 people per day, despite the fact that they voted in dozens.  Since in order to vote for a member to like our page it was not necessary, most of the audience did not.  As a result, the number of friends in both networks leveled off at level 200 and froze.  And then came the new trouble. <br><br><h4>  Clash of the Titans </h4><br>  More than a week in the competition was a modest amateur beer with a usual photo <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe5/dc9/afa/fe5dc9afa0a37c7d402bd8f23dbf9fda.jpg"><br>  - and here the heavyweights have joined the battle for the free camera :) <br><br>  One of them is the <a href="http://vk.com/alex_cheronko">leader of the</a> Chernobyl <a href="http://vk.com/alex_cheronko">group</a> , which has more than 64,000 members. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/977/1bd/214/9771bd214cf7418b563168bfde71c446.jpg"><br><br>  And the <a href="http://vk.com/s.techno">second</a> is a novice promoter and just a party-goer who just has a LOT of friends. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f2/0d0/d4a/7f20d0d4a9203f59defd3f4905406169.jpg"><br><br>  In the end, after literally three days of mutual ‚Äúraids‚Äù, insults, etc.  Both participants rejected the ‚Äúnobility‚Äù and began to agitate their friends about the voting so actively that they took the lead far ahead.  And the "party-goer" is almost 6 !!!  once overtook "Chernobyl" and now has almost 6,500 votes. <br><br><h4>  <b>Total.</b> </h4><br>  As a result, the comments to the contest flooded accusations of cheating, the dishonesty of the organizers, calls for disqualifications and early termination of the competition. <br>  The goals have not been achieved, and, although there is still 3 weeks ahead of the competition time, the algorithm of its conduct has completely discredited itself. <br><br>  The conclusions that are drawn from this sad experience: <br><ul><li>  <b>The main thing!</b>  Sometimes it's easier to just pay for ads. </li><li>  If you want to increase the number of "friends" of your page, in the mechanics of the "like" contest for yours should be a MANDATORY condition </li><li>  You should not mix audiences of different social networks </li><li>  Limit your audience by geography </li><li>  It is necessary to automate everything that is possible to minimize the time spent by employees. </li><li>  There are no ready-made tools for holding such events in either Vkontakte or Facebook: (Elementary, you‚Äôll have to revise everything to see the most popular photos </li></ul><br><br>  PS Currently we plan to transfer the vote to our site and try to reanimate the contest.  I will time constructive advice. <br><br>  As a positive remarks.  The photo below is the only one that aroused a keen interest in both soc.  networks.  100 people voted for her per day on Facebook (mostly Arabs for some reason), and three times more in contact :) <br><br>  The photo is called "Big eyes of my wife" <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/157/414/c94/157414c9453c6aca342818e56bc2ec32.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144490/</a></p>
