  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How much did the founders of YouTube earn</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is clear that the sale of a 20-month YouTube startup for $ 1.65 billion was supposed to pretty much replenish the cash accounts of the founders, investors and first employees of the company.  However, until yesterday we did not know the exact amount of their remuneration.  The answer came yesterday with an <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507022578/0001193125-07-022578.txt">official</a> Google <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507022578/0001193125-07-022578.txt">report</a> before the SEC commission.  The sums owed to these guys are huge, even by the standards of Silicon Valley. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most bold piece of the deal was received by co-founders of YouTube.  The company's founder and director, Chad Hurley, received 694,087 Google shares and an additional 41,232 shares on credit.  If we estimate on the basis of yesterday's closing price of $ 470.01, then this package costs <b>$ 345.6 million</b> . <br><br>  Another founder, Steven Chen (Steven Chen), received 625,366 shares immediately and 68,721 on credit (most likely, the second part of the shares is transferred when certain indicators are reached by YouTube), totaling <b>$ 326.2 million</b> . <br><br>  One can only envy the successful investors from the venture fund Sequoia Capital XI.  From November 2005 to April 2006, they invested only $ 11.5 million in a startup, and received <b>941,027</b> shares for a total of <b>$ 442.3 million</b> as a reward.  Venture fund Sequoia is considered one of the most successful in the world, it was also the leading investor of Google startup before its release on the stock exchange.

      If someone can be envied, then someone is quite the opposite.  It turns out that YouTube had a third co-founder, Jawed Karim, but he left it at the very beginning so as not to be distracted from studying at Stanford University, where he is studying computer science.  The student received 137,443 shares worth <b>$ 64.6 million</b> .  This is good money, but very little compared to other founders.  The price of the diploma was too high. <br><br>  About $ 83 million in shares received another venture capital fund Artis Capital Management, which also participated in the financing of a startup. <br><br>  At the time of selling YouTube in October 2006, the startup was less than two years old, and the company employed only about 70 employees.  Of these, about twenty people who were in the company almost from the very beginning are also listed in Google‚Äôs financial statements: they received several thousand Google shares each.  For example, a press secretary received 10,308 shares worth $ 4.8 million. Some programmers got even more.  The maximum stake went to leading programmer Yu Pan (75,593 shares worth $ 35.5 million). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1030/">The deal to buy YouTube</a> has become the largest in the history of Google. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3092/</a></p>
