      <i>(Flash application 1. Introverted world of one of our employees. You can click and play, and then continue reading. You can, and vice versa - first read and then play.)</i> <br><br>  Like many of you, we are promoting websites, and we are doing this only in legal ways.  We think this is right.  In this crazy and often cruel world, it is important to save face.  Not for the money.  For the sake of ordinary human dignity. <br><br>  We are sufficiently successful.  However, in the first place we always put not even work with the client, but attention to the employee.  You can lose a client, but you cannot lose a person, even the most insignificant, a person who works with the persistence of a geek.  Let's say this: if the client suddenly asks us to part with an employee who he does not like (there were such precedents), we would prefer to part with the client, no matter how much he blessed. <br><br>  Like Google or DreamWorks, our office is a web, in the center of which, in the Moscow office, sits the infernal leadership, and the villainous spider-web sits at the edges, in St. Petersburg or Krasnodar.  The essence of such a cunning outstaffing is not that the provincials can pay less.  The bottom line is that it allows you to select the most valuable, most talented personnel. <br><br>  The organization of work on remote access - rare hemorrhoids.  In order to somehow minimize this popular sore, our project managers adopted the 10 commandments of working with a remote employee.  Perhaps you will find them interesting. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  1) Always pay. </h3><br>  A remote worker needs constant stroking on the head.  Any of his work, albeit unsuccessful, even a draft, a sketch, a sketch, just an idea - should be appreciated. <br><br>  We have, for example, in the state of the copywriter Boria, an unusually unstable creature.  Borya comes from some remote province, it seems, from the Tambov region.  When Borya once again broke the schedule, we asked him what is the reason.  It turned out that in addition to copywriting, he earns money by unloading fish at a local fish factory, and he does it not because of money, but solely because of the free bottle of beer that was given to him there.  ‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù said Borya, a little embarrassed, ‚ÄúI have a boring job, sometimes I, like a car with butter, need to be greased with a reward for everything to work.  You can't send beer on the Internet. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  2) Make creative suggestions. </h3><br>  A remote worker is prone to misanthropy.  In a talented remote worker, misanthropy develops into a delusions of grandeur, which is also rapidly turning into confidence in its insignificance. <br><br>  The only way to avoid such mood swings is to maintain a creative dialogue with a remote employee.  You can not constantly chmorit his phrases like "you should" or "your task is to."  He needs not only a boss, but also a like-minded person and a comrade, someone who picks up his creative impulse and develops fantasies.  You only need to direct these fantasies in the right direction with a phrase like ‚ÄúWhat if?‚Äù - as if this idea just came to your mind, as if you were infected by an employee with this idea.  Recall Schellenberg, who memorized the proposals of his subordinates, and a few months later again served on the table for general discussion under the new sauce.  Only having solved this style of the chief, the Stirlitz super spy managed to accomplish the task of the Center. <br><br><h3>  3) It‚Äôs not the Brake-Bank, not the accounting department, not the client who didn‚Äôt transfer the money on time for the non-receipt by the remote employee of the payment, the project manager is to blame. </h3><br>  Often there are technical problems with payment.  That is, "we sent you the money, but for some reason they did not reach."  I wonder why?  The remote employee is deeply uninteresting why they did not reach.  The client, the bank and the accounting department are abstractions hovering in the air for him, these are ghosts in which he, as a man of rational, does not believe.  The only living and concrete being with whom he communicates is the project manager.  It‚Äôs enough for the project manager to play the humiliation, knock himself on the chest with his fist and say ‚ÄúMea culpa!‚Äù The remote employee‚Äôs face, transformed by a webcam, usually blurs in sadistic pleasure in such cases, and he says: ‚ÄúOkay, I will suffer a week.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  4) Avoid soldier wording. </h3><br>  The remote employee appreciates and loves his freedom.  He is inspired by the consciousness of the unlimitedness of his actions.  He likes to sit at the computer in his shorts and the ability to always walk to the twenty-four-hour shop.  He will regard any order solely in terms of an attempt on his freedom.  The words "must" and "must" annoy him.  Formally, he is conscious, of course, his subordination, but this is not the subordination of the soldier to the general.  The only phrase on which he begins to work is: ‚ÄúBoris, you are a brilliant copywriter, copy something, just hurry up‚Äù - ‚ÄúOh, yes, sure, I'm a genius ...‚Äù <br><br><h3>  5) Organize informal communication. </h3><br>  Be sure to add a remote employee to a team of two or three people.  The brilliant copywriter Bor, for example, would certainly like to share with someone his thoughts on the latest film by Lars von Trier.  A couple of hours of chatter in GoogleTalk will give Bor a cheerful charge for a week and a half. <br><br>  Of course, you can go too far and lose an employee in the depths of his dearly loved Twitter.  In general, everything is very subtle.  It is important to know who, with whom and how to match.  The same Borya, for example, is a completely unbearable man, ready to blunt everyone with his opinion until ... a woman appears in an online conversation.  Then his stream of babble abruptly falls silent, and he begins to work in cold blood.  And with another person may be the opposite. <br><br>  And how to find out?  For this there is the sixth commandment. <br><br><h3>  6) Take a sincere interest in a remote employee. </h3><br>  It is easy to see the sixth commandment stolen from the code of Gleb Zheglov.  An experienced manager, like an experienced investigator, is always able, after a lyrical introduction on the topic ‚ÄúAh, Boris, you also love the Apocalyptic‚Äù, to squeeze out of Bory the oath promise to finish the work on time.  You can play cat and mouse with a remote boss.  With the Apocalyptic fans, Borya is always honest.  At the very least, you will be aware that Boris is inundated with work. <br><br>  You might think after such words, of course, that in our company solid hypocrites and villains work.  Well, we will answer, and you, that, the captain Smollet will arrange as your chief: ‚ÄúI do not like this ship!  I do not like these sailors!  I don‚Äôt like anything at all! ‚ÄùIn the same book, there is a good-natured, willing to compromise with pirates, Dr. Livesey, who doesn‚Äôt stop being a gentleman. <br><br><h3>  7) Use all the technological power. </h3><br>  Use life-affirming startups in your work.  Dropbox, Teamer, and similar services and instant messengers will not only facilitate the work, they will provide a sense of unity of remote employees scattered throughout the country that is difficult to achieve with remote work.  Ideally, all employees should be combined into a corporate network with VKontakte functions.  The role of such a network can perform an ordinary closed forum, as long as it is.  A remote employee should be able to share a joke that is understandable only to those who worked on the same project or client.  And when writing a corporate blog, such a forum is simply irreplaceable. <br><br><h3>  8) Always give instructions and set deadlines. </h3><br>  Most of the problems always arise not from a careless employee, but from a project manager who has failed to clearly explain what needs to be done, and most importantly why.  A bad manager always starts yelling, forgetting to paint a task or break it into smaller, clearer parts.  A good project manager never uses such verbal turns as ‚ÄúI will give money, but little‚Äù and ‚Äúyou have to work, for‚Äù.  A remote employee does not understand and does not accept office logic like ‚Äúwe are all a team here‚Äù, he is alone, he is constantly distracted by some of his own, home affairs.  But this does not mean that he is a priori irresponsible.  On the contrary, he is more responsible and cautious than an office employee.  This is a fog effect.  A lost person goes to the voice, not to wave his arms.  Think over this image. <br><br><h3>  9) Make a person out of a freelancer. </h3><br>  In fact, Boris copywriter wants to work in the office.  Only does not admit to itself in it.  Borya wants free coffee and a status jacket.  When the mass of remote employees living in the same city reaches a critical point, it makes sense to rent a small office with a lightweight work schedule or a place in the co-working center.  Believe me, exhausted by domestic boredom, remote employees themselves will come there without any reminders and a special ‚Äúdiscipline manager‚Äù.  Boris wants and loves to work, he just does not like being forced to do it, regardless of his original freelance nature.  As the unforgettable character of Travolta from ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù used to say, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like it when they bark at me‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  10) Believe in honesty. </h3><br>  A remote employee, deprived of talking in a smoking room, does not understand why the company works.  As a matter of fact, the very word ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù means ‚Äúmercenary‚Äù, ‚Äúfree spearman,‚Äù a characteristic characteristic of the Middle Ages.  There is historical evidence that the Italian condottieres of the 14th and 15th centuries fought better and more desperately than the feudal militia, not in the name of ducats - in the name of honest contract fulfillment (condotta).  Against the background of eternally rebellious barons, this looked like a moral feat.  A remote employee will never let you down if you do not break the contract yourself and do not accuse him of negligence.  Then, yes, you are waiting for serious problems. <br><br><h3>  Summary. </h3><br>  Surely many of you, having read our 10 commandments, will consider them too liberal.  ‚ÄúNonsense,‚Äù you say, ‚Äúwork on remote access only contributes to human laziness.  Until the server collapses, the freelancer will not cross over.  Let me better tell you how I lead. ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, everyone has their own reasons and motives.  Everything needs an individual approach.  However, in our humble opinion, in the framework of the liberal model, the individual approach is better implemented. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand that in modern America, for example, this problem is no longer due to generations of marketers like Dale Carnegie, who have taught people not to be afraid and to be sincere, and only we out of habit see KGB agents everywhere.  This is a stamp of consciousness that must be freed if we really want to succeed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88604/</a></p>
