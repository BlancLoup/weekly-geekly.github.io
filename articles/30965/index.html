  <section class="page js-page"><h1>6 business trends 2007: rest in peace, desktop</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Computing gets out of your car and becomes a cloud</b> <br><br>  In 2003, the Yahoo Mail mail service was the second largest after Hotmail.  Yahoo Senior Vice President Brad Garlinghouse (Brad Garlinghouse) was aiming to make Yahoo Mail first.  Brad heard about a little-known participant in the mail service race called Oddpost and started an account on it.  After logging in, he realized that Oddpost was different.  Switching between letters was quick and easy.  Moving letters to folders was done using drag-and-drop.  Using the service was like working with PC programs.  ‚ÄúThe appearance of oddpost was a turning point,‚Äù recalls Garlinghaus.  ‚ÄúNot just for Yahoo.  For the whole internet.  The resource showed what Internet services could be. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today, what could be is a reality.  Yahoo acquired Oddpost in 2004 and made it part of the new version of Yahoo Mail, which is in beta and receiving enthusiastic reviews.  Now online mail services challenge traditional email clients.  In December 2006, 77 percent of Internet users in the US went to pick up mail on a website. <br><br>  <b>Ahead of the whole planet</b> <br>  Google - online applications <br>  Salesforce.com - network software for communication with consumers <br>  Samsung - full-featured smartphones <br>  Yahoo email

      Email - the leader of the expanding movement from the desktop towards the Internet cloud.  In fact, the desktop is dying out.  Once the software came to us in a boxed form and was launched on the local operating system, today the number of online applications that run in your browser for a monthly fee or for free is growing.  Online video archives, encyclopedias, photo managers, calendars, accounting software, text and table editors are omnipresent. <br><br>  The concept of an application as a service at the early stages was used by <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/uk/index.jsp">Salesforce.com</a> .  Founded in 1999 to provide enterprises with the ability to manage customer relationships via the Internet, the company introduced a new type of flexibility for business applications.  Buyers didn‚Äôt have to update the software every year, Salesforce did it ‚Äúoff-screen‚Äù.  To expand the capabilities of the application in order to serve a growing business, all that was needed was to pay <b>a</b> higher monthly fee.  Users accessed the application from any computer, inside or outside the office.  According to a McKinsey study, 61% of North American billionaire companies plan to use online software services in 2007, whereas in 2006 there were only 37%. <br><br>  Today, cloudware <i>(cloudware is a term used to refer to online services with software functionality, approx. Lane)</i> is penetrating everywhere to consumers.  Google‚Äôs free online software suite includes a suite of tools that defy Microsoft Office.  For a monthly fee, users receive 10 GB and technical support.  At the same time, the abundance of devices with Internet access is becoming a challenge to the supremacy of a desktop computer.  Physical Proof # 1: The Nokia N800 Internet Tablet, a cute device that provides you with web browsing, email, instant messenger, and media player.  The Tivo digital video recorder sells movie tickets and broadcasts Internet radio.  Motorola Q, Samsung BlackJack smartphones and a little monster named iPhone leave fewer and fewer tasks for a lonely desktop. <br><br>  With the provision of online alternatives to computer applications, the business environment accumulates invaluable data about customers and their activities - information that can be used to offer more user-friendly services.  Take <a href="https://www.wesabe.com/">wesabe.com</a> , a personal finance management service.  It allows you to organize a database of financial data with the details of the bank, credit cards, and other accounts.  Then the service combines information about purchases, savings, other data and compares them with the tasks set by the user.  The service also allows you to compare user behavior with the behavior of other users, calculating average preferences for savings and costs.  In addition, the service organizes communities of users who share certain preferences or are regular customers of a particular brand. <br><br>  Services like wesabe.com flicker with the lights of the future.  What if online services can recognize traces of ‚Äúbread crumbs‚Äù <i>(bread crumbs, specially built debugging operators into the program that serve as a guiding thread for finding the reasons for the abnormal behavior of the program when debugging ‚Äî like bread crumbs for the heroes of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale wandering through the forest , comment lane, thanks Lingvo)</i> , left by people when traveling on the network?  Requiring a solution to the privacy problem will not outweigh the enormous benefits that are being represented.  With an abundant archive of personal data, online services will be able to meet individual needs and habits.  The advantages of using such systems on a corporate scale are obvious, for example, managers will be able to search for the best experts of the company in a given area.  Outside the office, services will be able to help fill out calendars with reminders of upcoming visits to distant friends and collect photo albums that mark travel destinations that are popular among people enjoying certain types of recreation.  A desktop computer may disappear in the cloud, but when returning to Earth, acquire the capabilities of Internet services that understand individual users and their connection to their own kind. <br><br>  Jason Tanz, Wired 04/15/07 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30965/</a></p>
