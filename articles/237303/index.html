At the same time, it is clear that various manufacturers try to implement original ideas that make the products of such manufacturers different from those of their competitors. <br><br>  Not so long ago, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsmart clothes appeared, which, besides the usual functions, can work as an activity monitor, heart rate monitor, and pedometer.  This makes sense, because the concept of 2 in 1, smart device + clothing, often has the advantage over the traditional scheme of wearing smart devices.  Pulsometer, fitness tracker and other devices can be forgotten, drowned or misused.  But it's hard to forget your own clothes.

      Russian developers have proposed their own implementation of smart clothing: a <a href="http://cardiwear.com/">Cardiwear</a> smart t-shirt.  Now the t-shirt is being finalized, and will soon be presented to the general public. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  Cardiwear features </h3><br><br>  The t-shirt is equipped with an electronic module with several sensors, thanks to which ordinary clothing replaces an electrocardiograph, a pedometer, a sleep quality detector and several other devices.  T-shirt, except for sensors, is equipped with a small device (about the size of a USB flash drive), this device is placed in a special pocket. <br><br>  Cardiwear takes readings of cardiac activity on three ECG channels at once, and sends the data for processing to a mobile application, from where information enters the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù. <br><br>  Access to your data can be provided to outsiders, such as a doctor or trainer.  The Cardiwear service is designed so that heart disease can be automatically detected at an earlier stage, thanks to a special algorithm. <br><br>  Data is transmitted to the mobile device via Bletooth. <br><br>  T-shirt can be washed with all contents, in standard mode, without fear of damage.  True, the same device the size of a flash drive still have to pull out of the pocket, it keeps the collected data on itself, for 7 days.  By the way, this device works offline for a little more than a week. <br><br><h3>  The project team </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1d/284/f67/a1d284f67949d64fe8bffc99bab1ba4d.jpg"><br><br>  Sometimes you can see how, sometimes, a good idea dries out on the vine because of an attempt to implement such an idea by amateurs.  You cannot say the same about the Cardiwear team, it includes just 6 engineers, graduates of such famous universities, as Baumanka and the Radio Faculty of the Nizhny Novgorod University. <br><br>  All team members worked and are working in their specialty, so the baggage of experience is quite significant.  Among other things, the team includes specialists who worked for technology giants: Samsung, Intel, Cisco. <br><br><h3>  When can I buy? </h3><br><br>  Now the guys are raising funds for their project, and if everything goes well, the T-shirt-electrocardiograph will go to the market. <br><br>  As for the sales market, the team sees three main areas: <br><br>  1. Hospitals, sanatoriums.  Such clothes will allow doctors without personal examination of the patient to always carry with them the data needed for treatment; <br><br>  2. Fitness, athletes.  Both amateurs and professionals will be able to use smart clothes in order to control their own activity, which will allow for rational training planning. <br><br>  3. Niche markets.  T-shirts can also be used to monitor the status of workers in critical areas, including aviation, railway, and others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/237303/">https://habr.com/ru/post/237303/</a></p>
