      When you see a person who is fine with his head, he is physically healthy, knows what he wants to achieve, does his favorite work, and even earns money - you say that he is a successful person. <br><br>  What is a successful online community organization?  The success of the community is that everyone benefits more than he brings, and the whole organization benefits from the energy of the people.  We call these communities <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/korporativnaya-set-chto-ili-gde/">productive.</a>  So, productive communities also know what they want, they are also fine with their heads, they are physically healthy, do the right thing, and can measure their success. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Here are the characteristics of a successful community: <br><br><img width="1000" alt="  " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/732/50d/a16/73250da16cd1c5305c438d9af1e59bee.jpg" title="Characteristics of a successful community"><br><br>  Let's reveal these characteristics in more detail. <br><br><h2>  Clear vision </h2><br>  Vision, task, concept, strategy, roadmap, project plan - call it as you prefer.  The main thing is to formulate the business value of the community for the organization and its employees, and this is already half the success.  But there are still a couple of nuances: <br><br><ol><li>  Communication in the community is becoming more open than it was before, and this is associated with a change in corporate culture.  Therefore, the goal of the community may include cultural changes in the organization. <br><br></li><li>  The wider and more heterogeneous the contour of your community, the better.  For example, an industrial organization may include in the community of workers from production who do not have a PC on duty, a bank - front office employees, a distribution network - each seller, a distributor - partners, a manufacturer of consumer goods - customers.  But before you go beyond your own team, build a truly productive community inside. <br><br></li><li>  Not every task is more convenient and more correct to solve in the community.  Here is a good illustration from Anton Bradley and Mark McDonald's <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/31875457/">Social Organization</a> book about when community use is more appropriate: <br><br></li></ol><br><img width="1000" alt=" " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d25/9c9/516/d259c9516dc0164ebff04b1ed2f06d08.png" title="Community use"><br><br><h2>  Leadership participation. </h2><br>  In general, the higher the position of the leader supporting your community, the better.  But here it is important not to get an anti-example. <br><br>  Suppose your boss wrote for the whole company and urged everyone to actively participate in the life of the company.  You enter your corporate social network and see there is a pristine clean and empty boss profile.  And you understand that your corporate social network is for suckers.  Successful people do not go there. <br><br>  In fact, it is not difficult to show personal involvement in the community.  If you are a manager: <br><br><ul><li>  Once a day, put a ‚ÄúLike‚Äù mark on the 2-3 messages you like; <br><br></li><li>  Once a week, post a blog link to an article or book that interests you (you are reading, right?); <br><br></li><li>  Once a month, praise someone from your team; <br><br></li><li>  Once a quarter, arrange a chat session to answer questions from the team. <br><br></li></ul><br>  On average, it will take no more than 20-30 minutes a week.  You spend more time on your way to the office every day. <br><br><h2>  Community management </h2><br>  Community must be managed.  Any blogger, Facebook theme group owner or internal communicator in a large company knows this.  Therefore, the community manager is at the head of the community.  This is a very interesting position, because on the one hand, the community manager has access to management in order to understand where to direct the community.  On the other hand, he feels at his fingertips people, the corporate culture of the organization, as well as the subcultures of various departments. <br><br>  In large companies, at least one person must manage the community on an ongoing basis.  Moreover, he cannot cope with himself alone, and he is cluttered with a group of opinion leaders who help him at his local levels ‚Äî his departments, branches, and groups.  Read more about what a community manager should be able to read <a href="http://supereon.ru/learning/index.php%3Fe%3D1372">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Integration </h2><br>  Names and appearance will not call))).  I heard a bike when a client of a certain Social Communication Platform Maker appears at the conference and says: ‚ÄúWe are great, we have people involved in a corporate social network - 30%.  Cheers cheers!".  After it comes a report from a client of another Social Communication Platform Maker, who says: ‚ÄúAnd we have an engagement percentage of 95%.  So what?".  But the fact is that the first one put a spherical horse in a vacuum and tries to get involved at the expense of generation Z, and the second one simply invested a business process there. <br><br>  Americans even came up with the term corporate social networks - event driven network.  It's like with Windows - it starts doing something useful when you poke it.  Take any corporate event, drop it into the community, discuss it there and collect the result.  Only after a long time, people get used to the network so much that they start working there without external reminders. <br><br><h2>  Measure of success </h2><br>  Measuring success is needed not only in order to be able to request further investment in the project from the manager.  It is also necessary in order to separate ‚Äúgrain from chaff‚Äù during the project, useful discussions from useless, working groups from <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/Znachenie-setey/">fludilny.</a> <br><br>  If you remember - the task of the community is formulated for the whole organization and each employee.  Measuring the success of a community for an employee is easy enough.  If he gets a favor, he comes back again.  We must estimate the number of visits, the proportion of active participants and content creators. <br><br>  It is more difficult to determine success criteria for an organization.  With the right approach, they should have been laid at the very beginning of implementation, when defining community goals.  Often these criteria fall into four groups of indicators: teamwork, level of engagement (and performance indicator dependent on it), innovation and knowledge accumulation, as well as the integration of customers, partners and suppliers in the community.  Some of the information can be obtained by measuring the rate of introduction of new products or solutions, measure performance, the number of errors, the rate of adaptation of new employees.  You can use a simpler, but less reliable tool - employee survey, which can be conducted before creating a community and after people in the community work. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  And further.  When creating a community, check the criteria from left to right.  If you do not have the support of a manager, it is hardly worth thinking about measuring the success of a network.  Therefore, try to work in the online community, but first of all think about the correct formulation of the problem for your productive community. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296100/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296100/</a></p>
