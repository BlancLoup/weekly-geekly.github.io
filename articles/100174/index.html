Accordingly, in the comments there was a wide discussion, they asked me a lot, I answered a lot.  Thus, I became ‚Äúmany,‚Äù I practically became ‚Äúfirst caught‚Äù in some blogs.  Yes, and also, my e-mail is indicated in the open form in the profile, I'm not hiding from anyone :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, to quote the letter: <br><br>  from Sixtoff Andrew &lt;sixtoff@gmail.com&gt; <br>  time in the sender's zone Sent at 13:16 (GMT + 04: 00) Time in the sender's zone: 13:18.  ‚úÜ <br>  to Goshila@gmail.com <br>  dated July 26, 2010 13:16 <br>  theme habrahabr <br>  sent via gmail.com <br>  signed by gmail.com <br>  Hide details 13:16 (15 minutes ago) <br><br>  <i>Good day!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Immediately I apologize for such an unexpected concern ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And actually, I'm worried about this issue:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I have been fond of IT for a long time, namely IP telephony and NGN networks ... this is from history))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I have also been a ‚Äúhabr‚Äù reader for a long time, I think like you ... but fate has developed in such a way that it has not yet been registered there ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>therefore, if you have the opportunity and desire, I ask you to throw an invite - I‚Äôm ready to drop a couple of my articles on the telecom before this (unless of course you are not afraid to post them).</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I apologize again for your concern.</i>  <i>And thanks in advance for any whether a positive or negative result))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Have a nice day.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>-</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Regards, Andrew Sixtoff</i> <br><br>  I was surprised by the lack of direct appeal in the letter, which suggests the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa mass mailing and I did not hesitate with the answer: <br><br>  <i>Andrew, tell me, do you write such letters to many?</i>  <i>And by what criteria choose a mailing list?</i>  <i>Anyone who has a box in the profile specified?</i>  <i>Are there any articles in the sandbox?</i> <br><br>  Suddenly, soon (I assumed that I was almost communicating with the bot), the answer comes: <br><br>  <i>Actually, you are the second person to whom you wrote - you chose just the first who came from Telecoms.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I did not even know about the sandbox ... Thanks for the advice - I will try there .....</i> <br><br>  From the answer it becomes clear that this person simply did not know about the normal ways of getting an invite to a resource (and it is common practice for the audience of the former CIS to turn on first in the outlet, and when it smokes, read the manual);  or the person simply did not believe that in the sandbox his post would be noticed and requested, which, indeed, happens relatively rarely. <br><br>  In this case, it seems that this is the case, and the person will go and publish a post in the sandbox, all the rules; <br><br>  but it‚Äôs also possible what I suggested at first: a bot-crawler that collects e-mails of high-profile / high-rating / simply active Habrovchan and sends them impersonal tears about invites.  In response, sends the first available article from the wiki, in confirmation of its competence. <br><br>  Or otherwise: publish an article from the nearest textbook in the sandbox, and then e-mail an invite by e-mail.  Moreover, this trick can be performed en masse - the control over the sandbox is minimal. <br><br>  And in general, the people of Khabrovka are democratic, they are ready to meet. <br><br>  From here I get <br><br>  1) Questions for which I seek answers with your help: <br><br>  Have you ever had such bot tricks? <br>  How did they end? <br>  How many similar bots on Habr√©? <br>  How many people on Habr√©, who simply didn‚Äôt know about the sandbox and guessed that way? <br>  How many of those who drew attention to their post in the sandbox "external" ways? <br>  Can bots after invites automatically gain karma and invite other bots or <i>who</i> have <i>bought an</i> invite? <br>  Are there habraregulators for tracking bot activity? <br>  In addition to bots and inattentive people, there is a ‚Äúmiddle link‚Äù - trolls: how many people tried to get an invite at any cost with malicious intent? <br><br>  At all "how much" I would like to estimate the percentage of the total audience. <br><br>  2) Recommendations: <br><br>  If we want to preserve the primordialness of Habr, we are attentive to the power that he gives us - for example, to give invites. <br><br>  If we nevertheless decided on actions "bypass", do not be too lazy to double-check, find out the extra.  information about the person, send another letter, perhaps it will change your "doubting" opinion. <br><br>  To Habr developers: Improve embedded, intelligent mechanisms for tracking bot activity. <br><br>  Post Scriptum: <br><br>  To Sixtoff Andrew &lt;sixtoff@gmail.com&gt;: I hope that your posts will appear in the sandbox and a kind person will notice and send you an invite.  Unfortunately or fortunately, it will not be me, because karma does not allow me this. <br><br>  To residents of Habr: as in all spheres of life, I ask you to be attentive, alert, sanity. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100174/</a></p>
