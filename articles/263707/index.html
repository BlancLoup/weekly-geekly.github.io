You can write 100,500 articles per day and not even get thousands of reads.  And you can become a content hacker and conquer the world.

      Before reading the article it is better <a href="https://onthe.io/learn/mdc">to take a test</a> for the level of content hacking. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/io/blog/263707/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8de/efb/2b9/8deefb2b9124152f137a5f09e70ab1a6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What are the metrics </h4><br>  If the content-maker does not have a clear idea about metrics and finite numbers, does not have access to data and time for analysis, then the data-driven content will not work. <br><br>  For a full analysis, you need to track not only your site, but all references to it.  Sharings in social.  networks, hashtag mentions, referral articles.  For example, how we track <a href="http://t.onthe.io/%3Fpage%3Dboard%26r%3D459:494%26s%3D31daa118a3fdf8093af4271ee08ab760">our articles</a> in Habr√©. <br><br><h4>  Who are the content hackers </h4><br>  Content hackers are the people who squeeze everything out of the content, get the most benefit and pleasure from their article.  These are not just copywriters who can relate a few words.  They accumulate knowledge about the latest trends and know the difference between the reader and the search bot. <br><br>  Top quality hacker content: <br><br><ul><li>  They know what the target audience needs. </li><li>  They are fixated on growth: the growth of traffic, the growth of the content base and their own professional growth. </li><li>  Everywhere they see opportunities for content promotion. </li><li>  They view data as a primary measure of success. </li><li>  They know what SEO is and understand why Google does what it does.  And use it to achieve their goals. </li><li>  They are constantly searching for new content ideas. </li><li>  They never stop.  While writing one article - they think over a dozen of the following. </li><li>  They ignore the various guides and do not rewrite; they only think about what their audience will like. </li><li>  They are all very often scribblers. </li></ul><br>  Each advanced content hacker plans subsequent articles based on the analysis of the metrics of already published articles. <br><br><h4>  What are the content metrics </h4><br><h5>  1. Consumption Indicators </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f2/888/f54/1f2888f548832dbe02bddc0928b3266f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only 10% of people create content, the rest consume it.  The quality of consumption depends on the content, and is measured quantitatively: <br><br><ul><li>  Views, session duration, <a href="https://onthe.io/learn%2BWhat%2Bis%2Ba%2Bbounce%2Brate%253F">bounce rate</a> . </li><li>  Scrolling page. </li><li>  Reading time. </li><li>  Viral content. </li></ul><br><h5>  Case: how to increase content virality </h5><br>  The Tratata-news news site has a high number of articles per reader: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92d/c32/288/92dc32288e47379ecddfba939b044385.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The problem is that users log in mainly through the main page and only one third get directly to the article page (login schedule through the main page): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e1/ec2/dd9/6e1ec2dd9dd0ba0dd0ca6a06b8b598df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For comparison, other news sites receive 50% of direct visits to articles.  This indicates a low level of virality of articles on the Tratata-news website. <br><br>  Statistics confirms the schedule of visits from facebook - only 5% of the entire audience: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e2/61d/142/3e261d1427ec5f9d2ff3a4029a53d9ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The site did not use the open graph tags (og: title og: description og: image).  Those.  when sharing an article, instead of a picture on Facebook, a gray field was displayed, instead of the title of the article - the site title, so the post did not encourage users to share it. <br><br>  A week after correcting the situation, the rate of visits to direct links from Facebook grew by 80%: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd9/edc/726/bd9edc7262289d3c2ce16cf7289db1f8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  2. Indicators of engagement </h5><br>  Reading one article is not the goal of a content strategy.  The point of advancement is to engage the user in a dialogue, generate a lead from him, and then receive the necessary actions from him. <br><br>  For e-commerce and b2b - this is a product purchase, for news sites and blogs - a deepening in articles, rassharivaniya, likes, pros, viral distribution and the development of the base of regular readers. <br><br><h5>  Case: How to make readers read? </h5><br>  On the Tratata-news news site, too many users read only 1 article per day and came out immediately after reading.  Because of this, the bounce rate (bounce rate) was as much as 76%.  On the chart - the number of users who read more than one article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/419/1b3/1c0/4191b31c0c2e5475286fee7f5ec1ee56.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The analysis showed that the content page does not contain any tools for engaging the reader.  After adding the block ‚Äúsimilar articles‚Äù and pop-up with reference to the following article, the bounce rate for the week decreased to 64%. <br><br><h5>  3. Indicators of the author </h5><br>  Sites that generate large amounts of content are usually published simultaneously by several content hackers, a couple of lamers, many middling and one stupid.  Tracking and analysis of the authors' indicators will be able to reveal who is who. <br><br>  The number of readings of one article depends not only on the ability of the author, but also on the selected topics, and therefore is not representative.  But the percentage of users who have read the article to the end can reveal a lot about the author. <br><br><h5>  Case: How to monitor copywriters </h5><br>  On the Tratata-news website, only 10% of people can master Oleg‚Äôs articles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b1/05a/bea/7b105abea2577dda5b32d8944b7220a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For analysts, it turned out that they have no illustrations and are written in solid text.  <b>Conclusion: a</b> two-day intensive article writing. <br><br>  Oksana's articles read until the end of 70-80% of users, but suddenly this figure began to decline: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/2c8/f55/b4e2c8f556fcc064457f3b411b69c661.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> rewriting and formatting an unsuccessful article with the help of a more experienced employee and working on errors. <br><br>  The graph of the percentage of user involvement in Anton‚Äôs articles is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/216/b54/680/216b54680362721c4fbd998b30424d01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> this is a content hacker! <br><br>  All numbers are real and provided by the <a href="http://t.onthe.io/">t.onthe.io</a> service.  All names are changed.  And now <a href="https://onthe.io/learn/mdc">pass the test</a> again. <br><br><h4>  Abstract </h4><br><ol><li>  89% of marketers recognize the effect of content strategy. </li><li>  Only 10% of people write content, and the rest consume it. </li><li>  The main metrics of content: consumption, involvement and indicators of the author. </li><li>  <a href="https://onthe.io/learn/mdc">Test</a> for the level of content hacking. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263707/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263707/</a></p>
