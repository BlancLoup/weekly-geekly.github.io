In some ways, it looks like a gold rush. <br><br>  A huge number of people, having read ready-made algorithms, want to open their startup. <br><br>  Personally, I‚Äôm a couple of times in six months (earlier - every month) familiar, obsessed with the idea.  They have only one thing in mind - I have an idea, now let's make a project for me (draw, build, program, advance, etc.), and profit in half.

Therefore, they write less often. <br><br>  So, I highly recommend to anyone who is making his startup or is only going to reconsider the attitude to a number of issues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  A startup is a business.  Any business aims to extract profits from the results of its activities.  If you do not have it - you are engaged in charity.  Therefore, the sooner the question ‚Äúhow do we make money on this chip?‚Äù Appears in your thinking, the better. <br><br></li><li>  Any business is created by man.  This means you have to be ready to become a professional businessman.  There is a view that skills are required in three areas: sales, management, and finance.  In addition to related technical (we are still in IT), legal, accounting, and so on.  Then, look, any company rests on a person and it develops (Apple - Jobs, Microsoft - in the past Gates, Google - Bryn, Facebook - Zuckerberg, etc.).  Consider that about 4% of people have the talent for being an entrepreneur (according to statistics, of course).  Are you sure you want to develop this trend in your life (where the lack of talent will have to be compensated for by the nonstop work of 7 days for the first two or three years), or do you already have the skills and experience in programming, management, something else?  Life is given only once. <br><br></li><li>  Do you know how to manage risk?  At one of the start-up rallies, I asked the team - what will you do if the investor leaves you and the lead programmer runs off?  The answer was silence.  It is necessary to take into account the risks and work out reliable protection against them.  So that you are ready for trouble, and if they happen, you know what to do without wasting time on your worries. <br><br></li><li>  How effectively do you work?  Most startups do not require investments at the initial stage.  Moreover, it does not require endless presentations, parties at start-up meetings, and so on.  Anything that does not relate to the development of a project is a waste of time ‚Äî and time is the only resource that cannot be restored. <br><br></li><li>  Can you turn the unknown into certainty, quality into quantity?  The first is the ability to see from nothing, from an idea, to see a concrete implementation of a project and organize people to achieve a result.  This is also a vision of the strategy - because it is not as difficult to break into the lead as holding leadership in a situation where competitors will grow by leaps and bounds (in fact, the ability to think strategically, to see how your market will change in the future).  The second is the ability to calculate any indicator, for example, the effectiveness of each programmer in money, or estimate the approximate profit (several scenarios from excellent to very poor) in numbers 3 months after the launch of the project, and a year later. <br><br></li></ol><br><br>  Please, if you come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking millions on the Groupon clone, ask yourself these questions before you get familiar programmers and project managers, promising them money that you can't even count? <br><br>  If you read it and understand that you are intimate with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour <b>business, and not a startup</b> - I wish good luck to your offspring! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120819/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120819/</a></p>
