The authors of the document are the deputies Alexey Kazakov, Vadim Dengin, Olga Kazakova and Leonid Kalashnikov.  Amendments are made to the law on information, the Civil Code and the Procedural Code and the Code of Administrative Offenses. <br><br>  The draft law gives the right to Russian citizens to seek removal, in particular, from search engines on the Internet, of links to information about them, which these citizens considered unreliable, irrelevant or distributed in violation of the law.

      Who and why it took to hide their outstanding achievements from society and future generations, I suggest the reader to think independently, but for those who want to learn more about how the process of ‚Äúcontrolled oblivion‚Äù will take place and what the law threatens to vindictive people under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Gentleman believe the word </h4><br>  The court decision is not required - the search engine is obliged to trust the applicant to the word. <br>  From the number of search engines subject to regulation, ‚Äúinformation systems of national importance defined by federal law‚Äù are excluded. <br><br><h4>  Bulk oblivion is not threatened </h4><br>  The deputies make an exception only for information about events ‚Äúcontaining signs of criminal acts, the terms of bringing to criminal responsibility for which have not expired, as well as for information about a crime committed by a citizen, for which a previous conviction has not been removed or expired‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Strength is not in money, but in their quantity </h4><br>  Search engines are obliged to stop issuing links within three calendar days from the receipt of a valid application, deputies write, but only the links, not the information from the sites themselves. <br><br>  If the search engine does not delete the link, the penalty is 300,000 rubles.  The search engine may refuse the applicant, but must justify the refusal, according to the document, the citizen may appeal against the refusal in court.  If the search engine refuses to execute the decision of the court, the fine is 3 million rubles. <br><br><h4>  Can you prove that you are not a search engine? </h4><br>  Deputies understand a search system as ‚Äúa person‚Äù, which ensures the functioning of information systems or software, which are designed to search for and provide links at the request of users on the Internet.  This definition is too broad, any site where there is a search can fall under it, an employee of a large Internet company warns, for example, a media site with a search through an archive of articles. <br><br><h4>  Borders - not a hindrance </h4><br>  The draft law gives citizens the right to file claims not only at the location of the defendant, but also at the location of the federal government authority that oversees compliance with this law.  Also, the Russian courts are vested with the right to consider cases involving foreign persons.  This means that it will be possible to seek removal of links from the Google search system in the Russian courts. <br><br><h4>  A holy place is never empty.  Search engine as a substitute for the state </h4><br>  If the law is adopted, it will violate the constitutional right of citizens to search, access and obtain information, says a spokesman for Yandex, Asya Melkumova, access to a large array of socially significant information may be difficult.  Creates the ground for numerous abuses, continues Melkumova, and search engines are not assigned to the inherent functions of government agencies: they are obliged to independently determine the accuracy of information posted on the Internet, the legality of its dissemination, and the presence of signs of crime in certain events and determine the time limits for criminal prosecution.  All this will lead to disruption of the functioning of search engines, she warns. <br><br><h4>  The roller has no reverse </h4><br>  The owners of the affected sites have no opportunity to challenge the exclusion of links from the search engine, which their competitors and other people can abuse, in the first place it will hit the work of informational sites and the media, access to which will not be possible through search services. <br><br>  According <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/06/01/594519-rossiyane-smogut-trebovat-ot-poiskovikov-udaleniya-ssilok-na-personalnuyu-informatsiyu">to the</a> newspaper Vedomosti. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291150/</a></p>
