      And if this is the head of the press service of Roskosmos? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2016, at Habr√©, Zelenyikot published an article ‚ÄúProgress in the press service of Roskosmos‚Äù, which ended with the phrase ‚ÄúAnd in case of failures, Roskosmos must learn to save the courage to admit mistakes and explain what is happening with the greatest possible openness‚Äù. <br><br>  Two years later, in Roskosmos, there was a change of the old new leadership, and which once again promised a bright future for the Russian cosmonautics.  And so that there was no doubt that the brighter future was domestic, the leadership decided to create a corporate magazine, Russian Cosmos, at the same time having <a href="https://habr.com/post/420969/">liquidated the magazine Astronautics News</a> . <br><br>  And soon there was a reason for public relations - the micrometeorite broke through the compartment of the Soyuz.  The head of Roscosmos actively posed and communicated with the media.  Photos on <a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1035187190505066496">Roscosmos</a> official <a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1035187190505066496">twitter</a> : <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8r/ap/by/8rapbyf6tcm2ljefkbjhzmvfiee.png"></div><br>  But this idyll was undermined by the appearance of a photo of the ‚Äúmicrometeorite‚Äù hole.  The evidence of its artificial origin, determined impact on the management of Roscosmos, is akin to the defeat of the army of Charles XII near Poltava.  They and the press service could not react adequately.  The media filled out ‚Äúanonymous sources in the industry.‚Äù  This whole story is wonderfully described on Habr√© in lozga publications: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/422047/">The mystery of a hole in the "Union"</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/422541/">The drama of the holes in the "Union" turned into a phantasmagoria</a> </li></ul><br>  It would seem necessary to do what Zelenyikot wrote and ‚Äú... in case of failures, Roskosmos must learn to retain the courage to admit mistakes and explain what is happening with the greatest possible openness,‚Äù but ... <br><br>  No, apologize, admit mistakes? <br><blockquote>  Most children do not like to apologize for making a mistake or not doing the right thing.  It would seem that there is no easier task than just saying simple words to mom or dad: ‚Äúforgive me,‚Äù I was wrong. ‚Äù  Instead, mostly parents receive in response only a silent silence or, God forbid, hostility from the child. </blockquote>  "Treacherous partners secretly drilled the ship at night to abandon flights on the Unions" - who just did not speak out about hostile saboteurs and their intentions. <br><br>  Silence and hostility ... There was nothing.  You have a different opinion-and not an agent of the State Department? <br><br>  ‚ÄúMicrometeorite‚Äù, the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant or the current disaster in Armyansk - one handwriting. <br><br>  It would seem possible to make it worse?  Can. <br><br>  Yesterday, aerospace expert Vadim Lukashevich, the author and owner of the site Buran.ru, wrote on his page about communication with the head of the press service of Roscosmos on the topic ‚ÄúIn the Soyuz ship, new damage was found with a drill‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2073460/">NTV.ru</a> ) <br><blockquote>  The head of the press service of Roscosmos cowardly banned me at once in both accounts.  For not being able to answer when he was cornered to the wall, to the simple question ‚ÄúThis way new holes were found in the Soyuz ‚Äî yes or no?‚Äù About a dozen comments, I said it, and when I stated his dismount and allowed to summarize that ‚Äú a trampoline ‚Äùto you, they say, forgiven, but the‚Äú American Drule ‚Äù- they‚Äôll lower the earplugs, and this is only the beginning - banned.  But I haven‚Äôt asked him yet why the fact of the dismissal a week ago of a worker who made this hole on the ground is classified, and everything, starting from Roscosmos to the State Duma deputies, is crap about American sabotage ... And is it true that by personal order from Rogozin Has preparation for the future separation of the Russian segment from the ISS begun? <br>  But now they have there (and our space program as a whole) will undoubtedly immediately go up the hill. <br>  Especially if, because of these assholes, we are now thrown out of the project of a near-moon manned station ... </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">screenshot screenshot</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/er/yf/vs/eryfvsy2lvndfhaecmi76cnhm68.png"><br><br>  Screenshot with commentary by Vadim Lukashevich <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bf/e5/ft/bfe5ftnbyacnmjwtg_90bxenipw.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D1242775979195765%26set%3Da.120624478077593">Facebook</a> <br></div></div>  Having established order on the pages he guides, the head of the press service of Roskosmos, Ustimenko, published a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D2139287599479151%26id%3D100001937942339">remarkable post</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/3d/t6/en3dt66zmnuib-jnemcizr9g3bi.png"><br><br>  And one of the characteristic comments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zt/vh/zr/ztvhzr5oxjw0lwbmsh7vhd7dmgi.png"><br><br>  As it turned out you can‚Äôt ask even more harmless questions: <br><blockquote>  What a naughty girl!  Hooligan! <br><br>  Ustimenko is simply obliged to block me again!  On the page of Rogozin !!!  Shl ... <br><br>  I, Irina Doroshenko, editor of the All-Cosmos magazine, want to tell my friends that the head of the press service in the team of the head of Roscosmos Dmitry Rogozin, as well as the host of his page under the name Dmitry Rogozin on FB (And you are not Hee-hee), blocked me on his FB page and along the way on Dmitry Rogozin's page, because <u>I dared to express my opinion that people are already on platoon, you do not give information, and the accusation of American astronauts is an insult</u> .  Later, apparently having come to his senses, the imaginary Dmitry Rogozin (aka Ustimenko) sent me a friend request.  Well, of course I took him as a mother.  But after this, my statement, Ustimenko, as a true choleric person, simply has to block me again, again on the page of Dmitry Rogozin. </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">screenshot</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D520563838390540%26id%3D100013107858834">Facebook</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/wy/cl/thwyclakasbgztohydekxk79t_c.png"><br></div></div><br><br>  PS Thinking about the name of the publication, I chose a quote from the story ‚ÄúTenderness‚Äù of 1975 by the famous writer Julian Semenovich Semenov.  In my opinion, the quote describes not only this situation. <br><blockquote>  - I lost faith.  First, ‚Äúcut the bourgeoisie‚Äù, then ‚Äúlearn from the bourgeoisie‚Äù, then the surplus, then ‚Äúenrich yourself‚Äù ... I‚Äôm actually afraid of children, my dear sir, - noisy, cruel and selfish, and if the children rule the country?  That's when they cast the laws in bronze, when they learn to fulfill the guarantees, when they become Europeans ... Or maybe it is only in the third generation: while the cook‚Äôs son has finished the university ... Kuharkin‚Äôs grandson will rule the country - I believe in that: emotions will diminish, progress will progress. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423407/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423407/</a></p>
