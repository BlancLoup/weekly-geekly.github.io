  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do when IDDQD does not work?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Over the past 5 years of my ‚Äúoffice life‚Äù in IT-shny and near-IT-shny offices, I saw how people fainted (2 times), experienced a pre-infarction state (1 time) and an epileptic seizure occurred (1 time) .  Fortunately, all these cases ended well.  But in all of them, the people around (including me) could not do anything except call an ambulance and vain attempts to find a local doctor who is nominally in every office center respecting itself (but only nominally).  Unfortunately, not all offices are like Google‚Äôs, and often stuffy (especially in the summer) or work to win, no matter what, do their work.  Okay, this is the reality of our life.  I was thinking about what to do in such situations when someone feels bad?  How to do something more than an ambulance call, especially considering the not always fast arrival speed thereof. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I have to say that this is not an advertisement or a full review.  I just want to share how I solved the problem for myself. <br>  I think many have heard such a thing as First Aid.  It sounds cool, but what I mean, for example, did not know for sure.  It seemed that it was something like anoint the wound with brilliant green or bandaged something there.  It turned out that what is included in First Aid could easily help people in the situations I described above.  A quick search in Google led me to the site of one training center that prepares people for first aid.  The first thought is some kind of garbage, graduates of medical schools earn extra money.  It turned out that everything is steeper, the rescuers of the Ministry of Emergency Situations conduct the training, and the program is built in accordance with the requirements of the International Red Cross.  At the end of the exam and the issuance of certificates without which the west is not even allowed to render the PP.  I will not give the link \ name of the training center, because  This is not an advertisement, but an attempt to make you think.  If it is really interesting to someone about the training center and Google does not help, then write in a personal.  So, omitting the operational details, I get on these courses and some kind of brain firmware change begins.  Everything in this world turns out to be a little different from what I thought ... <br><br>  The first training day was spent by the current lieutenant colonel of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, who from the very beginning told the available where the first aid begins and where it ends, and where the blind heroism and harm to the injured begins.  It turns out that our legislation is quite arrogant in terms of the classification of the assistance provided.  It just needs to be known.  Although I will honestly say that some legislative boundaries will never stop me if the question of assistance will concern someone from close people.  But this is the lyrics, and the first theme that introduced correction in the brain. <br>  What I do not like medicine for is that this science is not exact.  Maybe the patient has it, and maybe this, and maybe this is what he needs to drink ...?  Ugh.  When rendering first aid, it turned out that there is a very clear sequence of actions that couldn‚Äôt please me as a technical person.  It turned out that if I understand that someone may need my help, then I should answer 2 simple questions for myself: <ol><li>  What threatens me? </li><li>  What threatens him? </li></ol><br>  If I understand that nothing threatens me, but something is wrong with a person, then we proceed to the same algorithm: <ol><li>  Identify conditions from which a person can die right now </li><li>  Call the help services </li><li>  Secondary inspection and clarification of the circumstances of the incident </li></ol><br>  It turns out that there are situations from which a person can die right now, and in which a mere mortal can help only 3: <br><ul><li>  No breathing </li><li>  Chest hole (lung punctured) </li><li>  Blood Fountain </li></ul><br>  It is clear that if a person has an epilepsy attack, then he clearly has breathing, there is no talk about a punctured lung, and the fountain of red blood is not visible.  But if a person went to the coffee machine and fell, then it is far from obvious what is happening, whether the person has breath and fainting or worse.

      In the form of a flowchart the algorithm of the first steps of first aid is as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e19/0b6/393/e190b6393298cf2cf1cbb09c35eaf39d.jpg"><br>  It looks scary, but this is for situations like ‚Äúseams‚Äù, when a person can die, and quite quickly.  Then we were told how to assist in less fatal situations: classify wounds, burns, injuries, etc. From what personally surprised me, it is how to properly deal with nosebleeds and burns.  100% did not coincide with how it is usually done "among the people."  A choked man on the back is also not worth knocking, but there are good chances to bring him to a state that is scientifically called ‚Äúhe choked at all.‚Äù  There is a much simpler, more effective and safer way to make a person cough up stuck food. <br><br>  Not without curiosities.  It turns out, according to the bearded textbook of civil defense of a shaggy year, if you saw a person who is beaten with a current, then you have to knock him out of the tension with a stick.  It would seem ok for now, right?  But after you kicked him out, he should be buried in the ground.  Yeah.  To remove the residual voltage :) The benefit of modern standards dictate more humane actions, although some would probably dream of ‚Äúsaving‚Äù someone :) <br>  When at the very end we were told about the reception of childbirth (yes, the topic was unexpected), I was surprised to find out for myself why a baseball bat is absolutely necessary (although some insist that the ax will fit better).  Without this, it turns out in any way. <br>  I was pleased that the training was accompanied by practical elements.  As a fragile girl can easily turn a man under 150 kg?  How can you quickly and easily take a person of your weight (up to 1.5 of your weight) if you need to transfer it urgently?  How to transfer people with various injuries, if you need to transfer them urgently?  I myself also, as it were, not Stallone, and some tricks have proven to be very useful. <br>  Sorted out the actions of eyewitnesses on the basis of various videos from youtube.  For example, this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYGc4lJPGPkw">video</a> (NOT TO GO! Is impressionable) in the summer was active on the Internet and gave rise to an interesting discussion in our group about what was done right and what was not (by the way, the traffic police officer was obliged to provide the PP, which he did not do But this is the lyrics ...) <br>  On the second day of training, we spent half a day on role-playing games.  This is when the group was divided in half, where one half played the role of victims in a certain emergency, and the other had to find a solution.  And if you think that even knowing all sorts of algorithms it is easy just to pick up and orient yourself in a situation of panic, confusion and people screaming about something of their own (who is about help, who is about something else), then you are greatly mistaken.  Role-playing games just can be put five. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">If you are interested, here is a list of topics that are considered for 2 full days of study.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br><ul><li>  Legal side </li><li>  Algorithm of actions at an emergency </li><li>  Man choked </li><li>  Heart attack </li><li>  Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation </li><li>  Wounds and bleeding </li><li>  Internal bleeding </li><li>  Foreign body in the wound </li><li>  Hole in the chest </li><li>  Traumatic amputation </li><li>  Nose bleed </li><li>  Fractures </li><li>  Transportation </li><li>  Burns </li><li>  Frostbite </li><li>  Hypothermia </li><li>  Overheating </li><li>  Poisoning </li><li>  Epilepsy </li><li>  Fainting </li><li>  Stroke </li><li>  Diabetes </li><li>  Electrical injuries </li><li>  Drowning </li><li>  Shock </li><li>  Bronchial asthma </li><li>  Childbirth </li></ul></div></div><br>  It was also interesting to learn about the psychological part of helping and in general about their behavior.  And then, for example, if you see a girl in a bikini on the beach, rush to do her cardiopulmonary resuscitation, then ... well, you know.  Especially considering that according to the rules it is necessary to remove any clothes that prevent access to the sternum (otherwise, injure your hands). <br><br>  In general, initially I was looking for information on how to help in the troubles of life that sometimes happen to us.  As a result, I am satisfied, I learned how to help with fainting, heart attack, epilepsy, burns, electrical injuries and a number of other situations that were and, I am sure, will occur around me.  But beyond that, I learned much more.  It is clear that the planes do not fall often, but help with an accident may be required.  Citizenship and all that.  And, by the way, speaking about airplanes, I think many have heard about the recent fall of the Tu-204 at Vnukovo.  And there just the first aid crew provided accidentally passing drivers.  And who knows how many victims there would be if not for the help of these people. <br><br>  So I don‚Äôt know about you, but now I feel much calmer in knowing that if something happens, I can be more likely to help, especially if it is a close person. <br><br>  I will conclude, perhaps, with a phrase that the rescuer of the Ministry of Emergency Situations said, handing at the end of the second day of the certificate to those who coped with the final exam: And now, if I suddenly fall unconscious on the street, I will not be so scared because maybe you will pass. <br><br>  PS Immediately I will answer those who are interested: Yes, artificial respiration was done, according to the scientific, this is called Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR).  There is a specially trained dummy with a computer connected to it to indicate the correctness of performing both stimulation of cardiac activity and mouth-to-mouth breathing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164647/</a></p>
