  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Platform. 10+ years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Storing and processing data is a task that mankind with varying success solves a thousand years.  The problems associated with solving this problem are connected not only with the physical volume of data ( <em>volume</em> ), but also with the rate of variability of these data ( <em>velocity</em> ) and the variety of data sources - the fact that Gartner analysts in their articles [11, 12] designated as "3V". <br><br>  Computer Science has recently faced the problem of Big Data, whose solutions for IT are private companies, governments, and the scientific community. <br><br>  And a company has already appeared in the world, which, with varying success, has been coping with the Big Data problem for 10 years already.  In my feeling (because to declare we truly need open data, which is not freely available), <em>no commercial or non-profit organization operates with a large amount of data</em> than the company in question.

      This company was the <em>main contributor to the ideas of the Hadoop platform</em> , as well as many components of the Hadoop ecosystem, such as HBase, Apache Giraph, Apache Drill. <br><br>  As you guessed, it is about Google. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18e/a69/9cf/18ea699cf12d5bd0bf2050e51bf15062.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Chronology of Big Data at Google <br></h2><br>  Conventionally, the history of the development of ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù solutions at Google can be divided into 2 periods: <br><ul><li>  1st period ( <strong>2003-2008</strong> ): during this period, a set of principles and concepts were described, which are now de facto the standard in the world of processing large amounts of data (on commodity-equipment). <br></li><li>  2nd period ( <strong>from 2009 to the present</strong> ): data processing technologies were described, which, with a high degree of probability, will be used to solve the ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù task in the near future. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  2003-2008 </h3><br>  During this period, Google engineers described and published freely available research papers on 3 systems that Google uses to solve its problems: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/73673/"><strong>Google File System</strong></a> (GFS) - distributed file system [1]; </li><li>  <a href="http://0xcode.in/bigtable"><strong>Bigtable</strong></a> [3] is a high-performance petabyte data storage database; </li><li>  <a href="http://0xcode.in/google-mapreduce"><strong>MapReduce</strong></a> [2] is a software model designed for distributed processing of large amounts of data. </li></ul><br>  The impact of the work published by Google on the first steps in the development of the Big Data industry is difficult to overestimate. <br>  The most famous example of the implementation of the concepts described by Google is the Hadoop platform.  So the <em>prototype of the HDFS file system is GFS</em> ;  <em>the ideas behind the HBase architecture are taken from BigTable</em> ;  and the <a href="http://www.codeinstinct.pro/2012/08/mapreduce-design.html">Hadoop MapReduce</a> computing framework (without <a href="https://habr.com/post/161437/">YARN</a> ) is an implementation of the principles embodied in a similar Google MapReduce framework. <br><br>  Starting from 2008, the Hadoop platform itself will be gaining popularity over several years and by 2010-2011 will become the de facto standard for working with Big Data. <br><br>  Now Hadoop is already the ‚Äúlocomotive‚Äù in the Big Data world and has a huge impact on this IT segment.  But once the same <em>huge influence on Hadoop had the architectural approaches described in Google</em> to build the Big Data platform. <br><br>  The Google platform itself has been developing all this time, has adapted to more and more new requirements, the search engine has new services, including those whose nature corresponded to <em>an interactive processing mode</em> rather <em>than a batch</em> ;  <em>chunk sizes (clusters in GFS) were suitable for efficiently storing</em> not all data types;  there were requirements related to <em>geodistribution</em> and <em>support for distributed transactions</em> . <br><br>  <em>By 2009-2010, both within Google itself and in the academic environment, the merits and limitations of the set of approaches for building the Big Data platform described by Google engineers from 2003 to 2008 were investigated in sufficient detail.</em>  <em>Yes, and the Google platform itself for the period up to 2009 has evolved and evolved.</em> <br><br><h3>  2009-2013 </h3><br>  So, in (conditionally) the 2nd stage of development of the Big Data platform in Google - 2009-2013 - the following software systems were described by researchers with varying degrees of detail: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/206986/"><strong>Colossus</strong></a> (GFS2) is a distributed file system, which is a development of GFS [10]. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/207082/"><strong>Spanner</strong></a> is a scalable geo-distributed storage with support for data versioning, which is a development of BigTable [8]. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/207234/"><strong>Dremel</strong></a> is a scalable system for processing requests in near-real-time mode, designed to analyze read-only related data [4]. <br></li><li>  <strong>Percolator</strong> is a platform for incremental data processing, which is used to update Google search indexes [9]. <br></li><li>  <strong>Caffeine</strong> is Google's search engine infrastructure using GFS2, next-generation (iterative) MapReduce and next-generation BigTable [6]. <br></li><li>  <strong>Pregel</strong> is a scalable, fault-tolerant and distributed graph processing system [7]. <br></li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/207348/"><strong>Photon</strong></a> is a scalable, fault-tolerant and geo-distributed stream data processing system [5]. <br></li></ul><br>  In subsequent articles of the cycle on the Google platform, most of the above <em>internal Google software products</em> will be reviewed, with which Google successfully solves the tasks of <em>storing, structuring and searching by data, detecting spam, increasing the effectiveness of ad impressions in contextual advertising services, maintaining data consistency on the social network Google+, etc.</em> <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  Instead of a conclusion, I‚Äôll quote a person who has already proven his ability to successfully predict the future of the Big Data industry, Cloudera CEO Mike Olson: <br><blockquote>  High-performance data processing <br>  read your Google research papers that are coming out right now. <br>  - Mike Olson, Cloudera CEO <br></blockquote><br><a name="references"></a><h2>  List of sources used to prepare the cycle </h2><br><h3>  main sources </h3><br><ul><li>  [1] Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, Shun-Tak Leung.
