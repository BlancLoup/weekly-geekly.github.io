Now tell you how. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once I, very young and inexperienced, still without a higher education, decided to change the scope of activities.  Previous work tired of the lack of professional development: all actions were monotonous and were carried out on the machine, and ‚Äúfood for the brain‚Äù did not come at all.  Well, what can I tell: work in a glorious 1C Enterprise.  No creativity.  No new assignments. <br>  At first, of course, I penetrated, understood all these new things for me (I am not an accountant).  Later mastered everything well.  Then I felt like a professional in the work I was doing.  I was on top of fame :) Then came the longing green and wanted to forget all this pricing, invoices and tax invoices. <br><br>  I posted my resume online.  I looked through the vacancies that employers posted there, sent a resume to those positions that interested me.  As time went. <br>  I will not bore me with all the details, I will, in fact, turn to the ‚Äúonly interview‚Äù in my life.

      This happened in a large company, a chain of stores for women (household chemicals, cosmetics, etc.).  I safely found their main office, filled out a questionnaire and waited for a recruiter to invite me.  Last did not make herself wait long, we had a nice talk with her.  True, she asked me if I could cope with heavy loads, to which I replied that I could.  HR asked a few technical questions, having received the right answers to them, and informed me that in their company the candidates for the position for which I am applying are undergoing another interview with the HR Director.  I agreed, and after 10 minutes I was already at the director, along with the recruiter, who interviewed me. <br><br>  And here the worst began.  Even at the door, they gave me a displeased look (looking ahead and voicing possible comments: I was dressed in a clean, well-pressed classic suit and had a decent look) and with a gesture I was invited to sit down.  I handed over my questionnaire for study, after which a heavy, prolonged pause hung in the air.  You probably know what I mean: while you are studying your profile, you are sitting and do not know how to behave.  It‚Äôs probably not at all correct to look at the office where you are, not quite culturally, at one point, it‚Äôs not quite right to watch those who read the questionnaire. <br>  A few minutes later, in a demanding tone, they asked me to tell about myself.  I started.  In mid-sentence I was interrupted, asked another question.  I began to answer, after a few words I was interrupted again, asking a technical question, which was completely out of place.  This went on several times.  On the whole, the communication was, to put it mildly, ‚Äústrained‚Äù.  I did not understand what was going on - before that I had not encountered such aggression on the part of the employer. <br>  At the end of the conversation they asked me: ‚ÄúWe have a five-day session.  Explain why my subordinates go to work on Saturdays. ‚Äù  I replied that, most likely, you motivate them with something: give time off, pay extra work day, encourage in other ways.  To which I was told that there is no, there are no incentives.  I suggested that in the event of a heavy workload, before the holiday, for example, a person can go to work to finish the current unfinished business.  I was answered: my subordinates go to work every Saturday, regardless of whether I am [director] in the workplace or not.  I asked the counter, and, as it seemed to me, quite a logical question: "And how, then, can your schedule be called the five-day week?"  After that, I was told: ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù and they offered to wait outside the door for the recruiter, who, I remind you, was present at this interview. <br><br>  After such a "welcome" reception, I confess, I was completely broken.  In my practice, this was the first time.  True, at that time I was only about 20 years old, but this was not the first interview I was having. <br>  In general, I, as you probably understand, were not interested in working in this company.  Yes, and my candidacy did not please that director.  I did not understand then, why was she to be such a monster, and so ‚Äúirritate‚Äù me, but some time passed, and I didn‚Äôt remember about this incident later. <br>  Until she came to her goal - she became a recruiter.  And here I remembered that case. <br><br>  There is such a term in recruiting: a stressful question.  (In my case, it was a stressful whole interview.) In short: nothing will truly show your behavior like the situation itself.  If you are asked: "How do you feel about criticism?", Then you, most often, give a socially desirable answer: "I accept constructive criticism, and I close my eyes to non-constructive criticism" (or something like that).  Of course, there are those who tell the truth, no matter how bitter it may be.  But after all, we want to get a job, and at the interview we inevitably wear a social mask, as was said in the comments to my previous article. <br><br>  But if you start to criticize directly at the interview - you get a reaction that is closest to the natural one. <br><br>  For example.  Recruiter pleasantly asks you, why did you leave the previous place of work.  The conversation began nicely and "nothing foreshadowed trouble."  You answer that there was no career growth at the previous place, and this was the reason for leaving.  And here you see the following picture: the recruiter pauses, curls, looks at you frowningly and insolently asks: ‚ÄúWhy did you suddenly decide that you will have professional growth prospects in our company?‚Äù. <br>  This is a stressful question.  First, your answer to it will show the level of your culture (because you can‚Äôt be rude to a stranger).  Secondly, the recruiter will see your behavior in an already not a stressful situation (not only is the interview a thrill in itself, and here you are openly "bumped").  You may be confused.  Or, on the contrary, ‚Äúbreak out‚Äù and act (‚Äúhow dare you, I will call the police now !!!‚Äù :) <br>  And, interestingly, the recruiter will even see your ‚Äúresponsiveness‚Äù: by continuing the conversation in a sweet tone, it will be possible to track the ‚Äúecho‚Äù of this single stressful issue.  If you ‚Äúcome to your senses‚Äù already answering the next question, it means that you are easily appeased.  If you are embarrassed / agitated / indignant before the end of the interview, it will say about "long digestion." <br><br>  And instead of output.  Now I understand why I was so "mocked."  That position in that company assumed a very large load and a large flow of people daily (up to 80 people).  They needed the employee not to ‚Äúfall into a stupor‚Äù or start to sort things out, that's all.  Therefore, a stressful interview was the easiest way to find out how I would behave in a stressful situation.  That's just that director I do not consider a professional (due to many circumstances). <br><br>  Here is such information for consideration.  I hope it will be interesting and digestible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285324/</a></p>
