  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Does your mobile ad work?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When a potential consumer clicks on an ad with a built-in referral link, he can be redirected to a landing page that takes into account the person‚Äôs location, his purchase history, the type of device from which he came, interests, and much more.  This allows marketers to track the campaign and make changes in real time, making and implementing important and profitable decisions within a couple of minutes and getting better ROIs at lower costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8af/ca7/80b/8afca780bc0c4a28845b3deee3421695.jpg"><br><br>  Mobile advertising is on the rise.  Studies published by <a href="http://www.iab.net/">IAB</a> , <a href="http://www.iabeurope.eu/">IAB Europe</a> and IHS Technology this summer indicate an increase in mobile advertising costs by 92% (to $ 19.3 billion) in 2013 compared to 2012. More and more marketers are ready to attract customers on the very devices that they use - social networks, applications and websites for creativity and, of course, shopping have become adaptive. <br>  But are such costs justified? <br>  By 2017, more than a third of all people will use smartphones by eMarketer.  Since this market is developing, the main question for a marketer at the moment is which approaches work in this area, and which are a waste of resources? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Tracking the user's path and actions, whether registering, downloading or selling, is one of the most important components of modern campaigns, as it allows not only to track the effectiveness of advertising, but also to balance budgets for various promotion channels.  Below are four tips, following which, you can improve the quality of your analytics and, accordingly, marketing.

      <b>Track user path</b> <br>  Today, our clients receive tons of advertising from all channels: search, banner advertising, video, advertising in social networks and applications.  And before becoming your user, a person sees several different advertising or PR messages from different channels. <br>  However, most often only the last click is monitored before registration, which does not give a complete picture of what marketing activity or a combination of them has had such an effect.  It is important to be able to measure and see the consumer‚Äôs entire path to the target action and assess the importance and value of each control point along the way. <br>  This approach is called ‚Äúmulti-touch attribution‚Äù and at the moment it is extremely important for the mobile industry, since it affects a huge number of marketing channels - social networks, videos, games and much more.  A deeper understanding of the role of mobile marketing activities will allow you to more subtly and specifically approach the allocation of costs for them. <br><br>  <b>Take a look at engagement</b> <br>  Good conversion is great, right?  Yes, but not every converted one is equally useful, especially in a mobile environment, where the downloaded application is considered a sign of ‚Äúsuccess.‚Äù  But installation means nothing if the application is no longer in use. <br>  User engagement - in other words, this is how your customers interact with the application - this is a really important indicator.  Tracking the number and frequency of logins, use of the application and additional purchases can give you a deeper understanding of the real value of the converted customers. <br>  Thus, tracking what happens to a client after installing an application or, in the case of other types of advertising campaigns, after the final click is another key to optimizing the effectiveness and profitability of your marketing efforts. <br><br>  <b>Soliciting outside help</b> <br>  Every day there are news from leading players in the marketing and e-commerce market like Facebook, Alibaba, PayPal and Google, every news and change in the rules leave their mark on marketing strategies and opportunities. <br>  Rapid changes in privacy policies, rules for the use of personal data of users and guidelines add complexity and complexity in the construction and analysis of advertising activities.  Constant changes in what can be measured create problems for both application creators and marketers and partner networks. <br>  Instead of trying to cover everything alone, use the help of external specialists who will monitor and compactly notify you of all changes in policies and rules, as well as make recommendations on analytics and marketing nuances.  Outsourcing such activities will free up your marketer‚Äôs resources to create more creatively accurate advertising campaigns. <br><br>  <b>Don't be passive</b> <br>  The technical side of analytics matters too.  Usually, the script starts when a person enters the landing page and only then begins to collect information about the user - viewing the search history, operating system info or device type.  This is passive tracking, which begins on your site. <br>  His problem is that it is not always possible to react in time and quickly change a small but important part of the campaign.  To start active tracking, use special links for each type of activity, each site and different keywords.  You can create them directly in GoogleAnalytics using the URL builer.  This allows us to customize the data that we collect as much as possible and make quick changes in activities and sites that show less effect.  These links can also include demographic indicators for which the campaign is configured, the source of the link (banner, letter, or search query, for example) and the keywords for which the link was found. <br>  After receiving information that the transitions on request ‚Äúbuy fishing poles with delivery‚Äù are more in one region, and ‚Äúpurchase fishing gear‚Äù bring effect in another, you can correct other activities and keywords in these regions immediately. <br><br>  Tracking the effectiveness of mobile marketing is becoming increasingly difficult, especially given the daily development of this dynamic area.  Marketers should be ready to look for reliable partners and solutions that will help to measure all communications with the customer, involving the consumer in using the product and bring not only conversion, but also making a long-term contribution to the user and business communication. <br>  _____________________________________________________________ <br>  This is a translation of an <a href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/81395.html%3Frss%3D1">article by</a> Santi Pierini, president of <a href="http://getcake.com/">Cake</a> and an expert in analytics and online marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245083/</a></p>
