MSI claims that they are now shifting the focus to a user-friendly interface with mouse support (UEFI), and plan to launch it into use by the end of this year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/362/6f1/fca/3626f1fca1e230377666e23681afeb77.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A company spokesman in Taiwan, who wished to remain incognito, said: ‚ÄúMSI will release the first UEFI motherboards at the end of this year.  We also expect that in three years this technology will be widespread. ‚Äù

      According to this information, the first UEFI motherboards will be based on Intel's <a href="http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/6/4/msi-shows-lga1155-sandy-bridge-boards/">Sandy Bridge</a> chipset and will be released in all categories: from budget to high-end.  Fees will be released at the end of this year and at the beginning of 2011. "We do not include UEFI as special additions for the premium class," said a company spokesman. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a3/ca2/3e7/8a3ca23e7dc2422d43fec3b627454093.jpg"><br><br>  UEFI (Universal Extensible Firmware Interface, Universal Extensible Interface for Firmware) is a further development of the Intel project called EFI, which was designed to endow the BIOS with a user-friendly interface, as well as solve many other problems typical of a PC. <br><br>  In 2008, MSI had already tried their hand at UEFI.  Then on some motherboards based on Intel's P45 chipset, they introduced <a href="http://www.msi.com/html/popup/MB/uefi/applied_model.html">Click BIOS</a> .  However, now the transition to UEFI is becoming much more important, as it opens up new opportunities for data storage.  Last month, Seagate was <a href="http://www.thinq.co.uk/2010/5/17/exclusive-seagate-confirms-3tb-drive/">told</a> that UEFI is an important requirement in order to boot a PC from a disk larger than 2 TB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf7/588/05f/bf758805f0f2019b8e25d76c6ccf1a80.jpg"><br><br>  The MSI representative emphasized this point, since ‚Äúthe general public is using more and more capacious data collectors‚Äù.  He predicts that ‚ÄúMost laptops will have about 1 TB of hard drives next year, not to mention workstations.  So you need to quickly move to UEFI! " <br><br>  Implementing UEFI support is not an easy task for motherboard manufacturers who are used to working with BIOS.  Our source explained that manufacturers postponed the transition to UEFI due to "the huge resources that need to be allocated for this." <br><br>  About the BIOS, he says this: ‚ÄúThere is an opinion that if something works, then you don‚Äôt need to touch it.  If there is no firm belief in the need for improvement, the manufacturer will still use the old and proven solution. ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, there are many subtleties that are worth mentioning.  An important fact is that the BIOS can not simply be replaced by UEFI.  The fact is that "UEFI, generally speaking, takes up more space than a regular BIOS," the insider says, "and most of the built-in ROMs are quite incompatible, so normal motherboards cannot be simply flashed to UEFI." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/362/6f1/fca/3626f1fca1e230377666e23681afeb77.jpg"><br><br>  He also notes that ‚ÄúUEFI does not support all the boards, because each motherboard has its own peculiarities in the code.‚Äù Motherboard manufacturers spend a lot of time developing their own features and technologies that distinguish their boards from competitors.  If these technologies affect the BIOS code, then it is possible that they will not be able to work with UEFI. <br><br>  "The main difference between the BIOS and UEFI is the code itself," said our source, "UEFI is written in C, unlike BIOS, which is written in Assembler."  However, as he says, this adds considerable flexibility to the code. <br><br>  According to MSI, there is still a lot of work to be done at UEFI, but a company spokesman says that the cost of the final touches will be minimal.  ‚ÄúWe believe this is a step into the future,‚Äù he said, adding that UEFI should be ‚Äúcommonplace for all end users.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Translator's note: the title is yellowish, but, unfortunately, it was the same in the original source.</b> <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> While I translated, already posted <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/96033/">another topic</a> .
