In honor of this grand event, the action ‚ÄúPlant Your Domain‚Äù was held, in which took part: Yandex, Mail.ru, 1minute.ru, Megaplan, INFOX, the Advertising Federation of the Regions and Job.ru.  A whole <b>IT alley</b> appeared today in Sokolniki: 8 trees found their domains in the person of the companies that planted them. <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/outfoto/habr/st9/post.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first to start setting up the IT alleys was the birthday man himself - Workle represented by Vladimir Gorbunov, CEO of the company, his first deputy Viktor Vasilyevich Gorbunov and Dmitry Churilov, director of marketing and PR.  By the way, they were offered to create a new profession at Workle - ‚Äúsummer resident‚Äù, or, in modern terms, a qualified internet plant cultivator.  Hmm, why not? <br>  Vladimir Gorbunov, Workle: ‚ÄúEvery Internet company must plant its own domain.  We propose to make it environmentally friendly - for example, in the form of a personalized tree.  In addition, no wonder the Workle logo is the shovel mouse.  And work, and the Internet - all together " <br><br>  Following the landing of the domain began to representatives of Megaplan. <br>  <i>Maria Piterskaya, the evangelist of Megaplan:</i> ‚ÄúExcellent story - domain grounding.  Now cloud technologies have become more real, they have moved from the realm of the virtual world to a completely tangible thing - a tree. ‚Äù

      <i>Mikhail Smolyanov, the ideologist of Megaplan:</i> ‚ÄúThe main <i>thing is</i> for a large tree to grow.  It was necessary to plant bamboo, because it grows with the speed of the company - you do not have time to look back, but already three meters in height ‚Äù <br><br>  INFOX called Workle for help: it turned out that it was not so easy to land a domain.  However, this task was completed successfully, and now, on a hot day, any company representative can relax under his own tree. <br><br>  <i>Natalia Kutusheva, INFOX representative:</i> ‚ÄúAn unusual event.  Combines work and rest - all the most incongruous.  Usually, on May 1, I have some cognitive dissonance - like a day off, but a celebration of work.  And this action is a great idea.  In general, Internet work is a very promising direction.  In a short time, about 2-3 years, it will develop into a whole industry.  Of course, there will be other similar companies.  But Workle has an advantage - he is the first in this business. ‚Äù <br><br>  Representatives of 1minute.ru, a charity organization dedicated to saving children's lives, also contributed to the IT alley.  Surely they had prepared for the process of planting trees in advance, it is possible that they even practiced separately in this - so professionally no one wielded shovels. <br><br>  <i>Vladimir Gorbunov, Workle:</i> ‚ÄúI want to separate 1minute.ru separately, as they help children every day.  Their work deserves respect, and that is why the first piece of the holiday cake will be sold from a mini-auction, and the proceeds from it will go to the fund 1minute.ru ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Lev Grunin, representative of 1minute.ru:</i> ‚ÄúThank you all very much!  We do good deeds every day.  And they are always happy when this opportunity presents itself.  Nice to see people from the IT-sphere, whom he knew and read earlier on the Internet.  I rate the action at 10 points out of 10. And the very concept of planting trees is very close to our spirit. ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Dmitry Matskevich, representative of 1minute.ru:</i> ‚ÄúGreat event!  The main thing is very correct.  In any case, I was going to the park, and then I had the opportunity to combine business with pleasure.  How can I refuse?  I would like to congratulate Workle on his birthday - after all, it was he who brought us all together.  Let him always have a job - the Internet, of course! ‚Äù <br><br>  The tree at number 5 was planted by Yandex.  Now you can fully expect that Yandex.Money and Yandex.Maps services will also be added with Yandex.Tree, thanks to which not a single tree will be lost in Sokolniki! <br><br>  <i>Natalia Fedorishcheva, a representative of Yandex:</i> ‚ÄúAn unusual event, very unusual.  We are accustomed to buffets, office style, dress code ... And then May days, trees, fresh air! .. In a word, beauty.  Workle, happy birthday!  For the company to grow, to dissolve - just like the trees that we planted.  Well, of course, I charged other people with my positive, off-site energy. ‚Äù <br><br>  Portal Job.ru got the tree number 6.  This is not an easy job - to drag a hippopotamus, and here - just a tree!  Because the shovels were again first in price, and then in action. <br><br>  <i>Svetlana Gosteva, brand manager Job.ru:</i> ‚ÄúGreat action!  The day is sunny, the weather is beautiful.  Let all the years of workle be the same as today.  The future is at work via the Internet! ‚Äù <br><br>  Advertising Federation of the Seventh Regions has planted its own domain.  It is noteworthy that she had a seat just opposite Workle - maybe this is a sign?  Vladimir Gorbunov noted that he plans to repeat today's action on a more global scale: from colorful tablets to a large number of distinguished guests. <br><br>  <i>Galina Artemenko, representative of the</i> Russian Democratic Republic <i>:</i> ‚ÄúThanks to Workle and his today's action, online and offline communications are even stronger connected.  Now you can safely say that online is offline and vice versa: but as proof, submit our domain.  Moreover, such a socially responsible business is perpetuated in the tree.  And we grow with it.  And the regions also want to work online, so we are especially looking forward to Workle access to the regions.  And always support him " <br><br>  The last, final tree of the IT alleys went to Mail.ru.  From now on, it is safe to say that this company is rooted in the Sokolniki Park.  Considering that every guest of the event planted a tree with his own hands for the first time, Workle had the idea to create a tradition, a kind of ‚Äúdedication‚Äù to Internet circles. <br><br>  <i>Svetlana Danilchenko, Mail.ru HR-manager:</i> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very good that Internet resources leave the Web for life, particularly into the forest.  Today, even a child knows that the Internet is the future, and now we can clearly demonstrate to everyone our own domain-tree.  I would like to wish for Workle development, increasing the number of users, and even growth - just like trees ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>Yuri Kopylov, the best photographer of Runet:</i> ‚ÄúThe most interesting thing is to unite Internet companies offline, look each other in the eye, so to speak.  Trees - a vivid example of combining the virtual world with the real, the personification of spade mice.  I wish Workle success!  To enable people not from Moscow to feel part of something bigger. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/outfoto/habr/st9/tort.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The action ‚ÄúPlant Your Domain‚Äù ended with a solemn auction: the very first piece of a festive cake was subject to sale.  Its starting price is 500 rubles.  During the bidding rates doubled, tripled, and, finally, reached the mark ten times more than the starting price.  Thus the fund of the charitable organization 1minute.ru was replenished. <br><br>  <i>Vladimir Gorbunov, Workle:</i> ‚ÄúI believe these funds will help at least one child in our country.  Perhaps they will even save someone‚Äôs life. ‚Äù <br><br>  Very soon you will be able to see a photo report about the last action - stay in touch with <a href="http://www.workle.ru/t/habr_9_1_may">Workle.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143351/</a></p>
