Or maybe someone will discover something new if he has not heard it yet. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  Parable about chess <br><br><h1>  Parable about chess </h1><br>  The chess game was invented in India, and when the Indian king Sheram met her, he was delighted with her wit and the variety of possible positions in it.  Upon learning that the game was invented by one of his subjects, the king ordered him to be called in order to personally reward him for a successful invention. <br><br>  The inventor - his name was Seth - appeared to the throne of the sovereign.  He was a modestly dressed scientist who received livelihood from his students.

      “I wish to adequately reward you, Seth, for the wonderful game you have invented,” said the king. <br><br>  The sage bowed. <br><br>  “I am rich enough to fulfill your wildest wish,” continued the king. “Name a reward that will satisfy you, and you will receive it.” <br><br>  Seth was silent. <br><br>  - Do not be shy, - the king encouraged him. - Express your desire.  I will not regret anything to fulfill it! <br><br>  - Great is your kindness, sovereign.  But let the term think about the answer.  Tomorrow, on second thought, I will tell you my request. <br><br>  When the next day, Seth again appeared at the steps of the throne, he surprised the king with the unprecedented modesty of his request. <br><br>  “Master,” said Seth, “order me to give me one wheat grain for the first cell of the chess board.” <br><br>  - A simple wheat grain?  - the king was amazed. <br><br>  - Yes, my lord.  Order two grains for the second cell, four for the third, 8 for the fourth, 16 for the fifth, 32 for the fourth ... <br><br>  - Enough!  - with irritation, the king interrupted him. - You will receive your grain for all 64 cells of the board, according to your desire: for every double against the previous one.  But know that your request is not worthy of my generosity.  Asking for such an insignificant reward, you disrespectfully neglect my mercy.  Truly, as a teacher, you could show the best example of respect for the kindness of your sovereign.  Go on!  My servants will carry you a bag of wheat. <br><br>  Seth smiled, left the hall and waited at the gates of the palace. <br>  At dinner, the king recalled the inventor of chess and sent to find out whether the reckless Seth had already taken away his pitiful reward. <br><br>  “Master,” was the answer, “your command is being executed.”  The court mathematicians calculate the number of grains to follow. <br><br>  The king frowned - he was not accustomed to his instructions being executed so slowly. <br><br>  In the evening, going to sleep, the king Sheram once again inquired whether Seth had left the fence of the palace with his bag of wheat. <br><br>  “Master,” he replied, “your mathematicians work tirelessly and hope to finish the count before dawn.” <br><br>  “Why are you slowing down this case ?!”  - the king exclaimed angrily. - Tomorrow, before I wake up, every last grain must be given out to Sete.  I do not order twice! <br><br>  In the morning the king was informed that the foreman of the court mathematicians was asking for an important report.  The king ordered to enter it. <br><br>  “Before you tell me about your case,” announced Sheram. “I want to hear whether the insignificant reward he has given himself has been given out to Seth. <br><br>  “It was for this reason that I dared to appear before you at such an early hour,” replied the old man. “We conscientiously numbered all the grains that Seth wanted to receive.  The number is so great ... <br><br>  “No matter how big it is,” the king interrupted arrogantly, “my breadbaskets will not become scanty  The reward is promised and must be given ... <br><br>  “It is not in your power, my lord, to fulfill such desires.”  In all your barns there are not as many grains as Seth demanded.  It is not in the granary of the whole kingdom.  There is no such number of grains on the whole space of the Earth.  And if you want to definitely give the promised reward, then order to turn the earthly kingdoms into arable fields, order to drain the seas and oceans, order to melt the ice and snow covering the far northern wastelands.  Let their whole space be sown with wheat.  And all that is born in these fields, order to give Seta.  Then he will receive his reward. <br><br>  The king listened with amazement to the words of the elder. <br><br>  “Give me that monstrous number,” he said thoughtfully. <br><br>  “Eighteen quintillons four hundred forty six quadrillion seven hundred forty four trillion seventy three billion seven hundred nine million five hundred fifty one thousand six hundred and fifteen, O lord! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37671/</a></p>
