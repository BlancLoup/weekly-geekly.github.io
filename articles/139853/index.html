  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Attacks by anonymous hacker groups have practical financial implications.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The end of last year and the beginning of this can be safely called the time of unprecedented activity of various hacker groups, apart from which are Anonymous.  According to most reports of information security breaches, it is this group of people that is responsible for DDOS attacks and hacking into the websites of such serious organizations as the FBI and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/135279/">StratFor</a> . <br><br>  In comments to such reports, it is often thought that, in fact, the efforts of hackers do not have any practical sense: a certain site did not work for several days due to a DDOS attack, or the unthinkable amount of gigabytes of personal correspondence of secret agents was stolen - in fact , it did not change anything, except for obvious political goals, when among the "merged" data, the authenticity of which is still in question, suddenly there are some scandalous information about public figures who are forced to do something with questionable topics.  Inventions and excuses.  Here, of course, it should be noted that among the shares of Anonymous were those that can be considered "moral": it suffices to recall the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/131020/">termination</a> of the network of child pornography or the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/135721/">publication of</a> lists of fans of neo-Nazi subjects. <br>  Also here the operation " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/133930/">Robin Hood</a> " stands apart, the essence of which, according to the statements of the hackers, was that the stolen credit card data would be used for charitable purposes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Anonymous says in this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dix5ZitgE464">video</a> that they have already used Bank of America, Chase and CitiBank credit cards to transfer "thousands of dollars to protesters in different countries of the world, to poor people and charitable organizations."  The experts in the field of electronic transactions in this regard have serious doubts, because the security departments of banks and financial institutions promptly monitor fraudulent transactions.  Moreover, if a certain charitable fund receives money of dubious origin at its expense, then, according to the rules of Visa and MasterCard, it will have to pay a fee (chargeback fee). <br><br>  On the eve of the Catholic Christmas of 2011, Anonymous, the server of the information-analytical organization StratFor was hacked, as a result of which about 50,000 credit card numbers were stolen, of which about 9,600 have not expired.  At the same time, the hackers made a statement that the finances of the organization serving the US administration for various military projects in Afghanistan and Iraq would serve for charitable purposes.  This statement, of course, did not oblige to anything, since it is most likely that it will not be possible to verify the result of its implementation, precisely for reasons of privacy and the illegal origin of money.

      Yesterday, the FBI published information that financial transactions worth at least $ 700,000 were executed from credit cards that were stolen from StratFor servers, and this data is not yet final, as they include the results of the investigation at the beginning of February.  Here, of course, it is not clear whether it is a question of fulfilling its promising statements about disinterested financial aid to charitable foundations, or whether hackers simply took advantage of the results of their ‚Äúefforts‚Äù in their own interests.  The following fact is clear: the attack and the "drain" of financial data, despite the security systems of banks, bring intruders a very specific income - at least someone from Anonymous (if you do not allow extreme carelessness due to recent arrests of hackers, although there, according to their own words The success of the FBI and Interpol was not the ingenuity of investigating cybercrime, but the use of embedded agents) may well spend this money in their own interests, of course, not necessarily charitable. <br><br>  [ <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/12/anonymous-stratfor-credit-card/">Source</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139853/</a></p>
