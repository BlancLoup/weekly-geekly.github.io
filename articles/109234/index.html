The slogan of the competition ‚ÄúIt is time to act!‚Äù.  Let's carefully read the content of the terms and conditions of this competition. <br>  This document contains a lot of both simply weird points, and points that make it possible to fairly fairly seize your intellectual property.  Moreover, since the document is formulated extremely vague, it seems that you agree to share almost everything you have with Cisco.  There are also errors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So the points: <br><blockquote>  3.1 (1) the use of technology in healthcare energy saving;  (2) the use of technology in health care and (3) information technology ("Competition Categories") according to the descriptions given on the Site. <br></blockquote><br>  There seems to be a typo here. <br><br><blockquote>  4.4 All Applications (and related information) must be received and evaluated in the USA. <br></blockquote><br>  This item is mysterious. <br><br><blockquote>  7.1.7.  Your Application does not contain anything prohibited by these Terms and Conditions, including but not limited to illegal or harmful content, content that threatens or violates private property, is offensive, defamatory, libelous, vulgar, offensive, sexually explicit, obscene, causing racial hatred, or content that is undesirable for other reasons; <br></blockquote><br>  Content that is undesirable for other reasons.  For which others?

      Here begins the most delicious: <br><br><blockquote>  Viii.  LICENSES <br><br>  8.1.  Member hereby grants and agrees to provide Cisco, its branches, partners, subsidiaries and their assignees and agents a global, permanent, irrevocable, deductible and fully paid non-exclusive license for all Member's Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) so that: <br><br>  8.1.1.  review, evaluate, verify, analyze, or review for other purposes the Applications and any other information or materials submitted as part of participation in the Competition; <br><br>  8.1.2.  reproduce or receive reproduction, publicly distribute copies or audio recordings, produce a public display or demonstration of Applications, in whole or in part, using digital means of transmitting sound signals or other equipment; <br><br>  8.1.3.  correct, modify, modify, improve or create other derivative works in relation to the Applications; <br><br>  8.1.4.  use, produce and give into production, import, export, distribute, put up for sale, lease, sell, offer to sell or otherwise dispose of (i) part of the Application or the Application as a whole;  (ii) a product (s) or services resulting from the application of the methods or processes described in the Application;  (iii) Applications as a stand-alone product (products) or services;  (iv) all of the above in accordance with the application together, in combination or separately with any product or service, already known or not developed at the moment, with the above rights granted by subclause 8.1.4. apply to other legal entities involved in the production and distribution, including to suppliers, manufacturers, resellers, distributors, firms selling their own solutions with finished products, equipment manufacturers, customers and  x users. <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  Under clause 8.1, you transfer non-exclusive intellectual property rights.  Unfortunately, however, there is no indication - what kind of property we transfer.  The question is disclosed in the following paragraphs.  And we transfer the property to almost everything.  Any ideas and products that you have described in the application or provided within it can be sold, exported, imported, etc., etc. <br><br><blockquote>  8.1.5.  provide support to users to perform the above actions; <br><br>  8.1.6.  grant sublicenses and authorize the sublicenses of all rights granted by Cisco under this Section to Cisco suppliers, manufacturers, resellers, distributors, companies selling their own solutions with finished products, equipment manufacturers, customers, end users, branches and other parties specified by Cisco; <br><br>  8.1.7.  otherwise use bids for any purpose. <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  8.1.7 adds spice. <br><br><blockquote>  8.2.  ‚ÄúIntellectual Property Rights‚Äù means all tangible and intangible: (i) copyright and other rights associated with copyright works in all countries of the world, including but not limited to copyrights, neighboring rights, non-property rights, industrial design rights and all derivatives the work of the above;  (ii) trademarks, trade name rights and similar rights;  (iii) rights to trade secrets;  (iv) patents, industrial property rights, rights to algorithms, industrial models and other industrial property rights and all improvements made in relation to the foregoing;  (v) all other intellectual and industrial property rights (of any kind and nature, in any country of the world and regardless of their name) granted by law, contract terms, licenses or other means;  (vi) all registrations, applications, renewals, renewals, breakdowns or reissues of the aforementioned are in effect now or in the future (including all rights specified in the above documents);  and (vii) all licenses and permits associated with paragraphs (i) - (vi) above. <br><br></blockquote><br>  It clarifies that you actually give. <br><br><blockquote>  8.3.  You refuse to make any claims and will not receive royalties now or in the future from the Sponsor, its branches, licensees and assignees for using your Application, including without limitation royalties from all types of copyrights on intellectual property, public reproduction, digital audio recordings and mechanical, synchronized use or use of the original. <br><br>  8.4.  Applications will not be treated as confidential information, and the submission of Applications will not create confidential relations or obligations not to disclose the information provided between you and the Sponsor or between you and a third party.  Without limiting the foregoing, you acknowledge and agree that your Application may be publicly disclosed by the Sponsor on the Site or in other external information channels, forums and in the media.  Participants should discuss with their legal advisers the desirability of obtaining patents or protecting applications.  The Participant acknowledges that the Sponsor may at the moment or in the future develop information similar to the information in the submitted Application within the company or receive it from third parties.  Accordingly, this document does not prohibit the Sponsor from independently obtaining, developing or ordering the development of products, concepts, systems or technologies that are similar or competing with products, concepts, systems or technologies in any way presented in any Application.  You acknowledge that other individuals or legal entities may have submitted to the Sponsor or others, publish or submit for review, or may publish in the future materials that are identical or similar to your Application.  You acknowledge and agree that the Sponsor has the right to use identical or similar materials, which is not a reason to pay you compensation for the use of such materials by the Sponsor.  If your application is identical or similar to the application of another Participant, the Sponsor reserves the right to evaluate one application higher than the other, based on the evaluation criteria described below, or at the discretion of the Jury. <br><br></blockquote><br><br>  The sponsor can order the development of your idea or do it yourself. <br><br>  As a result, all these subtleties somewhat reduce the value of the competition to the public.  It would be wonderful if Cisco relaxed the requirements for the transfer of intellectual property rights.  No one, of course, doubts the honesty of this esteemed company, but the contract is a contract. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109234/</a></p>
