  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Barnes & Noble introduced an updated reader model - Nook Glowlight</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After a year and a half of silence, the largest American bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble launches a new electronic backlit reader, Nook Glowlight, which happens exactly one month after the start of sales of the updated version of Kindle Paperwhite from their main competitor, Amazon (which is already available from September 30th).  It is worth noting that information has repeatedly appeared that B &amp; N can be sold.  For a whole year, the company did not provide information about new devices, and the model line presented as early as 2012 was recently sold at a significantly reduced price, suggesting a possible termination of the release of these ‚Äúdevices‚Äù soon.  But now, without prior announcement, Barnes &amp; Noble has begun selling its new "reading room".  Let's try to figure out how the new Nook can outrun competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/433/81f/5db/43381f5db832c03bfda20d41a91d22fd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Appearance and characteristics. </h5><br>  The Nook Glowlight retained the signature outlines of its predecessors, but appeared in a white case.  The reader has become a little thinner and lighter: only 175 grams, against 212, which were previously (at that time Kindle Paperwhite weighs a little more: 206).  True "reader" lost with the mechanical buttons turning;  also depriving us of the opportunity to expand the built-in memory by microSd card.  The power button from the "back" moved to the left side.  The case of the reader is made of plastic with a soft-touch coating and silicone edging for better ‚Äúgrace‚Äù.

Resolution increased from 600x800 to 758x1024.  Declared improved and more uniform illumination without a "blue", as well as a more sensitive touchscreen.  Judging by the first video reviews, the speed of the work of the book also increased, and at the same time, the speed of drawing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/S_BEkMXZ43g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj-NMUjUNTvZYDl6bwXEvQC556COw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Among the software innovations, only a recommendation service has been added, focused on the purchase of new books in the company store, so we can say that for the Russian-speaking user no changes have appeared at all. <br><br>  Not the best news for Chinese manufacturers of accessories is that the device has a new format and size, which means you will need to develop new covers.  So far B &amp; N offers only one type of protective case - a la Apple. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a83/38e/c18/a8338ec180e602cc2e0373f49ab3a583.jpg"><br><br><h5>  "Stars" ... </h5><br>  On the official website in the device comparison section it is stated that the processor frequency has been increased from 600 MHz in previous models to 800 in the current one.  But in all existing descriptions it is stated that the old Nook-ah processor frequency is 800 MHz, so it is not entirely clear whether the Nook has become faster in hardware, or just the software part has been optimized. <br><br>  The manufacturer claims that the device‚Äôs battery lasts for two months of use with wi-fi turned off, with the expectation that they will use about 30 minutes a day with a one-time screen refresh every 60 seconds with the backlight turned on by default or turned off.  That is, the duration of the work remained about the same as before. <br><br>  We should also mention the ‚Äúreality‚Äù of the declared 4 GB of memory.  In fact, only 2.5 GB will be available for content, of which two are reserved for books from the official store, that is, in fact, we only get about 500 MB of pure memory. <br><br><h5>  About future. </h5><br>  Nook simple touch has been on sale for two and a half years and continues to enjoy steady demand, which is largely due to the possibility of "rutting" this device.  But the new model from B &amp; N has lost support for memory cards, which limits its ability (at least for now) to modify the device, which, coupled with the lack of mechanical scroll buttons, will certainly alienate the potential buyer in our region.  In addition, the Nook is now very much like its Canadian rival Kobo, who, like Kindle, recently released an improved book with backlighting Kobo Aura.  So now it will be even more difficult to choose, because the devices have become too similar.  And the price of all devices is on the same level (you will have to pay $ 119 for the Nook).  It remains to wait quite a bit to see which of the books turned out the most enjoyable screen with backlight. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/200318/">https://habr.com/ru/post/200318/</a></p>
