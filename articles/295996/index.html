The idea seemed intriguing, because at the end of the course we had to implement a simple version of the C compiler, and in my case the compiler came out on the interpreter - funny, I thought, and began to code the languages ‚Äã‚Äãin Python 3.4. <br><br>  <b>February - March 2015</b>

      My teacher in nuclear science, at the same time already the 4th year as an Olympiad programming coach, and this means that a person who knows me well, suddenly offers to work for one foreign company X, because of the bachelor students of our university, I alone (according to her memory ) I am writing in Python, and X is just looking for Python developers from our university for its startup in the field of e-commerce.  Well, I decided, it means that they will pay normally, and I recruited a team of 5 people including me.  Together, we began to look forward to the interview. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>April 2015</b> <br><br>  We were told that all the logic of the project was carefully and thoroughly considered, even the design is already there, you just need to write code, put the project on rails, so to speak (no, no! We immediately thought about Django).  We didn‚Äôt think deeply with an inexperienced eye that the project was done for five months, although there were elements of a social network, an e-commerce aggregator, and another highlight that turned this project into a tasty pie - the ability to design stores from aggregator products and share them in social network.  Complicated?  I didn‚Äôt have the experience to say it‚Äôs easy or difficult, long or quick, but by pure chance, in the minds of all 5th guys there was a period of 5 months, which suited our future colleagues from X, since September is the beginning of the business season. <br><br>  The logic of the project is thought out, the design is there, we just need to code and get experience, we thought, but they also have a startup, but we are from the Siberian wilderness - Barnaul - in short, we agreed with awe to work 20 to a month, waiting a big premium for the release of the alpha version and, of course, the salary increase after September. <br><br>  We were literally set the following goals: ‚Äúshort term, high-quality product, cheap payment‚Äù - and this is all from the mouth of a Russian-speaking consultant and personal representative of the director of company X. <br><br>  <b>May 2015</b> <br><br>  5 students of developers with no experience, who have defense of undergraduate work in their nose, undertook to read documentation, learn new tools and principles of development, delve into Agile, and write code.  After two months of hard work (Django, Amazon EC2, PostgreSQL, Mailchimp, Apache2, Jinja2, SCSS, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery), finally, a web business card was presented that could accept applications for testing the alpha version of the main product.  It was a great achievement for us, and we just had to do the impossible until September - all the functionality of the product. <br><br>  <b>June 2015</b> <br><br>  ... meanwhile, we have the preparation and defense of bachelor's work ... <br><br>  <b>July - August 2015</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúAre you sure that you thought out the logic?‚Äù We asked our colleagues from X. Then where will the ‚ÄúForgot password‚Äù button be?  Do you seriously think that a lot of popups are a good idea?  Maybe we will take out the process of entering payment information from one popup to the wizard?  Do you even think what will happen to the user who tries to register using a google plus account with mail Y, and the system already has a user with unconfirmed mail Y?  Almost every question of logic methodically sifted through us and we spent a lot of time for the difficult struggle with usability. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy are files from a designer in A4 size ‚Äî is it impossible to impose on a ruler?‚Äù, We asked our colleagues from X. Why do we get different shades of the same UI element all the time?  Yevpaty, it's the same interface as Windows 98 ... And where is the design for mobile devices and tablets because there are already two weeks left before the product presentation?  And why almost all * .ai files (Adobe Illustrator) do not contain source images?  It seems that our beautiful and effortless designer doesn‚Äôt know how to compile * .ai files. <br><br>  <b>September 2015</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo, well, seriously, think over the logic with the invitation cards on our website for the time of alpha, do you have a UI / UX person?‚Äù We strongly recommended to our colleagues from X. ‚ÄúThis person is not UI / UX, he just has this position, in fact, he is engaged in another, but I think through the logic, ‚Äù- said the director of company X. <br><br>  The project presentation somehow passed, we cut a lot of features, but what was - was the main idea and revealed the huge potential of the product in all its glory. <br><br>  <b>October 2015</b> <br><br>  In a close circle of programmers, we discussed our s / n on the basis of data on s / n employees of exemplary positions in other companies.  As a result, agreed to 70-90 to for each of us. <br><br>  In the process of waiting for a new s / n, we neatly raised continuous integration and wrote unit tests, while our director presented the project and gathered so respected investors around the world. <br><br>  After long, suspicious discussions, we were offered 30 days a month until the summer of 2016, although our requests were three times more and we really deserved it.  Probably, many are embarrassed by such a big leap in s / n, but we did the impossible - in a completely inexperienced team they put Django, Nginx, RabbitMQ, Celery, Elastic Search, PostgreSQL, Amazon Web Services, Jenkins, Selenium + Firefox, Karma into one project. + PhantomJS and a bunch of client pieces, and made it all fulfill specific business requirements. <br><br>  I, like the team leader, who spoke out loud for all five programmers, was the first to be fired.  Subsequently, the rest of the guys followed me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295996/</a></p>
