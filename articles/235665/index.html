However, the time for announcements has already come. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0e/951/c04/d0e951c04f7f435680b1e153747173cf.jpg"><br><br>  In the framework of the special Microsoft event, held under the slogan ‚ÄúReady for #morelumia?‚Äù, We presented three smartphones from the new line: the thin <a href="http://nokia.ly/1ps4kB1">Lumia 830</a> and two selfies, the <a href="http://nokia.ly/Wgqwr3">Lumia 730 DS</a> and Lumia 735. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Nokia Lumia 830 </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sb5McfPga4Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmISuWLVc03qOqBRqTvUhyNEKZfw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

      <br>
      The first novelty of the event was the vice-flagship Nokia Lumia 830. The smartphone successfully combines the successful design solutions of its predecessors, such as, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/186926">Nokia Lumia 1020</a> .  But most of all he podcherpnul in the appearance of the flagship model of the "elder brother" - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/227065">Lumia 930</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf8/343/36d/cf834336df044c17a017372cdfaea27f.jpg"><br>  <i>Nokia Lumia 930 (in the picture on the left) and Nokia Lumia 830</i> <br><br>  At the heart of the Lumia 830 case, as well as the flagship presented in the spring, is a monolithic metal frame in silver or black, which is also a design element of the smartphone.  The frontal part is almost completely covered with Gorilla 3.0 protective glass of slightly convex shape, and on the reverse side there is a colored protective cover made of polycarbonate.  The smartphone is presented in a completely black color, as well as combinations of silver frame and back cover in white, bright orange or bright green.  Such a design "recipe" is becoming traditional for Lumia and allows you to focus on lovers of bright colorful design, and conservative users. <br><br>  Another important point regarding the physical characteristics of the new smartphone is its thickness and weight.  They are 8.5 mm and 150 grams, respectively, so that the Lumia 830 becomes the thinnest and lightest device in the line at the moment.  The length and width of the new smartphone are 139.4 x 70.7 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8a/ef9/3a5/e8aef93a54914ec389e83179979af223.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth paying attention to the technical component.  The smartphone is equipped with a quad-core 1.2 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor with an Adreno 305 graphics chip and 1 GB of RAM. <br><br>  Lumia 830 has 16 GB of internal memory with the possibility of expanding through microSD memory cards (up to an impressive 128 GB).  Plus, all users will be available for free 15 GB in the OneDrive cloud. <br><br>  A clear five-inch IPS-display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels (pixel density - 296 pixels / inch) with ClearBlack technology boasts excellent readability in sunlight tse and facilitates the management of a smartphone in various conditions thanks to an ultra-sensitive sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/b8e/37a/5abb8e37a96641409074c6424525c1fe.jpg"><br><br>  Lumia 830 is equipped with a basic 10 megapixel camera with PureView technology, LED flash, ZEISS optics (the optical system consists of 6 lenses) and the easiest and thinnest optical image stabilization system of all that we have ever created.  The camera has a high sensitivity, allowing you to take high-quality images in low light conditions.  The sensor size is 1 / 3.4 inches, the focal length is 26 mm, and the f / 2.2 aperture.  The front-facing camera has a resolution of 0.9 megapixels and a wide-angle lens for better self-portraits and video calls. <br><br>  The main camera allows you to shoot video with a resolution of Full HD (1080p).  A Nokia Rich Recording technology and three high-performance microphones will provide sound recording in ‚Äúsurround sound‚Äù format (5.1) with no distortion throughout the entire full range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/ac6/7a9/f72ac67a98e84c6d8cd064c9d2f87692.jpg"><br><br>  A powerful replaceable battery (which is rare for flagship devices today) with a capacity of 2,200 mAh will provide up to 14.8 hours of talk time (on a 3G network).  You can recharge the Lumia 830 battery by QI standard wireless charging. <br><br>  The smartphone supports SensorCore technology, which allows you to collect information for fitness applications (such as Health and Fitness and Adidas miCoach) in low-power environments. <br><br>  The new Lumia 830 is already pre-installed the latest Lumia Denim update with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1. We will tell you more about it later in the post. <br><br>  Global sales of the Lumia 830 will begin this fall.  In Russia, the novelty will appear approximately in October.  The retail price will be announced additionally (the expected cost will be about 330 euros excluding taxes and discounts). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Technical characteristics of Lumia 830:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Operating system: Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Denim <br>  HERE geolocation services: Free global maps of HERE Maps and Navigator HERE Drive +.

The main difference between the models is that the Lumia 735 supports LTE networks, and the Lumia 730 DS supports simultaneous operation of two SIM cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e03/d1e/007/e03d1e007dc949b0b4ee1ae037f58cb4.jpg"><br><br>  A key feature of the new devices is a powerful front wide-angle camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels and the ability to record Full HD video.  The focal length of this camera is 24 mm, and the aperture - f / 2.4.  Thanks to the above characteristics and a wide-angle lens, the front camera is well suited for taking group photos with friends and sharing in Skype.  Especially for the presentation of the smartphone was developed a special application for shooting high-quality self-portraits - Lumia Selfie. <br><br>  The main camera in the new Lumia 730 DS / 735 smartphones has a resolution of 6.7 megapixels, autofocus, ZEISS optics and an LED flash.  The sensor size is 1 / 3.4 inches, the aperture is f / 1.9, and the focal length is 26 mm. <br><br>  The deep integration of Microsoft services in Windows Phone 8.1, pre-installed in new smartphones, allows one-touch switching from voice calls to video calls via Skype.  A system consisting of a pair of microphones and intelligent voice processing technology ensures clear sound transmission during conversations. <br><br>  In some markets, users of new smartphones will also have a three-month free Skype Worldwide Unlimited subscription to make international calls to a mobile or landline phone. <br><br>  The devices have a 4.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels with an aspect ratio of 16: 9 and a pixel density of 316 pixels / inch.  The smartphone supports ClearBlack technology and, like the Lumia 830, has a high sensitivity sensor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cec/b80/922/cecb80922c574abd9c3325ae0a4f109f.jpg"><br><br>  As for the other technical characteristics of the smartphone, here Lumia 730/735 smartphones will offer users a 1.2 GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor and 1 GB of RAM.  The internal memory of the device is 8 GB, but it can be expanded with microSD memory cards up to a maximum of 128 GB and cloud storage 15. It is worth recalling that with the recent update of Lumia Cyan, all Lumia devices were able to install applications on a memory card (respectively, if device supports work with them). <br><br>  A battery with a capacity of 2220 mAh will allow you to use your smartphone all day without thinking about charging.  The maximum talk time on the 3G network is 17 hours.  The Lumia 735 has support for QI standard wireless charging (but only with the optional Wireless Charging Shell (CC-3086) - <b>UPD</b> ). <br><br>  New items are presented in a recognizable Lumia palette: bright green, bright orange, dark gray and white.  The dimensions of the smartphone are 134.7 x 68.5 x 8.9 mm, and the weight is 130.4 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/213/26e/c41/21326ec416534ce58488a21eb2fca011.jpg"><br><br>  Lumia 730 and Lumia 735 also come with a pre-installed Lumia Denim update, which includes a new application for shooting "Lumia Camera".  Also, users will have access to a package of mobile applications Microsoft Office, detailed maps and satellite navigation (HERE Maps and Drive +), clients of leading social services such as Instagram and Twitter, as well as the latest fitness applications that use the benefits of SensorCore technology, such as Fitbit and Adidas miCoach. <br><br>  Deliveries of the affordable and powerful Lumia 730 Dual SIM and Lumia 735 to Russia are expected in October.  Price will be announced additionally.  The estimated cost of the 4G / LTE modification will be about 219 euros, and the 3G Dual SIM version is about 199 euros (all prices are exclusive of taxes and fees). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Technical characteristics of the Lumia 730 DS / 735:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Operating system: Windows Phone 8.1 with Lumia Denim <br>  HERE geolocation services: Free HERE Maps and Navigator HERE Drive +.

Many features are hardware dependent and are being announced for Lumia 930, Lumia 1520 and Lumia 830 only. Information about the availability of certain features on other Lumia devices will be provided simultaneously with the distribution of this update. <br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Lumia Camera</b> ‚Äù - will replace the Nokia Camera application.  It features an improved shooting algorithm, new features and more intuitive controls.

Each video frame has a resolution of 8.3 megapixels, which means that each frame can be saved as a static image. <br>  Rich Capture will add HDR support and allow users to first take a picture, then adjust the settings and select the best option. <br><br>  <b>Improved Glance screen</b> (the screen displayed in the lock mode of the smartphone) - Lumia devices that support it can, in addition to the date and alerts, display other information, for example, from <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0/63c2a117-8604-44e7-8cef-df10be3a57c8">Weather</a> or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581/cbb8c3bd-99e8-4176-ad8c-95ec6a3641c2%3Fsignin%3Dtrue">Health and Fitness</a> apps. <br><br>  The Lumia Denim update will be available for download by air in the fourth quarter of 2014, after testing and approval by partners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235665/</a></p>
