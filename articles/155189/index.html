  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Again firmware: CM10 for Desire HD</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed6/bc9/be8/ed6bc9be84cb300975edddacd323e4ed.jpg">  Having tried <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151156/">Virtuous Infinity</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/153209/">JellyTime</a> , I began to carefully study what was happening outside the boundaries of these projects.  Moreover, the last update of JellyTime R21 on October 17 brought disappointment - the sound in the player became unrecognizable, your favorite songs on the road began to cause only disgust.  Specifically - it became very hard to lock the bass, which I could not cure with the help of the built-in JT DSP Manager, or the PowerAMP equalizer.  I had to look towards something new. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually, why I decided to upgrade to another firmware - constant JT updates.  This is good (it means the authors work), and bad (constantly download, flash, try, swear to new glitches).  I checked all the assemblies in a row from R12 to R15, inclusive, and then immediately R21, since the Android version was upgraded to 4.1.2 (nothing global, but they said that the power consumption was corrected. Lies).  And in general, it is stressful to download 150 MB of new firmware every time. <br>  After studying the opinions of users of xda-developers and w3bsit3-dns.com, I decided to stop at the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1820881">unofficial build of Cyanogen Mod 10</a> for Desire HD.  There are only "nightly" builds, and the fact that a stable official version is released is still a big question - there are versions no higher than 7 <a href="http://download.cyanogenmod.com/%3Fdevice%3Dace%26type%3D">on the Cyanoden Mod website</a> . And this is Android 2.3, you know, it‚Äôs reluctant to take a step back, having tasted the fours. <br><br>  In general, I stitched the last nightly assembly for October 17th, compared to JT, the responsiveness of the interface increased.  The sound in the player has improved, but not much - locking the bass is less, but still present.  Almost managed to heal, putting in the settings of the equalizer PowerAMP preset "Light bass".  It is pleasant to listen, in general, the ear hardly cuts.  Maybe, of course, the matter is also in my headphones (the standard headset from the phone kit), and music lovers will certainly scoff at this fact.  But the thing is that with the same headphones before the sound was clear!  Maybe in 4.1.2 they managed to break something, maybe it is in these firmwares that I don‚Äôt know, and I don‚Äôt want to figure it out.  Just want to listen to music. <br>  As for the general impressions - purely positive.  The interface responds quickly, applications open without brakes too.  Sometimes when changing the orientation of the screen at some point, artifacts appear on the screen, but then they disappear on their own, this is not critical for me.  The standard for building the Trebuchet launcher was again replaced with the favorite Go Launcher EX with the corresponding body kit from the dialer and the messaging program. <br><br>  What still needs to be improved: <br>  1. Player control from the headset buttons - still not repaired, although the developer‚Äôs to-do list is one of the first places <br>  2. Spontaneous disabling the setting "For developers - Disable hardware overlay."  In JT, the removed jackdaw at this point gave the wildest artifacts in the player and camera (both stock and third-party), such as: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Screenshot from MX Player</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6fb/ed6/825/6fbed682579ba6d94b487173d886307a.png"></div></div><br>  Interestingly, even in CM10, the jackdaw itself is still removed after a reboot, but no such artifacts are noted - yesterday I photographed the whole evening on the phone, watched the video - the camera and video player behaved decently. <br>  3. Sound in player

      As for WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS - everything works clearly, quickly and without complaints, at least for me.  I saw a few complaints about Bluetooth, but the bug was not confirmed.  The battery is consumed no more and no less than the last tested JT R21, I still bring half the battery to work.  In sleep mode, it behaves pretty well for my settings - after all, I have a bunch of widgets on each desktop. <br><br>  As a summary, I will say that the firmware is generally suitable for use, quite fast, compared to JT (in the AnTuTu test it showed a slight excess in points).  I also follow the development of the <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1933804">PACman</a> and <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1862915">codefireX</a> firmware <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1933804">with</a> <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1862915">interest</a> - according to reviews.  not bad either.  Perhaps in the future I will try them too. <br><br>  And finally, the proverb: <i>If you have reshuffled your phone at least once, you will do it all the time.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155189/</a></p>
