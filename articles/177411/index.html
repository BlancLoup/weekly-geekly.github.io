It is useful primarily for those who are dreaming of launching their own project and the subsequent cutting of hundreds of millions with an unsuspecting, stupid, and unaware audience. <br><br>  <b>Apple's appeal to employees is diminishing</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/176975/">Rus</a> <br>  Apple has always had a reputation for holding employees ‚Äî they have worked for it for decades, despite the lack of career growth, lower wages and the lack of bonuses.  Recently, however, everything began to change, writes Business Insider. <br><br>  <b>Hopscotch: the basics of programming for kids on the iPad</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/176965/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81c/f2f/459/81cf2f459473a89c025283a5117a79dd.png" alt="image"><br>  Hopscotch is an object-oriented language that is made intentionally bright and colorful, suitable for children of 8-12 years old.  Instead of loading children with endless lines of code, creating Hopscotch programs is dragging and dropping various objects and scripts that can work with them. <br><br>  <b>Difficulties of translation: as a translation Hit Tennis 3 doubled the number of downloads</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/perevoda-udvoil-kolichestvo-zagruzok.html">Rus</a> <br>  We translated our iOS hit Hit Tennis 3 into 14 languages.  In general, we have doubled the number of downloads in a few weeks and hit the charts in some countries. <br><br>  <b>New features in Facebook SDK for iOS</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/facebook-sdk-dlya-ios-new.html">Rus</a> <br>  Facebook announced a series of changes aimed at helping mobile developers integrate social networks.  Among them, the new Open Graph API, the new standard sharing dialogue, an accelerated login and the Technology Partners program, which will help developers to look for third-party solutions. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Study Google Play and AdMob on the example of a single application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176675/">Rus</a> <br>  My free app on Google Play is turning into a year.  During this year I managed to collect 77.5 thousand installations in total, 22.5 thousand active installations, earn $ 75 on in-app (15 of which disappeared in an unknown direction), as well as $ 364 on AdMob advertising. <br><br>  <b>Android NDK: OpenSL ES</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176933/">Rus</a> <br>  OpenSL ES - library for 2D and 3D audio in C <br><br>  <b>Creating a custom component from scratch</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176643/">Part 1</a> / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176919/">Part 2</a> <br>  Quite often, when developing multimedia Android applications (hereinafter simply ‚Äúapplications‚Äù), we are faced with the task of creating our own components that are not provided for in the system.  It can be all kinds of knobs-switches, spectrum visualizers, etc. Some of them can be obtained by simply replacing the graphic resource, turning the canvas by 90 degrees, etc. But sometimes, you still have to do something different. zero. <br><br>  <b>Writing a simple application for working with the RESTful API for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176729/">Rus</a> <br>  Working with the API of various portals is one of the most common tasks encountered when developing for Android.  It would seem nothing complicated - to send HTTP requests asynchronously and display the answers, but the devil, as always, is in the details. <br><br>  <b>Google Play started taking screenshots for tablets</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-play-skrinshotyi-dlya-planshetov.html">Rus</a> <br>  When viewing the store from a specific device, it will show pictures of only the required version.  In addition, Google itself with the help of screenshots will be able to determine ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù applications for tablets and highlight and offer them to users. <br><br>  <b>Android's universal resolution: perfect on all screens</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177093/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/473/b18/1a8/473b181a8c2a31dc73f96289985f5908.png" alt="image"><br>  In writing a program for Android, one of the main tasks of the developer is to make the application look equally beautiful on any screen resolution.  And often novice developers have difficulty with the correct location of the interface elements and the correct method of texture compression.  In this article, I will paint one of the best ways to adapt an application to any screen resolution I have come to on the path of trial and error. <br><br>  <b>Accusoft released USB Scanner Toolkit for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/accusoft-usb-scanner-toolkit-android.html">Rus</a> <br>  Scanning documents using a mobile device was hardly a simple matter, relying mainly on the camera, but Accusoft intends to correct this situation and releases an Android SDK, which should greatly simplify the communication of mobile devices with scanners. <br><br><h4>  Firefox os </h4><br><br>  <b>Phones on Firefox OS will be available in June, in 5 countries</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176871/">Rus</a> <br>  And the first such devices will go on sale in June of this year, in five countries.

In the 4th quarter of 2012, the Apple store overtook the Google store 4 times in terms of revenue, while in the 1st quarter of 2012 - 2.6 times.  The new App Annie report also notes that Play is growing faster than its competitor.  Nevertheless, although Google Play reached 90% of the App Store level in Q1 2013, the latter is far ahead of him in making money. <br><br>  <b>Distimo: the most profitable countries for the App Store and Play games in March 2013</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/distimo-samyie-pribyilnyie-stranyi-dlya-app-store-i-playstore.html">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d28/853/c21/d28853c21bd6feb6d13ac7f25b3c827d.png"><br>  Distimo, following App Annie, published new data on platform earnings in various countries and the most popular applications, highlighting 20 leading countries for the iPhone, iPad and Android. <br><br>  <b>A brief introduction to the MOAI Framework</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176765/">Rus</a> <br>  When it comes to business applications, it is customary to write multiple copies for each of the popular mobile platforms.  This is fully justified, since the Android / iOS / etc platforms are so specific that it is quite difficult to implement on the principle of ‚ÄúCode at once - run everywhere‚Äù.  However, the situation is quite different when it comes to mobile games.  Games usually have their own style of graphic elements - buttons, menus, etc., and all graphics are built either on sprites or on 3D.  There is a completely natural desire to write an application once and collect it for different platforms.  The cross-platform MOAI framework will help us achieve this. <br><br>  <b>Xamarin launches Test Cloud, a platform for automatically testing mobile application interfaces</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/xamarin-test-cloud.html">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/81e/bd6/f2f/81ebd6f2fa0b255edd9accc3a7b883d6.jpg"><br>  Xamarin Test Cloud is a Calabash-based automated user interface testing platform that the company launched at its Evolve 2013 developer conference in Austin. <br><br>  <b>Terevaka - a high level framework on Lua for mobile platforms</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176771/">Rus</a> <br>  Dear friends, today I will tell you about the high level framework on Lua for mobile platforms of its own design.  As you may have guessed from the name, this framework uses another low-level framework for drawing graphics and for interacting with the system.  The quality of it is MOAI. <br><br>  <b>Yodo1 introduces the Kryptanium social gaming platform.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/yodo1-kryptanium.html">Rus</a> <br>  Yodo1 is already conducting a beta test of its platform with 1 million Chinese users, it implements functions for exchanging statuses, screenshots, likes and even virtual currency directly from applications. <br><br>  <b>Research of the Russian job market for mobile developers</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/issledovanie-rossiyskogo-ryinka-rabotyi-dlya-mobilnyih-razrabotchikov-2013.html">Rus</a> <br>  At the beginning of April 2013, IT Brain IT and Apps4All investigated a job market for mobile developers in Russia. <br><br>  <b>JScrambler 3 helps JavaScript and HTML5 developers hide their code</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/jscrambler-3-pomogaet-razrabotchikam-skryivat-svoy-kod.html">Rus</a> <br>  JScrambler 3 allows developers to obfuscate source code for mobile and desktop web applications so that it becomes almost impossible to read it. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>PapayaMobile opens China Mobile billing for developers around the world</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/papayamobile-billing-china-mobile.html">Rus</a> <br>  PapayaMobile opens a billing system that will allow Western developers to connect their Android games directly to the China Mobile payment infrastructure. <br><br>  <b>NARR8 starts monetization</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/narr8-nachinaet-monetizitsiyu.html">Rus</a> <br>  What everyone has been asking about for so long has happened.  Now, iPad users can access all library content (motion-comics, interactive novels and popular science series) for virtual currency NARRs, which can be obtained in two ways: daily visiting the app, or buying for real money. <br><br>  <b>Monetization of mobile games is not as simple as it seems.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/monetizatsiya-mobilnyih-igr-ne-tak-prosta.html">Rus</a> <br>  Mobile games also face great difficulties in transforming players into paying users.  Only 47% of American mobile players in the last 6 months bought games, and only 21% paid for in-game items.  For comparison, 75% of traditional players pay for physical games for consoles or computers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177411/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177411/</a></p>
