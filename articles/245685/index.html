      <b>Today, about checking the solution in perspective:</b> how the proposed solution behaves under dynamic loads. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The correct solution should not only solve the current need or problem, but also <b>capitalize your efforts</b> to solve it, to get long-term benefits. <br><br>  Speaking, for example, in chess language: a horse must not only move away from the pawn attack, but also attack the enemy's rook and create pressure on the ‚Äúsweep‚Äù fields in the desired area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe chess field. <br><br>  Or in the language of agriculture: cutting down a forest belt should solve a point request for wood to build two barns, but at the same time cutting should be done in such a way as to create a ‚Äúcut-off strip‚Äù from the forest in case of fire, and ideally the forest should be cut where it is planned to build a road to the new lake of the fish farmer. <br><br>  That is, the current solution should solve your problems now, and the efforts that you put on should give you advantages in the future and have the ability to accumulate: capitalize, as the interest on the right bank account is added to the deposit amount, and in the next period the interest is already on the amount deposit + interest for the previous period. <br><br>  Today, as you understood, the day of analogies from the external real world, as well.  Add more examples from the reverse: <br><ul><li>  You can not serve the car under the rules of waiting until the accumulated ‚Äúservice debt‚Äù, and the car will be a long-term and expensive repair. </li><li>  You can not engage in themselves and their health, rolling out the resource of the body, and then lie down in the hospital with problems of the stomachs, nerves and pressure. </li><li>  You can not invest time in the development of their professional skills and rotate in the same professional orbit, without making qualitative steps towards more responsible positions and interesting tasks. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Briefly remind ourselves what problem we solve:</b> <br><ul><li>  Modern life surrounds us with economic and political problems, diligently putting calm and sensible problems of the next system level on the heads of people, which the mere mortal cannot influence. </li><li>  The methods used in modern politics create a huge parasitic informational background, in which it is very difficult to live and work, primarily because of the lack of focus between external and internal problems. </li><li>  Professional life is also not indulge.  Systemic or hereditary behavioral models constantly bring problems of the next level of professional hierarchies to our heads - there are two ways to reduce their influence and quantity: change the system (which is difficult from low levels of the hierarchy) or change the level within the system and take positions with greater influence on the system . </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What do we offer:</b> <br><ul><li>  Training, as a means of focusing on something that loads the brain with the right flow of incoming information </li><li>  Focus on the study and implementation of skills and knowledge that will help you do your job easier and faster, with less losses in ‚Äúidle‚Äù communications and unproductive models for developing and arguing ideas and solutions </li><li>  Get the opportunity to convert the invested effort into a new position, which will allow you to operate with more interesting tasks and increase the level of income </li><li>  Set a long-term goal, thereby reducing situational anxiety, which is interpreted by others as useless throwing </li></ul><br><br>  We checked the proposed solution in statics, that is, we looked at what solutions there are in addition to the proposed one, and what limitations this solution has.  Now let's talk about testing solutions for sustainability over time.  Will the solution work for you in the short and long term. <br><br>  Speaking about checking the solution in perspective, we first check 2 things: <br><ol><li>  Can there be results or assets that you have gained from a ‚Äúlearn‚Äù decision that is easily lost in the future? </li><li>  Can the results be capitalized, where we started the current touch with the topic </li></ol><br><br>  About the first check, we have already spoken.  The conclusion is self-evident: accumulated knowledge is practically the only asset that cannot be taken away from a person.  Knowledge converted into experience through the practice of application becomes a part of behavioral models and a decision-making method - part of how a person behaves.  By nature, this cannot be taken away or easily lost due to external political or economic factors. <br><br>  <b>With capitalization, the question is more complicated: let's consider it in more detail.</b> <br><br>  Intensive <i>short-term</i> training leads to the accumulation of knowledge that can be immediately put into practice, which brings noticeable results almost immediately.  You just start writing other letters to customers, behave differently at meetings, calmly conduct technical speeches and reasonably defend your position in disputes and discussions. <br><br>  Surrounding people and the management especially clearly note the change of behavior: so if earlier or now you noticed ‚Äúskids‚Äù in terms of professional communication or service activities (writing letters, making presentations, selling ideas and suggestions), then you can get rid of them . <br><br>  We tried to take into account this quick effect when creating our training program: the program is modular, consists of 4 main sections or ‚ÄúFormulas‚Äù as we call them: <br><ol><li>  Formula for working with people </li><li>  Project Management Formula </li><li>  Formula negotiation </li><li>  Transition formula (how to become a manager) </li></ol><br><br>  These programs were conducted by us in 2014 as separate internships for a month of active study. <br><br>  We should also mention 2 courses, which are also included in the annual program of the School and are for reference only: <br><ol><li>  Negotiator's Handbook </li><li>  Manager's Handbook (‚ÄúSolver 3.0‚Äù) </li></ol><br><br>  These additional courses include video analysis of the most frequently encountered negotiation and management situations: more than 90 situations with analysis of 5‚Äì20 minutes each. <br><br>  Quite often there is no need to study the entire course in negotiations, for example, if a student already has a certain theory. The base and he needs to quickly get an answer to some applied question. <br><br>  The very process of student learning in our annual program allows him, independently or with our help, to select and begin work precisely from that module of the program, the study and implementation of which is most necessary now and will allow one to get the first external, noticeable changes quickly enough. <br><br>  The presence in the program of logically completed modules and the flexibility to choose the sequence of work with modules will allow students to get results and convert them to new positions or interesting tasks not after the end of the entire annual course, but from 1 to 2 months, depending on the intensity of the study and time which the student can devote to learning. <br><br>  In the short term, the program allows to get practical results either ‚Äúthe next day‚Äù in the case of a student working with the ‚ÄúReferences‚Äù, or in the first weeks of training in the program, in the case of a student working with the ‚ÄúFormulas‚Äù. <br><br>  Go ahead: check what happens to a student who is configured for <i>long-term education</i> and is ready to go through most of the modules offered by the program. <br><br>  <b>Point changes</b> begin to occur step by step, after each module studied.  Against the general background of people who ‚Äúgo to work to do work for which they pay money‚Äù (that is, just according to the rules: came at 10:00, left at 18:00, and was seen in the workplace), students of any programs that are beginning to implement these practices in work, stand out quite noticeably.  This is also noted by the students and managers with whom we communicate. <br><br>  After each point change, you will receive a plus / plus / plus in karma from bosses, customers and colleagues.  Changes in your behavior will not go unnoticed.  Your new results and the attitude of other people towards you is exactly what is then converted into new positions, promotions and greater pleasure from work. <br><br>  The main thing that I would like to note: you can not stop doing what you learn at the moment when the company matures to organizational changes and is ready to launch a mechanism to increase or expand the zone of authority of a particular employee (depending on the type and size of companies, this takes from several months , up to six months). <br><br>  At the design level of our currently main product - the Stratoplan School of Managers' annual training program - we took into account a certain inertia of the structures in which we work and offer not just a substantial ‚Äúknowledge load‚Äù (90 hours of materials, not counting the bonus classes and the time for teachers to live with students), but also the annual program of phased implementation of the knowledge gained in the practice of your work.  The program is built on the principle of ‚Äúpassed the module - went further‚Äù with an unlimited number of attempts to protect the material studied. <br><br>  We also know that when making decisions, many people are worried about the unknown.  And this is logical - no one has learned to predict the future, and the informational background paints more and more gloomy pictures.  However, any anxiety goes away when there is a goal, a plan and action. <br>  How do psychologists say?  Fear goes when action comes.  And no one says that the goal, plan and actions should be perfect.  They should be yours.  Not perfect, but yours. <br><br>  We specifically add to our program tools and personal discussion with each person of his professional goals (in the internal language of our students they are called ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù).  Because actions and approximation to your results, this is exactly what gives you the strength to perform actions that leave fear, situational anxiety, and systemic changes come. <br><br>  <b>What do we suggest to do now, while reading this cycle of materials?</b> <br><br>  Soberly assess your condition now: <br><ol><li>  How long have you been thinking about your own goals? </li><li>  In which environment you are currently working: how much the company and your boss know about your professional goals and are ready to support you in their implementation?  It's hard to count on the loaded manual's extrasensory abilities with respect to your unique person, right? </li><li>  When was the last time that you made, tracked and corrected your movement plan for a year, two, five or more years ahead? </li><li>  How many professional development books have you read in the past year?  And artistic?  Do you generally use a resource that gives your own reading list? </li><li>  How many seminars / trainings have you attended this year?  How many of them were helpful?  What of the past you have already implemented and how much useful ‚Äúwent into the table‚Äù and sank under the flow of incoming tasks and external troubles? </li><li>  What from the reading, the study did you put into real life and was it marked by your guidance in your personal ‚Äútrack record‚Äù? </li><li>  How much is the information background sucking you in right now?  And to what extent does this de-focus on the unimportant affect your achievement of your professional and, as a result, personal goals? </li></ol><br><br>  The force of inertia is a terrible thing.  She blows us back.  And it seems that the salary is not falling (we‚Äôll not be talking about inflation now), but time is running out ... <br><br>  Remember how much you wanted to do at school, college?  The world was bright, eyes wide open and it seemed that everything was still ahead?  Time flows like sand through my fingers ... what is changing? <br><br>  All that we do - we offer you a fork, a choice.  There were three of them in fairy tales; we have two: either you go forward or you stand in one place. <br><br>  The strength of the decision not equal to the strength of the decision with a minus sign.  Every decision that is not made is another blow to your internal ABS system, which ‚Äúdelays‚Äù you before changes, trying to make life manageable, static and boring. <br><br>  <b>Not made decisions accumulate</b> <br><br>  In the dynamics we are talking about, the decision not to make a choice will mean that you have decided not to change anything.  And the things left to themselves have a tendency to degrade.  Speaking the language of systems - each system tends to rest.  And we too. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible to change the desire of the system to total peace?</b> <br><br>  Let's look at the numbers. <br><br>  The statistics and the results of our training programs so that you can somehow predict the effectiveness of the ‚ÄúLearn and invest in yourself‚Äù model: <br><ul><li>  34% of graduates receive new positions and teams in the first year after training </li><li>  76% of graduates come to us again and recommend us to their colleagues and employees. </li><li>  82% of students are trained to the end </li><li>  94% of students rate programs 4.8 out of 5 and up </li></ul><br><br>  <b>What you need to do right now:</b> <br><br>  Answer for yourself the small questionnaire above and register for a free webinar, the online presentation of the annual program of the Stratoplan School of Managers, which will be held at 11:00 Moscow time (11:00 am Moscow time), December 16th (Tuesday). <br><br>  Participation is free, and registration takes less than 30 seconds: <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1202720948275279617">https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1202720948275279617</a> <br><br>  <b>See you online on December 16th at 11:00 (Moscow time).</b> <br><br>  - <br>  <b>Respectfully,</b> <br>  Alexander Orlov, Slava Pankratov <br>  Managers School Stratoplan </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245685/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245685/</a></p>
