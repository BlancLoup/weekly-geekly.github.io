Below you will learn how to do this and achieve more with smaller nerves. <br><br>  Accurate internal clocks are the cornerstone of time management.  If the assessment of the units of time and what can be done for these units is difficult for you, then you will always be upset about the cases that cannot be completed on time.

      Psychologists Jane Burke and Lenora Yuen offer in their book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Procrastination-Why-You-What-About/dp/0738211702/">Procrastination: A</a> number of specific exercises to improve their time management. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Practice timing </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/084db94e/338eec2e/b3c3209c/0e76dfaf.jpg"><br><br>  Because of the tendency to overestimate our own capabilities, lack of practice, or chronic stress, many of us fail to accurately determine time.  Burke and Ewen explain this by saying that age, dopamine levels, and wishful thinking impair our ability to adequately measure the passage of time.  (Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonboy_mitchell/3185818026/">John Mitchell</a> ) <br><br>  First of all, you need to start measuring the time spent <i>in reality</i> .  If, for example, your head is fixed that a daily trip to work or school takes 20 minutes, although in fact, taking into account the morning flow, it turns out 35, then the morning procedures will need to be adjusted accordingly.  The same with the morning shower;  if a vigorous 10 minute rinse is actually a slow wake up lasting 25 minutes, then it‚Äôs immediately clear where the extra 15 minutes go to every morning. <br><br>  If you do not wear a wrist watch, then this is a great reason to get it.  Also start keeping a simple journal of where your time is going, be it in a small notebook or a mobile application (like <a href="">Timr for Android</a> ).  If you spend most of your time at the table, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5362829/five-best-time%2Btracking-applications">desktop time trackers</a> can be useful.  Spend a week or two, re-familiarizing yourself with the amount of time that is actually spent on routine trips, preparing reports at work, cooking dinner and other daily activities. <br><br><h5>  Learn to use short periods of time. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2fffff63/528ef230/e3b09b24/da2b81f3.jpg"><br><br>  Here, Burka and Ewen offer the magnificent Swiss Cheese method, invented by Alan Lakein.  Its essence lies in the fact that the schedule of each project must have holes, like Swiss cheese.  If the task takes 10 hours to complete, this does not mean that 10 hours should pass in the marathon mode.  It is better to keep in advance the intervals that can be spent on small fragments of larger projects.  You can use these temporary windows as efficiently as possible if you already have a list of projects or, for example, calls to make in your bag or phone.  (Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zooboing/4398849331/">Patrick Hoesley</a> ) <br><br>  A timer can also be useful here.  If you often distract from work or, on the contrary, you cannot find the strength to break away, it is convenient to use a timer to create a sensible deadline.  Start the timer for 30 minutes and focus on the project, then switch to another or take a well-deserved break. <br><br><h5>  Anticipate distractions </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f74072a3/573f0ac8/fd86c35f/99430b27.jpg"><br><br>  A close relative of poorly tuned domestic clocks are inadequate hopes for concentration.  To some extent, your plans will definitely be disrupted.  Whether it is a small crisis at work, occupying a pre-allocated hour for processing a monthly report, or being late for work by two hours due to a snowstorm, external forces regularly try to dislodge you from the schedule.  Stay ahead of plans whenever possible.  (Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hmk/3863067780/">Michael Karshisa</a> ) <br><br><h5>  Distribute Responsibilities Effectively </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d3778bb8/f16e1018/86d1678a/b6d13b58.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúI can do all this‚Äù attitude is the main destroyer of all time management techniques.  Many people are reluctant to share their work, either because they consider themselves the only ones qualified enough for her, or because the load sharing is for losers who are not good enough in their profession to do everything on their own.  Burka and Ewen rightly insist that these are myths that plague is spreading around the offices and are often an excuse for postponing work.  Learn to assign responsibilities and focus on the tasks that most require execution.  (Photo <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/53370644%40N06/4976497160/">tableatny</a> ) <br><br><h5>  Find your best time </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/84c833a6/122f09d4/92ed1684/ff80facc.jpg"><br><br>  Although numerous cups of coffee and a commitment to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%258D%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">Puritan work ethic</a> give us a feeling of constant cheerfulness and readiness for everything, the feeling is false.  Someone is ready to work immediately after jumping out of bed, and someone has a peak of activity after sunset.  As part of your time tracking project, pay attention to what time of day you are most effective and concentrated.  Most of us work during normal hours, although we would achieve better results a little earlier or later.  Do not forget about your diet, because it may be that you are not really an "owl", but simply do not eat normally before dinner and therefore receive a noticeable surge of energy from him.  (Photo by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdpettitt/2681296156/">Martin Petitt</a> ) <br><br><h5>  Start scheduling and enjoy your free time. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4314748b/80b556a4/c82840a7/3a25efbf.jpg"><br><br>  People with bad time management skills are trapped when it comes to leisure activities.  You can be distracted by all sorts of pleasant little things while working, but half an hour of real rest after a busy day relaxes significantly more than half an hour of otlyvanivanie during its length.  One of the advantages of controlling your own time and schedule is knowing when to stop working and do personal tasks, sleep and relaxation.  The work will go much better when you know the exact time of its completion and that after it you will have a rest with a clear conscience.
