We chose two of them. <br><br>  First, in the 19H2 summer build, Windows 10 will be supplied with a full-fledged Linux kernel based on <a href="">version 4.19 dated October 22, 2018</a> for its own Linux for Windows subsystem (WSL - Windows Subsystem Linux). <br><br>  Second, the core of IE will be built into the future Enterprise assemblies of the Chromium-reincarnation of the murdered by Microsoft Edge.

      The first news is important and useful for developers, the second is like a bad joke. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e5/ky/aj/e5kyajhde67uailyz1-w4ytsliy.png"><br>  <i>We built in your Chromium-browser IE engine so that you do not forget that this is the browser Edge</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Linux Kernel on Windows 10 </h3><br>  Adding a full-fledged Linux kernel to Windows 10 is a logical step that continues Microsoft‚Äôs methodical work with the community.  Earlier in Windows, only the Linux kernel emulation was available.  In parallel with the Linux kernel inside its system, the company announced the release of <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2019/05/07/microsoft-unveils-new-open-source-windows-terminal/">Windows Terminal</a> - a new Windows application for centralized access to the PowerShell, Cmd subsystems and, in fact, the Linux kernel itself in the WSL package. <br><br>  Representatives of the company claim that 4.19 is not the latest version of the kernel for their subsystem.  In the future, WSL will be updated and keep up with stable versions of the Linux kernel, which is also important.  In addition, the introduction of a full-fledged kernel into the system eliminates the need for emulation, which, directly, will increase the productivity and comfort of developers working from under Windows.  In addition, WSL is based on open source code, that is, any developer will be able to make the necessary changes to the subsystem and make kernel forks. <br><br>  This is not the first major step towards the developer community.  Previously, the company has <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-bash-shell-command-line-windows-10">integrated into its system Bash</a> , which can be called a very serious step for a very conservative Microsoft. <br><br>  Microsoft's actions are surprising, but not shocking: under the control of Satya Nadella, the company actually broke into the open source community and more and more focused on working directly with developers and the enterprise segment, as evidenced by Microsoft's actions over the past 3-4 years. <br><br><h3>  The monster Microsoft or why in the Chromium Edge core of Internet Explorer </h3><br>  Everyone with a shudder recalls Internet Explorer, and the old type-makers also cry at the same time.  When Microsoft announced Spartan and the rejection of IE, they began to open champagne around the world, but the reality turned out to be angrier than we had hoped.  Until now, there are solutions, portals and websites created to work exclusively under old versions of IE.  For the most part, these solutions reside in closed enterprise solutions.  Once upon a time, Microsoft had a choice: to force companies around the world to update their internal products and solutions due to the company's total failure from IE, or to start a ‚Äúwrong way‚Äù to fight.  Since the complete rejection of IE threatened billions in losses for Microsoft and reputational damage, the giant had to drag its browser compatibility to Internet Explorer pages from year to year. <br><br>  Even after a loud rejection of the EdgeHTML engine and the translation of the development of the ‚Äúdefault browser‚Äù for Windows 10 to the Chromium engine, Microsoft cannot escape from its terrible legacy in the face of Internet Explorer. <br><br>  Therefore, especially for the Enterprise assemblies of Windows 10, the company will deliver a version of Chromium Edge with a ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù - the built-in IE engine in the Edge itself.  Such a strange solution will ensure the compatibility of the new browser with the old corporate solutions, which once rashly nailed nails to Internet Explorer. <br><br>  When opening any page adapted for Internet Explorer in Chromium Edge, the browser will automatically activate ‚ÄúIE Compatibility Mode‚Äù and connect a display corresponding to this in Internet Explorer 11. You can see that the page is running in compatibility mode by clicking on the special IE icon next to it. with the address bar on the browser page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1fd/8de/5c5/1fd8de5c50cd89fcefd5a8900fd94c92.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Microsoft itself insists that companies using obsolete web portals should upgrade to the new Chromium Edge and completely abandon the practice of using the IE + bundle on any other browser.  Of course, any technical specialist will say that such a step in embedding an outdated engine into a new product is redundant, but, in fact, Microsoft is now trying to save face and a little bit doing charity work.  The question is whether the giant will ever be able to say "no" to business and finally "shoot the donkey."  Not yet. <br><br>  The conference began yesterday, May 6, and will last until the 8th, so Microsoft has at least one day to surprise us even more. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450846/</a></p>
