  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Go to health</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Pulling ups, push-ups, swimming and running are good and useful sports, but they are all separate processes for which you need to allocate a resource of time, space, and often money.  I want to talk about the most, the most integrated sport for the life of the person, and not only ours. <br>  Ta-dam!  A curtain!  I present to your attention a way to upgrade the usual daily walk to sports exercises. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br>  The most weighty argument in favor of walking is that he absolutely, absolutely, does not require any financial investments at all, and sometimes even helps save money (of course, if you are not a girl who chronically prefers high-heeled shoes). <br>  To walk, you do not need to get up at six in the morning and go to the gym, close your pets (and sometimes residents) in a separate room, so that they do not rush at you when you energetically wave your arms and legs while doing exercises.  No need to learn a special technique (you just need to follow a few safety rules, which are described below).  No restrictions on age, sex and weight.  And the most important thing is that you don‚Äôt have to change your lifestyle either. <br><br><h4>  Benefit </h4><br>  When walking a person burns up to 360 kcal per hour, yes - not much, but better than nothing at all.  Vigorous walking perfectly stimulates the heart (comparable to more labor-intensive cardio-loadings), restores normal vascular tone (to those who smoke), normalizes general blood pressure (hypo- and hypertension), enriches the blood with oxygen (stuffy cabinets and hypodynamia), they also say that it does not it thickens the blood like most other sports, but I don‚Äôt presume to argue - I haven‚Äôt found any disproving or proving information. <br>  Deep breathing, when walking, perfectly massages the internal organs (digestive problems, constipation).  Provides blood flow to the pelvic organs (there is a whole bunch of diseases of the genitourinary system, as well as the heresser‚Äôs worst enemy - hemorrhoids).  Tightens the abdominal muscles (beer waving you hand), strengthens the musculoskeletal system of the lower extremities, if in Russian for girls: elastic and taut ass and slender legs, but do not go on the heels, otherwise poor posture and the threat of various dislocations and stretches. <br><br><h4>  We go for health </h4><br>  Yes.  For walking, you can set aside a separate time and walk every day for 30 minutes 2-3 km.  But so we do not need.  Therefore, I suggest going to work and from work on foot.  We take a map and plot a route from home to work.  If you live far away, then we find, for a start, the nearest public transport stop at a distance of 1 km, and we will walk to it.  In the future, you can increase to 4 km in each direction (there and back) at the generally accepted rate of 8 km per day.  You can also choose for walking distance from stop to work - as you like. <br>  Since we go to work barely getting out of bed, then the first hundred meters is better to go with my usual step (I chose the nearest traffic light for myself), so we will knead the muscles, it is important to follow this rule in the winter when cold ambient air can cause convulsions muscle <br>  At the traffic lights, while waiting for the little green man, you can additionally stretch your ankle muscles and ligaments.  To do this, go up on socks, lower, put weight on heels and again on socks.  There is no traffic light, it does not matter, leaving the apartment, we descend the stairs as far as we can pull out the socks, stand on the entire foot and heel and tear off, at the next step, at the very last moment. <br>  After warming up and warm-up, you can go at a speed a little faster than usual, the main thing is that breathing is not lost.  By the way, breathing is your speedometer - you need to walk so fast that your breathing is not lost, the more you walk, the better you keep the rhythm, the faster you can walk.  Watch your posture.  In many places they write that you need to keep straight, do not tilt your head, etc.  It seems that they themselves never went.  At a certain speed, you just have to lean forward a little bit to keep the laws of physics, but yes, it‚Äôs better to keep your back level and lean in the lumbar region.  When accelerating, many begin to take giant steps - this is not right and not useful.  The step should be normal, but in a greater rhythm, we work with the shin and foot, after the push we try to relax the foot and the shin - although this technique comes with long workouts, therefore, for starters, you can walk as comfortable as possible. <br>  Having passed the distance we need, you need to remember to calm the loaded body.  To do this, it is enough, again over 100 meters, to slow down the step, calm the breath.  If you are not working on the ground floor, then you can make a hitch while climbing slowly up the stairs (but not above the fifth floor). <br>  You can return from work in a more relaxed rhythm, you can not warm up, but it is better to repeat the hitch. <br>  I liked to walk, the distance to work no longer satisfies - we choose a more difficult route: with stairs, with climbs, with a large crowd of people (believe, maneuver between the weaving citizens and dodge the oncoming flow fascinatingly).

    <h4>  Total </h4><br>  We come to work vigorous and clear-minded.  Even if you didn‚Äôt have a very good trip in public transport, during the walk you will have time to calm down and start your working day with a clear head and good mood. <br>  After a working day, a walk will help relieve stress, calm a storm of thoughts, stretch a body that lingers in a day.  In addition, during the walk, you can calmly resolve some issues that during working hours seemed not resolvable - more oxygen, lack of environmental pressure, relieved psychological stress. <br><br>  Well, the extra ton of health has not prevented anyone.  Go to your health! <br><br>  PS I forgot to say about safety: do not walk after ten through dark alleys - it is very harmful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77965/</a></p>
