  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to do with pirates? Ask the pirates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just imagine, you wrote a useful program, we didn‚Äôt sleep at night, we‚Äôre looking at coffee already.  Wrote, started selling.  And even buy - still, the program is really useful.  But at the same time they download from torrents, keygens write and some authors don‚Äôt want to support at all.  What to do with it? <br>  You can, of course, spit on them, let them swing.  But it's a shame because there is also something you want. <br>  You can try all the courts zataskat.  But it is long and dreary, and as a result you will receive tons of curses on your head, and they will call you a copywriter all your life later. <br>  So another thought came to my mind what could be done.  Maybe someone has already done this, but I don‚Äôt remember reading about it anywhere. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can ask the pirates themselves what they lack in this life to pay for your program.  The scheme of action seems to me like this: <br>  Go to rutracker or some other similar site. <br>  We are looking for distribution of our program there. <br>  We look there at those users who thank for the distribution and write to them in a personal or e-mail (if you have) something like: ‚ÄúGood afternoon.  I, the author of SuperMegaApp, thank you for your interest in my product.  If it's not difficult for you, tell me why you chose to use the pirated version, rather than to purchase a license?  Your feedback will be very useful for me, and in the next version I will try to accommodate your wishes, so that the program will more closely match your understanding of which product you don‚Äôt mind paying for.  Sincerely, Vasily Pupkin ".  This, of course, is not a ready-made text of the letter, you need to think longer about it, just wrote it so that the essence is clear. <br><br>  Most, of course, ignore.  Many will write, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not rooting for software, but the workers are pysch-pysch.  But one of the hundred letters can come useful feedback.  After all, it is not at all necessary that people are so angry and greedy, maybe it was you who did not take into account something when you thought through a licensing policy.  Perhaps the program lacks any features to make it worth the money.  It may be the opposite, most people need only 30% of the functions of the software, but because of these 30%, it‚Äôs a pity to pay the full cost. <br><br>  In the end, spending a little time, you can get a useful idea: ‚Äúyou need to add a function to capture the universe‚Äù, or ‚Äúyou need to make a light version for users who just need to capture a couple of cities‚Äù, or even ‚Äúneed to add a license payment through Intergalactic Bank‚Äù  Without losing anything, we get a good idea, probably a future client, and it can happen that advertising.  After all, it is quite possible that the person who received such a letter then writes in his LJ ‚ÄúA letter came from the author, asking what to change so that I could buy his software.  But he could have filed a lawsuit.  Good man, apparently.  Maybe the truth for the license to pay ... "

      I do not know how it will work, but the idea seems interesting to me. <br><br>  PS If someone tells you in which blog it will look better, I will be grateful for the advice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113372/</a></p>
