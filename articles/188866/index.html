  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Petitions demanding to ban the game "Company of Heroes-2" in the CIS, scored about 15 thousand signatures</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On June 25, 2013, a long-awaited novelty appeared on the world and Russian markets - the computer game ‚ÄúCompany of Heroes 2‚Äù from the Canadian studio Relic (now purchased by SEGA). At that time, no one imagined what kind of excitement the game would cause and that for some reason will happen.  A month after its release on the network, an unveiling <a href="http://carambatv.ru/movie/bad-comedian/company-of-heroes-2/">video review from BadComedian</a> first appeared, and one after another, two petitions from outraged users appeared demanding to ban this product on the territory of the Russian Federation: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://chn.ge/1bhs8a6">petition to the leadership of 1C-Softklab and 1C-Interest</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://chn.ge/1377Ev6">petition to the leadership of Valve (who owns Steam)</a> </li></ul><br>  Each of these appeals has already been signed by more than 14 thousand people (a petition to 1C is 18.5 thousand), and their initiators do not intend to stop there. The reason for such cardinal decisions was the content of the game, with which many players completely disagree. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If one reads all the evaluations of the game, it will become obvious that its authors took the alternative version of the historical events of the Great Patriotic War as the basis for the scenario.  Thus, according to the authors of the petitions, the creators of the Company of Heroes completely distorted the truth about the Soviet soldiers, presenting them as traitors, cowards and sadists, completely deprived of not only heroic, but also human traits.  Particularly alarming is the fact that the main audience of the game is young people and even children, who are unlikely to read historical literature and may well take the images depicted as pure truth.  One can imagine the whole scale of the threat to the healthy upbringing of the younger generation by reading one of the more vivid reviews of the game. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">one of the bright reviews of the game</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Although the name of the game translates as "Company of Heroes", do not mislead yourself with this deceptive title.  For the Soviet soldiers and commanders here are the least similar to heroes in the world: the first dream to get out of the front line and only the ubiquitous detachments force this crowd of cowards and deserters to defend their own land, the second - shoot their own and make the greatest possible efforts to kill more of them subordinates.  In the whole campaign there is hardly a single indiscriminate action of the Soviet military.  Soviet soldiers set fire to homes with their own innocent residents.  Soviet soldiers chorus shoot unarmed prisoners.  The Soviet commanders are waiting for the special forces until their own soldiers reach the bridge, so that they can be blown up right there.  The Soviet military basemen betray and shoot in the back to those who have just helped them.  Sometimes ofigev from such heat of the TRUTH and "historical revelations" in the style of a-la Mikhalkov, you are just staring at the screen and waiting for you to see Soviet soldiers eating human meat or Soviet soldiers roasting at the stake of children (in pairs, both their own and non-German) .  Such moments would be absolutely in the spirit of Company of Heroes 2, which proclaims the maximum of hardcore: none that heroic, but even human, traits of Soviet untermensum should not be shown!

      Only the leader, Lev Abramovich Isakovich, is the light at the end of the tunnel, where everyone else, except for him, is cowards, traitors or sadists, the only honest, unafraid, sits in Gulag (like any honest person) and tells us a part of the historical truth mentioned above ... <br><br>  Who did the developers mean in the title ‚ÄúCompany of Heroes‚Äù?  Lev Abramovich, after all, whatever one may say, just one.  Most likely, the Nazis, who wanted to rid the world of these cowardly, vile, sadistic subhumans, who are well able only to run endlessly on machine guns without a weapon. <br><br>  Only once, it seems, there was a dilemma before the screenwriter: in spite of the fact that the Red Army shown to them is fighting only by throwing corpses from catapults and shooting soldiers for feats, it miraculously turned out to be in Berlin.  This small inconsistency was decided ingeniously simple: in the briefing we are persistently taldych that the Germans were defeated by ‚ÄúGeneral Moroz‚Äù, bad roads and the insides of Soviet soldiers stuck in the tracks of German tanks, and in all the troubles of war the blame for the Reichstag. <br><br>  The developers themselves do not feel guilty and vice versa go to the counterattack, claiming that everything was depicted as ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù, and we, residents of the former USSR, are simply too good opinions about our history.  (As the liberals who echo the developers add, are ‚Äúwashed up by Soviet education and upset that the USSR is shown not ideal‚Äù) Well, yes, dear reader, there are indeed two sides to the truth about the USSR: there is a good one, in the form of a truth-lover Lev Abramovich and his machine gunners dummy and bad - in the form of the rest of the Soviet. <br></div></div><br><br>  I take into account the daring reaction of the creators of the game, the resentment of Russian users becomes only sharper.  In addition to collecting signatures to the petitions, activists also urge the Russian authorities to join the process.  Since the laws on blocking sites with unlicensed films are being promoted in the country, then one should still sort out the game of trampling the feelings of veterans.  Outraged users of Runet have already lowered the rating of the game on the metacritic to 1.6 (out of 10), and put a huge amount of dislikes to the official game trailer on youtube (there are already more dislikes than likes). <br><br>  So far, as reported on the pages of the petitions, the leadership of the companies "1C" and "Valve" did not respond to the petition.  Apparently the key role is played by the amount of expected revenue from the sale of the game.  "Company of Heroes-2" became the leader in sales of the boxed version of the game on the 1C-Interest network in the CIS in the first weeks after the start of sales. <br><br>  Therefore, the confrontation continues. By creating and signing petitions, caring citizens expect to at least have an educational impact on the 1C structure.  Since, even if the game is not banned, from now on the company will more carefully approach the choice of games for localization for the CIS market. <br><br>  The signatories of the petitions also hope that the game development studios from around the world will learn this lesson and will more seriously approach the choice of the role of Russian-speaking characters in their games and historical authenticity, since they do not want to lose sales revenue in the CIS countries. <br><br>  Perhaps, Habr's readers are aware of cases when the sale of another computer game was prohibited in any particular country after the indignation of users? <br><br>  PS: Meanwhile, in the multiplayer online game ‚ÄúWorld of tanks‚Äù on American and European servers, from now <a href="http://world-of-tanks.livejournal.com/4969519.html">on, any inscription mentioning Joseph Stalin</a> (even Cyrillic) on Soviet tanks of World War II is <a href="http://world-of-tanks.livejournal.com/4969519.html">banned</a> .  This is the demand of the Europeans. <br><br><hr><br>  I publish this text at the request of Peter Morozov <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/petyamorozov/" class="user_link">petyamorozov</a> . <br><br>  From myself I will also note that yesterday Evgeny Bazhenov (BadComedian) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2m4SCUaBHS8">published his video review</a> <b>in English</b> , and it has already been viewed more than 176,000 times. <br>  In the comments on YouTube, serious battles took place, and Relic went into deaf defense in her forums and on Facebook, banning everyone. <br><br><h3>  08/05/13 1C stops selling CoH2 </h3><br><blockquote>  In connection with the appeals of users who consider a number of episodes of the game unacceptable, 1C-SoftClub decided to stop selling the computer game Company of Heroes 2 (developed by Relic Entertainment, publisher-SEGA) on the territory of the Russian Federation and the CIS on July 26, 2013. .  At the moment, we are analyzing the situation and informed the developer and publisher of Company of Heroes 2 about it. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.1csc.ru/news/2013/08/05/30317-ostanovleny-prodazhi-igry-company-of-heroes-2">www.1csc.ru/news/2013/08/05/30317-ostanovleny-prodazhi-igry-company-of-heroes-2</a> <br><br><h3>  08/06/13 World of Tanks News </h3><br><blockquote> When entering the functional emblems and inscriptions in version 8.0, we laid the possibility of changing the list of available emblems and inscriptions for different regions, without formulating a single position within the company regarding the use of these elements.  The result of this was the fact of deleting emblems and inscriptions associated with the name of I.Stalin from European and American servers, as well as from servers located in Asia. <br><br>  To realize the error associated with the removal from the game data labels, we helped our gaming community.  Despite the fact that not only victories were associated with the name of I.Stalin, but also the defeats of the initial period of the war, despite the fact that many aspects of his activities received a harsh assessment, this man‚Äôs contribution to the victory over fascism Coalition is not questioned by Wargaming.  In the update of the game version 8.8 all inscriptions associated with the name of Stalin will be returned to all regions. <br><br>  We remember our history and we are proud of it. </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/1/symbols_of_victory/">worldoftanks.ru/ru/news/1/symbols_of_victory</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188866/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188866/</a></p>
