For movement on the highway it is planned to use magnets and powerful fans in order to make aluminum capsules move along the pipeline.  Air will be pumped out of the pipeline to reduce the effect of its resistance on the vehicle speed.  And it will be huge - about 1200 km / h.

      In Russia, it has been stated several times that the project is interesting, and in its implementation we would also like to accept domestic specialists.  True, statements were also made that Russian scientists were <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276130/">independently working on a similar project</a> .  Anyway, today Hyperloop One has <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2016/06/21/hyperloop-one-parners-with-moscow-for-high-speed-transport-projects/">signed an agreement</a> with the Russian company Summa.  The essence of the agreement is the creation of a highway in Moscow and its connection with the local transport infrastructure.  The agreement was signed at the <a href="https://forumspb.com/ru/">St. Petersburg International Economic Forum</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the company is also developing a feasibility study for the construction of a highway in Finland, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland, Dubai, the United Kingdom and the United States.  Last month, she was able to receive a $ 80 million investment and conduct preliminary testing of her vehicle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e7/833/d54/4e7833d54ee94206a724a138b99bb769.jpg"><br>  <i>Meeting Shervin Pishevara, head of Hyperloop One, with the heads of 18 Russian companies.</i>  <i>President Vladimir Putin was also present at this meeting (Source: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D10154397523666549%26set%3Da.10150272471621549.328763.527471548%26type%3D3%26theater">Facebook</a> )</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are pleased with the cooperation with Summa Group and the Russian government, as well as with the fact that Hyperloop One will build the route in Moscow,‚Äù said Shervin Pishevar, co-founder and executive chairman of the board of directors of Hyperloop One.  "Hyperloop can significantly improve the lives of 16 million people from the Moscow region, reducing their time spent on the road."  The long-term goal of Hyperloop One, according to Pishevar, is to create a new ‚ÄúSilk Road‚Äù, namely, connecting the Hyperloop route of China and Europe.  This route, in theory, can ensure the delivery of goods from Europe to China in just 10-15 hours. <br><br>  In Russia, they are interested in the technology proposed in 2013 by Ilon Mask (the technology itself is not new, it was described at the beginning of the last century, but the implementation of the idea was proposed by Musk). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d7/2d7/ba3/1d72d7ba38923e1438e02223a59cf762.jpg" width="800"><br>  <i>Pipeline concept for high-speed trains (1974)</i> <br><br>  In such a huge city like Moscow, having a Hyperloop highway would really improve the lives of many people.  Now the population of Moscow is about 16 million people, so an inexpensive, fast and reliable transport would significantly improve the overall situation with the transport infrastructure of the city.  By the way, Hyperloop can be <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/251410/">free for passengers</a> .  The scheme of profit can be similar to the system free to play, which is massively used in many toys.  Passengers will be able to use the services of the system for free, but additional elements of service will also be available, for which payment is already required.  There is a second option for receiving money - the payment will be charged to passengers only during peak hours. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe implementation of the Hyperloop technology will provide the Russian Federation with significant advantages in geopolitical development, in terms of intracontinental transport, and will create an attractive alternative to the existing logistics flows.  In the long term, Hyperloop can accelerate regional economic integration, ‚ÄùZiyavudin Magomedov, owner of Summa, commented on the signing of the contract.  A Russian company that has signed a contract with Hyperloop One considers this transport, first of all, as a means of delivering cargo, not passengers.  Now cargo from Europe to China and back delivered within a few weeks. <br><br>  Initially, Hyperloop One offered to create a highway connecting Los Angeles with San Francisco.  The company has calculated that experts will be able to build a track of such length for $ 16 billion over 10 years.  At the same time, the construction of Hyperloop will be cheaper than the high-speed rail system.  The thing is that the lines are planned to start along the route of already existing autobahns, trains are not needed here, plus the land rent will be minimal, since the pipeline hangs above the ground, and the area allotment is very small.  In addition to other advantages, the Hyperloop circuit will independently provide itself with energy - for this it is planned to use solar panels.  The system will depend little on weather conditions. <br><br><h3>  Who helps Hyperloop One? </h3><br>  In addition to Summa Group, the company cooperates with 137 Ventures, Partech Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Fast Digital, Western Technology Investment, the French National Rail Company, and GE Ventures. <br><br>  As for the Russian partner, Summa Group is a diversified holding company combining promising and dynamically developing assets in port logistics, engineering, construction, telecommunications, and the oil and gas sectors.  The Group's companies, which are present in almost 40 regions of Russia and abroad, employ more than 25 thousand people.  This is the largest business conglomerate that can probably implement part of the project to create the Hyperloop route in Moscow on its own, without external support.  The founder and main shareholder of the company is Ziyavudin Magomedov. <br><br>  Ilon Musk is not a Hyperloop One investor, but he is dedicated to the implementation of current company projects.  Not long ago, she bought 137 acres of land in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582-%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581-%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">North Las Vegas</a> .  It is planned to build a full-scale segment of the route for testing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/267/9d6/793/2679d679312c67423a8b494b37366c68.jpg"><br><br>  In May, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276352/">company announced</a> the <a href="https://hyperloop-one.com/global-challenge">Hyperloop One Global Challenge</a> .  As part of the contest, Hyperloop One will collect bids from those wishing to build a track at home.  And this is not so easy - in the application, the initiative group should show how Hyperloop One technologies will be used, what impact the new transport will have on the region's economy, what advantages the passengers will receive, etc.  Representatives of cities from all over the world can participate - here Hyperloop One has no restrictions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369399/</a></p>
