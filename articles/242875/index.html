  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FAQ on the conference. NEXT 2014 Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  December 8, we will hold in Moscow a large .NET-conference. <a href="http://dotnext.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3Dhabrapost20141120_top_link%26utm_campaign%3Ddotnext2014moscow"><b>NEXT 2014 Moscow</b></a> .  We received a lot of comments in social networks and on Habr√©, as well as several letters with questions about confessions.  In order not to answer several times, I collected the most frequently asked questions here in one place.  I tried to group these questions by topic, and the result was a full FAQ. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Why do we need another .NET conference? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Modern conferences for programmers are sinful with all sorts of Ajayles, scraps and other startups and clauses, and therefore JetBrains and I decided to hold a conference for .NET-programmers, consisting only of reports on technical topics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/217/996/2c6/2179962c681e4839b7a925a641b87fd6.jpg">

    <h5>  <b>Q:</b> Where and when does it take place? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Moscow, Mon., December 8, Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel, metro station  Kiev <br>  The start is at 10:00, the ending is at 20:00.  Please note that this is a <b>monday</b> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Who are your "competitors"? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> <a href="http://www.msdevcon.ru/ru/">DevCon</a> from Microsoft, <a href="http://dotnetconf.ru/">DotNetConf</a> from Alexander Bindyu, <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/">Go #</a> from Nikolay Evdokimov from ITHH.  I will not comment on these conferences right now.  If interested - go to the links and read. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> How are you different from them? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> As I wrote two points above, we are <b>not</b> interested in promoting startups, wage markets, flexible methodologies, and ‚Äúnew opportunities for your business.‚Äù We prefer to focus on one thing that we understand, know and love.  On <b>technology</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> This is not the first. NEXT? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Not the first.  The first was held in April in St. Petersburg.  You can get acquainted with its materials <a href="http://dotnext.ru/spb2014/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3Dhabrapost20141120_top_link_to_spb2014%26utm_campaign%3Ddotnext2014moscow">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> About the December. NEXT already written on Habr√©? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Yes, and several times: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/codefreeze/blog/242857/">Announcement of reports</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/codefreeze/blog/242955/">Announcement of the speech Dino Esposito</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/JetBrains/blog/243389/">Announcement from Philip</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/philipto/" class="user_link">philipto</a> Torchinsky </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/enterra/blog/243371/">Excellent technical article and the announcement of the speech of Andrei</a> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshina </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Why do I need your conference? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> .NEXT 2014 Moscow is a great opportunity for any .NET programmer: <br><ul><li>  dive deep into the details of the implementation of the .NET Framework; </li><li>  talk with JetBrains and DevExpress about their great development tools; </li><li>  talk to Microsoft evangelists about the latest news and trends; </li><li>  talk with Mikhail Samarin from Futurice about career opportunities for dotnet developers in Europe; </li><li>  exchange experience with colleagues from other companies. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Why on a weekday? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Our experience shows that it is easier for young Junior developers to come on a day off: usually bosses are reluctant to let go on weekdays.  But Senior-developers, who, as a rule, are family people, are uncomfortable on weekends: wives, children and in general a lot of other things.  Seniors easier to agree with the authorities on a weekday. <br>  After weighing these facts, we decided that the adult Senior audience is more interesting to us.  So, excuse me, juniors, but we are not concentrating on you. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Who are your speakers?  Why should I listen to them? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Here is the list: <br><ul><li>  Firstly, these are the leading engineers of JetBrains, who will talk about their tools and how they solve technical problems that arise during their development. </li><li>  Secondly, it is Mikhail Samarin from Futurice, who talks about Windows Phone and hardware APIs.  With him, by the way, I advise you to talk to anyone who is thinking of continuing his career abroad.  Mikhail has been living in Helsinki for 15 years already, and their company has offices throughout Europe. </li><li>  Thirdly, these are the <b>leaders of the .NET-hub</b> : Andrey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin, Dmitry <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/mezastel/" class="user_link">mezastel</a> Nesteruk, Stanislav <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/sidristij/" class="user_link">sidristij</a> Sidristy, Timur <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/timyrik20/" class="user_link">timyrik20</a> Guev, Karlen <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/szkarlen/" class="user_link">szKarlen</a> Simonyan.  We are currently negotiating with Igor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/sychevigor/" class="user_link">SychevIgor</a> Sychev and Nikita <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kekekeks/" class="user_link">kekekeks</a> Tsukanov </li><li>  Further, these are the developers of modern tools.  For example, Roman Ageev from DevExpress and Andrey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/violettape/" class="user_link">VioletTape</a> Gordienkov from PostSharp. </li><li>  and, of course, Microsoft evangelists.  Where are without them. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0d/ac1/906/a0dac19061c748248478874a469ab8d0.jpg"><br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> How many reports will there be? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Apart from the keynote from Dino Esposito, we will have 21 or 24 reports: <br><ul><li>  or 3 rooms for 7 reports of 50 minutes </li><li>  or 4 rooms of 6 reports of 60 minutes each </li></ul><br>  At the moment we are choosing between these two options. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> I can not come.  Do you have an online broadcast? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Yes.  Will work on any devices.  Sold in the same place as the offline tickets. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> How does the online broadcast work? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> A few days before the conference, everyone who bought the broadcast receives a letter with a link.  By clicking on this link, the buyer of the online broadcast receives a Flash / HTML5 player, which will start working 15-20 minutes before the start of the conference. <br>  In the process, the user can switch between rooms.  In addition, at the end of the event, online broadcast customers will be able to see all the videos in the recording on the very same link the next morning.  True, without mounting and cutting into separate reports, because mounting and cutting take time. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> So you can buy one for two / three / ten? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> In theory, yes.  Generally speaking, any customer can deploy the player in full screen mode and distribute this signal on the Internet using any technology such as SOP for free.  Such things, of course, we do not track.  We do not welcome this, but we cannot do anything about it. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Will the video be uploaded? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Of course.  All online and offline participants will receive a link to the video reports of the reports specified during registration. That is, if you are a participant, you only managed to attend 6-7 reports at the conference or, for example, were sick and could not come at all - do not worry!  All look at the video! <br><br>  For those who decide not to participate in the conference, the best videos will be published a few months after the conference. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Does Full or Lite ticket give access to online broadcast? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> No, it does not.  But we will send such participants, as well as online participants, a link to videos of all the reports of the conference.  This will happen in the area on December 25th. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> That is, you can not come to konfa, and just see the vidos? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> You can.  Or buying a ticket online and looking online, in the record uncut or sliced ‚Äã‚Äãin 2 weeks.  Or, without buying anything, wait a few months until we publish the best videos. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> How can I buy a ticket? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Go to the <a href="http://codefreeze-msk.timepad.ru/event/153660/">registration form</a> , fill out a form and pay for the ticket. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Why is it so expensive? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Because rooms in the center of Moscow are expensive, dinners are expensive, etc.  One of the most expensive cities in the world, though. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Can I make my company pay for participation? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Yes.  To do this, you need to fill in the registration form, go to the payment and select the item "Company pays"  Registering will be asked to enter the details of his company, which can be found in the accounting department. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Will there be terrible dinners again, like in St. Petersburg? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> In St. Petersburg, there really were so-so-dinners.  We went to this step in order not to leave much in the minus for the money.  The people did not like this move, and we received a number of complaints about dinners.  Now we are fixed!  Dinners will be excellent, sometimes even pretentious.  They will provide us the banquet service of the hotel. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Do you want to make money on me? <br>  <b>A:</b> In the future, yes.  In general, we work in the long.  It is interesting for us that the participants who came to a conference in December should return home, to work, etc.  and told all my friends and colleagues about how cool our con is.  Therefore, we are investing a lot, losing money on it now, but earning much more in the medium term. <br><br></h5><h5>  <b>Q:</b> I probably will be hunted!  Who are your sponsors? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> JetBrains and DevExpress make tula.  Their goal is to show their products on the stands and collect your opinion on them.  Based on your feedbacks, they will improve their tula, add features needed by the people, etc. <br>  This year among the sponsors there are no companies that are active in hiring in Moscow.  But Mikhail Samarin will look for 2-3 people in the European offices of Futurice. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> My company is looking for fellow workers!  Can you look for them at your conference? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Tell the management that we are looking for sponsors :) A sponsor can set up a stand and lure people there.  We are not particularly welcome, but do not interfere.  To each his own. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Will there be a booze? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Will.  The truth is closed: for speakers, organizers and sponsors.  This is our tradition: if you want to participate in the movement - do something for the conference or for the community. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Need help? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Need it!  We are looking for volunteers for registration (to distribute badges to people in the morning) and track-ouners (people responsible for ordering and timing).  Those who wish - write to me in PM.  Naturally, volunteers are provided with a free ticket with lunch, afterparty, souvenirs and other nishtyak. <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Is it true that you bring Dino Esposito? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> True.  Dino will give two presentations: the first is about ASP.NET vNext, and the second is about his vision of modern development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/737/695/1a4/7376951a4b8c4c72a7b5acedf00ec28b.png"><br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> Where can I read in detail about the conference? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> On her site: <a href="http://dotnext.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_term%3Dhabrapost20141120_bottom_link%26utm_campaign%3Ddotnext2014moscow">http://dotnext.ru</a> <br><br><h5>  <b>Q:</b> What motivates you? </h5><br>  <b>A:</b> Personally, I do technical conferences, for example, so that my good friend, now an engineer at Microsoft Bing, when he saw my post on Habr√©, called me on Skype from Seattle and said: "Dude, you are cool." <br><br>  Believe me, such words are the best motivation! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242875/</a></p>
