Leafing through review after review, I came across data on discrepancies from 5 to 30% ‚Äî a rather bold run, for example, if you need to keep a pulse in the range of 130‚Äì150: a run of 15% is already larger than the entire required range. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f41/fe0/8c2/f41fe08c2be64b3099e650fa3e5d16d9.jpg"><br>  <i>Girl, you are what, I just measure the pulse</i> <br><br>  At the same time, I almost missed the fact that not only on-site gadgets can measure pulse.  As it turned out, besides, of course, chest sensors, this function is in a whole range of headphones - and we also work better there.  Therefore, I decided to put aside the fruitless search for the fitness tracker of my dream and find out what choice there is now of sports headsets with a built-in heart rate monitor.  In the review there will be both bluetooth devices and wired ears. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main advantages of the heart rate monitor in headphones are two:

      <br>
    <ol><li>  This is a more practical solution in the sense that any other kind of sensor - even wrist, even chest - is still an extra gadget for some money that needs to be separately charged (as if there is little around hungry "mouths": phones, tablets, laptops, more some kind of garbage - and you need to look after everyone not to sit down).  And the headphones are used by almost everyone who uses at least some gadget at all.  And it‚Äôs more convenient than a heart rate monitor in an earpiece except the heart rate monitor directly in a smartphone, if it were possible. <br><br></li><li>  At the same time, <a href="http://www.wareable.com/running/best-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-for-running-1139">according to the site Wareable</a> , the <a href="http://www.wareable.com/running/best-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-for-running-1139">pulsators</a> in the headphones are much more accurate than the wrist: thin skin in the ear makes measurements much simpler, and ear pulsators track changes in the pulse much more accurately. </li></ol><br><h2>  Jabra Sport Pulse Special Edition - review favorite </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef6/89d/1ab/ef689d1ab8c82e358e8bf55a9c96a86f.jpg"><br><br>  This brand has not come across to me for a long time - ever since this terrible ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù headset was in fashion in one ear.  But the Jabra does exist, and their Sport Pulse bluetooth headset collects very decent reviews.  They provide good sound and track an impressive body of physical activity data.  In addition to accurate measurement of heart rate, they consider the speed of movement, the length of the step, the number of calories expended, the duration of the workout.  Included is a very handy application Jabra Sport Life, which contains training guidelines in which attention is focused on the VO2 Max indicator (indicator of maximum oxygen consumption), as well as on standard fitness parameters.  Headphones are also compatible with third-party applications: Strava, Endomondo, RunKeeper and MapMyFitness.  It does not have a built-in memory, so a bundle with a smartphone is required - but this is so-so a disadvantage from the point of view of a person who, in principle, did not think before that the headset can have its own memory and can be used separately from the smartphone. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Pulse-Special-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B01LXKJPGH/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Ftag%3Dwareable-20%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1477398865%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3DB01LXKJPGH">$ 139.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  Sony Smart B-Trainer - the best headphones for use without a phone </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e36/036/5f5/e360365f52bcbf98197aa647bee937d9.jpg"><br><br>  But this is just an example of just such an autonomous headset with a built-in player and 16 GB of memory.  These headphones are good for running: they are equipped with 6 sensors, including a heart rate monitor, an accelerometer and a built-in GPS - and pick up the music to the pace of training based on their performance.  The user is also provided with voice information on the main fitness parameters (number of steps and calories burned, distance, speed, step length, rhythm, incline, pulse rate).  There is a built-in microphone.  Waterproof, which is quite traditional for Sony gadgets, but there are no special functions for training in the pool.  Unfortunately, they are only compatible with Sony's proprietary application, ignoring third-party fitness programs, but their main disadvantage is, perhaps, price.  More expensive than many smartphones will be. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-B-Trainer-Player-Bluetooth-Coaching/dp/B01245HDZI/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Ftag%3Dwareable-20%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1444140031%26sr%3D8-1%26keywords%3Dsony%2Bsmart%2Bb%2Btrainer">$ 269.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  Bragi Dash - the best headphones for swimmers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/908/89d/161/90889d1613d7b8d3cd8cd6dde70b9883.jpg"><br><br>  But this is a headset in which you can swim.  The main advantage of the Bragi Dash headphones is water resistance at a depth of 1 meter.  They track fitness performance for running, cycling, and swimming, making them an excellent gadget for beginners.  At the same time, they have comparable to Sony autonomy thanks to 4 GB of internal memory.  Among other things, Bragi Dash track step length, heart rate and distance.  In real time, they provide voice reports on user fitness statistics.  The touch sensitive interface allows you to control their tapping. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bragi-Enabled-Headphones-Black-B1000-0001/dp/B01BHAU6QO%3Ftag%3Dwareable-20%26ie%3DUTF8%26*Version*%3D1%26*entries*%3D0%26th%3D1">$ 249.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  Bose SoundSport Pulse - the best sound </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1e/9be/e83/c1e9bee8320a181f115fb6ed59494e24.jpg"><br><br>  This is the first Bose headphones with an optical heart rate monitor.  They work well with applications RunKeeper and Endomondo.  However, Bose developed their own Bose Connect application, which reflects the dynamics of the pulse in real time.  This model has a tight fit, so there is no annoying feeling that the headphones are about to fall out.  And although the accuracy here is not the highest, the sound quality is excellent.  But in general, it's nice to see such a big player in the game as Bose. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundSport-Pulse-Wireless-Headphones/dp/B01HETFPUE%3Ftag%3Dwareable-20">$ 169.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  Samsung Gear Icon X - the best headphones, if you have Samsung </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff9/63a/97b/ff963a97bb9f78e2ab62993440c79639.jpg"><br><br>  These are rather everyday headphones with additional features than a specialized fitness gadget.  This model has 4 GB of memory for music, a microphone and a battery case.  Sports functions are represented by a gentlemanly minimum: an accelerometer and a heart rate monitor.  Gear Icon X measures the distance traveled and calories burned per workout.  In real-time, the user receives voice prompts for training, recorded by live speakers in 15 languages, so no monotonous robots.  Samsung Gear Icon X, of course, works with Samsung's S Health app, as well as with Endomondo, MapMyRun, Runkeeper and Strava apps.  A significant disadvantage of this model is the complex configuration in the case of applications for Android and the lack of support for iOS.  Plus, they are still quite expensive. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Cordfree-Fitness-Activity-Warranty/dp/B01F8FWSGA/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Ftag%3Dwareable-20%26s%3Dwireless%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1475438110%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Dsamsung%2Biconx">$ 179.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  SMS Audio BioSport - the best budget headphones </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d7/ff3/eed/8d7ff3eedea1129cc38b5cc16df4a94e.jpg"><br><br>  The most interesting - finally.  Still, the question "why give a few hundred dollars if I just want to know my pulse" could not help but visit you during the review.  Headphones SMS Audio BioSport is a joint brainchild of Intel, a manufacturer of PC processors, and a rapper 50cent.  They measure the pulse, synchronize with the Runkeeper application and are IPX4 protected from moisture (protection against water splashes from any direction).  Music can adapt to the pace of the user.  But the most interesting thing is that they are able to charge directly from the sound connector of the smartphone, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about charging at all. <br><br>  Among the drawbacks are a relatively limited number of compatible applications, as well as the fact that some users find them a bit uncomfortable.  But the price is tempting enough to try them - and then not much to regret, if you still do not fit. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SMS-Audio-BioSport-Earbud-Blue/dp/B00PDHXND6/">$ 19.99 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  LG FR74 Heart Rate Earphones - good functionality at a reasonable price </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68e/f5b/780/68ef5b7804fd964228992914092a2c13.jpg"><br><br>  These headphones connect to a light oval medallion, which is fixed at the waist or on the arm.  As for the sound quality, the bass in this model does not sound very expressive.  There is no built-in player, so you can only listen to music from a smartphone.  In real-time mode, you can receive information on the number of completed steps, distance, calories burned, speed, stride length, pulse and the achievement of goals.  VO2 Max is also measured, measuring oxygen consumption and reflecting the user's cardio fitness level.  There is a built-in microphone, the ability to answer calls.  Headphones work with both their own LG Fitness application and third-party applications (MyFitnessPal and Runkeeper). <br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Furl%3Dsearch-alias%3Daps%26field-keywords%3Dlg%2Bfr74%2Bheart%2Brate%2Bearphones%26rh%3Di:aps,k:lg%2Bfr74%2Bheart%2Brate%2Bearphones%26linkCode%3Dll2%26tag%3Durbanwearable-20%26linkId%3Db06be8c260a745ed7552eb599d7bdd23">$ 47.98 at Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  iRiver On Fitness </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/682/93f/36a/68293f36a15f5c92670dbb240d29061c.jpg"><br>  Wireless headphones with pulse measurement and other sports data.  Work with a special application iRiver On Smartphone.  The disadvantage of this model, perhaps, is their heavy construction, which includes a neck element, to which the headphones themselves are attached.  This makes it difficult to perform some exercises. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/smartphone-Bluetooth-fitness-headset-IRIVER-/dp/B00GZADJHA/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26linkCode%3Dsl1%26tag%3Diwriteisharec-20%26linkId%3Dcb72982398fa355ac6950090cf9f3bee">$ 101.98 on Amazon</a> <br><br><h2>  Vi fitness coach - the most high-tech headphones </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98f/89e/4f3/98f89e4f3105f698a64c0cc5269309b6.jpg"><br><br>  Another ambitious project with Kickstarter.  The concept of this LifeBEAM production model is to give the user real-time practical advice on optimizing weight loss, preventing injuries, running techniques, as well as offering adaptive training plans.  Something like a personal trainer.  Run mode and bike ride mode are provided.  Their promo on Kikstaretere looks very inspiring, so it‚Äôs not surprising that they have already collected 17 times more than the required $ 100,000. They can still be ordered for $ 199 with delivery in December-January. <br><br>  At retail, they will arrive in May at a price of $ 249. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1050572498/vi-the-first-true-artificial-intelligence-personal">$ 199 on Kickstarter</a> <br><br><h2>  Kuai - universal earphones with the most accurate heart rate monitor </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/295/6c9/f77/2956c9f775b6226536c1821f00c174ad.jpg"><br><br>  This is another crowdfunding project, but on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kuai-the-world-s-smartest-multi-sport-headphones-sport-music">Indiegogo</a> .  The developers position their product as ‚Äúthe world's smartest universal sports headphones,‚Äù and also claim that their pulse measurement accuracy is the highest among all wearable gadgets, thanks to clinically tested sensors. <br><br>  In real time, they pass on to the user the basic fitness parameters.  This model is suitable for all sports, including swimming (water resistant to 3 meters depth).  Consultations in real time include tips from the best in the least fitness trainers.  From the Kuai platform, you can download professional workout plans.  There is a built-in player (8 GB).  Headphones are compatible with Strava, MapMyFitness, and Endomondo.  Retail price will be $ 250 USD. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kuai-the-world-s-smartest-multi-sport-headphones-sport-music">$ 169 at Indiegogo</a> <br><br>  One unobvious characteristic that unites all the ears in this review is the presence of silicone inserts.  The perseverance of manufacturers imposing them as the best solution for the headset is completely incomprehensible to me - when the same Apple has been successfully producing very comfortable ears for a long time without these foolish ever-dirty and lost nozzles.  Three sizes of ear pads for any ear?  Fine.  No liners at all?  Even better. <br><br>  However, since the new AirPods do not know how to count the pulse, my personal favorites in this case are SMS Audio BioSport Earbud.  With all the necessary features, they are also waterproof and do not stand like a new phone. <br><br>  <b>Deliver parcels by mail:</b> <br><br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition - a discount of $ 5 on the first order of delivery of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy</a> from the USA for all who read up to this place on the <b>supergeek</b> promotion code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361949/</a></p>
