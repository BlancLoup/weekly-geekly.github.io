As you can see, about 10 new applications are released per day.  And this means that there is no competition yet.

      Only 10% of all applications are games, 12% are utilities, 7% are health and fitness, and 2% are weather. <br><br>  It seems that game developers are not seriously thinking about entering a new platform and do not fully understand its prospects.  Complicates the process of creating and porting games and technical limitations, especially the size of the screen and the power of the device. <br><br>  It is interesting to hear in the comments the opinion of colleagues about the release of their games on the new platform.  Do you plan to do this?  If not, what should happen for you to change your mind? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Apple Financial Report </h3><br>  Apple submitted its <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2015/04/27Apple-Reports-Record-Second-Quarter-Results.html">report</a> on the second quarter of the current fiscal year.  This reporting period ended March 28. <br><br>  Smartphones this quarter brought the company $ 40.28 billion - this is 40% more than in the past.  In just these three months, Apple sold 61.17 million iPhones, thereby setting the average price of a smartphone to be $ 658.52. <br><br>  C iPad things are worse: the number of devices sold fell by 23% and amounted to 12.62 million units. <br><br>  Apple plans to earn about $ 47 billion next quarter. The head of the company, Tim Cook, has high financial hopes for the Apple Watch sales start in June. <br><br><h3>  Users in Europe and China are changing Android to iOS </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e79/700/046/e79700046cb44f9b84c4636e3f28acd8.jpg"><br><br>  Since the end of 2014, the share of Android users in Europe has decreased by 3.1%, now it is 68.4%.  At the same time, the percentage of European users of devices for iOS grew by 1.8%, reaching a figure of 20.3%. <br><br>  Such data <a href="http://www.kantarworldpanel.com/global/News/Android-Switchers-Drive-iOS-Growth-in-Europes-Big-Five-Countries">provides</a> analytical company Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.  Analysts attribute this dynamic to the fact that, in connection with the release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, some former Android users have switched to Apple devices.  According to the data presented in the report, 32.4% of purchased iOS devices used Android before. <br><br>  In China, the situation is similar: there the share of apple users has risen by 6.2% and now stands at 26.1%. <br><br><h3>  AppsFlyer will evaluate the effectiveness of TV advertising </h3><br>  The market for television advertising mobile games continues <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kamagames/blog/255591/">to gain</a> momentum.  The question is how to calculate the benefits of one or another specific roller. <br><br>  Many analytical platforms have long been able to count and collect statistics on the use of various advertising tools.  Accounting for the effectiveness of TV advertising is complicated by the fact that it is impossible to know for sure whether the user came to the site and downloaded the game, after watching the commercial on TV or using a different recommendation. <br><br>  Analytical company AppsFlyer, developing its platform, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/23/appsflyer-claims-first-tool-to-track-effectiveness-of-tv-ads-on-app-installs">found a</a> way to solve this problem.  It is based on a simple assumption: the user who learned about the game from the video is likely to download the application shortly after viewing.  Thus, each demonstration of the commercial corresponds to a time window; if the application was downloaded during this period of time, it is considered motivated to watch the video. <br><br>  The management of AppsFlyer calls such a seemingly simple solution a ‚Äúrevolution in television advertising‚Äù and assure that only their analytical company has such a tool. <br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
