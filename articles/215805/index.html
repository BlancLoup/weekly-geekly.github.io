And the cause of 70% of incidents in data centers, according to statistics, is the human factor, i.e., personnel errors.  But is it worth blaming only the data center personnel for the incidents that happened?  Wouldn't it be better to organize the operation process in such a way as to minimize the number of incidents and mitigate the consequences of their occurrence?  This question was the subject of the February issue of the magazine "TSODY.RF."

      Operation can make a different ‚Äúcontribution‚Äù to the level of data center resiliency.  With poor organization of the operation process, you can significantly reduce the reliability of the data center.  However, there are examples of sites that function in real life without a single failure, in accordance with even a higher level of stability than was stated in the design of the object.  With proper design and construction of a data center with a reasonable approach to its operation, incidents in data centers are practically non-existent. <br><br>  Of course, the notorious ‚Äúhuman factor‚Äù cannot be completely eliminated.  But, as noted by Greg Sherry, an expert of international level in the field of operating data centers, often the problem lies not in the specific performers, but as a management.  Many operators, for example, often hide information about incidents.  Otherwise, one would have to admit that there was no plan for getting out of an emergency, irregular testing of equipment, or even that the project was not completed at the proper level, and little attention was paid to personnel training. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To ensure the safety of the data center operation, you need to consider what procedures are used and what factors accompany them: work in emergency conditions (and, therefore, overload and personnel fatigue);  lack of familiarity with the equipment;  weak motivation;  unhealthy working environment in the team and so on. and so on.  In some data centers there is a pernicious culture of accusations, behind which there is a fuzzy division of areas of responsibility.  And the imposition of adverse factors only increases the risk of an emergency. <br><br>  The other side of the issue is the cost of the data center, which consists of capital costs and long-term investment in operation.  With proper organization, the operation service can turn into a structure that helps reduce the cost of operating a data center. <br><br>  The methodology for determining risks in various work situations in the data center is constantly being improved.  But, unfortunately, neither GOST nor ANSI documents, dedicated to the canons of data center operation, yet exist - there are only recommendations based on best practices developed by various non-profit organizations.  However, in the Russian market, the situation may drastically change over the coming years.  The Russian Association of Data Center Industry Participants as a priority puts the development of a system of national standards in the field of construction and operation of data centers. <br><br>  In the issue, which the reader holds in his hands, a lot of useful information is devoted not only to the operation of the data center, but also to its design.  In the ‚ÄúDesigning Data Center‚Äù section, the Russian companies SUNLINE Engineering and Ayaks Engineering presented their solutions for consolidating the data center of a potential customer. <br><br>  Another material - a photo tour in the new MIRAN-2 data center of the St. Petersburg company MIRAN - promises not to leave anyone indifferent.  The project, carried out by SUNLINE Engineering specialists, was based on a modular principle.  The developer and manufacturer of the module that forms the basis of this beautiful engineering solution is the Russian company GreenMDC, in the product line of which there are several versions of modules for outdoor and indoor use. <br><br>  We hope that this number will stay in your collection for a long time.  However, like all the other numbers "TSODy.RF" <br><br>  Natalya Zhilkina, Chief Editor <br><br>  The full contents of the issue you can find on the site <a href="http://dcjournal.ru/archive/ed6-feb-2014/">TsODy.RF ‚Ññ6</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215805/</a></p>
