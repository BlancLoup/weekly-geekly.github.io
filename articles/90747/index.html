  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pension antivirus</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a short story about how in the city of Taganrog accept reports in the Pension Fund.  A little background.  From 2010, organizations submit reports to the Pension Fund quarterly, until 2010 it was also, but also a piece of paper was sent to the tax, now this piece of paper was canceled, and everything is handed over directly to the Pension Fund (finally, someone logically at the top comprehends the situation).  Reporting is necessary within the month following the reporting period. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Now the story itself.  My accountant has passed all reports on our organization for the past first quarter, with the exception of the Pension Fund Declaration.  All papers, as well as a flash drive with an electronic version of the reporting, were already prepared for her, but she became terribly sick with the flu.  In the end, I decided to go there myself, as it is a dreary business to draw up again on someone a new power of attorney. <br><br>  I come to the Pension Fund, he, by the way, not so long ago moved to a new building and the corridors, as it turned out, became a bit wider.  Reporting documents were accepted in four rooms, each with 3-4 tables, that is, 3-4 receivers.  There were not so many people in the queue, somewhere around 5 people in each of the rooms.  I took a queue and noticed that in one of the offices at the end of the corridor there was some kind of a very large queue, literally 20 people. She moved very slowly, the people in the queue were extremely dissatisfied and angry.  I was glad that I was not there and waited for my turn.

      Waiting, went.  Grandma, the host of the report offered to sit down and asked for all my documents.  I gave the documents and flash drive.  Then the question followed: <br><br>  - Did you check the flash drive for viruses? <br>  - Yes, - I said honestly, - I checked at home, everything is fine. <br>  ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù said the grandmother, ‚Äúdid they check with us?‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúYou definitely don‚Äôt,‚Äù I said stammered. <br>  - Aah, well, so you go check the flash drive.  There is an office at the end of the corridor, you will see a line there, ‚Äùshe sarcastically remarked.  - Check first, and then come. <br><br>  I immediately asked: <br><br>  - And what on your computer flash drive can not be verified? <br>  ‚ÄúNo, we have nothing, security measures need to be observed, all of a sudden you brought us some kind of trojan and launch it to our database,‚Äù she smiled politely. <br>  - Flash drives are checked in a special office, go, check, and then come to me. <br><br>  I kept silent, went out, took a turn in the office to check the flash drive for viruses (this is where 20 people stood), waited.  Imagine, in this office, a poor, soapy girl with an open door sits, the computer is not new, everyone came with a flash drive full of everything (except for me, I even formatted it before going to the Pension Fund), time is running out.  In short, it was 48 minutes ... <br><br>  When my turn came, I gave the flash drive, the girl checked it and then the most interesting thing - wrote me a piece of paper, where she indicated only the date and time of the flash drive check, giving me all this back.  Tell me, is that safety?  Coming out of the office, and going back to that very grandmother, I could change the flash drive three hundred times and go down into the car three hundred times and throw any virus or trojan on it!  What is the meaning of the whole test and this madhouse (and you can‚Äôt call it another way)?  Who decided to introduce such a security system and security?  This is ridiculous.  By the way, the most fun they will begin at the end of the month, when everyone will run on the last day to submit their reports.  In general, I was pleased once again with our organization of the case. <br><br>  <u>Everything is as usual, in our ‚ÄúN‚Äù city nothing changes ...</u> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90747/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90747/</a></p>
