  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Grow three times faster than the market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <u>The article a couple of months ago was published in the weekly BelGazeta.</u>  <u>And do not ask why publish it here.</u>  <u>Just suddenly for some reason I remembered about her.</u> <br>  <strong>Last week, Xerox held a press conference on the results of its work in 2006.</strong>  <strong>and projected for 2007.</strong>  <strong>The global brand, whose name has become synonymous with multiplying technology, was represented by CEO of Xerox Eurasia International Group Vladimir Pavlenko and head of the Belarusian representative office Alexander Shvets.</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>REFERENCE "BelGazety".</strong>  <strong>In 2006</strong>  <strong>The total turnover of the corporation was $ 15.9 billion, of which $ 12 million falls on Belarus.</strong>  <strong>The Xerox Eurasia International Group, which includes Belarus, is the most successful corporation in all respects.</strong>  <strong>Since 2001</strong>  <strong>The company's turnover has increased almost 4 times.</strong>  <strong>In 2006</strong>  <strong>Xerox‚Äôs presence in Belarus increased by 67% compared with the previous year.</strong> <br><br>  BelGazeta correspondent spoke with Vladimir Pavlenko about the global brand's vision of the state of affairs in the Belarusian office equipment market in the context of global trends. <br><br>  - Last year in Belarus, just like before last, was very successful.  Last year we grew by almost 70%, which by all measures is an absolutely outstanding result.  Moreover, this growth was not from scratch: we have always been leaders here.  For example, last year we implemented a project to supply our products to the National Library.  Visitors can print books, booklets and other products on our devices.  This year the task is to consolidate the success so that it does not look like a one-time action.  IDC estimates that the overall peripheral market will grow by 17‚Äì18%.  Our task, as a company growing faster than the market, is to be above this bar.

      <strong>- What models became the sales leaders last year?</strong> <br><br>  - The launch of devices with the code name "Olympia" was very successful.  They quickly gained popularity in the digital commercial print market everywhere, including Belarus.  In general, everything that is sold on developed IT markets is successfully implemented in Belarus, for example, the Phaser 3117 personal laser printer and the MFP 3119. For the last year we sold about 7,000 copies of the latest model.  For comparison: in Ukraine we sold 4 thousand per month, in Russia - 10 thousand each. But the markets of the mentioned countries are incommensurable! <br>  <strong>- How fast is the Belarusian digital printing market growing?</strong> <br><br>  - By itself, the IT market is growing in developing countries about the same - 15-20%.  The commercial print market is growing faster than other IT industries.  The Belarusian market is very promising for us, as evidenced by our growth rates.  Our aggressive policy allows us to grow 3 times faster than the market.  The printing boom in Russia was huge, spontaneous, held on for two or three years, but it has already passed.  In Belarus, everything is just beginning.  As, however, in Ukraine. <br>  <strong>- Xerox has products for both home and office.</strong>  <strong>In which direction will you develop further?</strong> <br><br>  - And in one, and in another.  Although our company has always been a leader in offers for business, we would like to be a visible, successful player in all sectors.  Although in the home segment we are not N1 and do not plan to take 1st place. <br><br>  <strong>- There are two concepts for future workflow: it can be completely electronic and mixed.</strong>  <strong>How do you think the paperwork will ever refuse to print at all?</strong> <br><br>  - Of all the countries of the former USSR, Estonia is the most advanced in electronic document flow.  Nevertheless, the fleet of powerful presses over the past two years has tripled.  In this small country with a population of two million, everything is completely computerized.  Nevertheless, such are the results ... Another example is Japan.  Two years ago, one of the local banks, which is the operator of the Visa payment system, bought 24 top machines from Xerox for about $ 1 million per unit.  They print credit card statements, which, apparently, no one prints, because everything is transmitted electronically.  Printing goes into personalization: each client receives an advertising booklet addressed personally to him.  And the information stated there concerns him personally. <br><br>  <strong>- In 2006</strong>  <strong>Xerox has received more than two hundred awards in various world and national competitions.</strong>  <strong>What place does the Belarusian title of ‚Äúsocially responsible brand‚Äù of the national competition ‚ÄúBrand of the Year‚Äù occupy among them?</strong> <br><br>  - We really value this award.  We are not going to make PR out of it, it just corresponds to our internal corporate values.  This is recognition of Xerox as one of the best employers who cares about its staff very well, recognition of Xerox as one of the participants of social programs implemented in Belarus.  This is our corporate value - to be a socially responsible company, corporate citizen. <br><br>  <strong>- At the press conference it was said about the supply of the company's products to the presidential administration.</strong>  <strong>Among the priorities of Xerox - cooperation with the state?</strong> <br><br>  - In all countries where Xerox works, it is one of the main suppliers of equipment for government.  There is no need to go far for examples: these are the State Duma of the Russian Federation, the presidential administration of the Russian Federation, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, almost all state bodies of Kazakhstan, etc.  We have always and everywhere been the ‚Äúsupplier of His Majesty‚Äôs court‚Äù and we are very proud of this.  It is prestigious and profitable.  After all, if at MTZ the main product is a tractor, then in bureaucratic organizations the main product at the exit is paper with printed signs.  Actually, we supply the tools of production for the production of these products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12304/</a></p>
