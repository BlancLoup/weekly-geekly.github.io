This will help you Cambridge exams, which vary by level and age.  Today, the <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/%3Fpes%3Dgeektimes_fce_main">Puzzle English</a> blog will deal with adult high-level exams: <b>FCE (First)</b> , <b>CAE (Advanced)</b> and <b>CPE (Proficiency)</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/by/wd/ct/bywdct6xzqsooli9_kf4tverwui.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Cambridge Assessment English</b> is part of Cambridge University and for more than a century has been organizing and conducting Cambridge English exams.  To have a Cambridge certificate, which confirms the level of proficiency in the language, is prestigious and very convenient - most of them are perpetual certificates, and they are accepted around the world for a variety of purposes, from study to immigration.  You can take exams at 2,800 authorized centers in 130 countries, and prepare for them in as many as 50,000 training centers around the world.  The list of Cambridge exams is quite impressive: from children's YLE (Young Learners) to business exams and the same IELTS.  But today we will focus on three high-level exams that will help you go to university, find a job abroad or move. <br><br>  Most often, international exams are taken for admission to foreign universities, where the requirements begin with the level of B2 (Intermediate).  In the Cambridge system, the B2 level corresponds to the <b>First Certificate, or FCE exam</b> , and it is considered the most popular.  Few people need to demonstrate perfect knowledge of the language at the carrier level, and many stop at the middle level, which shows that the student is able to communicate, express his point of view, describe the pros and cons of something, write letters and essays.

      Since 2015, the exam assessment system has changed: now you can get Grade A, Grade B and Grade C depending on your score.  "Fill" the exam is impossible.  If you do not even get points to Grade C, you will be given a certificate of level B1.  For each of the aspects that you give up (reading, writing, listening, speaking and use of English, in fact, grammar), you will receive a separate assessment and you will be able to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses.  There are two types of FCE: <i>paper-based</i> and <i>computer-based</i> .  Between themselves, they do not differ, only the venue. <br><br><h2>  FCE exam </h2><br>  The <b>Reading</b> part consists of 7 parts.  In parts 1-4, you read short texts and complete assignments for vocabulary and grammar.  Here you need to be prepared for questions on idioms, phrasal verbs, stable expressions, shades of the meanings of certain words, to be able to substitute the necessary words for the meaning and know the basics of word formation.  In parts 5-7, you read a few more texts and demonstrate your understanding and ability to work with the text.  Here you will see multiple choice questions, you will need to establish the correct order of paragraphs or the correspondence between the statement and the paragraph. <br><br>  <b>Writing</b> consists of two parts: an essay on a given topic and a small text (article, email or letter, review, etc.), to which you will be given some introductory context.  In this case, the essay is written strictly on one topic, but the second task can be selected from the three proposed. <br><br>  <b>Listening</b> consists of four parts and lasts forty minutes.  Here you have to answer questions with answer choices and record information by ear.  FCE is not an academic exam, so all listening topics will be everyday and simple. <br><br>  Part <b>Speaking</b> consists of three parts, and here you have to talk not only with the examiner, but also with another one.  First you communicate with the examiner and tell about yourself, then together with the other person who gives you, you analyze the issued photos.  In conclusion, you need to discuss with another handing over the topic that the examiner will give you.  In this part, your ability to critically think, compare, describe, express your opinion, agree or disagree with the interlocutor, evaluate and make decisions through negotiations will be evaluated. <br><br><h2>  CAE and CPE </h2><br>  The CAE and CPE exams are quite similar.  Having certificates of passing these exams means confirming a high and advanced proficiency in English.  With such certificates, you will literally open all the doors, because the CPE is actually the level of the carrier.  The grading system for these exams has also been updated, and just like in the case of the FCE, you cannot fail the exam.  In case of a shortage of points you get a certificate for a lower level, and if there are enough points, then you are assigned Grade: A, B or C. <br><br>  In the <b>Reading</b> part, the CAE exam has 7 parts, and the CPE has 8. The subjects of the texts can be very different, but the tasks are similar: insert suitable words from the suggested ones or independently, change the word so that it fits into the text, choose the answer from the proposed, arrange the paragraphs in the correct order and complete the tasks for the correct use of words and shades of meaning in the presented context. <br><br>  The CAE and CPE part of <b>Writing is</b> also not much different.  It even reminds of FCE, only the level is naturally much higher.  A student is expected to have perfect language skills.  You are waiting for two tasks.  The first is an essay on a given topic.  In CAE, you will need to read one text and write an essay highlighting two points of view described in the text, explain why one of them is more important than the other, and reinforce your point with arguments.  In CPE, you need to read two texts and write an essay-reasoning that summarizes and analyzes key points from the provided texts, as well as write your opinion on the topic. <br><br>  The second task of the Writing part is a written work on an optional topic.  There are three topics in CAE, four in CPE.  At CAE you will be asked to write an email or regular letter, offer, report or review.  The CPE is almost the same, but it is possible to write a task based on a previously read book or film on it.  The list of books published in advance on the site of the Cambridge Assessment English. <br><br>  The part of <b>Listening</b> in these exams is also similar, it has 4 parts, and it lasts 40 minutes.  It differs only in the number of fragments that need to listen.  CAE has fewer of them.  Tasks include choosing the right answer from the proposed ones, complementing the information heard (you need to complete the sentence), correlating the speaker with the topic he is talking about. <br><br>  The <b>Speaking</b> part is a little different: in CAE it is a minute longer, and there are more parts in it.  In both exams, you first communicate with the examiner, talk about yourself and talk about general topics like work and interests.  After this, significant differences begin: the second block of CAE almost coincides with FCE.  You will be asked to review three photos and talk about two of them, then the other person who gives comments on your answer, and vice versa.  In CPE, you will be offered one photo, following which a discussion is built between you and your partner. <br><br>  In the third block of CAE, you and your partner discuss the statements that the examiner gives you.  In CPE, you will be given a card with a topic on which you first speak alternately with your partner, and then hold a discussion with the examiner.  The fourth block of CAE is also a discussion, but it is based on tasks from the third block.  The requirements here are the same as in the FCE: you should be able to speak clearly and coherently, give arguments, agree and disagree, make assumptions, etc. <br><br><h2>  Finally </h2><br>  Of course, one cannot say that the exams are simple and easy to prepare for.  Nevertheless, CPE is the level of an educated native speaker, and in order to pass the exam, you will have to master quite a lot of skills in both speaking and writing.  On average, you can prepare for any of the examinations we have considered in approximately 9 months (one academic year) both in courses and independently.  It will be useful to have a carrier friend or a student preparing for the exam: this way you can get a third-party opinion on your written assignments. <br><br>  As a rule, Russian students believe that the Cambridge commission places extremely high demands on speech, and it is necessary to work on accent, idioms and phrasal verbs.  This is not entirely true.  Of course, the speech must be literate, but no one requires you to receive pure Received Pronunciation (also known as Queen's English, which we wrote about in a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/puzzleenglish/blog/296959/">previous post</a> ).  The examiners pay attention to the coherence and the vocabulary used, so special emphasis should be placed on connective words, introductory words and established expressions. <br><br>  In general, all the time spent on preparing and passing the exam and nerves pay for themselves.  After all, in the end, you get a prestigious and, most importantly, a perpetual certificate of excellent command of English. <br><br><h2>  For those who need English </h2><br>  Readers of the blog give a <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/prices%3Fcoupon_id%3D28%26pes%3Dgeektimes_fce_coup">coupon for 500 rubles</a> for the purchase of a subscription, which includes 8 types of training and weekly mailings about English grammar and vocabulary - "Vitaminki" and "Buns". <br><br>  And for unlimited and perpetual access to all features of the site there is an <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/vip%3Fpes%3Dgeektimes_fce_vip">‚ÄúAll Inclusive‚Äù tariff</a> (the discount does not apply). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371163/</a></p>
