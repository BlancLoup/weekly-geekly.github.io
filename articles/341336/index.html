      Maybe I will even miss the not quite standard format of the overview post and the picture with all the conference speakers will be after the kata. <br><br>  And this time we will not have an opening keyout, i.e.  Each report of the first time slot is a small keyout, and there will be no time to build up.  Immediately in the sale! <br><br>  What to expect from the reports at the conference and where with their help you can get - under the cut.  Whether our vision coincides with reality or not is up to the participants of <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">Mobius 2017 Moscow</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Program</b> </h2><br>  So, for a start, let's take a look at the list of speakers in general.  Perhaps someone you like visually, and you immediately scroll to it.  But if, after all, you are a supporter of the ‚Äúget to know all the options and then choose‚Äù approach, then perhaps in chronology you will have a coherent story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y3/qj/p3/y3qjp3uxpscizqn2xiccnken9iw.png"><br><br>  According to the classical scheme, there are several options for the delivery of <s>personal</s> information to the user, so we divided all the reports accordingly.  Getting started. <br><hr><br><h3>  <b>Reports about Android</b> </h3><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ny/xn/pc/nyxnpcu1j9lxhrdbp8lnvtggkai.png">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/7tt1i72eu0wkyywykuuuuw/"><b>Lisa Wray - Data Binding in a Kotlin World</b></a> <br>  Mat for someone is gymnastic flooring, and someone lacks confidence when jumping in the UI.  What is in life, what is in the development of fears, and, perhaps, you even use the <b>Kotlin</b> and <b>RxJava extensions</b> as the same mat and want to do everything a little faster, easier and more efficiently.  We have a speaker for you. <br><br>  A guest on the other side of the Atlantic is literally ready to tell on the fingers how to use the Data Binding framework to significantly reduce the headache with the code and change the path to creating a UI.  Lisa is not just <b>Android Google Developer Expert</b> , she is a graduate of MIT undergraduate in music and IT.  Before she started working on the application of a single world-famous publication, she managed to work at Google (unexpectedly) in the development team for the relationship of developers of <i>Android, Google Glass, Android Wear</i> , etc. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iy/na/tk/iynatkwesgtkvhi-arp1b8xesi0.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/rwduypffmy0cmeyksqwyy/"><b>Jing Li - Android meets Docker</b></a> <br><br>  Jing Li is a developer agnostic (whatever that combination means) with a focus on tula, quality and CI.  Perhaps a brief <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/339500/">interview</a> can make the picture more clear. <br>  CI is not the easiest process to implement, and in terms of software development, it is still developing in the field of mobile.  The Jing report will be an introduction to Docker and a high-quality Docker image for Android, on the basis of which the presentation of using the latest <b>Android CI</b> is built - with a description of the advantages, limitations, chips and performance. <br><br>  Of course, there will be a live demo for setting up a Jenkins Android slave via Android Docker image in 2 minutes (no matter how incredible that may sound). <br><br>  The report lacks moments that look like a challenge to stereotypes.  If you want to participate in the discussion, please prepare your questions in English.  * <br><br>  * I wrote it myself, I re-read it myself ... no, this is not the same article as <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/southbridge/blog/340738/">‚ÄúDocker, Docker, Docker‚Äù</a> . <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v0/dn/yf/v0dnyfen-2ov3i2geugc2i2oblu.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/1tlnb0svnwgieo2uewauom/"><b>Sergey @willykolepniy Boishtyan - How I hated ORM</b></a> <br>  Advertising Tinkoff in one way or another appears regularly, HYIPs, etc.  But in our history the speaker himself is notable, and for two years Sergey has been part of the mobile application development team for legal entities.  Despite the fact that in 2013 he started everything from the profession of bartender, Java and backend. <br><br>  Sergey's report will be about the current project on Android, what problems the team brought <b>ORM</b> (growth of the size of the base to breathtaking size) and how they were solved.  Let's discuss the purpose of <b>ORM</b> and what restrictions it imposes on developers.  The purpose of the report is to make an ordinary developer think about the appropriateness of using <b>ORM</b> in his project.  Technologies to be used: <b>OrmLite, Stetho, DBInspector, Sqlite.</b> <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/bs/fp/jjbsfptsvfq1j8o8znngifb_-gc.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/3kone5kcgeeeeaiu2iaqi6/"><b>Ivan @IvanPonomarev Ponomarev - Crash-reports on Android NDK</b></a> <br>  Ivan is the leading programmer for the <i>Akvelon</i> mobile platform.  Behind more than 5 years of experience in the gaming industry with a specialization in cross-platform development for mobile devices using C / C ++ (and they work, for example, the company has a video about controlling the device for pouring beer from a mobile phone).  The problem of collecting information about errors in the <b>NDK</b> code is familiar firsthand, and this will be discussed. <br><br>  The first part of the report will briefly review the existing developments: how the built-in Android debugger works, what solutions already exist. <br><br>  The second part is devoted to the story of how it works ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù: how to get the processor status at the time of the error, how to unwind the call stack, how to find the line numbers in the source code.  An overview of such stack promotion libraries as <b>libcorkscrew, libunwind, libunwindstack</b> will be given <b>.</b> <br><br>  The report will be of interest to both Android developers, whose applications use NDK, and everyone else to expand their horizons. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/go/zg/kz/gozgkzhc1yto9e0euv2sixbhtss.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/7eig3wj0c46u2scags2ugk/"><b>Alexey Buzdin - Make your gadget speak: Google Assistant</b></a> <br>  But when studying this report, the author naturally remembered a bunch of memes from Siri, Alexa, Alionka and Alice, Amazon Home, Google Home and, finally, a joke about the Scottish accent and voice control of the elevator ... <br><br>  Together with Alexey we will dive into the world of <b>Google Assistant.</b> <br>  In the report, the speaker will show how to start writing applications for Google Assistant and test them on Android, iOS and Google Home.  Within 40 minutes we will write the application from scratch together and debug it using Google Home. <br><br>  In general, Alexey knows how to organize a community, which he regularly does, arranging meetings with the Google Developers Group Riga, the Java User Group Latvia and the annual conference Riga Dev Day. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/3b/u5/p13bu5zukqszpka3v2d4ciz2atg.png">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/zqoeak6eiouwka0oessa2/"><b>Eugene @smart_jk Saturov - Instant Apps: how to teach an application to work without installation</b></a> <br>  Let's start from afar.  <b>4.8</b> on Google Play - is it a lot or a little?  It is clear that this is rather arbitrary, but we take the hypothesis that this is an honest rating, verified and voluntary. <br><br>  So, Evgeny is the leader of the <i>Android Labyrinth</i> team, the one that was the first in Russia to implement the <b>Instant App</b> and boast an application with a rating of 4.8 on Google Play. <br><br>  We will talk about <b>Instant Apps</b> - the possibility of using the application without having to install it on the device.  The report will cover the technology itself, the implementation experience, how to prepare a project for the implementation of Instant Apps and the pitfalls that can be encountered in the process.  Special attention will be paid to the choice of use cases, as well as the benefits that a clean architecture provides in the context of creating Instant Apps. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5p/pv/xr/5ppvxr2bmgt6h-htes4mb42rij4.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/3bq7ixea3egimycoeiwgag/"><b>Enrique L√≥pez Ma√±as - TensorFlow for mobile devs</b></a> <br>  Enirique Lopez has been working with mobile technologies since 2007 and has seen many HYIPs during this time, so he knows a lot about them.  At the moment there is a hyip around <b>ML</b> and <b>AI</b> , and in order to be on the wave, he suggests using <b>TensorFlow</b> as the main framework from Google.  And provided that the Enrique L√≥pez Ma√±as itself is <b>Google Developer Developer</b> and one of the founders of the <b>Google LaunchPad accelerator</b> , then how can you not get into this, and also benefit from the use of ML.  Before the conference even released a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/340424/">preliminary post</a> on his work, so you can have time to prepare. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/--/km/4s/--km4s2xv8nxdc_fiqurkovwnka.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/jslrnocqzieusmswmg0w0/"><b>Sergey @Reallife Ryabov - Writing Java Friendly Kotlin Code</b></a> <br>  Sergey Ryabov is an independent Android developer with a back-end background.  A few years ago, I gained <i>Kotlin-superpowers,</i> which I still use for good in my experiments and production.  <i>Rx-fanatic, Kotlin-evangelist.</i> <br>  And like any evangelist, he is ready to carry knowledge to the masses.  This time about how to write Kotlin code so that it can be used in Java.  Indeed, interop with Java is widely advertised.  However, while <b>Java</b> code from <b>Kotlin</b> can be pulled without any problems, working with the Orthodox <b>Kotlin</b> code from Java has its own nuances.  Sergey will tell you what the creators of <b>Kotlin</b> reserved for such cases. <br><hr><br><h3>  <b>Reports about iOS</b> </h3><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0f/wr/xl/0fwrxl7jpjyzn-e5sz3hieh10fa.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/7z4qnan0xuagoaq6a0kwga/"><b>Andrey @ s1dd0k Volodin - How to become a GPU-engineer in an hour</b></a> <br>  Andrei Volodin - lead developer <i>Cocos2d-ObjC</i> , creator of the first <b>Swift</b> application for Android, the author of the cross-platform game engine <b>Fiber2D</b> , currently a <b>Metal / ARKit</b> engineer. <br><br>  Andrew will help us get to the video card mobile phones.  Someone may remember the bearded joke about the " <i>bundles of iPhones on a kolokeyshene</i> ."  To some extent this is not a joke.  Namely: <br>  The modern world would not be what it is, without <b>GPU</b> calculations.  Modern console games, VR, AR, cryptocurrency, machine learning - it all works on hot graphics processors. <br><br>  However, among mobile developers, video cards are not very popular: many people think that this is very difficult, and some do not even notice that the iPhone basically has a video card. <br><br>  With the help of this report, I would like to familiarize the masses of developers with programming graphics processors, with an eye on mobile platforms and, of course, trendy topics. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3z/2q/v5/3z2qv58e8cbfwsc-ksbrhgmmojg.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2zbpb5p9awemu42sucew2o/"><b>Maxim @max_sokolov Sokolov - Messenger inside out, or How to make an instant messenger today in a mobile iOS application</b></a> <br>  Imagine that instead of tearing off a piece of paper with a phone from an ad at the entrance, you can take a smartphone and immediately write to the owner directly, specifying the status, without worrying about the problem ‚Äúdoes not take the pipe, got it, sold it,‚Äù etc. <br>  To get such a messenger, Maxim Sokolov, like Team Lead in <i>Avito</i> , had to go through all the serious things, from a simple <b>HTTP-API</b> to using web sockets, learning about the pros, cons, and pitfalls of various approaches.  Maxim will share how his team designed the client-server <b>API</b> and how <b>Swift</b> helped with this.  You will learn how to guarantee the delivery of messages to customers, online user statuses, message statuses and other functions of modern instant messengers and their implementation. <br>  Messengers are developing rapidly and new functionality needs to be added quickly.  The report will explain how to build a scalable architecture that makes it easy to add new chips. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/ng/m5/snngm5znbs6al4nbsh26ogrkgbs.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/1viu3dhu7esqsagsugeaco/"><b>Yevgeny @ptiz Kamyshanov - Life without connection: from chaos to consensus</b></a> <br>  Too many historical references are obtained during the review.  But what to do, the story moves in a spiral: ‚Äúapplications on the desktop tend to work in the cloud regardless of the local memory‚Äù, ‚Äúapplications on the phone gradually acquire more and more offline functionality.‚Äù <br>  Good or not, it will be possible to discuss with Evgeny Kamyshanov from <i>EPAM</i> after its practical demonstration of this phenomenon during the report. <br>  With all this, being a <b>Lead iOS developer</b> at <i>EPAM</i> in St. Petersburg, the speaker does not believe in silver bullets and struggles with perfectionism as much as he can. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/ui/um/rbuiumla5ojxg8p8b6okzgycljw.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2dghgmhchamgyey6ya6giy/"><b>Marcin Krzy≈ºanowski - Decipher the encoding</b></a> <br>  Marcin is not just a developer and author of <b>Natalie</b> , <b>CryptoSwift</b> and <b>ObjectivePGP</b> , but also someone who is still trying to preserve privacy with <b>PrivacyApp.io</b> As a consequence of the latter, he knows a lot about <i>Encoding</i> processes ... very much.  Of course, the report will present not only practice, but also a comparison of <i>encoding vs.</i>  <i>encryption</i> .  With more being used in real life, explanations with examples (mostly on iOS, but not only). <br>  By the way, Marcin is not with us for the first time and was already pleasantly surprised by the high level of our community.  We hope that this time he will have the opportunity to strengthen his faith in the high level of our mobile developers. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/dd/e6/qsdde6axqjwl6d18_deuis3ycqs.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2mdvnkwcssioquwmgykq08/"><b>Dmitry @handamade Kurkin - Optimizing Application Size</b></a> <br>  So, what do you associate the sound <b>"oh-oh"</b> ?  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth talking about everyone, but for those who started before the iPhone came, this is the sound of a single messenger, which, by celebrity, was comparable to the current Telegram. <br>  What is this all about?  Dmitry has 12 years of experience in developing instant messengers for various platforms.  For the last 5 years, he has been making the iOS client for <b>ICQ</b> (the sound "oh-oh") as a team lead. <br>  Consider what the size of the application on iOS is made of and how this size can be reduced.

It is led by Gleb Novik, the author of the <abbr title="https://github.com/strongself/COOperation">COOperation</abbr> framework. <br>  Gleb's report will be built around a common way to build the service layer of an application ‚Äî this is using <b>GCD</b> mechanisms to create asynchronous interaction of components.  Many people think, but very few people use in practice the full power of the <b>NSOperation</b> and <b>NSOperationQueue classes</b> for this task. <br>  Through careful decomposition and minor refinement of these classes, you can get an extremely flexible and portable component that will become a true friend when you create new services.  Gleb will talk about how you can use composite operations when building a service layer and how the <b>COOperation</b> framework developed by him can help. <br><hr><br><h3>  <b>The field of general utility is no longer an environment, but something more</b> </h3><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/rb/ep/1krbepmoc3nvnurhmb9jtlaa_le.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/7ewhxk5ohg28asgu6scqw8/"><b>Vladimir @dzigoro Ivanov - The Void of Heritage: A Strategy for Drastic Improvements in the Project</b></a> <br>  Vladimir is one of the fairly frequent guests of our conferences, and his position as lead developer in EPAM is not the reason.

Let's sort out " <b>Legacy</b> ".  Every developer has to deal with it constantly.  Moreover, each new project becomes legacy over time, if not enough attention is paid to technical debt.  The report will talk about how to live with a particularly neglected case, aka a project of more than 5 years of age. <br>  We will find out: <br><ul><li>  how to realize the size of the debt; </li><li>  how to come up with a refactoring plan; </li><li>  hold it as painlessly as possible. </li></ul><br>  The code will be in <b>Java</b> , but there is almost no specificity for <b>Android</b> , so it will be interesting for engineers of both platforms. <br>  It is a little theory, a lot of practice, a pinch of statistics, not boring pictures - everything, as you like. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sq/z8/ag/sqz8agk135vmd_aunuvbjddlg7i.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/4iprilrwsawge2e488yeis/"><b>Konstantin @Konojoto Yakushev - Universal links - palace from reefs</b></a> <br>  I would like to begin the presentation of this speaker with an introduction to the report of his colleague: <br>  <i>‚ÄúWho thinks Badoo is a search network?</i>  <i>And who thinks that this is a Chinese internal online store? ‚Äù</i>  Honestly, in the hall at another conference, hands were raised by far from a few on both questions.

You understand, here it is - a turning point, but when you seek support and approval for the development, you are faced with an obstacle: "We do not have the resources," or "At the moment we have other priorities."  Employees who are familiar with the company's product are best suited to inventing and designing the best features for an application, but sometimes the company's policies and procedures are in the way.  But where there is a desire, there are opportunities!  Rebels and insurgents conquer the world - The Empire must fall!  If you know that this feature is important, but you do not have permission to continue, you will have to carefully balance between creative freedom and respect for the priorities of your company. <br><br>  In this report, Jonathan will share how he developed the feature without permission and how he was not fired / crippled / killed. <br><br>  Jonathan is one of the leading Israeli mobile developers, part of the elite Google Developer Experts team.
