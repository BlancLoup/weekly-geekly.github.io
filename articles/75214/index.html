  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to buy electronics on Amazon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/47f/953/05e/47f95305ecf6bc80793384dcf7bc1d70.jpg" alt="Amazon logo" align="left"><br>  Surely many of you got into a situation where in the American online store there is a thing you are interested in at a tempting price, but the store delivers only within the United States.  For example, in the largest online store Amazon residents from the CIS countries can order only books and movies, and then not all.  Of course, you can compensate for this drawback with ebay, but where else can you have a chance to buy an iPod Touch 32 GB 3rd Gen for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apple-touch-Generation-NEWEST-MODEL/dp/B002M3SOC4/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1258140389%26sr%3D8-1">$ 269.99</a> , and a Nokia N900 for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-N900-Unlocked-Computer-Touchscreen/dp/B002OB49SW/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dwireless%26qid%3D1258140439%26sr%3D8-1">$ 559.99</a> ?  Or maybe it's a sinful thing to order a <a href="http://google.com/phone/%3Flocale%3Den_US%26s7e%3D">Nexus One</a> ?  The fall of the dollar and the pricing policy of manufacturers has made purchases in the US quite a tempting affair. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, for purchases on Amazon with delivery to the US address, we need a credit card and a good shopping history at Amazon, otherwise Amazon can easily block you for fraud.  Why Amazon?  Just because, unlike many other stores, Amazon allows sending parcels not to your Billing Address, but to any other (even to Cambodia). <br><br><img src="http://s50.radikal.ru/i127/1001/21/72c2e0888415.png" alt="Shipito" align="left">  We also need an American postal address, because we will have to resort to the role of intermediaries.  Asking this question, I rummaged a lot of information, in the end the required service was found: <a href="http://www.shipito.com/">shipito.com</a> . <br><br>  All you need is to <a href="https://www.inccontact.com/client/shipito_signup.php%3Fid_language%3Deng">register</a> and pay $ 8.50, which will automatically be deposited into your internal account.  In gratitude for the registration, Shipito will give you your own mailing address.  <b>Please note</b> that in addition to the street address and the building number, you will be assigned a unique Box Number (I have Suite # 8018).  Remember this number and be sure to indicate next to the street name in e-shops, so that Shipito employees can quickly and easily determine who sent the package.

      The Shipito web interface looks ascetic and sometimes quite damp, but quite functional: <br> <a href="http://radikal.ru/F/s60.radikal.ru/i167/1001/d5/89331c405124.png.html"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b66/0a2/de1/b660a2de162151dfa89196e4d5fbff69.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As soon as the package arrives at Shipito, you will be notified by email.  Looking at the interface you can easily find the package in the section <b>Packages in Warehouse</b> .  All you need to do is: <br><ul><li>  With your own hands to create a customs declaration. </li><li>  Choose a shipping method and insurance. </li><li>  Give additional instructions to Shipito employees: for example, destroy the Amazon invoice (however, this is all optional for a coin). </li></ul><br>  <b>Please note</b> that the cost for which you are going to insure the package will be taken from the customs declaration, i.e.  understating the cost, in case of loss of the parcel, you risk getting an incomplete value when you return the money. <br><br>  The cost of Shipito services for sending your package is $ 8.50, which is a fairly affordable amount.  Shipito also provides a number of other services, more about which I can tell in the comments, or you can read on their <a href="http://www.shipito.com/shop-pricing">website</a> themselves. <br><br>  <i>Briefly about the customs declaration.</i>  Please note that your customs declaration will be viewed not by the same technogic as you, but by a simple customs officer.  Therefore, one should not once again rivet his attention to strange phrases, so that he does not have a desire to open the parcel and see for himself whether you have hidden something somewhere.  Therefore, try to simplify the descriptions, for example, Apple mp3 Player, if you are transporting an iPhone, or Toshiba DVD Player, if you are carrying a netbook, etc.  Remember about the restrictions on the maximum cost of goods for physical persons, which is not taxed, namely 10000r for Russian post, and 200 euro for Ukrainian mail. <br><br>  <i>Briefly about delivery methods.</i>  If you do not want to have problems during the customs clearance of the goods by valiant FedEx, then I ironically do not recommend choosing it.  It is better to use one of the USPS services: <br><ul><li>  <b>USPS First-Class Mail / USPS Flat Rate Envelope</b> is the cheapest and longest delivery method.  At this point, as lucky as they are, they will be delivered in 1 week or in 5. It is necessary to receive in the local post office.  I do not recommend to use for expensive things. </li><li>  <b>USPS Priority Mail</b> - the best method of delivery: cheap, reliable, with insurance.  You should also receive it at your local post office.  Delivery time - 2-4 weeks. </li><li>  <b>USPS Express Mail</b> is the fastest delivery method (1-2 weeks).  Delivers the local branch of the EMS directly to the house.  On average, a bit more expensive than Priority Mail, and also necessarily insures all packages for $ 100.  I recommend using this type of delivery for various electronics. </li><li>  <b>Shipito Airmail</b> is a great cheap alternative to First-Class Mail.  Delivery time 2-3 weeks.  Shipito employees themselves agree on the shipment of your cargo through air cargo flights.  Delivery is carried out by the local delivery department at the post office.  This method is well suited for small things, such as DVDs or magazines. </li></ul><br><br>  So I acquired different things: iPod Touch, Wacom tablet, PS3, etc.  In general, try, use, write.  All questions will be answered in the comments. <br><br>  If anyone is interested.
