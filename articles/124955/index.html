Compared to my old <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/107796/">Zenithink ZT-180</a> device, the device turned out to be much faster.  And what is surprising - for half a year the devices of the same price category differ so noticeably that in the beginning it was hard to believe.  Constant torment with the Zenithink firmware to speed up the work especially didn‚Äôt lead to anything, and the new device from the box earned quickly and without problems.  In general, it was very interesting to follow the development and competition in the price range around $ 200.  For this money, you can get the best-selling flatbed iron at the moment, which should be ‚Äúa little worse than the top models, and much better than the cheap ones‚Äù, otherwise they just wouldn't have a place in the market. <a name="habracut"></a>  The device came to me in 10 days, this is the usual time for EMS.  If you compare the design of the packaging of my old tablet with Dropad, then you can easily see that the Chinese are gradually moving away from using recognizable logos such as IE, Apple, Microsoft, etc. Finally, did you value your own brands? <br>  <b>Equipment</b> <br><ul><li>  1 √ó 7 Inch Dropad A8X </li><li>  1 √ó AC Power Adapter (5V / 2A, Mini USB) </li><li>  1 √ó USB Cable </li><li>  1 √ó OTG Line </li><li>  1 √ó User Manual </li><li>  1 √ó Earphone </li></ul>  Immediately noticeable nice aluminum case, which sits well in the hand.  Headphones as always could not be put in the box, but as a temporary option - you can and try to use.  The instruction was in Chinese and English, but that didn‚Äôt upset me too much.  We were pleased with the presence of an adapter for our sockets in the kit.  The tablet itself in the box is quite tight, so small shakes and jolts on delivery should not damage it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/945/b5b/cc1/945b5bcc122aeda49fcb3332af10a58d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Filling </h2><ul><li>  Samsung S5PC110 Cortex A8, 1 GHz processor </li><li>  RAM 512MB </li><li>  Memory 512M ROM + 8G TF Card (up to 32G) </li><li>  Screen - 7 inches, capacitive TFT, resolution 800 √ó 480 </li><li>  WIFI support for IEEE 802.11b / g / n standards </li><li>  Supports 3G modems, built-in GPS, Bluetooth, 0.3 MP camera, HDMI output, G-Sensor </li></ul>  Separately about GPS - he does not catch indoors, this is understandable, but in the car as a navigator it is a very handy thing, considering its multimedia capabilities and screen size - a great replacement for any navigator.  The wifi in the room catches fine, but not as good as my HTC Legend.  With active use of Wi-Fi, the back of the tablet is heated.  A 4100mAh battery charges an hour and a half or two hours and then holds 4-5 hours later.  The stated 6 hours of work has not yet been achieved, but I am sure that the battery can be ‚Äúshaken‚Äù.  The camera ... Well, it is :)

    <h2>  Performance </h2><br>  Iron productivity is enough for many everyday tasks and entertainment.  As a multimedia device, it fully justifies itself - without stuttering 720p videos lose, 1080p is not always smooth, but you can watch it most often (why you never understood this video quality on such a screen).  Unlike my Zenithink, the new Dropad draws most of the toys on Android, and thanks to the multitouch they can even be played.  HDMI output can easily turn a device into a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNfME_XRqs0k%26NR%3D1">game console</a> , help show friends videos and photos on the big screen TV. <br><br><h2>  Screen </h2><br>  I want to single out the screen in a separate paragraph - it is very high-quality, compared to Chinese devices of six months ago.  Compared to the same Galaxy Tab, I did not notice any special differences.  The text reads well, the picture is bright.  Multitouch in games and the browser works as it should.  Mark screen, but where without it.  Tactile seems that the screen is quite strong, but I did not dare to test it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/658/681/b5f/658681b5f0819ddcc87c737b6c9507e9.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  For many it turns out to be a plus that the device does not copy an ipad-like case, for me it does not matter.  Aluminum back cover gives solidity to the device.  The camera is not particularly noticeable, it is successfully inscribed in the body at the same level with it.  Otherwise, the appearance can be called normal for devices of this class. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  <strong>pros</strong> <br><ul><li>  GPS </li><li>  HDMI </li><li>  Fast processor </li><li>  Good body </li><li>  Good screen </li><li>  Full Flash in the browser </li><li>  Charging via mini usb </li></ul>  <strong>Minuses</strong> <br><ul><li>  Not perfect firmware </li><li>  No built-in 3G </li><li>  Mark screen </li></ul>  I will not take the old Zenithink anymore.  Dropad A8X surpassed it absolutely in all respects except for the screen size.  This device can be called popular, so new firmware is constantly being released to it, and the user community will help solve the problem.  At the moment, this is a good choice for its price, but note that in six months, most likely, it will already be an outdated model. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> This device cost me $ 217, I bought it on the site <a href="http://www.nowsupplier.com/dropad-a8x-android-22-samsung-s5pc110-capacitive-touch-screen-inch-tablet-support-3g-hdmi-flash-with-camera-p-1801.html">nowsupplier.com</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124955/</a></p>
