How exactly is it worth presenting information.  In fact, everything is simple.  Now <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/CrazyIT/63449/">GOOZZY</a> works in Opera, and, in connection with this, we are distributing invites.  Who is not interested in my languishing, do not read further, just go <a href="http://goozzy.com/request_invite/">here</a> , in the field ‚Äúwhy do you want to invite,‚Äù write, well, for example, ‚Äú[habrahabr]‚Äù, and we will send you an invite. <br><br>  For those who, after all, decided for some reason to read these lines, I immediately warn you that I really have only one goal - PR, but at the same time, I would really like to share some of my observations, because I have a lot more questions than answers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Some of my observations about the Internet business, and more precisely about the Runet.  An online business really has a number of major differences from any other business.  Let's start with the media.  The fact is that on the Internet, to ordinary professional journalists, bloggers are added, who, most of all about the Internet, write.  One way or another, there is almost no control here, which means that anyone and anything can write about your project.  Nobody really appreciates the significance of the informational event here, and, therefore, even the smallest startups can count on publications.  The second difference is publicity.  Here is the root of evil.  If you spent tens of millions and opened a restaurant, even a very inexpensive one in the center of St. Petersburg or Moscow, you will not be able to count on more than a few hundred visits a day, while even an average photographer‚Äôs blogger or graphomaniac may be several orders ahead visit the best off-line institutions.  Costs are almost nil.  ‚ÄúOh, God, everyone will talk about me, read my blog and admire me!‚Äù A huge platform for self-realization.

      Now about the money.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cool progger, I‚Äôm fixing up now, and I‚Äôm going to cut down the headstock from someone else's fund!  My idea cannot please them! ‚ÄùOr they come to petty tyrants online business, like me, stubborn and with confidence that they know how to run a business, so why not try it.  But this is all fine.  Well, tell me, is it bad that somehow money comes into the industry?  Not, in RuNet is not so simple.  ‚ÄúAre you doing a new internet project?  Everything is free?  Do you spend your money yourself?  What for?  How will you monetize?  And what are you offering new?  And what are you better than these? ‚ÄùThe audience, well, the one that, according to the idea, should be happy, sincerely indignant.  And it is indignant, screaming and scolding (not to be confused with constructive criticism).  If marketing is well thought out, then the company has come to earn money, and there is even more resentment!  Can anyone answer why? <br><br>  There is a debate about the value of ideas, and representatives of investors shout that ideas are worth nothing, but programmers do not agree.  But there is no dispute.  Simply no.  Investors need to reduce risks, especially if they are representatives of funds, which, as Andrei Ryabykh perfectly noted (Internet bourgeois), they look like the Sneaky Leo, since they are not spending their money, and they are seriously asked.  But programmers need faith in the idea, otherwise there is no motive to sit at night and write code, in between the main work. <br><br>  But the worst thing is that this chaos can be controlled.  And this is where science begins. <br><br>  About a year ago I wrote my first post on Habr√©, maybe someone else remembers.  I immediately got into the top 50 of habr people, which even for that habr was very cool.  And then I realized that it is possible to manage the opinion of the community, and if you do business in runet, it is simply extremely necessary.  But this is not taught anywhere.  I somehow bought books on sociology, but the felts of the book were not the ones, the felts, but rather, the guys there are doing other things, in a word, it gave me nothing.  Maybe one of you will advise what?  For example: <br>  How to create community in ugc-projects? <br>  How to answer when you, committed not deservedly, doused with mud? <br>  How to stop taking this chaos to heart? <br><br>  PS It was a sincere PR project goozzy.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66326/</a></p>
