      The money for the project is collected not from investors, but from ordinary fans according to the rules of kraydfinding, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1949537745/armikrog">asking 900 thousand dollars</a> for Kikstarter. <br><br>  The start was stunning.  In the first four days, more than a third was collected, a little more than 350 thousand.  All the fans were sure that they would ‚Äútake off‚Äù in the near future.  But something unpleasant happened: on the fifth day, the amount of fees did not exceed 25 thousand, on average, hesitated around 15 thousand a day. <br><br>  And now there are only 3 days (June 24) to collect the necessary large amount. <br><br>  Here you can see the dynamics of fees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12e/a33/35f/12ea3335f5e6809a31b013299da61b1c.png" alt="Kickstarter project fees"><br><br>  And <a href="http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1949537745/armikrog/">under the link you can see</a> detailed statistics. <br><br>  Since yesterday began to increase collection, but the danger is not over! <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Through thorns to Armikrog </h2><br>  What is Neverhud once again do not have to tell.  This year, the Habrasoobschestvo named the game the best among the quests, and in the list of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/172485/">best games of all times and peoples,</a> it took 5th place, overtaking Doom and Civilization. <br><br>  In 2007, the news was spread on the Internet that a plasticine cartoon based on Neverhud would soon be removed, but there was no continuation.  Last year, conversations began that the third part of the game would be created, but again everything died down.  And now, the charter to fight with the owners of the company decides to remove the new clay quest with new characters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d84/255/655/d84255655ba8f0f1867bf352dae7f2e3.jpg" alt="Heroes of Armikrog Tomminout and Bik-Bik"><br><br>  New characters are: <br>  - space explorer Tomminawt (Tommynaut, translated by <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/greatrash/" class="user_link">GreatRash</a> ), <br>  - and his dog Bik-Bik (Beak-Beak). <br><br>  The creators have promised to draw a comic with new heroes and even published one page about what happened right before the game began: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d24/1c4/d92/d241c4d929c35c9dffa3125377a82576.jpg" alt="Comics about Armikrog"><br><br>  And, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dzmz73kvDFHI">Terry Taylor</a> , the same musician who wrote and performed the entire soundtrack for Neverhud, was attracted to the creation of the game. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  About the amount of donations and that you can get for it </h2><br>  In my opinion, the creators have come up with too many gradations, it could be easier.  The most popular was the amount of $ 20, for which they offered the opportunity to download a legal game and that's it.  But the limit of this amount has now been exhausted.  Here is what the creators offer to the current accountants: <br><br>  - from $ 5 to $ 25 - just morally support the creators.  They will give a wallpaper with a picture of a worm Jimmy. <br>  - $ 25 - wallpaper with a worm and a game! <br>  - $ 30 - all that on top, and 100 pages of pictures about the country Armikrog in PDF and 3 tracks of Terry Taylor. <br>  - $ 35 - everything on top, and 24 pages of a comic book about Armikrog in PDF, and a 20-minute documentary. <br>  - $ 45 - everything on top, and the whole soundtrack for the game. <br>  - $ 50 - everything on top, and 50 pages of sketches and a 60-minute documentary. <br>  - $ 60 - everything on top, and a film with commentaries of the developers to the game and tracks with dance mixes for the songs of Terry Taylor. <br>  - $ 75 - all that on top, and 100 pages of the script to Newhud in PDF and 24 pages of comics to Armikrog on paper. <br><br>  I will not list all of them, but I will note some of the other suggestions: <br>  - $ 130 - a disc with the game, a disc with a soundtrack in the box with a description, and with an additional level of the game, out of 100 offers are all sold out, <br>  - $ 3,500 - an opportunity to talk on Skype with the creators and tell them your ideas about the world of Armikrog, and these ideas should be displayed in the game, out of 5 all are sold, <br>  - $ 10,000 - the opportunity to come to the studio, create a piece of animation that will enter the game.  Of the three, one place is still free.  Hurry up!  If I had 10 thousand free, I would buy my excursion for my child, he adores Glinka. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  So take off or not? </h2><br>  It is said that Kickstarter fees are always greatest at the beginning and at the end.  The next three days promise to be dramatic and rich. <br><br>  With this post, I appeal to all Glinkans: let's not let the project fall!  <s>Let's</s> build your own <s>Armikrog</s> lunopark! <br><br>  Crowd funding is alive! <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Translations </h2><br>  The project has not yet collected money, and the Runet community is already trying to transfer.  So, <a href="http://vk.com/armikrog">the vkontakte group</a> discusses <a href="http://vk.com/topic-52378716_28206448">how to properly translate the name of the dog Beak-Beak</a> (thanks for the link <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/cyberap/" class="user_link">CyberAP</a> ).  There are two main options: <br>  - Bik-Bik (in tune), <br>  - Clu Clu (close to translation). <br><br>  More fun options: <br>  - Beak Clyuch, <br>  - Mordoklyuv, <br>  - Byak-Byak. <br><br>  I also found another funny comic by Doug Tineip. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f0/0d3/c35/5f00d3c3595d504ff72806b476a1ff7e.jpg" alt="Comic by Dag Tineup"><br><br>  <a href="http://vk.com/armikrog%3Fw%3Dwall-52378716_1149%252Fall">The source and other translation options</a> . <br><br>  The creators of the last day of collecting money <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1949537745/armikrog/posts/521189%3Fref%3Dactivity">announced</a> that the localization of the game will be not only for Italian, French, German and Spanish, but also for Russian and Polish. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  We track the dynamics </h2><br>  June 25 - on the kickstarter the countdown began not by days, but by hours.  For the previous day, collected 48 thousand.  The total amount exceeded 700 thousand. <br><br>  The evening of June 25 - until the end of 46 hours.  760 thousand collected. <br><br>  June 26, 9:16 Moscow time - 800 thousand milestone passed!  It remains 34 hours to collect another 100 thousand. <br><br>  June 26, 20:07 Moscow time - to the finish line exactly 24 hours.  Collected 834 thousand.  Up to 900 another 66 thousand. <br><br>  Night from June 26 to June 27 in Moscow, in America in the evening, hot fund-raising time.  At about 3:30 Moscow time the <strong>required amount was collected!</strong>  Congratulate each other.  Now the Pencil Test Studios team wants to collect another 50 thousand on the Wii version for the remaining 12 hours. <br><br>  June 27, 11 am Moscow time - 9 hours to go.  27 thousand more are collected from above. <br><br>  June 27, 18:32 Moscow time - 95 minutes to go.  The amount of 950 thousand collected. <br><br>  June 27, 20:07 Moscow time - the collection is completed.  For the last hour, another 24 thousand have been collected.  Outcome: 974 thousand.  Finita la comedie. <br><br>  Here is a funny interview with Doug TenNerl, which was organized by our Russian guys.  The interview was filmed to the finish: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Af3fVIH0sdU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In general, we did it, we are great, we will not wait for the game. <br><code>&nbsp;</code><br><br><h2>  Release date is named: August 18, 2015 </h2><br>  On June 9, 2015, the fans who supported Armikrog in the company on the kickstarter received a letter in which the day of release was named: <br><br>  August 18, 2015! <br><br>  Look forward to! <br><br><h2>  PS 2017: </h2><br>  The game has disappointed.  It was not as atmospheric as Newhud.  Short and not funny.  Unfortunately. <br><br>  But the creators kept all their promises.  I got a game, a sound track and a paper comic. <br><br><blockquote><p>  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BOObIaNAuG-/">Got a comic Armikrog</a> </p><p>  Photo posted by Vadim (@vadimiztveri) Dec 19 2016 at 8:22 PST </p></blockquote><br><br><h2>  Authorship, this is all </h2><br>  The author of the article is Vadim Galkin.
