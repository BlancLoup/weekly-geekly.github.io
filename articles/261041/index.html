      Here is how Alexey Savvateev announced his lecture: <br>  <i>In the magazine ‚ÄúKvant‚Äù number 8 for 1983 in the article ‚ÄúAround the bisector‚Äù on page 36 I. F. Sharygin formulates the following task:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúAbout this triangle it is known that the triangle formed by the bases of its bisectors is isosceles.</i>  <i>Is it possible to assert that this triangle is isosceles? ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The answer is no, but the article further states:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúUnfortunately, the author failed to build a specific example of a triangle (that is, to specify the exact values ‚Äã‚Äãof all its angles or side lengths) with such an exotic property.</i>  <i>Maybe this can be done by the readers of the magazine? ‚Äù</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Since then, built three examples.</i>  <i>The last example leads us to the theory of elliptic curves and the operation of addition of points.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In the lecture, we construct a whole triangle with the desired property.</i>  <i>The question of the infinity of such triangles is still open.</i>  <i>The school problem, thus, will lead us to the very heart of one of the most beautiful branches of modern mathematics.</i> <br><br>  The shift is in full swing, we have already managed to do something interesting, but something else is in the plans. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are obligatory lectures in the camp, there are visiting lecturers, there are workshops, there is independent work on the project.  The most interesting thing happens <s>after the end of</s> the breaks and between events.  It is there that I conduct my partisan activities. <br><br>  I started with the simplest: in order to figure out something, you need to sort it out.  This time, the radar detector is asked to be torn apart (not to be confused with an anti-radar detector).  Following me, the guys disassembled two laptops, such as repair.  (And they found a ruler and a table of recalculation of different quantities inside one of them.) <br>  Past cuts: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/neuronspace/blog/236279/">laser</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/neuronspace/blog/242591/">cut, stun</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/neuronspace/blog/258239/">gun cut, flashlight cut</a> <br><br><h4>  Radar detector </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bf/bf2/ee9/0bfbf2ee922b481fbb402ef2e176b5d5.jpg"><br>  We will understand what the K <sub>a</sub> and K <sub>u</sub> ranges are, what the Doppler effect is, what the horn antenna is, how the police radar and lidar work, how the radio signal is jammed and what a laser jammer is. <br><br><h4>  Saw the game TAMSK </h4><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI never thought that I would become a professional game author.  Just once the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan abstract game came to my mind, something between a puzzle and a cube-rubik.  For 4 days I made it.  A couple of years later, sitting in a bar, I met a guy who claimed that he was inventing board games.  I told him about my game, he showed interest, came to visit me and carefully looked at her.  And the next day I went and registered it in my name.  There was little enjoyment here, but instead of filling his face with him, I decided to come up with a couple more games.  That guy showed me that your ideas can somehow be implemented.  If not for him, I would not do what I am doing now.

Let's see what he will answer. <br><br>  Several games have been released in Russia, but the game with the most interesting gameplay (in my opinion) has been consigned to oblivion.  I wanted to reconstruct this masterpiece and give at least one constructive example to the guys.

Dropping a ring:</b> <br>  After moving an hour-glass, you can play one ring: take it a ring from your ringholder;  (For the remainder of the game, you will have to go through the ring before it‚Äôs been indicated earlier.) <br>  Note: Since he wasn‚Äôt  If you‚Äôre on a ring, you‚Äôll still be able to make your regular move. <br>  <b>4. The different spaces:</b> <br>  The spaces (tubes) on the board have different heights.  Once the rings have been ringed, it‚Äôs not. <br>  ¬∑ 18 spaces around the edge of the board. <br>  ¬∑ The next tier of 12 spaces may have a maximum of 2 rings. <br>  ¬∑ The inner tier of 6 spaces may have a maximum of 3 rings. <br>  ¬∑ The central space may have 4 rings. <br>  Note: You can never move it.  If you do, you lose the game at once.  So, watch the rings carefully. <br>  <b>5. Passing your turn:</b> <br>  You must not be able to move on your turn.  You need to move again - or until the game ends. <br>  <b>6. The end:</b> <br>  Ends can be made.  The player with the fewest rings left wins the game.  He has no idea what to lose.

Each time you move it, it must be turned over.  The time of one of your hour-glasses.  A move must be made with a fluid motion;  you may not keep an hour-glass in a horizontal position.  You can‚Äôt let your opponent go.  (See point 5 below: Timing of a move.) <br>  <b>4. Dropping a ring:</b> <br>  After moving an hour-glass, you may still play a ring.

The participants of the experiment for a month and a half wore a massive belt with an electronic compass, the sensors of which vibrated while being directed north.  They, like birds, learned to feel the magnetic field of the earth, and this is how they tried to describe their sensations: ‚ÄúI intuitively sensed the direction to my home or office.  I could stand in line at a cafe and suddenly think: I live there. ‚Äù  Or: ‚ÄúDuring the first two weeks I had to concentrate.  Then it all happened intuitively.

Phone phreaking is a form of hacking when you explore telephone networks, exploiting telephone systems and employees of telephone companies.  He showed me some tricks he could do with phones, such as getting any information from the telephone company about its customers and using secret test numbers to make free long distance calls.  Free only for us - much later I found out that these were not secret numbers at all: accounts came to some MCI subscriber.  It was my acquaintance with social engineering - my kindergarten, so to speak.  He and another phone phreaker, which I met later, let me listen to my calls to the telephone company.  I learned how to make myself sound convincing and learned about the various offices and procedures of the telephone company.  But this "training" did not last long.  Soon I did it all myself, even better than my first teachers.  The direction of my life for the next 15 years has been determined. <br><br>  One of my favorite jokes was the seizure of unauthorized access to the telephone switchboard and the substitution of the class of the telephone service of my fellow phreaking.  When he wanted to call from home, he received a message to lower the dime, because the telephone company‚Äôs switchboard perceived his phone as a public pay phone. <br>  I studied everything related to telephones: not only electronics, switches and computers, but also corporate organization, procedures and terminology.  Soon, I probably knew more about the telephone system than any of the employees. <br>  And I developed my social engineering skills to such an extent that by the age of 17, I could talk with most of the Telco employees about almost anything, personally or by phone.  <b>My hacking career began in high school</b> .  Then we used the term <b>hacker</b> to a <i>person who spent a tremendous amount of time digging with software and hardware, developing more effective programs or eliminating everything unnecessary to make work faster</i> . <br><br>  At the end of 1979 ( <i>Kevin, 16</i> ), a group of hackers from the Los Angeles Unified School District suggested that I hack The Ark, a computer system from Digital Equipment Corporation, which was used to develop software for their RSTS / E operating system.  I wanted to be accepted into this hacker group so that I could learn from them more about operating systems.  These new ‚Äúfriends‚Äù knew the dial-up number of the DEC computer system.  But they could not enter without an account name and password.  When you underestimate someone, he can come back and strike from the flank.  In this case, it was me who managed to hack the DEC system at such a young age.  Posing as Anton Chernoff, one of the leading developers of the project, I just called the system administrator.  I stated that I could not log into one of ‚Äúmy‚Äù accounts, and convinced this guy enough to give me access and let me choose a password on my own.  In extra class protection, any user connecting to the system had to enter a dial-up password.  The system administrator gave it to me.  It was the password ‚Äúbuffoon‚Äù (clown), which, I think, he felt when it became clear what had happened.  In less than 10 minutes, I got access to the DEC RSTE / E system.  And I did not log in as a regular user, I had all the privileges of a system developer.  At first, my new so-called friends did not believe that I had access to The Ark.  One of them shoved me away from the keyboard with a face that expressed disbelief.  His mouth opened when he saw that I was in a privileged account.  Later, I discovered that they began copying the source code of the components to the DEC operating system.  Now it was my turn to be surprised.  When they copied the software, they called the security department of DEC Corporation and said that some had hacked into the company's corporate network.  And they gave my name.  My so-called friends first used my access to the high-security source code, and then they framed me. <br><br>  It was a lesson, and more than one such lesson I had to learn.  After a few years, I repeatedly ran into trouble, because I trusted people whom I considered to be my friends.  After school, I studied computers at the Los Angeles Computer Training Center. <br>  A few months later, my school computer administrator realized that I had discovered a vulnerability in their operating system and received full administrator privileges on their IBM minicomputer.  The best computer experts from their teaching staff could not find how I did it.  It was one of my early experiences of hiring.  They made me an offer I couldn‚Äôt refuse: to make an honorable project to improve the security of a school computer or to face the charges of hacking the system.  Of course, I chose the honorable project and with Honor I graduated from Cum Laude. </blockquote><br><br>  A couple of schoolchildren ran to download the book on your tablet. <br>  Let's try to have time to write with students one more article on Habr ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233545/">last year‚Äôs article</a> ) <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Translate the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261491/">Kingpin</a> Book <br><br><h4>  Engineering Olympiad </h4><br>  Task: measure the height of this structure <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d49/380/294/d49380294b034a54bdb19cedc0089b82.jpg"><br><br>  Ideas: <br><ul><li>  measure the speed of sound (did not) </li><li>  throw sneakers and measure the time of the fall (did not) </li><li>  sfotali with a man nearby and measured on a photo in parrots </li><li>  figured that the height is equal to the radius, and the radius measured </li><li>  a) in steps <br>  b) growth <br>  c) plates <br></li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce8/d51/505/ce8d5150562b4df5aebd59561b9c7e83.jpg"><br><br>  The remaining tasks of the engineering Olympiad will be a little later. <br><br><h4>  Projects </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/4e5/977/3214e59771a3451c95eced1573dbfd01.jpg"><br>  The basis of the shift - work on projects in a team <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26e/857/49f/26e85749f9707807f1ce8f08999656fb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At first, this is how all the projects looked. <br><br>  Some have not stood the test. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6d/87e/afa/c6d87eafaf16453ba60edce88a0121c9.jpg"><br>  The remains of an amphibious robot met with the remnants of a robot drummer <br><br>  Some successfully function <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/16d/344/2cb16d34478c4def8ef038b07e17cf2b.jpg"><br>  Room mapping robot scanner <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69c/b58/dee/69cb58dee6684bbc9c24fc47b73a9bda.jpg"><br>  Robot-rider on a stick, to help cameramen <br><br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5f/227/658/a5f2276587d54148a7724e59f3843911.jpg"><br>  The oxygen sensor is monitored by the CO2 sensor. <br><br>  Programmers, meanwhile, code "solvers" of puzzles <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/610/0d2/f726100d22e24f5faeb544e8ef747333.jpg"><br><br>  and support Chinese manufacturers by helping them invent names like "Abibas" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b70/680/332/b706803328e344a7ab6124a026d0f919.jpg"><br><br>  P.S. <br>  If you have interesting offers of games, tasks, <s>social experiments</s> , offer, there is still time and living children, you can test your hypotheses for free.
