Recently, we told you about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/271668/">X Force</a> , the flagship of the line of Moto smartphones with an unbreakable screen.  Now smoothly go to another model - Moto X Play.  This is a cute and very ‚Äúhardy‚Äù device with color interchangeable panels included.  All the details about the gadget right under the cut: do not hesitate to go in and ask questions in the comments. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/273286/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32c/823/ca8/32c823ca80eb4c26b3211bbf2eeaa29a.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Design</font> </h2><br>  Moto X Play immediately "touches" its design.  The front panel is decorated with a slightly curved around the edges of the 2.5 D glass, which, under direct light, creates the visual effect of a spreading water drop.  The back panel of expressiveness gives a removable cover with a rubber coating, which by default can be either black or white - depending on which Moto X Play you choose in the store. <br><br>  Together with a standard lid, two extras are supplied.  If you choose black Moto X Play, they will be dark purple and dark blue.  And if X Play is white, then you will find orange and light green panels in the box.  You can change them depending on your mood: it seems like a trifle, but someone will surely be pleased.  And no fingerprints on this material remain - also a plus!

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5dd/a57/9c2/5dda579c2e4c4b63870de7b228b89188.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the smartphone does not imply that the user will remove the battery independently.  Although experienced enthusiasts and specialists of service centers with the replacement of the battery will cope easily - the small screws right here under the cover.  But remember that this leads to a loss of warranty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/989/32e/4a9/98932e4a9bf040e69321fb9c1ca3ee05.jpg"><br><br>  You can simultaneously install two nanoSIM and one microSD memory card in the sliding tray on the top of the Moto X Play.  The volume keys and the power button are on the right.  And the latter with a corrugated coating, which helps to quickly find it by touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70a/465/00d/70a46500de8a4dbbacb60ae205c67a76.jpg"><br><br>  Water protection, like Moto G, does not have a device, but it does have a water-repellent coating.  Of course, X Play will not survive a full swim, but rain or even a randomly spilled cup of water is not a hindrance for it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5d/162/bc1/a5d162bc17f5444d93b97cdfc7af4310.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Screen</font> </h2><br>  One could say that Moto X Play has quite a flagship screen, but for today's ‚Äútop-end‚Äù smartphones, the actual resolution is not Full HD, but the resolution is 2560x1440.  Here, 5.5 inches in diagonal with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  That, however, does not prevent you from getting great pleasure from the color quality of a bright IPS-matrix with wide viewing angles.  With this screen, you can comfortably work even on a bright sunny day outside, and it is equally well suited for any tasks: from watching videos and mobile games, to quickly editing documents on the way to work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/3b4/547/8343b45475da4d619b847a0847c34269.jpg"><br><br>  There is also an interesting "feature" called ActiveNotifications.  If you take a smartphone out of your pocket or take it in your hand after it has been lying on the table for some time, then a clock and notifications about missed calls, received letters and incoming messages will appear on the dark screen. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Performance</font> </h2><br>  Performance Moto X Play is at a confident average level.  The device is equipped with a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset with eight cores running at the maximum possible frequency for this SoC of 1.7 GHz, and Adreno 405 graphics. Plus 2 GB of RAM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/071/a89/bcc/071a89bcc9cc4f619e2a1ab7213284c4.jpg"><br><br>  The results in the AnTuTu 6.0.1 benchmark are about two times more modest than the Moto X Force flagship: 44,000 points against almost 84,000. In the 3D tests, Mark Moto X Play scored 370 and 9170 points.  However, synthetic tests do not know anything about how much time the developers spent on system optimization.  In this regard, a really big job has indeed been done: Android 6.0 works very smoothly, the smartphone does not start going crazy if you launch a dozen applications at once or open many tabs in the browser.  And for most games from the Play Market, the performance reserve should be enough, except, perhaps, for the most voracious and demanding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/204/a39/e07/204a39e07fbc428f961e40802803d348.jpg"><br><br>  The amount of internal memory is 16 GB, of which 11 GB is available to the user.  It is quite enough for all the necessary programs and games, and photos and videos can be copied to a memory card, the maximum amount of which can reach 128 GB.  Moto X Play is also equipped with an NFC-module and can connect to Wi-Fi networks on both 2.4 and 5 GHz. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba5/f49/20d/ba5f4920d7c44f0dbcd0cf22ed71fc6f.jpg"><br><br>  Android 6.0 is already available for all four models of Moto smartphones sold in Russia.  In general, this is an absolutely standard version of the Google operating system, which is complemented by a pair of our branded "fiction".  For example, modified gallery and camera interfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b53/e08/da5/b53e08da56e744488507aaa5f503fcab.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Camera</font> </h2><br>  The Moto X Play camera is based on the Sony Exmor IMX230 21-megapixel sensor, the constant aperture of the lens is f / 2.0.  Plus, 192 Phase AF sensors are very helpful.  In daylight, it is easy to take sharp and ‚Äúlive‚Äù shots with very natural color reproduction and excellent detail.  In general, in terms of quality, they are quite comparable with frames provided by flagship apparatuses.  Is that the noise in the dark areas of the frame a little more.  And, of course, optical stabilization in X Play is not provided. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/baf/9be/124baf9be3774328b3e27b44591292c7.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72c/9a3/67c/72c9a367c24447be979337f4c71860d2.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3e/951/7c0/e3e9517c04b94b0ebe9a0932fb5d1ea0.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/045/d0b/a31045d0b68440df8c7bffd9428d5a27.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67d/a3a/c4e/67da3ac4ea354abe86d8d4af48d50d8c.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b9/fda/126/7b9fda126528492eb8a226821627cc43.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td></tr><tr><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aab/f6e/389/aabf6e3895684c1a9c8932f256f7c07b.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td><td><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5f/83a/2a1/b5f83a2a18af4a929bc3c8f222affad3.jpg" alt="image" width="400"></div></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  With a lack of lighting, the noise becomes more noticeable, but it is still comfortable to work with the camera.  Well, when the light is not enough, then double flash will always come to the rescue.  Of course, there is a front camera: its resolution is 5 megapixels.  Moto X Play is not a selfie, but the gadget will not leave its owner without decent self portraits. <br><br>  It is appropriate to recall another proprietary Moto "feature": the ability to turn on the camera of a smartphone, just shake it slightly.  It saves time when you urgently need to photograph something important. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Battery</font> </h2><br>  The large screen of the smartphone provides an excellent opportunity to provide the device with a capacious battery.  Alas, not everyone uses it, but we tried to squeeze the maximum: Moto X Play is equipped with batteries with a capacity of 3630 mAh.  Employees of the Moscow office of Lenovo, who use this device as the main one, report that on average a full charge is enough for a day ‚Äúwith a tail‚Äù.  With an economical approach, you can achieve better results. <br><br>  Well, if you operate with mean, but with clear figures, the user can count on about 5 hours of mobile games with maximum brightness or 13-14 hours in video playback mode.  These are not record figures, but they are noticeably higher than the average. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/326/c34/d5d/326c34d5d81a48e1aec7eaf279d4ee46.jpg"><br><br>  Another nice bonus is fast charging up to 100% in just 1.5 hours using the special TurboCharger adapter.  It is not included in the package, but the usual adapter from Moto X Play is something remarkable.  It has two USB-inputs at once, so you can charge two smartphones from one outlet, if you have an additional cable on hand. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Where to buy and how much?</font> </h2><br>  X Play, along with three more Moto smartphones went on sale in Russia almost three weeks ago - March 1.  You can buy the gadget <a href="http://bit.ly/21Kv5EO">at the official Lenovo online store</a> , as well as at Megafon, Euroset, Svyaznoy and Know-How stores.  Regardless of which option you choose, Moto X Play will cost exactly 29,990 rubles, and deliver it to you completely free of charge. <br><br>  <i>That's all, thank you for your attention!</i>  <i>If you have any questions, we will be happy to answer them in the comments.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368501/</a></p>
