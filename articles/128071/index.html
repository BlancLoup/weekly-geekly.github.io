      Classes are held 2 times a week by the method and under the guidance of the teachers of FML No. 239 in both branches of the center.  The cost of classes in DDT "Transfiguration" - 800 p.  per month (for 16 academic hours).  Classes for students FML ‚Ññ239 free. <br><br>  We invite in circles in the following areas: <br><br>  - Basics of robotics (Lego-robots), three years of study <br>  - Radio electronic control systems (beam robots, microcontrollers), two years of study (from grade 6) <br>  -Electrical engineering (with designers "Expert"), one year of study <br>  - Physics of robots (with Lego designers), one year of study <br>  -Android robots (with Bioloid constructors), one year of study (from grade 8) <br>  and etc. <br><br><br>  You can talk live with our teachers and see the robots at the fair of circles, which will be held on September 10 at 14.15 in the premises of FML No. 239 at St. Petersburg, Kirochnaya St., 8. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read about the programs offered <br><br><h5>  Recommendations on the choice of directions </h5><br>  For beginners of robotics of all ages, the direction of the Basics of Robotics is basic (2 times a week for 1.5 hours).  The course is designed for 3 years, the main tool is the designer Lego Mindstorms NXT (school version, home version).  The programming environment at the first stages is Robolab 2.9.4, subsequently - RobotC.  Lego robots lead the All-Russian competition in robotics, in which circles take an active part. <br><br>  As an additional course for students in grades 4‚Äì6, Physics of robots is recommended (1‚Äì2 times a week for 1.5 hours).  The course is designed for 1 year and helps to master the basics of physics (mechanics, pneumatics, energy sources, etc.) with examples of mechanisms made from Lego designers. <br><br>  For those who want to do their own robots, we recommend the new course Radio-electronic control systems (2 times a week for 1.5 hours).  Classes are held in the radio installation workshop DDT "Preobrazhensky", the course is designed for 2 years.  At the first stage, the simplest analog beam robots are created, subsequently more complex robots on programmable microcontrollers, the C language is studied, and much more.  Self-made robots compete with Lego robots and are valued much higher in professional circles.  Recommended not earlier than 6th grade. <br><br>  For students in grades 6‚Äì8 who plan to engage in radio electronics, we recommend the course Electrical Engineering (1‚Äì2 times a week for 1.5 hours).  Fundamentals of electrical engineering are studied using the constructor "Expert". <br><br>  For experienced robotics and senior students (from grade 8), we offer the direction of Android robots (2 times a week for 1.5 hours).  The course is designed for 1 year, the main tool is the designer Bioloid.  Fascinating, but painstaking work on the assembly and programming of robots with a large number of degrees of freedom. <br><br>  For mathematicians, physicists and programmers who are fond of cybernetics, we offer the Basics of TAU direction (automatic control theory, once a week, 2 hours).  Using the C language, algorithms will be analyzed that provide control in various unstable systems (balancing robots, motorcycles, inverted pendulums, etc.).  Preliminary preparation is required.  Recommended after the course Basics of Robotics. <br><br>  The Simulation course (once a week, 2 hours) is intended for those who want to create their own structures and mechanisms using a computer-controlled machine tool.  Recommended not earlier than 3 years of study or not earlier than grade 9. <br><br>  Circles with interesting ideas that have mastered the basic course and dream of creating something special get into the creative laboratory of robotics.  Work is carried out in various directions.  Examples of creative projects created by children: drummers, robots Ilya Muromets and Serpent Gorynych, a robot-fireman, a controlled balancing robot-sigway, a robot decorator, a pendulum on a trolley, a driven car, etc. <br><br><h5>  References: </h5><br>  <a href="http://239.ru/">FML 239</a> <br>  <a href="http://lektorium.tv/">Lectorium</a> helps to broadcast events and provides equipment <br>  <a href="http://239.ru/robot/">General information about the center of robotics</a> <br>  <a href="http://239.ru/robot/zapis_v_kruzhok">Link to electronic registration in circles</a> <br><br>  PS In general, we have 82 circles in school and almost all of them are free.
