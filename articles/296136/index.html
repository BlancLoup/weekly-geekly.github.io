Users have access to applications and online services that will help you get a free lunch with a potential employer, better show your personality or, for example, turn your track record worklist into a great infographic.  In addition, it is possible to get remote work for a few hours with instant pay on completion of the project or organize an internship with reference to a specific project where you do not have to prepare coffee for colleagues.

      We present you 13 "technological" ways to get a new job. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  ResumUp turns your resume into a great infographic. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/d0b/c4e/31dd0bc4e4b8431f95c8ea7332f34f99.jpg"><br><br>  The application provides an easy and convenient template, thanks to which you can get an impressive infographic from your standard resume.  Perhaps this tool will not be able to fully replace the CV - it is more suitable as a supplement, the second page for the traditional resume.  At the same time, ResumeUp will be useful for those who cannot boast of an ideal and logical way of climbing the career ladder, but would like to show their entire working career in the best light. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platforms: free of charge, premium features are provided ( <a href="http://resumup.com/choose_your_template">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Speedlancer gives you remote work that can be done in 4 hours </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efb/8c2/a53/efb8c2a53de44e12b7c7195deb0ef62a.jpg"><br><br>  The essence of the service is to provide the user with a small freelance work, which takes 4 hours of time.  This is an ideal solution for those who would like to quickly earn a certain amount, and who are not alien to such things as design, copywriting and working with data. <br><br>  Such work does not require any discussion on the cost of work and interviews - you just do some work and get paid for it.  And all this - remotely. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="https://speedlancer.com/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Lunchcruit allows you to dine with a potential employer for free </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/426/c90/049/426c90049d22429487dc4d3dc23648ff.jpg"><br><br>  The service gives you the opportunity to ask for lunch at the company you are interested in without any obligations.  Just fill out a small application form and then schedule time for a free lunch and conversation.  The application is primarily used to organize meetings in the field of modern technology in San Francisco. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="http://lunchcruit.com/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  You can apply for many jobs by sending a link to your LinkedIn profile. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd7/d14/1cc/dd7d141cce534574ba2c60ca8a46a41c.jpg"><br><br>  LinkedIn was previously just the place to put your resume online.  Now the service has become a powerful business platform that makes it easy to connect with specialists from the field of interest to you and even publish content in accordance with the direction of your company. <br><br>  Now the service provides many vacancies for which you can send your application using only your profile.  In some cases, even writing a cover letter is not required. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platforms: free ( <a href="http://linkedin.com/">web version</a> , iOS, Android).</i> <br><br><h4>  Jobr allows you to quickly figure out the jobs you‚Äôve found - just like when looking for the right person in Tinder </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/107/1b2/d9d/1071b2d9df9c449390c367d8ba48e698.png"><br><br>  People like the ‚Äúswipe left or right‚Äù mechanism, which has become popular thanks to the Tinder dating app, and which is being used more and more often in many different areas.  Jobr provides an already-familiar ‚Äúyes / no‚Äù selection mechanism regarding job search.  The application shows you one-by-one job matching your requirements, and you decide which ones you want to apply for. <br><br>  This is especially useful if you have only a few free minutes and do not want to plunge into the job search process. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free (iOS, Android).</i> <br><br><h4>  Freelanship gives you the opportunity to get an internship on a specific project. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fa/8b5/968/4fa8b5968c034615b73fee1ec0d969a2.jpg"><br><br>  The service connects you with an employer who needs an intern for a specific work project.  This is a unique opportunity to show your ability to do this or that job.  It is also important that due to the service the trainee avoids such attendant duties as, for example, making coffee. <br><br>  It's simple.  The employer needs help on a specific work project, and you need to prove that you can help him.  At the end of the project, decisions may be taken on the admission of the intern to a permanent job. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="https://freelanship.com/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Sumry helps you create a multimedia resume and contact your employer. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc5/24f/756/bc524f7566784843958bcf1f91915037.png"><br><br>  A big pitfall in creating a ‚Äúcreative‚Äù resume is the likelihood that an employer simply cannot tolerate such creativity.  Sumry not only provides you with a convenient interface for creating high-quality multimedia resumes, but also informs you about which companies hire people who use this form of self-expression. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platforms: free of charge, premium features are provided ( <a href="https://sumry.me/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Use Twitter to show that you can remain professional without losing your individuality. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e0/921/b36/8e0921b36c3d4922a4938d2da3016834.png"><br><br>  Twitter can get you into trouble, and it can also show you what a colleague you will be.  You can use the service to discuss your own and other people's ideas, share funny videos, comment on articles that are interesting to you - that is, do all those things that are considered informal and at the same time far from defining ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù.  And employers definitely analyze open Twitter-accounts of potential employees in order to make an impression about them. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platforms: free ( <a href="https://twitter.com/">web version</a> , iOS, Android).</i> <br><br><h4>  JobCV.me - an easy way to create an outstanding resume </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/e87/758/1afe87758e0b4e9687f387140519d2bf.png"><br><br>  This service is one of the most uncomplicated (and at the same time convenient) ways to create a resume that is better than others.  The templates provided are modern, but devoid of the hint of madness, which often scares a potential employer.  In addition, the result is easy to save as a PDF file. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="http://www.jobcv.me/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Wildcard was created by analogy with a typical dating application, only here we deal with business contacts. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd7/6e6/818/cd76e6818f094d038493ac2a556b511e.jpg"><br><br>  The service resembles dating apps for building business connections.  You create your personal business card (a kind of online business card) that contains information about who you are and who you are looking for.  Then you look at the cards of other people and choose those you would like to meet.  If both users are interested in meeting, they will receive each other‚Äôs contact information, which will be included in their virtual files. <br><br>  You can also create individual file cabinets with the data of certain people, sorting them by event or location, and use the data files for searching for potential business contacts. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free (iOS, Android).</i> <br><br><h4>  About.me allows you to create a simple website that talks about your hobbies. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f9/ae2/328/4f9ae23286f648438d69baf9f823067f.jpg"><br><br>  The service uses the well-known principle of creating a resume, but teaches it from the other side.  Instead of listing work achievements, About.me helps you create your personal page where you can talk about your hobbies.  This page does not necessarily have to be comprehensive - just a small sketch of who you are. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="https://about.me/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Video Resume - It Doesn't Always Suck </h4><br>  A resume in the form of a video may look trite, but only if you misstate it.  The trick is to be able to edit the video and manage well with the video camera.  If you make good videos and know how to edit video files, then you should definitely try creating a video resume. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free ( <a href="https://youtube.com/">web version</a> ).</i> <br><br><h4>  Humin is a useful alternative for getting the business card of the person you need. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/7ed/611/cf77ed6116324fc183d78cb0b2c11e9f.jpg"><br><br>  This application remembers all the small details about where and under what conditions you met this or that person, and in a sense replace a business card.  All you need is to get the phone number of the person you are interested in, and the program will do the rest for you.  With the number, you can search for information on contacts using simple phrases like ‚Äúmet last week‚Äù or ‚Äúlive in Brooklyn‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Price / Platform: free (iOS).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296136/</a></p>
