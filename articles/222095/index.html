He was born back in 2011.  Even then, I had the idea to create a cozy place where people could share their problems and find their solution, or at least receive moral support.  However, only now, after almost three years, he began to acquire the qualities that I wanted to give him. <br><br><h4>  For what? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8c/b30/503/d8cb30503e666fa5c2fe94542f2e5e46.png" alt="image" width="306" align="left">  We have many thematic communities in which you can find answers to almost all relevant questions.  But sometimes, in life there are situations in which you simply cannot do without the advice of a friend.  It is this atmosphere of friendly support that underlies the ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù. <br><br>  Yes, not everyone can call as "friends" those who have never been seen and perhaps do not even know their names.  The format of hundreds of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù in popular social networks is much more familiar to people and has already managed to settle.  But no matter how it is called, the fact that somewhere on the other end of the line there is a person who is ready to listen, understand and try to help is very much worth it.

    <h4>  For whom? </h4><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúWhat to do?‚Äù Is a place where people do not come just to cry or pour their problems to everyone.  This is a place where people want to find help, support, and someone the <a href="https://chtodelat.com/q/9394">meaning of life</a> .  That is, at a minimum, they are aware of the problem and have a desire to solve it. <br><br>  The ideology of the project is based on the principle of preservation of significance.  Behind each question is a specific person, with their own feelings and their own experiences.  This principle allows you to prevent the issue from "dissolving" and become insignificant against the rest. <br><br>  Very often, you can hear excuses in the spirit: "Here are the children in Africa are starving, this is really important, and your problems here and there have not been around."  It is clear that problems are of varying degrees of complexity.  But evaluating them, people, as a rule, project compared situations onto themselves and make a seemingly logical decision. <br><br>  But the brain is complex and two problems in one head are not at all the same as two problems in two different people.  One person may want to be fed more than the new iPhone wants.  But two different people may want these absolutely incomparable things in the same way. <br><br>  Remembering that this problem is important for a particular person and having penetrated into a situation, you can help him or her much more than by comparing hundreds of thousands of situations and setting priorities. <br><br><h4>  How? </h4><br>  For comfortable work of the project, both in principle and everywhere, it is necessary to maintain order.  However, the ‚Äúorder‚Äù is a subjective concept.  You can't do well to absolutely everyone.  But you can do well for the audience for which the project was created.  It is the upholding of its principles that helps not to step down from the course and preserve the atmosphere that the project has created within itself over the years. <br><br>  Of course, I would very much like to move on to self-regulation of the community, but for this, the current audience is still not enough, therefore, order is maintained by moderation.  Interestingly, with the development of the project, it is becoming less and less moderated, although there are more questions and answers.  I relate this to the ‚Äúbroken window theory‚Äù.  People try to write more competently, it is better to express their thoughts and show more respect for others, and Trolls choose other places of entertainment for themselves when they see "how everything is arranged here." <br><br><h4>  And what do you do? </h4><br>  Now on " <a href="https://chtodelat.com/">What to do?</a>  ¬ªMore than 1,500 questions were asked and more than seven and a half thousand answers were given.  Is it a lot or a little?  I think that counting the numbers here is not entirely appropriate, because the project helps people, which means that everyone is important. <br><br>  I hope that the project will continue to develop and will gather around itself a community of people who care.  Who want to make the world around him just a little better.  I will be glad to see you as part of this community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222095/</a></p>
