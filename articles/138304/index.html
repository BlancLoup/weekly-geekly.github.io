  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tale of how one dad checked diary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our school event - enter the electronic diary!  In connection with this, parents of pupils of primary classes were gathered the other day in the assembly hall and held a small presentation on how this diary is and what it is to serve with.  I also visited, because I am the father of the eight-year-old genius, the hope of the nation, the future winner of something and other ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start, a small excursion into that part of Electric Russia, which is connected with the training of minor citizens of it.  There is such an organization - the <a href="http://mcko.ru/">Moscow Center for Quality Education</a> .  It was founded three years ago solely for the purpose of improving the quality of education, as you already understood.  He develops a lot of different methods, conducts seminars, consultations, in general, does the things necessary for our children.  Even before the heap licenses and accredits, that is, under his supervision and control, the teachers of our city grow flowers of society. <br>  Rumors that e-diaries will be introduced will have been raging for a long time, and <a href="http://dnevnik.ru/">some</a> even tried first to make them de facto standard, then to smoothly move to the legal side of things.  And finally, it came true.  One after another, principals of Moscow schools receive instructions from the department of education on launching electronic diaries in their schools.  That is, this is not some kind of deadly initiative, but full-fledged orders that are legally binding.  It came to us. <br>  In the assembly hall, we were told in 15 minutes what an electro-electrode is, how to get in there and what information is there.  And I decided to retell this presentation in my own words.  With your comments, of course. <br>  The site is located at <a href="http://new.mcko.ru/">http://new.mcko.ru</a> .  For access there, we were given long logins consisting of some numbers and the same passwords, adding that of course we can change the password, but if we suddenly forget it, then (here are round eyes) it will be almost impossible to recover it.  By golly, I will forget login faster, it is already two characters longer than the password.  But, closer to the topic.  Going into a diary, I saw just such a picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a2/3bd/11d/5a23bd11d7ef2a2c69fc4f4ad4179ee0.png">

      Naturally, I am interested in the diary of my child, and I open it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/892/597/17a/89259717ad291251ee1803eb83a92ff6.png"><br><br>  In the first trimester, the diary has not worked yet, because it is empty.  But the diary every time you open this page stubbornly returns me there, although in the yard, for a minute, is the second.  However, after a few seconds, the developers rehabilitated themselves by opening the current week after the click on the right trimester.  In the next screenshot, the previous week, because this has nothing happened yet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99b/91e/ac6/99b91eac609dfd124ce2d6f3ef2cd226.png"><br><br>  But it turned out that last week my child fell ill on Tuesday, right after gymnastics, was sick until Thursday, appeared in English on Thursday, and then collapsed with temperature, but on Friday he again found the strength to come to the lesson.  Not for long. <br>  In fairness, I want to note that we were warned about possible bugs, because the system is still being tested.  Then I wanted to see the results of tests.  Simple and tasteful, without dates and comments.  Earned - received. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2d/9f2/874/d2d9f2874475ebf9ed903058b8d52a39.png"><br><br>  Then came the final assessment.  When computers were large, these ratings were called "quarter". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe0/095/d75/fe0095d75d146a6f9a3a71ad3d228a70.png"><br><br>  There is also a section ‚ÄúAsk the teacher a question‚Äù, a simple form, nothing special and outstanding.  At this point, the tour of the content part was completed, and my father was eager to evaluate the settings of the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e64/921/e71/e64921e718e461a44e1fad2c2d8fd19c.png"><br><br>  From the actual settings there was only a password change, which (round eyes here) is not recommended. <br>  But the second point caused me admiration.  Parents decided to demonstrate the directory of native languages.  The list included two Kurdish languages ‚Äã‚Äã(one of which is Kurdish, and the second is Kurdish, but the other), unknown to me Lysginian (Lezgins, it's time to insult!) And two Central Asian.  Sorry, the first was Central Asian, and the second - Central Asian.  This, of course, is not a criticism of the functional.  Simply, the ridiculous result of evaluating the attentiveness of those who do it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8d/f5f/cd7/c8df5fcd78d2993eec2aca444b2d749d.png"><br><br>  Well, the third "setting" - directory IES.  There is nothing special, the usual directory.  Have you looked, dad?  Well, forget it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/935/95a/4d3/93595a4d3a7f89d7d79b2ed34cb64b32.png"><br><br>  On this my acquaintance with the electronic diary ended.  Below is a summary of my thoughts on this. <br><br><ol><li>  The parent part of the diary is utterly minimalistic.  View grades and chat with the teacher.  On the one hand, what else is needed?  On the other hand, I want something else.  And that one is still ... </li><li>  Perhaps, <i>perhaps</i> , the ‚Äúteacher‚Äôs part‚Äù of the diary provides a wide range of tasks and really helps the teacher.  <i>Perhaps the</i> director or some other ‚Äúboss‚Äù part of the diary is a powerful analytical tool that allows you to analyze something there with the help of something.  But looking at what I saw, it is hard to believe in it.  Most likely, this diary is simply a means for collecting assessments, which are then analyzed elsewhere.  In this case, the introduction of it in some part is justified. </li><li>  From the point of view of the developer, a week and a half of not very exhausting work was spent on the development of the parent part.  I doubt that the development time of the rest of the different order. </li><li>  Most likely, this is the homework of the Moscow Center for the Quality of Education.  For the fact of the realization of the need for them honor and praise, but I will refrain from a qualitative assessment of the result.  I did not like him. </li><li>  There is a definite plus - all classes are equipped with a computer and a printer, so that the teacher can, without leaving this place, get access to this storehouse of statistics.  Yes, and parents no longer have to fold to the laptop in the class;) </li></ol><br><br>  That was an acquaintance.  I do not argue, the introduction to the learning process of various electric tools reduces the time spent by teachers on routine work.  But, in my opinion, it should still look a little different. <br><br>  If there are people who took part in the implementation of this project, I will be glad to hear their opinions.  Also I will be glad to see the comments of teachers using this system here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138304/</a></p>
