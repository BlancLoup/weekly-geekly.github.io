      At this time, Yandex decided to arrange <s>ethnic</s> cleansing in the ranks of the search results of its service Yandex. <a href="https://blogs.yandex.ru/">Blogs</a> .  We all remember that if something once got on the Internet, it will remain there <b>forever</b> and this, it seems, can be found with the help of appropriate services.  But Yandex on this topic has, for some reason, a different opinion.  Search results on Yandex. Blogs were mercilessly cleaned and now you can only find entries <b>no older than two months</b> .  Everything else - in the <s>oven</s> trash, apparently.  Now ‚Äúwon-that-cool-post-in-LJ-I-remember-a couple of words‚Äù will have to look for in the overall issue. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Very often, the necessary information on a narrow issue is more logical to look for in blogs and forums, which, unfortunately, the ‚Äúevenness‚Äù of the search on the site does not differ.  Now, in order to dig up a monumental topic or comment on one of the forums / blog, you will have to dig in the dirt of the overall search results, along with news and advanced SEO-Schnick in the top on a wide fan of requests sites. <br><br>  According to information <a href="https://tjournal.ru/p/blogs-yandex">from TJournal</a> , this step was intentional.  Here is how Yandex support commented on this: <br><br><blockquote>  Search now works only on fresh and relatively fresh records.  This is not a mistake, we intentionally took this step.  Mainly because the overwhelming majority of users are looking fresh, archives are rarely accessed. </blockquote><br>  Previously, Yandex did think to get rid of blog search, but later returned the functionality to the company's general list of services on the main page. <br><br>  Also, this decision partially (or completely, as someone you like more) goes against the company's position regarding the law ‚Äúon the right to oblivion‚Äù, which Yandex representatives explicitly <a href="https://blog.yandex.ru/post/96625/">stated</a> in their blog and even made <a href="http://cache-default05h.cdn.yandex.net/download.cdn.yandex.net/company/Yandex_on_FZ804132-6.pdf">their own conclusion</a> on this issue: <br><br><blockquote>  The bill violates the constitutional right of citizens to seek and receive information.  If the draft law is adopted, the search for a large array of socially significant, as well as reliable information will be difficult. </blockquote><br>  At the same time, the company independently limits its own functionality for searching blog posts.  Well, as they say, the owner-master, the service is his own, but there is a reluctance to spend resources in difficult economic conditions on things that a narrow circle of people and specialists use. <br><br>  Against the background of all that is happening, one of the network users launched a petition on Change.org calling for the Yandex leadership to return everything ‚Äúbackwards‚Äù, that is, not to violate the ‚Äúcohesiveness of the blogosphere‚Äù and not to force users to use the common search again, if they created a highly specialized blog search , which is now, in fact, themselves killed.  Sign the petition <a href="https://www.change.org/p/%25D1%258F%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2585%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">here</a> . <br><br>  For all this there is one logical, self-evident <b>question</b> : gentlemen from Yandex, if you are fighting for the freshness of search results, then why not just fasten the ‚Äúfirst new‚Äù forced filter, with the ability to switch to relevance?  Or is the fact that in the default search the first three links are ads?  I would very much like to see in the comments a detailed response from a company representative, and not a support unsubscribe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267511/</a></p>
