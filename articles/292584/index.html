How about drawing parallels with your business and drawing conclusions?  Word to the author.

      I am a nurse in hospice.  And one thing in my profession really brings me satisfaction.  I can come home and realize that today I worked well.  I respond to the needs of patients and their families, communicating with them with compassion in a calm, unhurried manner.  I have quite tense days, so sometimes I get tired.  On one of these days, like this one, I realized that I don‚Äôt give my patients what they need most: my understanding, support and experience.  In fact, I am deceiving their expectations. <br><br>  I am 100% sure that <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/lozhnaya-sueta-kak-postoyannaya-zanyatost-umenshaet-produktivnost/">productivity</a> , about which they talk so much, is not the main thing in the work of a nurse.  If I have too many tasks, most likely, I will not cope with them in eight hours, which means that I need to choose between quality care for my patients and the needs of my children.  This currently existing nurse‚Äôs work schedule becomes prevalent even here in the hospice.  Although she - is fundamentally wrong!  And I am ashamed, because the end of a person's life must be accompanied by the most careful care and sincere care. <br><br>  I am aware that the ‚Äúwent in and out‚Äù approach helps to adapt to a busy day, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-rabotat-i-ne-zabyvat-pri-etom-zhit/">to save time and energy</a> for home life.  But I feel that this is wrong.  I understand that days like this happen from time to time, but when it becomes the accepted norm, you probably need to think about rethinking the working model of a nurse. <br><br>  Many nurses do schedules or other tasks at extra unpaid time.  When I worked in the hospital, I acted in the same way: I came in early to get acquainted with the patient‚Äôs medical history and be well aware of what he needed.  I had to do this before the start of my shift, because I, like other nurses, ran from floor to floor all my work day.  But I ask myself: why is this considered acceptable?  Why do we follow this particular model, which gives so little professional satisfaction? <br><br>  It is possible that the productivity model is based on financial thrift, but I absolutely do not understand how increasing the productivity of a nurse can save money.  When people in our profession begin to hurry, this leads to mistakes, new medical intervention and an increase in the cost of treatment.  So, here it is the opposite: a nurse should work slowly, but carefully, it is this approach that saves money. <br>  Compassion, kindness, and a desire to serve others - these are the main reasons why I chose the profession of nurse.  I appreciate the science of care, I like to earn income, but the key point is my love for people. <br><br>  I feel frustrated and helpless, I have fallen into the trap of a business model that does not allow me to fully <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/luchshiy-sposob-zadeystvovat-tvorcheskiy-potentsial/">use my potential</a> - a business model that does not honor the needs of patients and their families.  I am powerless working in an industry where income is more important than compassion for a person and his needs.  But in fact, I am not helpless, I have a voice and I will use it to press for changes in the interests of our patients, their families and the society I serve. <br><br>  And how often do we ourselves do not pay enough attention to our customers?  Just due to the fact that initially we choose the quantity to the detriment of quality?  We struggle for productivity, but in fact, as if on purpose, we are doing everything to reduce it, succumbing to common misconceptions ... Maybe it's time to change something? <br><br>  PS We recommend another article that will help to achieve success in the profession, unleash creativity and get satisfaction from what you are doing - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/rabotat-ne-bolshe-a-s-umom-kak-kreativnost-uluchshaet-produktivnost/">‚ÄúWork no more, but wisely: how creativity improves productivity</a> . <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/rabotat-ne-bolshe-a-s-umom-kak-kreativnost-uluchshaet-produktivnost/">‚Äù</a> <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292584/</a></p>
