    <h4>  <b>Justclick</b> </h4><br>  The first resource on our list is JustClick.  Their slogan is ‚ÄúThe best service for maintaining infobusiness on autopilot!‚Äù.  Based on this, their ‚Äútrick‚Äù is precisely in the independence of the system.  Let's see how this is true. <br>  Feature of the service - here we create our online store information products. <br><br>  Registration is very fast and simple - it took me less than a minute to fill out 4 fields and, with willpower, to press the Enter button.  You do not even need to go to the mail and confirm the registration by clicking on the link. <br><br>  For start-up entrepreneurs, whose turnover does not exceed 100 thousand rubles per month, the commission on sales will be 5%.  As turnover increases, the use of a rather confusing pricing system is envisaged, which needs to be dealt with separately. <br><br>  Now we have reached the "chips" of the resource.  Justclick provides you with an online store project where interaction with payment systems is already established.  But creating it is not so easy.  There are no ready-made design options for pages, so you have to understand the html encoding. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bf/84b/9ce/2bf84b9ce6da35d3dabca88e9d5b9f9d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The lack of ready-made templates and a human editor, understandable to the average user, in my opinion, is a huge minus.  Not everyone has the time and desire to understand a bunch of incomprehensible characters. <br><br>  If you managed to deal with the coding of your mini-site, things are easy - to set up a payment method and fill the store with products.  And you can start working. <br><br>  It is not necessary to assess the quality of the design at the level of a personal account, since the guys didn‚Äôt take too much steam on this account - the personal account resembles a regular Word document.  But in terms of content there is nothing to complain about.  The guide is set out fairly accessible.  For <s>dummies</s> strongly inexperienced users have video tutorials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/0f8/533/4a30f85330830cc47d3fdf3a57e76b01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, JustClick has been sharpened for the narrow task of direct selling information.  No other types of infobusiness on it can not be implemented. <br><br><h4>  <b>LPgenerator</b> </h4><br>  LP Generator is a resource not for creating and managing your information business, but for promoting it.  The site is positioning itself as an effective business tool for creating landing pages, a fan page on Facebook, lead generation, etc. <br><br>  What is it and why?  We will explain.  Under the landing page, the authors mean the landing page, i.e.  page where the user gets by clicking on the banner, for example. <br><br>  Developers offer marketing technology that is simple enough: you already have your own website, but you don‚Äôt really understand how to promote your services (or products) with it.  You go to the LP generator, create a landing page there with an advertisement for a particular product, launch an advertising campaign.  The site will target and your proposal will see only the target audience, which it can be potentially interesting. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  LP is a platform that integrates search engine promotion (contextual advertising), SMM, E-mail marketing and mobile marketing. <br><br>  But, in order to understand all the capabilities of the site, it will take more than one hour to sweat.  Information both on the main page and inside the site, in the personal account, differs by an excess of terminology in which the ordinary user is not easy to understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/426/05e/00542605e221f2d64790ef2e20a075f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Suppose we decide to create a landing page.  Scoring the name of the page, choose a template. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/656/1b5/ce16561b5368cc9c83a05b3f6322ad48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Click save ... <br>  And here we are in for a pleasant surprise in the form of a normal, human editor, where each element can be selected / replaced / changed color, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c2/7a9/330/0c27a93304342e39b31dfc84c8400e99.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After playing with the design and launching the page, you can watch the campaign progress through the statistics counters.  The most important thing is to see how many visitors who came to the page made some kind of action on it.  This is the conversion.  The most objective way to evaluate the effectiveness of your created landing page. <br><br>  Ideally, this conversion should be converted (excuse the pun) to live buyers. <br><br>  All this pleasure, of course, is not free.  Payment logic - the more unique visitors you want, the more you pay for it. <br><br><h4>  <b>Seemedia</b> </h4><br>  Seemedia is the only resource that allows you to develop your infobusiness for free.  <a href="http://www.seemedia.pro/">www.seemedia.pro</a> <br><br>  Positioning: SeeMedia is a service for training and webinars.  The functional is divided into three components: conducting webinars, organizing a free e-mail and SMS mailing, and receiving payments from webinar participants (if you decide that your seminars are paid). <br><br>  As it turned out in the process of chaotic moving around the resource, on this site, as well as on the LP Generator, there is also the possibility of promoting info-business on the Internet by creating landing pages. <br><br>  The functionality is very similar: there are templates already customized for design, the ability to view conversion, etc. <br>  In general, there are plenty of possibilities for decoration: there are a lot of templates, and they differ not only in color, but also in style in general. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d7/714/217/3d771421758d8545c96057f543301452.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little more detail on the work with the functionality of the landing page.  In addition to text, you can upload photos and video files to the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd7/fa1/c2e/cd7fa1c2e61709517e7452431e3ba8f7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is important not to forget to upload your logo, instead of the company logo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9d/759/3fc/f9d7593fc2233f109cbaa3feca81bb72.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/529/04e/b04/52904eb040d2b77c07dd66a2677accd8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The organization of SMS sending and receiving payments from webinar participants is carried out through a personal account.  All functionality is accumulated in one place, which is very convenient and witch.  The personal account interface, by the way, is the friendliest of the three resources. <br><br><h4>  <b>Timepad</b> </h4><br>  Event organization is the direct purpose of the TimePad site. <br>  The event can be created in three steps, as shown in the screenshot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4e/55d/e09/a4e55de09ee11af56a5bb49614bf87ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first step is to fill out an event form.  Here, as with any type of registration, you need to fill in the basic items: a title, a short and detailed description, enter data by time, location, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb3/a79/d00/eb3a79d00089c156c2d4c1bfce296800.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The system will even prepare an agreement for the exchange of personal data with the participants, you only need to fill out a small form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e54/a08/507/e54a0850791cc944b6793f3af9530516.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The minus of the site is that the possibilities to somehow somehow, individually arrange the page of your event will not work.  All events organized in timepad will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/785/0a4/cd5/7850a4cd56535ea2753e899772be0c18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second step is to create a registration form for the participants of the event.  Next, you indicate the conditions for participation in your event. <br><br>  To sell tickets through TimePad you need to sign an agreement.  The cost of participation can be indicated without a contract, in this case, users can only register for the event, but cannot immediately pay for it. <br>  At the final stage when publishing a page, you can make it publicly available or closed.  Only users who receive a link to it can register for a closed event. <br><br><h4>  <b>Eventmag</b> </h4><br><br>  Another service to organize and search for interesting events.  We are today interested in only part of the creation of events. <br>  As an individual entrepreneur, you can register using Contact or Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c33/3bb/b8e/c333bbb8e527effea2e8cf4ce30a22f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All tools for organizing events are provided free of charge.  No hidden surcharges are required.  However, this does not mean that the resource is completely free.  The commission from sales nevertheless is. <br>  A portal chip is an electronic ticket that a person receives immediately after payment.  It is fast and convenient. <br>  After registration, we get to the event creation section, fill in the standard form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f9/534/6d0/3f95346d08d61c33c82c0f6d057f52cf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A small distinctive feature of the resource at this stage is the ability to download a mini-banner, set the number of times it will float. <br>  Next you need to determine how, to whom and for how long you will sell tickets.  The commission, as seen in the screenshot, will be 9%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c3/63a/aa0/4c363aaa0f051e70ee1f82c6af5312df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next you want to customize the look of the page.  It took me quite a long time to find the right tab, so especially for the same teapots like me, we‚Äôll focus on that.  When you have saved your event, go to the ‚ÄúMy Events‚Äù section, click on the ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù mini-arrow and then choose ‚ÄúAppearance‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e6/0bf/d62/2e60bfd62b06fd1d3be542aa7125a812.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Wow!  A couple of dozens of color solutions of the event page are at your service.  But honestly, they are all a bit monotonous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2f/2c3/54c/d2f2c354c28d8d2ca4cd2919e7bc9118.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Actually, the conclusion of the foregoing.</b>  <b><b>Eventmag, TimePad and SeeMedia</b> resources are equivalent, since they have similar functionality and capabilities.</b>  <b>Except that the latter is not only a platform for organizing events, but also for broadcasting them (I mean webinars, of course).</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>The tasks of <b>justclick and lg generator</b> are exactly promotion and advertising of your infobusiness.</b>  <b>They can be a good help in matters of marketing.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190612/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190612/</a></p>
