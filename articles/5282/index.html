  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promotional video "New iPod nano".</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day on the apple website came across an advertisement for the ‚Äúnew iPod nano‚Äù: <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/ads/">www.apple.com/ipodnano/ads</a> <br>  Somehow I really liked this ad, everything is so dynamic, colorful, a great combination of colors, the music was chosen correctly.  I did not quite understand and did not at all find that in this new pod a new one, how it differs from all the rest of his relatives.  At the very iPod video, satisfied, very.  True in size, of course, does not compare with the nano, but the video - a huge plus.  So nothing, as it is not great, but how you put next to the nano - so terrified.  To him, by the way, a progressive little cap, a sock like that, socs)) There were seven of them in the set, half handed out, there were only a sullen gray, purple and green, who would not give anyone: P <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Creators</b> <br>  In general, it became very interesting who the creator and how much this wonderful advertisement cost.  And xs who is the creator and how much this miracle advertising cost)).  Half an hour of searching did not give absolutely nothing.  So if someone knows so completely by chance, share)) I just don‚Äôt know how to search at all.  I will collect information. <br>  <b>Songa.</b> <br>  Song, bitch cool)) Really very tired.  Although there are just a few words, but today I went all day and drank a few words.  They say that the song knocked out of the brain it is necessary to learn and sing three times.  At first, I wanted to search by words, and actually did not find anything (well, here I am such a cracker).  Then I decided that there should be a link to the song on the Apple site.  Imagine, she was there on the video page), even half an hour spent on her search, can be considered stupidly lost.  However, not everything is so simple, the angry Apple just gave a link to the iTunes store, where this song is absolutely worth 1.50 Fr (xs what it is, explain).  I began to look for this song, I found it again in half an hour, but for some reason they don‚Äôt allow downloading, so I had to be content to ‚Äúlisten‚Äù with poor quality.  By the way, the song has the following form: <br>  Cut Chemist - The Audience's Listening <br>  I advise everyone to download.  In general, at this particular moment is puzzled by the search. <br><br>  <b>Video.</b> <br>  The video is also at a high level, the colors are super, as I have already said.  He began to look closely and saw members of the notorious gang of black-eyed pies or whatever they were ... I just didn‚Äôt understand if Vergie had just left them, or had they completely broken up?  But this is not the main thing, the main thing is that the main thing I was looking for, i.e.  Old creators and the price of this has not surfaced (( </div>
