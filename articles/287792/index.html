A brief guide for those over 30</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The first part of the posting "How to survive on Lyra.  A brief guide for those over 30 ‚ÄùI published in November last year.  The posting summarized the one-year experience of being actively on LiveInternet and recommending more or less older people how to behave on this rather youth-friendly resource.  After a couple of weeks, the owner of the blog <a href="http://gromkoizaranee.com/">gromkoizaranee.com</a> gave a link to the material in his posting about alternatives to LiveJournal.  A few days later, his post appeared on Habr√©.  In the next couple of days, two and a half thousand people passed through my billowing sandpit. <br><br>  In general, I did not expect that such a sufficiently bayan material would be so useful to those who are still far to 30. They still quote Lyra.  After this material I made a few more postings.  What goes below is the resulting material, which can be interesting to the habra people. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúHow to survive on Lyra.  A brief guide for those who are over 30 ".  Consolidated posting

      This posting is the final of this series.  More (at least this year) I'm not going to write on this topic. <br><br>  What is the dry residue?  What is the main thing in successful blogging on Lear? <br><br>  Still, the main thing - to understand why you are here.  I would single out several options lying between ‚Äúyes, I don‚Äôt know, I decided to start a diary ...‚Äù and ‚ÄúI will become a megapopular blogger and will live with it‚Äù.  In this case, consciously or not, people are looking for two things on the network: communication and information.  Let's start with the information, because communication is just more related to motivation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The bad news.  If you are looking for interesting and useful information, then the Lira blogosphere is not a place where you can quickly find what you are looking for.  Why?  Because: <br><br>  1. The blogosphere is, in principle, a poorly structured area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe network, supersaturated: <br>  - information of a local nature (the details of how someone spent the weekend, I think, will not be too interesting); <br>  - "reprints" from news sites that lose their value very quickly; <br>  - incompetent opinions; <br>  - unverified information; <br>  - profanity. <br><br>  If we consider the quality of blogospheric information, it is significantly lower than what is published on the web portals, not to mention the "solid" publications. <br><br>  You can find pros here, and there is also high-quality information, but it is extremely difficult due to the imperfection of navigation through the blogosphere.  Tags and other features of Web 2.0 work in a very peculiar way (if anything - be careful with tagging your text with these tags).  If you need information and competent advice, it is better to go to the forums of thematic sites.  Say for the MMORPG (Everquest 2) I have not found good blogs and online gamers pile up mainly on specialized sites.  Another interesting fact is that among my co-guilds (more than 50 people) no one regularly blogs.  The fact is indicative. <br><br>  In order to navigate and find blogs that are worth attention, I recommend to subscribe to the community Interesting blogs and Golden Blogs <br><br>  2. The Liru segment is aimed at young people and popular topics among young users: <br>  - popular music, movies, movies; <br>  - the life of "stars"; <br>  - the life of young people (school-institutes-dnyuhi-unhappy love-loss of virginity- next in the list); <br>  - incomprehensible for those "who are over 30" youth subcultures (emo, goths, etc.); <br><br>  3. The design of the main pages of Lear is more focused on media content (photos, videos, music, etc.), rather than as a search engine (although there are also these elements).  Details on this are described in the first part of the ‚ÄúQuick Guide‚Äù. <br><br>  Now regarding communication. <br><br>  If you belong to the category of ordinary users, ‚Äúkazualov‚Äù, who simply want to have a warm company for communication and you are not concerned about popularity, then in principle is a good place.  30-40 people for a pleasant pastime you will find here without any problems.  Use the tips in the first part of this guide.  Guaranteed you'll have your own in this environment. <br><br>  As a free network site where you can post the fruits of your work or just life notes, the Lear platform is also a good place.  The interface is more convenient than on the same LiveJournal and you can pour everything you want here without any restrictions.  You do not have to pay for hosting and website development, and it‚Äôs also easier to gain an audience here than to promote a stand-alone platform. <br><br>  If you have far-reaching plans for the blogosphere, then be prepared for hard work and many not very pleasant moments. <br><br>  In addition to the ability to make interesting posts, one must master the difficult art of PR.  Difficult, because it is a delicate matter and setting yourself a goal to get into the elite of the blogosphere, you will surely stumble upon local authorities with experience.  I can‚Äôt say that there is a lot of competition here, but some of the top-ranked guys are bad.  They may lightly bite if you behave in the wrong way. <br><br>  In addition, you should definitely learn how to read statistics.  This will give you an understanding of where and why goes to your site.  It will also give you an understanding of who comes to you and how to behave with him / her.  Do not neglect this powerful tool. <br><br>  Be prepared for the fact that your successful postings will steal.  ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù copy-pasting is a mass phenomenon and not yet punishable. Be prepared for the fact that from time to time you will be approached by trolls and scoring trades to postings with outright insults. <br><br>  The last thing to do here is not recommended (based on personal experience). <br><br>  1. Do not remember the name of the blogger in vain.  One unsuccessful sentence or phrase - and the blogger (friends) of this blogger will come running to kill you for ‚Äúbad‚Äù behavior (even if you behaved well).  I received for it on the cap more than once (and deserved a couple of times), ... <br><br>  2. Do not intervene in other people's disassembly.  Especially in the top blogs.  They still make up their hands, and you will have a reputation as Flamera and Fluder. <br><br>  3. Do not seek to gain popularity by any available methods.  I‚Äôve been reading a lot of articles about bloggers who got two or three thousand to a blog in just a couple of months.  You can also do this without any problems; you do not even need to be able to write interestingly.  The question is who will your audience be?  Crowd, istaptyuyu blog blunt comments or someone more reasonable.  Be patient. <br><br>  Actually everything.
