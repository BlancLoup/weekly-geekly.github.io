Great review of the IV international IT conference "Strike"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e00/07a/d09/e0007ad0953645af96a025f3758cdbca.jpg"><br><br>  For the fourth time, an event took place in Ulyanovsk, which cannot be missed if the Internet has become a work space for you.  On April 10 - 11, 2015, the <a href="http://nastachku.ru/">international IT conference "Strike" was held</a> , which, under its slogan Stop working!  gathered 3,500 participants from 50 regions of Russia, as well as guests from the USA, France, Germany, Austria, Belarus, Iraq (yes, a whole delegation from Basra), and became one of the country's largest industrial conferences, approaching the level of the capital RIF + CIB <br><br>  Representatives of a wide variety of professions gathered at the Strike at the Lenin Memorial: serious programmers, green IT students, bearded owners of web studios and Internet agencies, energetic Internet entrepreneurs, sleek Internet marketers, and beautiful SMM players.  Yes, anyone here just can not meet!  The main thing that united this bright crowd was the desire to get the maximum amount of practical knowledge, which can be applied in the work the very next day.

      6 sections, 8 halls, 130 experts, 142 reports, 5 master classes and 6 round tables - these are the figures of the ‚ÄúStrikes‚Äù in 2015.  And now about everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Digital insights: crisis and performance marketing </h4><br>  The digital communications section has firmly taken the place of one of the leaders at the conference.  Supervises the section and selects speakers <b>Nikolai Fetyukhin</b> , CEO of MST Agency and one of the organizers of the "Strikes".  This year, <b>Andrey Terekhov</b> personally took part in the preparation and moderation, a person known to everyone in the digital world.  Such cooperation could not fail, the program was the best in the history of the conference.  The hall allocated for this section was clearly not enough, people sat on the stage, on the floor, stood in the doorway and crowded in the corridor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4f/40d/de2/f4f40dde2fce4b88ac1640bd2069336c.jpg"><br><br>  According to the participants, the most fun speakers gather in this section.  In digital, no creative is impossible, although with this sometimes problems arise.  Inimitable <b>Vitaly Bykov</b> from Red Keds shared his personal recipe for motivating creative employees.  Money, food and real estate - shake up, but do not mix.  His report on the ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù was about the proportions and how to use these tools, so that the output would be advertising, like Red Keds. <br><br>  Work with creative people, namely with designers - fragile and vulnerable creatures, was also devoted to the report of <b>Ilya Avdeev</b> , art director CreativePeople.  Ilya told how to set the task correctly and then evaluate the result so that the designer does not become depressed and the project does not lose the fighter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/cb4/d8a/d33cb4d8a8a24d4baee944176227cbba.jpg"><br><br>  Most of the reports were focused on the internal problems of Internet agencies and web studios.  The company's strategy, work with business processes, rebranding, personnel shortage were discussed by the Director General of Pirogov's Bureau <b>Yevgeny Chernov</b> , <b>Nikolay Okhitin</b> , Managing Director of Dr. Jung, and General Director of the leading Siberian digital agency Wow <b>Nikolay Glukhikh</b> . <br><br>  <b>Anatoly Denisov</b> , the chief editor of CMSmagazine, shared his view on the agency‚Äôs anti-crisis pricing.  In his opinion, increasing the cost of services is not the best measure to fight for the client, it is much more efficient to work on reducing costs. <br><br>  By the way, no matter how much they say that the crisis was not in the market, but in the head, he had a serious influence on the program of the section.  <b>Alexander Grigoriev</b> from Ingate Development spoke about finding clients in a crisis.  Pro crisis management marketing - <b>Anatoly Emelyanov</b> (ONETOUCH).  The crisis in the digital communications market was dedicated to a separate round table.  The leaders of the largest Internet agencies discussed the current situation and trends in the development of the digital services market for 2015 - 2016. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7d/7e8/78c/d7d7e878cba840eebcd8adf31dec32e0.jpg"><br><br>  But <b>Alexey Ramensky</b> (‚ÄúTagline‚Äù) had his own opinion on this matter.  ‚ÄúThe lack of ideas and drive is where your real crisis is,‚Äù he denied previous speakers.  By the way, his report was called. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/846/89d/25e84689d8e04df68f9e84a10fb2b927.jpg"><br><br>  Part of the speeches was focused on customers of online agencies.  Those who were on the report of <b>Andrei Terekhov</b> from RUWARD now know what the price of the project consists of and how to understand what you are overpaying for.  Charismatic <b>Vladimir Zavertaylov</b> , CEO of Sibiriks, shared his case studies when post-release support for the project was extremely expensive for customers, but ended with a file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49c/07e/a25/49c07ea2505b44d7b796616ff8467ad7.jpg"><br><br>  About the work tools of internet marketers talked on the second day.  Have you ever seen that the topic is not laid out on the shelves, and collected in the cake?  <b>Alexey Ezhikov</b> (RUWARD / AG &amp; AT) baked a delicious cake from the most effective techniques and techniques of Internet marketing.  It should be noted, a very unusual approach. <br><br>  <b>Daniil Filin</b> (MOST Creative Club) shared his knowledge in the field of online projects integrated with offline. <br><br>  This year, two ‚Äúsharks‚Äù working with social media spoke about their SMM practice - <b>Andrei Volkov</b> from GRAPE and <b>Elena Kupriyanova</b> from Artucul Media.  They promote famous brands on social networks, so if you don‚Äôt get into their reports, bite your elbows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/290/517/bfb/290517bfb2814ee98abc63ca8af93ebb.jpg"><br><br>  And of course, it is impossible not to mention the two speeches that have touched the trendy topic of performance-based marketing.  Funny guys from Reaspekt <b>Ravil Sabirov</b> and <b>Andrey Anisimov</b> told about the principles of work for the result, and <b>Nikolay Fetyukhin</b> from MST Agency - about analytics and result measurement tools. <br><br>  In general, the program of the section turned out to be saturated, not boring and trendy.  Go ahead. <br><br><h4>  SEO, context: keeping abreast </h4><br>  A few words need to be said about another direction of digital communications - search engine optimization, analytics and contextual advertising.  A separate room was allocated for them, which, by the way, was never empty.  What was interesting to hear here? <br><br>  For example, <b>Vasily Tkachev</b> (All in Top) revealed the secret that links still work, although Yandex seems to have canceled them.  About the return of search engine optimization sites told <b>Ivan Nikitin</b> ("Ivan Nikitin and partners").  The focus of the speakers was monopolization of search results, independent development of the semantic core, ROI calculation in contextual advertising, SEO in the region, filters and sanctions for 2015. <br><br><blockquote>  Ivan Nikitin: ‚ÄúIt was nice to meet our clients from Moscow at the performance.  Finally met them personally.  They came to Ulyanovsk specifically to understand the issues of search engine optimization, because they had heard about the quality of the conference's SEO program. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e3/b67/7c3/0e3b677c3dc54f1c8290306df62641d4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Content Marketing in Action </h4><br>  The ‚ÄúContent‚Äù section has become completely new for the IT conference.  It's no secret that content owns the Internet.  How to create it?  <b>Pavel Trubetskov</b> , director of development at Simtech Development and curator of the section, gathered the most famous masters of content generation and its monetization. <br><br>  <b>Anatoly Denisov</b> , chief editor of CMSmagazine, regularly travels to conferences, voicing the results of the research.  But it was only on ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù that he first talked about his projects CMSmagazine and Rating Runet.  How did a small editorial team manage to create an authoritative resource where every second head of a web studio or agency wants to go with his article?  Why did the Runet Rating become popular, and the traffic from it provides the studio with work for the whole year?  What is needed to repeat this success?  Anatoly covered all these issues in his report, which is extremely interesting for any blogger or journalist who dreams of creating a media resource. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/bc8/5ed/1dabc85ed8734c9f9e7e607481880eca.jpg"><br><br>  Another premiere of ‚ÄúStrikes‚Äù is a report by <b>Andrey Terekhov</b> (RUWARD) about creating a personal brand.  In the digital world, Andrei knows everything.  By generously handing out useful information, he achieved that his name now helps to promote any project for which he undertakes, be it RUWARD, Inforza or Digital-cluster.  This is a unique personal experience, which is customary to be silent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d9/646/cf1/1d9646cf16f44329a95e225abb5df124.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Alexey Ponomar was</b> broadcasting from Koh Samui via Skype.  5 years ago, he was engaged in the development of the project "Lifehacker".  Then very few people believed that an information resource is capable of making a profit.  Today, this resource is visited by more than 3.5 million people per month, and, apparently, it is well monetized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/93a/9c5/ad8/93a9c5ad82d74a6fa463960b22bbb6a2.jpg"><br><br>  Approximately this was the occupancy of the hall on his report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/acc/e0f/3cd/acce0f3cd65f43d9b0c2d288a3b622dd.jpg"><br><br>  The charismatic speaker <b>Rodion Scriabin</b> from Netology introduced him to systematic work in the field of one of the most trending areas in content marketing - working with a video channel that will allow you to live without active advertising.  The presentation of his report is available <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/RodionSkryabin/ss-46929956">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/342/68a/24e/34268a24e4094a32a15ef8371de5fb63.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Oleg Vlasenko</b> from Simbirsoft considered a unique project case that allowed several companies in the region to solve the shortage of human resources for the IT business. <br><br>  Was on the "strike" case and about the unsuccessful experience of generating content.  <b>Ekaterina Shukalova</b> from the Internet Agency "Firth" told about her content project in the beauty industry, why he did not shoot, and what lessons they learned from this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a30/075/7de/a300757de131448fbffbd9fde38abf58.jpg"><br><br>  The section was completed by a truly deep master class for 2.5 hours from <b>Peter Ponomarev</b> (Greensales), the guru of content marketing in the field of e-commerce.  Peter forced the audience to take a fresh look at the use of content in online sales.  He told that in the USA it has been practicing for a long time, and in Russia it is only emerging: how to get out of price competition and form a truly loyal customer base, which can be sold for a long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ee/19b/44c/7ee19b44c09a43f5a2d0b11ba3a402e2.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Internet of Things, Core OS, PostCSS and other trends of the technical section </h4><br>  <b>Kirill Mokevnin</b> , technical director of Hexlet.io, again became the curator of the technical section.  The program of the section was enriched with strong and diverse reports not only of Muscovites, but also of professionals from the regions, which have become no less than 53. <br><br>  No wonder the conference "Strike" has the proud status of international.  The second year in a row here comes a big foreign guest.  This year, <b>Laurent Ellerbach</b> from Microsoft's European office became the headliner.  Although it was announced in the technical section, non-technical specialists were also interested in his presentation on the Internet of Things - the large hall of the Lenin Memorial with 1,200 seats was filled.  Laurent's report was an unusual sight: the Frenchman spoke English and showed slides in Russian, carefully prepared by the Russian office of Microsoft.  The presentation of his report is available <a href="http://1drv.ms/1IPH8sn">in Russian and English</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/601/72b/06a/60172b06a3004767882c94fd6c157552.jpg"><br><br>  Traditionally, the most positive feedback comes from <b>Andrei Aksenov</b> from Sphinx Technologies Inc.  This time, Andrew prepared two reports and both hit the top "Strikes 2015".  In the first, he expressed the opinion that an IT specialist should know: a little about everything, and not all about a little.  Programming is very narrow and very broad at the same time: on the one hand, there are very few fundamental data structures and algorithms, and on the other hand, there are a lot of tasks and special techniques.  The second report was devoted to the economics of open source products and the method of their monetization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37d/7f9/392/37d7f9392881446f92b151929c0ad9e5.jpg"><br><br>  The topic of highload systems has been raised.  <b>Oleg Bunin</b> ("Ontiko"), a recognized Russian expert in the field of high Internet loads, revealed a step-by-step algorithm for their design and development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36c/918/74a/36c91874ae5b437b92143bbe05245d61.jpg"><br><br>  Walked on the issues of working with databases.  <b>Dmitry Emanov</b> from FirebirdSQL spoke about working with his database.  <b>Podolsky Daniel</b> (Git in Sky) touched on the topic NoSQL.  <b>Andrei Kumanyaev</b> (Coub) made a devastating report on PostgreSQL. <br><br>  They did not forget about the development of cloud systems, namely about the global cloud trends and the use of the cloud backend for mobile platforms.  This was told by <b>Vladimir Yunev</b> , another guest from Microsoft, a company expert in the field of web development and cloud technologies. <br><br>  Futuristic mood added <b>Alexander Roznov</b> (Undev).  He introduced Core OS - the future of cluster operating systems.  The use of this OC is still a mystery, but perhaps in a year, already on the next Strike, many reports will be devoted to this topic. <br><br>  <b>Anton Pleshivtsev</b> , remembered to the participants of the last ‚ÄúStrikes‚Äù in an interesting report on the creation of a ticket booking service Aviasales.ru, this time spoke about the implementation of the language of natural language processing in the service of parsing phrases.  Now Aviasales.ru can find tickets for any user requests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92c/298/a60/92c298a607654e5a80c08a628e836af5.jpg"><br><br>  We were pleased with the reports on the front-end development.  For example, <b>Andrei Sitnik</b> from Evil Martians spoke about the need to abandon preprocessors and move to PostCSS.  Novosibirsk colleague from 2gis Timofey Chaptykov talked a lot about the design of interfaces, the use of active elements. <br><br>  By the way, this year map services were presented by 2gis, Yandex.Maps and Sputnik.  The most inquisitive, who reached the 4th floor of the Lenin Memorial, were able to get to <b>Vsevolod Shmyrov's</b> master class and develop their own map of the game world using the Yandex.Maps API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/a03/545/f72a035457264934968e461b797da538.jpg"><br><br>  This year, testing, security, and Arduino information was added to the program.  <b>Alexander Serbul</b> (1C-Bitrix) after the report answered questions for a long time.  His presentation was devoted to testing complex systems.  After <b>Vasily Zhuravsky‚Äôs</b> story (FutureLab) about Arduino, even a child probably wanted to study it. <br><br>  By the way, there are more children this year on reports.  It is not so much about schoolchildren (they became obligatory participants of the ‚ÄúStrikes‚Äù), as about toddlers.  IT industry is getting younger in the eyes :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/100/0fb/b70/1000fbb703624868a03d2a7eea69bbba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80f/626/efb/80f626efbb6b424f945898ba206c0fff.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/539/061/f06/539061f0675546c9be8faa7a037dbcaf.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Management and IT Education </h4><br>  Section "Management" is very close to the technical.  It covers the issues of creating products, scaling them, project and team management. <br><br>  The special invited guest in this section was <b>Aleksey Troshin</b> (B2B Center).  He arrived with a report on approaches that help to speed up development significantly and successfully complete the project with one hundred percent accuracy.  These are factors of planning, technology, psychology, presentation, prioritization, and many others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7c/10a/a8a/a7c10aa8ad3e46bdb9fa5e464e9addb6.jpg"><br><br>  Last year, <b>Mikhail Tabunov</b> talked about his experience in managing the Coub video-loop video service in conditions of rapid growth, and in this he brought a report on the rules of an excellent developer. <br><br>  We talked about the experience of creating services and companies.  For example, <b>Askar Rakhimberdiev</b> (‚ÄúMy warehouse‚Äù) talked about the development of a cloud service.  And <b>Dmitry Voropayev</b> from ‚ÄúTrilan‚Äù shared his story of founding a company without initial capital. <br><br>  Business angels love to visit the strike.  Where else can you find so many burning eyes and fresh ideas?  <b>Daria Komarkova</b> , CEO &amp; Founder of the MSU Business Incubator, put all the sources of financing for projects on the shelves, suggested how to choose the right one and answered the questions of young startups and distributed business cards long after the report.  She promised to come next year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98b/53f/996/98b53f996cc54ad693b0a3ee0b646615.jpg"><br><br>  A cutting-edge theme at the ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù was education in the field of information technology.  There are not enough employees in the IT field.  Personnel hunger inhibits business development.  The problem is solved with the help of close cooperation of companies, universities and schools.  Companies formulate requirements for future specialists, higher education institutions graduate more qualified and demanded personnel, and schools provide a continuous stream of applicants for the required specialties, involving students in IT from primary school.  Something like this should look like an ideal IT personnel development scheme in Russia, discussed at the round table ‚ÄúProblems of IT education in a crisis‚Äù. <br><br>  The parade was led by <b>Oleg Vlasenko</b> , chief of personnel at SimbirSoft, a teacher at the faculty of information systems and technologies at Ulyanovsk State Technical University.  In order to gather representatives of three parties in one place, he organized a separate direction within the ‚ÄúManagement‚Äù section. <br><br>  Here, <b>Viktor Negoda</b> , the legendary teacher of the FIST of UlSTU, spoke on how to lure talented school students to the IT sphere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b21/bdb/95d/b21bdb95d5c2466eb5c7f38ebd040d35.jpg"><br><br>  The prospects of school informatics were discussed.  Guest from the Ministry of Communications and <b>Mass Media of</b> Russia <b>Anton Korenyushkin</b> spoke about the current state policy in the field of IT education. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Looking Glass </h4><br>  The curator of the mobile section, <b>Elena Stolbova</b> , CMO Atlantic Corporation, prepared 17 reports for fans of the development of mobile applications and games.  The emphasis in the section was on the management of mobile applications. <br><br>  <b>Andrash Gusti</b> , the head of the studio ‚ÄúBegemot-Behemoth‚Äù, arrived with a provocative report ‚ÄúAh, user story, heartless trainer.‚Äù  Already from the title it is clear that the talk was about user story as the fundamental principle of creating mobile application design: how to kill a project without making user story, what are user cases, when they are needed and how to do them correctly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/419/80b/608/41980b6088f541e882493a62ed4c0aaa.jpg"><br><br>  Not without success stories.  If you visited the report of <b>Maxim Mikheenko</b> , art-producer of FOX3D Studios, now you know how to get to Steam.  He told about the main stages of the development of the project Subnautica, awarded feature and first place in the ranking of new games in the section Early Access (Steam).  <b>Maria Kravtsova</b> , Indie-developer, Message Quest gamewriter, shared her personal zero-budget game development history. <br><br>  About what is happening with iBeacon, <b>Sergey Kolpakov</b> , sales director of the company Bunch, touched. <br><br>  Separately, it should be noted a master class "Journey of a Hero" from <b>Ilya Kurylev</b> , the founder of Gamification Now!  He considered how to design a landing page, service, product, or even an advertising campaign in order to maximize the involvement of the user in the project and, imperceptibly for him, lead to the target action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9e/fc7/af3/b9efc7af33834166b5b64fcdde7c2d86.jpg"><br><br>  It is impossible not to touch on the technical reports targeted directly at the developers.  <b>Ivan Chashkin</b> , team lead of the Mail.Ru Group mobile development team, spoke about the ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù of mobile application development.  <b>Andrei Kulakov</b> , team lead Undev - about the NativeScrip framework for writing mobile applications with native UI in JavaScript.  XiMAD developer <b>Alexey Klyuchnikov</b> - how to get rid of persistent database dependencies in mobile games. <br><br><h4>  100% natural e-commerce </h4><br>  Who will tell better about e-commerce than the owners of real online stores?  <b>Kamil Kalimullin</b> , curator of the section, general director of AdvantShop.NET and co-organizer of Strikes, invited practitioners of online stores from the case-club "100% natural e-commerce".  The section has grown 2 times and has become at least 2 times more interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f31/acd/e53/f31acde5308d468c9ccc436fad272350.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f1/f03/403/1f1f034039264c688f79eac89bf0f58d.jpg"><br><br>  If you are involved in the development of electronic business, you should definitely listen to <b>Guy Karapetyan</b> , director of marketing for RealXenon.ru.  This time he spoke about the most important metrics of the online store: the cost of attracting an order (SRO) and the number of orders for this CPO.  Also about the analytics was an interesting report from <b>Yuri Batievsky</b> from Antop.  Listeners attacked him with questions on call recording and call tracking.  Apparently, this topic in the context of analytics was the most urgent. <br><br>  The call center was organized by a report from another e-commerce practice by <b>Mikhail Semenkov</b> , co-owner of projects lilitop.ru, toybunch.ru, azhelp.ru.  Since the main competence of an online store is sales, it is very important to have an internal contact center, and not to outsource this function.  <b>Olga Zagoskina</b> from ‚ÄúBoutique Boffo‚Äù supported the idea and continued it: ‚ÄúSales scripts are a method that does not suit well the online store.
