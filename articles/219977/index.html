      Just below - about the history of the creation of all these books. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Secrets of managing programmers </h5><br>  I wrote this book in 2007, when I was working at Intel.  And the story was very simple.  I worked as a manager for 5 years, I was very interested in the topic, I shoveled a lot of literature from Joel Spolsky to Peter Drucker, from Jack Welch to Mikhail Litvak, I experimented with my teams ... <br><br>  As a result, a certain picture of the managerial world formed in my head, which at that time seemed to me to be correct.  I decided to hold a small online seminar on this topic.  Suddenly 50 people signed up with whom we worked for two weeks.  And according to the results, the book ‚ÄúSecrets of managing programmers‚Äù was born. <br><br>  Special thanks to the Publishing House Williams, who then published it, because the book is small.  And many publishers said in plain text: add volume.  And I didn‚Äôt want to add water ... But in 2013 the rights to the book came back to me and now there is an opportunity to lay it out for everyone. <br><br><h5>  How to become a manager in IT </h5><br>  In 2009, we with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/slavapankratov/" class="user_link">SlavaPankratov</a> made the first joint project - the online training ‚ÄúHow to become a manager in IT‚Äù.  Slava at that time was still working at Yandex in Kiev, he had his own history of rapid growth as a technology director.  I didn‚Äôt have my own fast story :), but at Intel I was conducting internal training in Transition To Manager. <br><br>  In general, we decided to see how popular the topic was and made a free webinar.  Suddenly, 400 people came to listen to him.  We still communicate with many listeners.  Many have already become not only managers, but directors of divisions and companies.  And according to the results of the webinar was born a book. <br><br>  And we have been working with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/slavapankratov/" class="user_link">SlavaPankratov</a> for 5 years and still can‚Äôt stop.  :) <br><br><h5>  Black book manager </h5><br>  Business coaches often fly conferences.  At some point, I decided to hang our badges on the wall in the St. Petersburg office - it turned out quite well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4e/42d/6e0/f4e42d6e0cbd3c8d9cf71e2d0bd72bdc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And in 2011 we flew to Novosibirsk to the CodeFest conference.  (By the way, if someone was not at CodeFest - our recommendations. One of the best Russian IT conferences, by organization, by reports, and by atmosphere. Very cool, really.) <br><br>  So, we flew on CodeFest.  And while I was sleeping peacefully in the chair, SlavaPankratov took and wrote a small book.  Black book manager - obscenely-provocative monologue of the director of the company in relation to the manager, vaccination against chmoshnosti. <br><br>  The book has become our most popular product - more than 20,000 downloads, many people sent inside companies.  Recently, a St. Petersburg company ordered a small circulation from us to give to customers.  :) <br><br><h5>  White bookshelf manager </h5><br>  After the release of the Black Book of the Manager, at each conference I began to receive at least three questions: ‚ÄúSasha, and where is the manager‚Äôs white paper.‚Äù  It happened in our duet that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/slavapankratov/" class="user_link">SlavaPankratov</a> is big and noisy, and I am bald and polite. <br><br>  And there was no time for a new book.  At the same time, I continued to write articles in my blog.  And at some point I realized that the white book was in fact already written.  After that, all the articles in the blog for 5 years were collected and divided into 9 categories: <br><ul><li>  Career </li><li>  Communication </li><li>  Money </li><li>  Delegation, decision making, reports </li><li>  Interviewing, Recruiting </li><li>  Leadership </li><li>  Meetings </li><li>  Public performance </li><li>  How to write letters </li></ul><br><br>  It turned out 9 books - just the white bookshelf of the manager. <br><br><h5>  Management tools </h5><br>  We are big fans of management tools.  Matrices 2 by 2, three circles, 4 questions about this and 5 questions about that - we love simple models that clearly show various management problems and techniques. <br><br>  For 7 years of training activities of such models a couple of dozens have accumulated.  And in the fall of 2013, the idea arose to clothe it in the form of articles and publish it on Habr√©. <br><br>  Honestly, there were doubts, because before that we hadn‚Äôt been able to communicate with the Habrovo people.  But the articles were unexpectedly popular.  And here, of course, thank you so much for accepting them so well.  In summary, the first 7 of them, we have combined into a separate book: <br><ul><li>  How to explain when you feel one place? </li><li>  Andragogue Practitioner Tips: How We Learn </li><li>  How to play non-linear chess </li><li>  Why do customers demand silly reports? </li><li>  5 questions to clarify the purpose or why you need a BMW X5? </li><li>  4 principles of constructive communication, or why we live in the mode of achievement? </li><li>  4-phase algorithm for solving problems with people or ‚ÄúWhat do you want if you're such a crap manager?‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  And if you have a couple of hours to deal with all the management tools, then we have a free video course on this topic: <a href="http://stratoplan.ru/tools/">‚ÄúManagement tools: system management on the fingers‚Äù</a> . <br><br><h5>  Why books for registration? </h5><br>  In fact, this is our standard scheme.  We write articles, conduct webinars, speak at conferences.  And we post all our free products in exchange for an e-mail.  Why is that?  Open the card, there are no secrets. <br><br>  We like to communicate with those who are interested in what we do.  Therefore, after registration, we send other useful materials, report on our paid programs, make special good offers that we do not do in public, and try to respond to every letter that our subscribers write to us. <br><br>  Probably, we are somewhere dinosaurs that communicate with people by e-mail, and not in social networks, but we like it.  :) Of course, you can unsubscribe at any time, without any problems, but many of our subscribers have been with us for 4, 5 years - for which we thank them separately, we know many by name.  :) <br><br>  By the way, the nearest good offer is scheduled just for April 21 - if you sign up for books, you will definitely not miss it.  :) <br><br>  Friends, if there are any questions or comments on the books - write here or write us at mail@stratoplan.ru, we will be happy to talk with you.  Happy reading and good weekend! <br><br>  PS You may ask, and where does Iron Man.  Yes, God knows, just like the picture.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219977/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219977/</a></p>
