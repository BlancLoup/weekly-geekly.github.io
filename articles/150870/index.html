And after a week I found time to sit down with a translator and work hard to write a less tolerable letter to this company.  True, they didn‚Äôt answer me soon, but in pure Russian (which made me happy), and after a couple of days of correspondence I was informed that the order was made and will be sent soon.  True, I had to wait a long time (thanks to one organization that deals with this in our country).  But when hope began to melt slowly, and the holiday was approaching, I finally got my desired battery for the old <a href="">Dell Streak 5</a> with a capacity of 4,800 mA / h (in the title I rounded up for beauty, see more <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/dell/dell-streak/mugen-power-4800mah-extended-battery-for-dell-streak-m01m.html">here</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cec/cc3/a26/ceccc3a2621e6d1145c6c656b282fc9e.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As it is not surprising, the kindness of the Chinese did not end only on the battery, and two covers went in the kit at once.

So, I had to go on the train for 2 days and at that time I wanted to entertain myself somehow and not only as far as possible, so before leaving I was bothering to download more movies and books.  The first day passed quite calmly using 3G and reading books, on the second day 4 films lasting from 1 to 2 hours were watched and, what struck me, the device after that ate only 40% of the charge (as standard the film), as it turned out, the dignity did not end there, since I had been on the Internet all evening and one at night and had time to read a 500-page book during the trip.  Fortunately, arriving at the place of rest (and this is half an hour by car) and sorting things out, I pressed the power button and saw the joyful screen of the graphic key (then I first thought something like ‚ÄúTHIS IS YES!‚Äù), As the green robot showed, about 23% more, but just in case I decided to charge it all the same.  In my daily rest, I didn‚Äôt really care about charging because I was driving around on various excursion routes, of course, after three days of very active use of 3G, he still gave up.  After a week of rest in the south of Russia, but far from the sea, a collective meeting with the host side sent us to the sea accompanied by a car, and then I got the idea to check the lifetime in navigator mode.  For this, I downloaded Yandex navigator and we went.  The journey took 10 hours and during that time I got used to the monotonous ‚ÄúOksana‚Äù mumbling, which showed the way, on arrival my old man showed 20% of the charge.  Perhaps the way back was easier for Dell, because it discussed past trips and planned vacations.  In which I probably will take with me a phone only with a battery of increased capacity. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Despite the rigorous mathematics, the device works more than three times longer.  The only weak point is the fragile plastic from which the covers are made.  With a price of about 4,000 rubles.  he completely discourages the money spent. <br>  PS I thank the company <a href="http://www.mugen-power-batteries.ru/">Mugen Power</a> for providing the battery. <br>  PSS Many thanks to the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kraleksandr/" class="user_link">kraleksandr</a> , who did the Titanic work, and even at one in the morning, showed me the mistakes.  By the way, the links were corrected for the Russian-language site, and a link was added directly to the battery itself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150870/</a></p>
