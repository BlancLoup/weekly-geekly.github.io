  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ISEF Israel, or a few words about our children who live in Israel and are preparing to raise local high-tech</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of March, he flew to Israel on business, and at the invitation of Kobi Bahar from Israeli Intel drove into Jerusalem, where the final of the Israeli ISEF was held.  Who does not know, ISEF is the International Science and Engineering Fair, a competition where young men and women of 13-18 years of age exhibit their engineering and scientific projects.  He appeared in the United States in 1950, and in 1996 Intel became its general sponsor.  Today, the numbers look very convincing - more than 50 participating countries, the prize fund of four million dollars a year.  As far as I know, children are not given bags with cash, but they do not stint scholarships and awards. <br><br>  Russian schoolchildren in ISEF have been participating since 1998 and quite successfully.  But it‚Äôs easy to get to the Russian part of the competition if you know who to ask.  But on the Israeli leg of the Russian journalist has not stepped even once.  Meanwhile, the guys there are going to be extremely talented, and a good half of them speak Russian.  Former our people, so to speak. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I wrote a <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/intel_isef_israel/">big report on 3Dnews</a> on the topic <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/intel_isef_israel/">, if you are interested - take a look</a> .  And here are some photos with comments.

It works, however, not very quickly, on the Internet through this technology you can not walk, but the voice is transmitted perfectly.  The radiation is so insignificant that, consider, it is not there at all.  Got the third place. <br><br>  Two Jerusalem guys - and also from improvised means - made an electronic guide dog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b87/69c/f19/b8769cf190f870d4d11a3be951c55f03.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is not only that tracks the road, so also with a cell phone in conjunction working SMS reads out loud.  It is not necessary to wash the paws, combing the wool too.  I charged the battery once a day and that's it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bc1/052/3a7/bc10523a75282127036f495cbfaaff5c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In principle, nothing prevents in time to add to the design a full-fledged GPS-navigation.  Voice, of course.  The price of the design, as they say, is dramatically lower than that of a real dog. <br><br>  The following photo is a wonderful antenna that can solve the problem of the emergence of "dead zones" in the room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/069/e8c/17b/069e8c17bdfe25264e78b512679c1a6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And these are just two beautiful girls :) They came up with a system that turns subtitles in cartoons into sign language.  Children with hearing problems will appreciate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1c/542/c60/a1c542c60c9f88fe0db486ed306195a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Tellingly, Shlomit (left) is from Samara, and Liza is from Kharkov. <br><br>  The winners of the competition were hosted by the President of Israel Shimon Peres at his residence.  In the photo with him, Adi Friedman, winner of the Israeli ISEF final.  She invented a polymer, which produces notable alternatives to intervertebral disc prostheses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/403/164/f62/403164f622b0a4756c0af523fdd3a769.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And another story without a picture.  Three guys showed at the competition rescue boat.  It floats itself, does not need manual control, is guided by GPS.  I ask the boys: and you, sorry, software, how are you planning to write?  He, the dog, is complicated. <br><br>  And they modestly answer: well, yes, difficult, so the Israel Defense Forces (Tsakhal) gave us the source code for the software from the past generation of drones.  We twirled it, and everything works fine. <br><br>  Ok right  That's what I understand working with young people ... <br><br>  More pictures and stories on the topic <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/intel_isef_israel/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90781/</a></p>
