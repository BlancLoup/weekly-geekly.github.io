  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Media - The fourth power. What about responsibility?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps, after reading this topic, you say that I am paranoid.  I will not argue.  But first things first. <br><br>  Today I read the following article on the site of the newspaper ‚ÄúVzglyad‚Äù: <a href="http://vz.ru/society/2007/10/28/120502.html">http://vz.ru/society/2007/10/28/120502.html</a> .  This article about the fact that resources on earth is becoming less and less is not enough for everyone.  The article is based on another article published in The Times.  The most interesting thing is that the links to the original were not given.  What alerted me. <br><br>  First read with interest.  Then he began to catch himself thinking that strange things were written. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, how can you calculate the exact date when the planet Earth reached the ‚Äúpoint of no return‚Äù in terms of resources?  To do this, at a minimum, you need to know exactly how much resources are consumed per day and how much exactly the resources left on earth.  Then I saw the translation of the name of a foreign organization, and I had a suspicion that it was a trick somewhere.  Judge for yourself.  I quote: <br><blockquote>  At least, experts of two authoritative organizations believe so: the American Global Trace Network and the British New Economy Fund. </blockquote><br>  How it was possible to translate Global Trace Network as a ‚ÄúGlobal Footprint Network‚Äù is completely incomprehensible to me.  Moreover, it is not clear how this could be printed in a serious edition. <br>  After thinking how best to translate this name, I decided to ask Google.  I typed ‚ÄúGlobal Trace Network‚Äù in the address bar and got very unexpected results.  Surprisingly, the Global Trace Network is mentioned only on <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3D%2522Global%2BTrace%2BNetwork%2522">our news sites</a> .  Nowhere else.  To be sure, I checked in <a href="http://search.msn.com/results.aspx%3Fq%3D%2522Global%2BTrace%2BNetwork%2522%26geovar%3Den-US">MSN</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp%3D%2522Global%2BTrace%2BNetwork%2522%26fr%3Dyfp-t-471%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8">Yahoo</a> .  Nothing.  And this can only mean one thing.  Such an organization does not exist.  And in the newspaper The Times about this organization there were no notes. <br>  Then I decided to check the second organization, for which I again turned to Google.  This time, such an organization was found.  However, everything here was not so simple.  Firstly, the organization was not British, but American.  <a href="http://americanfundsretirement.retire.americanfunds.com/about/funds/details.htm%3Fticker%3DANEFX">Judge for yourself</a> .  And secondly, it turned out to be an investment company.  That is, there are no specialists in it.  They take money from investors and invest in the securities of other companies. <br>  It turns out that the incorrect information is given in the article about both companies.

      After that, I still decided to find the original article in The Times.  I went to the site " <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/">The Times</a> ", looked for recent notes on the preservation of the environment and here I was waiting for success. <br>  This note served as the basis for writing an article in the Vzglyad newspaper: <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2739926.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article2739926.ece</a> <br><br>  After reading an article from The Times, I found out that only the very beginning of an article in the Vzglyad newspaper is based on the article mentioned in The Times.  Where the rest of the information comes from is not clear.  The author of the article, Gennady Nechaev, refers to a certain UN report, where these data were allegedly published. <br><br>  I decided not to stop there and went to the UN site to look for the aforementioned report.  But there I was disappointed.  The fact is that this report is issued in the form of a book and can be bought for 80 dollars.  If you wish, you can buy it <a href="http://www.unep.org/publications/search/pub_details_s.asp%3FID%3D3933">here</a> . <br><br>  I would like to believe that the author of the article still read the report and the article provides real data.  However, in this case it would not be bad to cite sources of information.  Personally, I do not trust this article after strange things with the names of organizations. <br><br>  I sent a letter to the editorial office of Vzglyad, asking to explain why the facts in the article are incorrect, as well as why the name of one of the organizations was not so professionally translated.  We'll see whether the answer. <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that a lot of news sites published this article without even bothering to check the facts that form its basis.  Such actions are more likely to suit the yellow press.  I have always considered Vzglyad a more serious edition.  This indicates how easily any misinformation can be launched on the network. <br><br>  PS: No one even had a question, why the organization is so clumsily called the ‚ÄúGlobal Footprint Network‚Äù.  (How poetic is it?) <br><br>  Original article in my <a href="http://alex-arkhipov.blogspot.com/2007/10/blog-post_29.html">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15517/</a></p>
