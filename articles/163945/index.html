The Ukrainian team and two people from it went with me to a distant country of Taiwan, the city of Taipei.  Let me bring to your attention the report on the trip to the MSI MOA 2012 final. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f12/e1e/9a0/f12e1e9a057929f7195ec181512b3eca.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Overclocking has long been the tool that allows component manufacturers to significantly expand the model range, giving them the opportunity to create additional information events and declare themselves as champions.  They benefit from overclocking and ordinary users who need to press one button on the motherboard to automatically overclock the processor or in a special program using the sliders to increase the operating frequency of the graphics adapter, which results in a decent performance increase in games and various applications.  As for enthusiasts who are not afraid of liquid nitrogen, in addition to the pleasure of overclocking and getting record results, they have the opportunity to earn money on overclocking or get access to the latest hardware.  In addition, many professional overclockers have decided for themselves also the issue of employment.  Today we will talk about overclockers and the company that organized a real holiday for them. <br><br>  One of the most famous overclocking tournaments called MSI Master Overclocking Arena (MOA) celebrated its fifth anniversary this year.  A grand final tournament held in Taipei.  Every year, as part of the MOA event, the strongest teams gather from almost every corner of the planet.  This year, 15 teams from 14 countries fought for the first place.  Your humble servant together with the Ukrainian team Xtremelabs.org as part of overclockers T0lsty and Cyclone recovered on a long journey in order to tell the reader in detail about the grand finals of the MSI Master Overclocking Arena 2012 tournament. <br><br>  <b>MSI MOA 2012 - Venue and Participants</b> <br><br>  Our journey began with Boryspil airport (Kiev), where we all met (from left to right: SteelRat (MSI representative), T0lsty and Cyclone), discussed the latest news and began to wait for the announcement of landing on Moscow.  From Moscow to Hong Kong, and from this glorious city to Taipei.  We were accompanied by a representative of MSI Ukraine and an extreme overclocker in the past SteelRat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c92/2c2/e41/c922c2e41cfb060adbe800c60ab9021b.jpg"><br><br>  If I am not mistaken, then at the Hong Kong airport we met such a character, waiting for some Vasya. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/489/6c5/a5a/4896c5a5a13d34160dd26d21a10df831.jpg"><br><br>  Most teams and journalists flew to Taipei one day before the final.  At the airport of the capital of the province of Taiwan, the representatives of MSI met the new arrivals ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fb/ceb/239/5fbceb239d108da70ee718fa38b73991.jpg"><br><br>  ... and a little distract from the long flight helped its local attractions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce7/0a6/085/ce70a608571148f6233dd7c6d36ed7f6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ea/668/e17/8ea668e17bd4b22ac4385659ed7ba024.jpg"><br><br>  I would like to say a few words about the bus, or rather about its driver.  We were met by representatives of MSI, and were taken to this small bus.  Near it, the participants and journalists were awaited by a young girl who helped throw her backpacks and suitcases into the transport.  After that, she plopped down on the driver's seat, started the device, and quickly pulled away.  At the same time she was driving very quickly, neatly and most importantly very smoothly for passengers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bf/9a6/f4e/8bf9a6f4e1aa716065c4cb661ec4ab9b.jpg"><br><br>  It is difficult to convey the speed of movement with the help of a photograph, but now, perhaps, it is this photograph that conveys the entire drive of a bus ride at a speed of over a hundred along ramps and smooth roads of Taipei. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/48b/99a/dc4/48b99adc497f54b42c3c353c605b862e.jpg"><br><br>  On the road to our hotel, there are sometimes amusing buildings that ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/348/b07/f50/348b07f50559c637b0063d07cfd79901.jpg"><br><br>  ... in contrast with those. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7da/cd6/469/7dacd6469efa60c71564d376eaa3e208.jpg"><br><br>  And somewhere far away is the famous building - Taipei 101. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/83d/38a/666/83d38a666ef30d1939849657e9b21ff5.jpg"><br><br>  Surprisingly, for me, for a Ukrainian, that the city of Taipei is littered with multi-tiered overpasses, which allows you to avoid traffic jams and driving around the city does not cause any special problems.  At the same time more and more new constructions are being built, designed to simplify and secure movement.  Yes, I have not seen holes on the roads for all my time in the capital of Taiwan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c88/227/fb4/c88227fb4dc904ccdb9d7064007dbfbb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cda/de1/a6d/cdade1a6d8ed95cd1477c95695934e91.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3df/4ef/732/3df4ef732ad7069a122884d8a534e49d.jpg"><br><br>  If you go on a bus and here on you, the powerful torso of another overpass is coming up on you because of the turn. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/865/31c/c7f/86531cc7f0027ab041627268c8941cfb.gif"><br><br>  With a breeze before reaching the hotel Miramar Garden Taipei, all involved in the tournament received special T-shirts and went to rest, because the next day promised to be hot. <br><br>  After 30 hours of stay, I got to the crib. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e22/6e8/373/e226e837382bca59e18eda3a873dc60e.jpg"><br><br>  MSI decided not to change its traditions, and organized a grand final at the National Taiwan University Sports Center (NTU). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b9/ee1/975/6b9ee1975c14947295660a20c70d635d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/465/548/8b1/4655488b1fe8c89014947ff1134001b3.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the sports center there is a small park, where overclockers can gain strength, wander under shady trees and get some fresh air between the stages of the competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c61/bd9/a15/c61bd9a1500395970b0e7d3dde382460.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/399/ac8/37d/399ac837dd765e29bd1fa41d12338cf1.jpg"><br><br>  Participants in the tournament quickly unloaded from the buses, while not forgetting about their valuable supplies: copper cups for nitrogen, pre-prepared video cards, professional thermometers and, of course, talismans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56e/0f7/42a/56e0f742a50132d99570ec97c2ff294b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aec/2da/8b6/aec2da8b60dfbd307ed1e2163568f8eb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Regulations</b> <br><br>  In preparation for the MOA 2012, each team received from local MSI representative offices for a kit consisting of a Big Bang-XPower II motherboard and a N680GTX Lightning video card.  In addition, within the framework of the final itself, all participants were given a chance to choose iron from the prepared sets. <br><br>  As a result, the overclocking players armed themselves with the following iron: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/270/e73/657/270e7365709bee0bc2e65568dedb89f0.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, the organizers have clearly defined what software can be used during the nitrogen battle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/161/126/0e9/1611260e98f7998787f7f3856ccee502.jpg"><br><br>  In order for the reader to understand how intense the competition day was, I‚Äôll give the schedule for the MOA 2012 final. <br><br>  Schedule (Taipei time): <br><br><ul><li>  08: 50-09: 00 Opening Ceremony </li><li>  09: 00-10: 30 Assembly of stands </li><li>  10: 30-12: 30 Task 1: SuperPi 32M </li><li>  12: 30-15: 00 Task 2: 3DMark 03 </li><li>  15: 00-18: 00 Task 3: 3DMark 11 Perfomance </li><li>  18: 00-18: 30 Winners announced </li></ul><br><br>  In other words, the enthusiasts were under ‚Äúload‚Äù for more than nine hours. <br><br>  <b>Designed arena MOA 2012.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f0/85d/ae0/3f085dae0df266144d6be7b387c8e430.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/915/834/00f/91583400f128fa7f45441e771113b0fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d8/a85/4fc/1d8a854fc942be0253c49bb944c3a22f.jpg"><br><br>  Stable power for all teams was provided by powerful power supplies designed for loads up to 100 kW.

They are met by the organizers, journalists and guests of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87c/d1d/033/87cd1d033cd103e56844ba83b3806584.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/286/4b8/a6f/2864b8a6fac5789e8991a5740fcc5e92.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50b/3a3/42b/50b3a342b9391ecd7119b7290f8507d3.jpg"><br><br>  The measure of time, until the zeros.

For recharging enthusiasts, the organizers have prepared the appropriate drinks, decorated in the format of "MOA 2012". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/03c/172/522/03c172522b737cc8cbd1d600280fbfd1.jpg"><br><br>  To overclockers do not feel the lack of liquid nitrogen, it was in the arena - 2.5 tons.  Yes, 2500 liters of liquid nitrogen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/818/f29/f91/818f29f91dd7c1329eedfc6366b183d5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa6/60d/9d6/fa660d9d67eb255f0e3824939f952352.jpg"><br><br>  It was enough for an enthusiast to go up to these guys in gloves and collect ‚Äúliquids‚Äù in their thermos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9f/781/986/d9f7819868a884fdd6a63b050fc715fa.jpg"><br><br>  Strict judges.
