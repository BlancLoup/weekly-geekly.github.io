    <h2>  Physical cloud protection </h2><br>  Since this is a cloud infrastructure, the task of controlling physical access <a href="https://www.cloudsigma.com/security-in-a-public-iaas-cloud-part-2-access-to-cloud-servers/">falls</a> on the shoulders of the cloud provider.  Therefore, it is worth making sure that outsiders are not allowed to host.  If you are denied a tour or do not provide important information about how the infrastructure is protected from unauthorized access, then this is a reason to get worried. <br><br>  If the provider demonstrates the engine rooms, engineering and other service rooms, allowing you to look at the "kitchen" from the inside, then this is a good sign.  For example, the provider, whose services are used by IT-GRAD, provided comprehensive information on where the cloud is located, how communication systems work, and provides security at the facility.  We described all this in one of our materials. <br><br>  It is worth noting that you need to trust your data only to certified data centers.  It is possible to assess the state of the data center independently, but this can take a lot of time.  Additionally, you should examine the legal status of the data center and find out whether the provider has all the necessary state licenses and contracts to support the systems in case of an emergency. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our materials on the topic</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585-%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94d/4fa/f87/94d4faf871924b629194a644587488c8.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2581%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585-%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Comparison of four top disaster recovery solutions</a> <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/275553/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/179/93f/016/17993f0162884129920e4fa9470618ce.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/275553/">How IaaS provider to choose a data center to host the cloud: IT-GRAD Experience</a> <br></div></div><br><h2>  Data leakage protection </h2><br>  ‚ÄúOrganizations <a href="http://www.businesscloudnews.com/2015/01/27/largest-ddos-attacks-50x-bigger-than-a-decade-ago-report/">suffer</a> from a wide and wide range of threats, which, of course, is a cause for concern.  Successfully implemented attacks have a direct impact on clients' business and are destructive in nature, ‚Äù <a href="http://goo.gl/GpMULv">says</a> Arbor Networks spokesman Darren Anstee. <br><br>  Therefore, the data transmitted to the cloud provider must be protected.  You need to <a href="http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Security-for-Cloud-Computing-10-Steps-to-Ensure-Success.pdf">know</a> who got access to the information, what operations were performed with it, from what address the request came.  All these issues can be resolved with the help of rights-based access rights to business critical data.  It is also worth thinking about creating a policy of ‚Äúself-destruction‚Äù for important information that does not need to ‚Äúlive‚Äù indefinitely outside the corporate data center. <br><br>  One of the ways to protect transmitted data <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/the-top-five-trends-in-mobile-and-byod-security-7000014226/">is</a> encryption.  To protect information properly, it is worth implementing encryption at each stage of the data life cycle.  If applications on mobile corporate devices are caching data, this approach will prevent leakage in case of loss of the gadget. <br><br>  There are many solutions on the market to provide data encryption in the cloud.  For example, Trend Micro SecureCloud <a href="http://www.it-grad.ru/tsentr_kompetentsii/blog/19/">is</a> one of them.  The system encrypts virtual machine disks using encryption keys stored in SecureCloud, which initiates the encryption / decryption processes of protected storage modules.  Architecturally, the solution consists of a management system, provided as a service with access via the console and agents installed on the protected virtual machines. <br><br>  Several other popular services for encrypting data in the cloud were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/4fryg1/what_is_good_crypto_software_for_backups_uploaded/">offered by</a> users of Reddit. <br><br><h2>  API access protection </h2><br>  It is necessary <a href="https://www.cloudsigma.com/security-in-a-public-iaas-cloud-part-2-access-to-cloud-servers/">to limit</a> access to the web console, since unauthorized access via API can be extremely destructive for systems.  Those who use the application programming interfaces should use the access configuration and authentication control functions. <br><br>  Perhaps the most powerful tool is the ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù of IP addresses, which allows you to designate a limited number of addresses for each API call.  In addition, it makes sense to use other ways to connect to the API.  For example, you can use a combination of UUID / API keys instead of a login and password to separate access to the API and the web console. <br><br><h2>  Authentication and authorization </h2><br>  The use of multi-factor authentication types should be considered here.  The introduction of an additional level of security provides a more efficient protection of systems against unauthorized access. <br><br>  At the same time, cloud providers should <a href="http://www.cloud-council.org/deliverables/CSCC-Security-for-Cloud-Computing-10-Steps-to-Ensure-Success.pdf">provide</a> their customers with the ability to configure access levels for each user in accordance with company security policies.  For example, one employee may generate purchase requests for goods, and another, having other access rights, can confirm them. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our materials on the topic</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-security-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d41/4d7/7c3/d414d77c373c440591e8a0fbd4d9b385.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-security-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC">Cloud Security Testing, or Security Tips</a> <br><br> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee6/1fa/171/ee61fa171b35420396ddf13545717e72.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5">What to look for when placing code and deploying applications in the cloud</a> <br></div></div><br><h2>  Activity monitoring </h2><br>  When virtual machines are created and transferred between servers automatically, you cannot know for sure where your information is located.

Studying protocols, ports and signatures, such a system categorizes incoming packets and applies appropriate measures to them. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Our materials on the topic</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277977/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/efa/654/22fefa654e8a49eda4573c5f2831f1ac.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/277977/">IaaS provider and security issues</a> <br><br> <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/dpi-na-sluzhbe-oblaka/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b13/c4e/8f3/b13c4e8f38b54c3f98948c1fdd58cb0b.png" width="600"></a> <br>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/dpi-na-sluzhbe-oblaka/">DPI on cloud service</a> <br></div></div><br>  CASB is a security tool for administrators to identify potential system risks and provide a high level of protection.  The solution is a single point of control for cloud applications used by the company, and works in conjunction with the IT infrastructure of the provider, offering opportunities for monitoring shared files.  This gives administrators all the information about when and to whom content is transmitted. <br><br>  A list of other monitoring tools was offered by Quora and Reddit users.  They can be found at the links <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-cloud-orchestration-and-provisioning-tools">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/4mpr48/advice_on_some_simple_server_monitoring_software/">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Security strategy </h2><br>  As a conclusion, we note that the most important aspect of the work of any environment, not only the cloud, is an evolving plan to maintain the safety of the infrastructure.
