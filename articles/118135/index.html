  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What does BES 5 SP3 prepare for us?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago we installed and started testing <b>BES 5.0.3 (SP3)</b> on our corporate <b>BlackBerry Enterprise</b> server and want to talk a little about what's new for the users of <a href="http://infobox.ru/business_solutions/exchange/blackberry/">our BES service</a> after we install it in production environment (focusing on the beginning of May about). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I must say that for <b>BES</b> administrators, the release of this service pack is a long-awaited news, with which they pinned certain hopes.  Any large server product updates ‚Äî such as a <b>BlackBerry Enterprise</b> server ‚Äî have 2 sides.  One of them is important for the user of the service, because it adds new functions, improves the functioning of the existing ones, adds stability to the overall operation of the device-server bundle.  The second is important for server administrators, bringing new options to management, changing (usually for the better) the work of key services, adding new elements and capabilities to an extremely rich <b>BES</b> server console. <br><br>  Based on these two constants, we would like to highlight the changes that came with this service pack. <br>  A very curious (and, as it seems, useful) function is called the <b>BlackBerry Balance</b> .  I will describe its main features.  For many, it is no secret that the <b>BlackBerry</b> smartphone connected to the <b>BES</b> server can be blocked or completely cleared by the <b>BES</b> server administrator if necessary.  This is done through the so-called <i>remote wipe option</i> (some call it also <i>remote kill</i> - for what it does with the smartphone). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So, this operation deletes all the data on the phone and simultaneously blocks it.  With the new BlackBerry Balance feature, it is possible to segregate enterprise data (actually able to represent core business value) from personal user data.  Thus, custom customization will not be lost as a result of remote wipe.  Of course, when the smartphone is lost, it does not make much sense to divide the data into types, but when the user saves the BlackBerry device after, say, leaving the company in which he used BES, this is valuable. <br><br>  Another joyful innovation is the appearance of support for <a href="http://infobox.ru/business_solutions/ocs/">Microsoft's Office Communications Server (OCS) 2007 R2</a> and <b>Lync Server 2010</b> .  For a very long time, many companies waited for the start of <b>OCS</b> support and even postponed the transition to <b>BES 5</b> * due to the lack of this support.  It's nice that <b>Lync</b> server support came much faster. <br><br><img src="http://ehlo.me/wp-content/uploads//2011/04/bb_ocs_comm.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  This is how the <b>OCS / Lync</b> client finally communicates on your <b>BlackBerry</b> device with the OCS / Lync server. <br><br>  Support has been added for S / MIME and PGP encrypted attachments, adding even more security to <b>BES</b> users. <br>  User management in the console has become somewhat more convenient, sorting by columns and exporting to a csv file immediately from the search results helps in some cases :) <br>  <b>BlackBerry Enterprise Server has</b> started supporting Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2008 R2 - an excellent innovation for those companies that give priority to <b>Microsoft</b> virtualization technologies. <br>  The work of <b><a href="http://infobox.ru/business_solutions/exchange/blackberry/">BES 5 with Exchange 2010</a></b> has long been, to put it mildly, a headache for the administrators managing these products.  Their interoperability left much to be desired even after RIM‚Äôs declaration that the products were fully compatible.  The biggest problems of mutual work of the two products were eliminated to BES 5 SP2, but from time to time the oldest and most annoying problem made itself felt - the delay in delivering messages to BlackBerry devices.  This problem had several large root causes, the most recent of which is the high activity of the mailbox disk subsystem of servers on Exchange due to interaction with BES - was eliminated by the current service pack. <br>  So now you can rightfully say that between Exchange 2010 and BES 5 * this state has occurred - <br><br><img src="http://ehlo.me/wp-content/uploads//2011/04/exchange2010_blackberry2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>BlackBerry Enterprise Trait Tool</b> - the Swiss knife of any self-respecting <b>BES</b> admin - has undergone changes and received several new features.  It should be noted that this tool is not very well known among the interested public, moreover, some BES admins manage without it.  However, this tool can be considered the same as for <b>Exchange</b> administrators is, for example, <b>PowerShell</b> .  Yes, in terms of flexibility, they, of course, are no match, but they have in common with the fact that some of the tasks of the <b>BES</b> administration can be performed only with the use of this tool. <br><br><img src="http://ehlo.me/wp-content/uploads//2011/04/trait_tool.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The BlackBerry MDS Integration Service</b> (MDS-IS) has been retired, and we do not foresee any difficulties in this regard, since it was not used by anyone in the existing environment. <br>  A large number of corrections and improvements have undergone <b>BAS</b> service - the main tool for managing <b>BES</b> server in <b>BES</b> of the 5th branch.  This news is extremely pleasant and valuable for us, those who directly administer the server and can appreciate the work done by <b>RIM</b> . <br>  Finally, <b>BES 5.0.3</b> introduces several new IT policies aimed at further improving manageability and security, including a policy for managing a native client for access to <b><a href="http://infobox.ru/business_solutions/portal/">SharePoint</a></b> (!), Which is not there yet, but the emergence of this policy leads to good thoughts and coming soon. <br>  Be sure to notify service users a few days before deployment and, we hope, you will also like the innovations, as we do! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118135/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118135/</a></p>
