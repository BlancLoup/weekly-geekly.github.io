On this occasion, many <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/191280/">useful instructions</a> have already been written, and their successful passage should guarantee that there are no problems with your bank‚Äôs currency control when receiving a payment from <a href="https://wallet.google.com/">Google Wallet</a> (formerly Google Checkout). <br><br>  Understanding this issue recently, we were faced with the need to submit our agreement with Google Play to the bank.  This agreement exists in the form of a public offer ( <a href="https://wallet.google.com/termsOfService%3Ftype%3DSELLER">here is a link</a> ) and the problem is that it is provided by Google only in English. <br><br>  Having fairly rummaged in the depths of the Internet, we were able to find a good translation.  However, it turned out that the translation from 2012 is already outdated, and in the current edition (August 5, 2013) there are moments that are not translated.  As a result, we turned to professionals who transferred the missing pieces of the contract to us.  The result is laid out here for universal use.

      <a href="">Link to the translation of the contract from August 5, 2013</a> <br><br>  Under the cut are interesting moments that, as we noticed, Google was added to the new edition of this agreement. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the version dated September 19, 2012 in paragraph 2.3 it was written: <br><br><blockquote>  2.3 Limitations on the Use of Service.  It is up to the Seller to comply with the limitation: <br>  (i) the Integration Guidelines; <br>  (ii) the Button and Acceptance Logo Guidelines and the Google Brand Feature Guidelines; <br>  (iii) GPC requirements for data security; <br></blockquote><br>  In the version of August 5, 2013, Google decided to expand the concept in paragraph (iii): <br><br><blockquote>  (iii) GPC requirements for data security <b>and privacy, including the Google Privacy Notice;</b> <br></blockquote><br><br>  In the version from 2012 in paragraph 6.3 it was written: <br><br><blockquote>  6.3 Payment Adjustments.  The seller acknowledges that he has to pay the bill (including a Carrier), and the GPC will accept the charge back. Seller if the transaction is not covered by the Payment Guarantee Policy.  As a particular payment transaction, GPC may withhold payments or reverse payments if: <br>  (i) A Buyer makes a claim for a GPC for a refund or other reversal or <br>  (ii) the rules of this agreement, or otherwise violate this agreement, or not the Policies.  It is possible that the seller agates to cooperate with him. <br></blockquote><br><br>  In 2013, one more phrase was added there: <br><br><blockquote>  (ii) the rules of this agreement, or otherwise violate this agreement, or not the Policies.  It is possible that the seller agates to cooperate with him.  <b>It agrees to comply with the GPC.</b> <br></blockquote><br><br>  Well, the third change affected section 7 (CONFIDENTIALITY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS) <br><br>  It was: <br><br><blockquote>  7.1 Confidentiality.  It shall be obtained through the Service, except for the use of it.  Seller acknowledges that it has been subject to the Service Privacy Policy.  It doesn‚Äôt matter that he has received his or her consent to receive his or her consent. third party confidential information.  The seller agrees that the breach of this paragraph.  In the case of the GPC, it‚Äôs third parties.  "GPC Confidential Information" includes without limitation: <br></blockquote><br><br>  It became: <br><br><blockquote>  7.1 Confidentiality.  This information is obtained through the Service Provider.  Seller acknowledges that you are not subject to the <b>Google Wallet and you are not allowed to use it</b> .  It doesn‚Äôt matter that he has received his or her consent to receive his or her consent. third party confidential information.  The seller agrees that the breach of this paragraph.  In the case of the GPC, it‚Äôs third parties.  "GPC Confidential Information" includes without limitation: <br></blockquote><br><br>  In general, it is clear that nothing terrible in the license agreement has not changed, as expected.  In any case, we hope that the document we have laid out will help you save time and quickly get your hard-earned money. <br><br>  Have a nice day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223847/</a></p>
