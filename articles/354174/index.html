      Some of them act boldly and decisively - they are trying to prove to the whole world that 1C is not a program for accounting, it is the coolest platform for business automation, confidently exciting markets, developing new technologies, creating and developing their own.  Such people, of course, cause the strongest response feelings.  They are like strong, proud and confident negative movie characters.  Well, you know, those that overshadow the positive. <br><br>  But most 1Snikov, alas, are not.  Modest, quiet, who consider their "unity" - a shameful disadvantage, mental or physical illness.  Reading Habr, they are forced to hide their "yellow pants", so as not to be in disgrace expelled, spat upon and desecrated. <br><br>  They read about game development, web applications, machine learning, working abroad, Google and Apple, and cry.  And then they reject, get angry, quit reading, return to the accounting department ... But come back again and read. <br><br>  Publication - for them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you're on vacation, <br>  Better in March and to Thailand! <br>  Year close without programmer <br>  Chief accountant will be very happy! <br><br>  *** <br><br>  You residual registers <br>  Never create! <br>  The boys on the negotiable <br>  Everything is decided without difficulty! <br><br>  But since you got <br>  That residual register <br>  Change the type of measurement - Better "Date" and "String"! <br><br>  If they begin to poke his nose: <br>  Like, the register is not closed. <br>  Answer that you are thinking so <br>  Architect, his mother! <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Solution Integration <br>  Your customer wanted? <br>  What is there to think about the exchange plan! <br>  Well, the register information. <br><br>  Matches keep it <br>  It will be for objects of all. <br>  Only need an operator <br>  To record drive in. <br><br>  Well, okay, you do not worry <br>  Operators - car, <br>  Like money from sharashki, <br>  To horror contain. <br><br>  Let him know who he contacted, <br>  This is a bitch, 1C! <br>  President said you need <br>  Us jobs. <br><br>  Operator - a man, right? <br>  Mortgage, all things. <br>  Though his work is a monkey ... <br>  Nothing will survive. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Catching one <br>  Don't forget about the EDT. <br>  Well this is the main thing that everyone <br>  Not enough in 1C? <br><br>  Study it as soon as <br>  The next release will be released, <br>  And write that is very cool <br>  Only a little slow. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  For platform releases <br>  Watch very carefully <br>  Suddenly registers into extensions <br>  Can I add? <br><br>  After all, such a life will begin! <br>  You can completely forget <br>  Quality and updates <br>  Just code, damn it, and that's it! <br><br>  Fuck a bunch of files <br>  Connect one by one <br>  Well, hemorrhoids and conflicts ... <br>  Somehow then decide. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Better in negotiations <br>  Smile and nod. <br>  And do not specify details <br>  Say "Yes, we will solve everything." <br><br>  Dude income increase, <br>  And the costs cut, <br>  Efficiency and cash flow <br>  Promise to raise at times. <br><br>  Otherwise, they will suddenly add <br>  What are you - just a programmer? <br>  And income and expenses <br>  For you - accounts in used? <br><br>  How can they, damn, raise? <br>  Here after all mediocrity around ... <br>  There is a double entry, kids! <br>  And platform balance. <br><br>  Okay, then later, in the process <br>  You will bow them to the TZ. <br>  And with TZ your brain is free, <br>  You can no longer be wise. <br><br>  Just write a program, <br>  Document, register, report. <br>  Needed, no ...
