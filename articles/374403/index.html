Therefore, the title of the first "space photographer" went to astronaut <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD">Alan Shepard</a> , who made the first suborbital flight for the USA on May 5, 1961 from Cape Canaveral. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/53/x9/-j/53x9-jpl9e3ntuuxwvrb7m3u-3e.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">German Titov</a> on August 6, 1961, not only became the second man in Earth orbit, but also the second space photographer.  He also still holds the title of the youngest man in space: at the time of the flight he was 25 years and 11 months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_8/y8/bn/_8y8bnc1siubi6utesyfvzv_5yu.jpeg"><br><br>  The first color image of the entire Earth was received in August 1967 by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DODGE_(satellite)">DODGE</a> satellite. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/wt/ok/cmwtokyxn2fkvumq05a9yj_9acq.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  In 2012 and 2016, using the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suomi_NPP">Suomi NPP</a> meteorological satellite, night shots of the earth's surface were made, from which NASA later composed a mosaic called the ‚ÄúBlack Marble‚Äù.  The pictures <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/new-night-lights-maps-open-up-possible-real-time-applications">clearly show</a> how the night illumination of India has grown over 4 years. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mg/ib/qx/mgibqxg_vecia-bbixsflvrv-sq.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Also, many beautiful pictures of the Earth are made by people from the ISS.  For example, the rising of the Moon, Venus and the Sun over the Aurora borealis, taken in May 2017 by astronaut <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5,_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">Thomas Peske</a> : <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YEkTGOh9kA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In addition to the "Blue Marble", astronauts flying to the Moon received another famous picture - this is the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%2597%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8">"Earth Rising"</a> made on December 24, 1968 by <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC">William Anders</a> of the Apollo 8 crew who were the first to fly around the Moon. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/gg/tv/bhggtvlmob-6w34lchrg8ehjy2i.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  On April 5, 2008, the satellite of the moon <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2583%25D1%258F">"Kaguya" of the</a> Japanese space agency JAXA video of the same nature was shot on a camera with a CCD matrix of only 2.2 megapixels. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H1KWtG66lEQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  On May 21, 2018, along with the Chinese satellite transponder <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258A%25D1%258D-4">Chang'e-4,</a> two small Longjiang-1 and -2 weighing 45 kg each went to the Moon.  The first of them lost contact and had to cancel their radio interferometry mission with a super-long base.  However, Longjiang-2 remained working and was able to transfer this and several other images of the Earth from the lunar orbit made on a camera made in Saudi Arabia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yo/xb/vu/yoxbvuawwau1gcbqs0xxxvf_feo.jpeg"><br><br>  On July 5, 2016, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory">DSCOVR</a> satellite located at Lagrange point L1 (1.5 million km from the Earth towards the Sun), the Moon was traversed across the earth's disk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qe/iy/w9/qeiyw9rpcqckxcbzyl2pywqr9uc.gif"><br><br>  A combined image of the Earth and the Moon, taken on October 2, 2017 from a distance of 5 million km using the MapCam camera of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSIRIS-REx">OSIRIS-REx</a> probe designed to deliver soil from the Bennu asteroid. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9o/dj/hh/9odjhhlab9hexz58ybebzhwfvrs.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  On September 18, 1977, Voyager-1 took the first joint image of the Earth and the Moon from a distance of 11.66 million km during the inspection of its cameras. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/ac/hp/gnachpmaerdgd8akxk9idvuey_k.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  This is again OSIRIS-REx, but already on January 17, 2018, the NavCam1 camera and a distance of 63.6 million km. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lr/jz/yd/lrjzydwokpbrjmn32vrkttww9qs.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  On May 6, 2010, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580_(%25D0%2590%25D0%259C%25D0%25A1)">the MESSENGER</a> probe took a picture of the Earth and the Moon from the orbit of Mercury (183 million km distance) where our planet and its natural satellite look just like two bright stars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rm/fu/cw/rmfucwobaqdidrkpz3q2up-jzju.jpeg"><br><br>  The resolution of the HiRISE <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Reconnaissance_Orbiter">MRO</a> probe in Martian orbit (distance 142 million km) is much higher, but even on it the Earth and the Moon look like small balls with a diameter of 90 and 24 pixels, respectively.  The picture was taken on October 3, 2007. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/ie/ka/vqiekak0bbmzef6kzyn-sgj09cg.jpeg"><br><br>  On December 10, 2017, the Earth accidentally got into the frame of the Kepler telescope looking for an exoplanet, and thus lit up the picture, despite the distance of 150 million km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x3/dq/y6/x3dqy6jgaphahjpdzi-5obutv8c.jpeg"><br><br>  Already from the surface of Mars, the rover <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Curiosity</a> Earth and the Moon are visible as two small points - this picture was taken on January 31, 2014 from a distance of about 160 million km. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h1/jg/mw/h1jgmwjcc6avj4da3hnthca2ei8.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  On December 16, 1992, a general snapshot of the Earth and the Moon made the Galileo probe purple, red and near-infrared during its departure to Jupiter (distance 6.2 million km). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nh/x-/bq/nhx-bqi7x6t_rxy4ptylvggdqg0.jpeg"><br><br>  On July 19, 2013, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292701/">the Cassini</a> probe made 323 snapshots of the Saturn system on the basis of 141 of which a mosaic was made on which, besides Saturn and its satellites, a small point is visible - our Earth. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n-/p6/yj/n-p6yjmvacqsnzzvj7e9ea55two.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Together with this snapshot, NASA organized the action ‚ÄúWave Saturn‚Äù during which 1600 pictures of volunteers were taken, from which the collage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Earth_Smiled">‚ÄúThe day when the Earth smiled‚Äù</a> was made like a general picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/ph/a6/g9pha62y6jtlujdvxmraa0wj8x0.jpeg"><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ou/2l/y0/ou2ly0y9x6i0reo4ox1ch7j6few.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  Finally, the furthest snapshot of the Earth is the ‚ÄúPale Blue Dot‚Äù taken on February 14, 1990 by Voyager 1 from a distance of 6.4 billion km (this distance corresponds to the orbit of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">Pluto</a> recently degraded from the planets).  The angular resolution of the narrow-angle <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/292209/">Voyager</a> cameras from such a distance was 9 earth diameters per pixel.
