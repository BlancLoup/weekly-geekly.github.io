  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The next increase in prices for Microsoft products makes us think about abandoning the software of an American company.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 2016, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft has</a> increased the prices of software in Russia.  Microsoft Office packages, Office 365 and other products increased in price by 19%.  Prices for cloud services for corporate customers increased by 25%.  True, the prices for boxed versions of the Windows operating system remained the same. <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office">Microsoft Office</a> is a work tool for hundreds of thousands of people.  Even if it suddenly becomes more expensive, it is almost impossible to refuse it, because attempts to switch to some alternative free packages were made many times in my experience, and in 99% of cases organizations still returned back to Microsoft Office, because losses still is more expensive than a license, ‚ÄùSergey Viljanov, editor of the IT and Innovation section of Bankir.ru, <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2887694">told</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  But is it possible to abandon Microsoft software not now, but in the short term? <a name="habracut"></a>

      The announcement of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D0%259E%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581">the MoiOfis</a> cloud package, developed by <a href="http://ncloudtech.ru/">the New Cloud Technologies company</a> , became one of the most noticeable events in the Russian IT industry for the entire outgoing year.  This product is unlikely to be able to compete with a foreign giant, and it is not easy to compare them.  As CNews <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2015-12-24_mojofis_vs_microsoft_office_sravnenie_nesravnimogo_1">writes</a> , so far this ‚Äúcomparison of the incomparable‚Äù: the functionality of Microsoft Office Online is currently much broader than that of MoiOffice.  The latter has only the most necessary for editing documents.  It is more convenient to work in Microsoft Office Online, it supports different browsers and works faster. <br><br>  However, New Cloud Technologies announced plans to sell MoyOffice solutions 30-40% cheaper than the market leader.  However, the cost of the new product is not compared to the roughly similar cloudy Office 365 in functionality, but to the regular Microsoft Office ‚ÄúStandard‚Äù license for corporate users. <br><br>  Last time, prices for Microsoft products rose in February 2015.  Then the prices for software increased by 15-30%. <br>  The increase in software prices is due to economic changes in the country, Pavel Betsis, the president of Microsoft Russia, explained to Kommersant earlier. <br><br>  Antivirus software developed abroad can also become more expensive.  Rising prices for it may be 25%, Leonid Delitsyn, an analyst <a href="http://www.finam.ru/">at Finam</a> investment holding, believes.  According to the expert, prices will gradually be raised by domestic software manufacturers. <br><br>  Since early January, the law on the restriction of public procurement of foreign software came into force.  <a href="https://roem.ru/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/importozameshenie.po.3.chtenie.doc">The law</a> obliging state agencies to submit a written argument for the purchase of foreign software from January 1, 2016 was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of June. <br><br>  From January 1, 2016, the state customer will have to argue his choice in favor of foreign software, if his Russian counterparts in a specially created registry of domestic software.  The software should belong to the state, the municipality, a Russian non-profit organization or company with a share of Russian beneficiaries of more than 50% - this is the main criterion that makes it possible to consider software as domestic. <br><br>  December 25, "Megamind" <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/22980/">wrote</a> that the Ministry of Communications has proposed to introduce price preferences of 15% in public procurement (competitions, auctions, quotations requests).  The exemption, as conceived by the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media, should extend to the purchase of 22 product names, including application and system software. <br><br>  For the most part, domestic products are still inferior to foreign software, the head of the Internet Development Institute German Klimenko is sure: <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the software there is put in order, with document flow, with service, with support, and we are just learning.  If all this is implemented, it is necessary to look carefully so that our companies are not put at a disadvantage, because if there is something western cheaper, there is no history when we buy Russian at any price.  We are doing well with software for the Internet, with an average corporate office - ‚Äú1C‚Äù, in my opinion, looks very worthy.  Very bad with software that serves the largest companies. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297696/</a></p>
