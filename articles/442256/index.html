      This campaign is strategic and is aimed at upholding digital rights and against the current negative trend of state regulation of the Internet in Russia. <br><br>  Over the past few years, the Russian authorities have adopted a huge number of legal acts that adversely affect our digital rights and freedoms, the development of Internet business, and the construction of effective communications online: personal, social, business, educational.  Regulation of the network environment has clearly gone somewhere wrong for a long time.  Deputies of the State Duma, instead of laws that should stimulate public, commercial and scientific communications in the online environment, put forward increasingly strange and detrimental to modern society initiatives to expand network censorship, introduce surveillance of users, burden new information intermediaries - telecom operators, hosts, content providers, site owners, online media and other participants of the Internet interaction. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is no secret to anyone that the adoption of the most odious laws occurs unilaterally - ‚Äúpeople's choices‚Äù and representatives of state bodies do not listen to constructive criticism from experts from the industry and public organizations.  All repressive and regressive bills regarding the Internet are quickly approved by the relevant committees, ‚Äúhigh-speed readings‚Äù in parliament, the same quick approval by the Federation Council and endorsed by the President of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  <b>We want to change this!</b> <br><br>  In the framework of the ‚ÄúDigital Defense‚Äù campaign, all of us, Internet users, industry representatives, website and service owners, IT specialists, bloggers, representatives of the scientific community and the media can massively defend their online rights.  Otherwise, in the near future, life awaits us in the anti-utopias of Orwell and Bradbury - some elements of such worlds penetrate our lives and become familiar to us.  We are taught: censorship is normal, shadowing is so necessary, accept the total state control of your communications for the sake of your own safety.  The Ministries of Truth, Peace and Love are already visible on the horizon.  And the thought offense is almost already here and now. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/60e/911/51a60e9117f73e279a98d0043dc3a8ed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The first stage of the campaign, we propose to unite efforts against one of the most dangerous bills - <a href="http://sozd.duma.gov.ru/bill/608767-7">‚Ññ608767-7</a> "On the sovereignty of Runet" authorship of Senators Klishas and Lateral, as well as the deputy Lugovoi.  The first reading <a href="https://roskomsvoboda.org/44987/">took place</a> in mid-February of this year, the second will be in March.  The norms proposed by the draft law will put the routing of the Network with the regulator represented by Roskomnadzor under state control.  Officials of this department will have the right to instruct telecom operators how to build Internet traffic routes.  It is also assumed that equipment will be imposed on ISPs that will filter traffic using deep packet analysis (DPI).  Traffic exchange points and cross-border traffic will be taken under tight control.  All this carries many risks: both technological, and economic, and public. <br><br>  Lawmakers justify their actions by seeking protection from outside threats.  But with the implementation of the new law, there will be many threats, including  the risk of cutting off the Runet from the World Wide Web. <br><br>  Well, you, I suppose, and you yourself are well aware of this.  Moreover, at Habr√© this bill was very actively discussed and caused a serious resonance <br>  By chronology: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433188/">one</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/434292/">two</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/439040/">three</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440006/">four</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440232/">five</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/440496/">six</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441110/">seven</a> , <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441786/">eight</a> . <br>  And this I still far from all posts led, published here.  Only, one might say key. <br><br>  <b>So let's try to change the situation!</b> <br><br>  We created <a href="https://oborona.digital/">the Digital Defense website</a> , where we will publish campaign news, and now we have laid out the most detailed instructions on what each of you can do personally. <br><br>  <b>We offer to write an appeal to the deputies - the <a href="https://oborona.digital/kak-sozdat-obrashhenie-deputatam/">corresponding guide is posted on the website</a> .</b> <br><br>  We have <a href="https://oborona.digital/examples/">given</a> examples of such appeals <a href="https://oborona.digital/examples/">on this page</a> .  There is also a file containing an extended expert argument, which you can attach to your request. <br><br>  <b>We want such high-profile draft laws to pass through open public hearings on the Internet.</b>  And the deputies were not accepted as soon as possible, despite the huge number of comments from public and industry organizations.  Users have long been concerned about such a devil-may-care attitude from government agencies. <br><br>  In the future, we will focus on the response received by the authorities on this issue (or ignoring it).  And take the next steps to consolidate the efforts of users and Internet companies in asserting their rights.  Including in court. <br><br>  We ask you to tell your friends and acquaintances about ‚ÄúDigital Defense‚Äù, repost in social networks and instant messengers.  Spread your campaign news with the hashtag #DigitalHabon. <br><br>  <b>Download banners <a href="https://oborona.digital/join/">on a special campaign page</a> and place them on your website, social networks, blog.</b> <br>  On the same page, you can subscribe to campaign news. <br><br>  Those Internet resources, public organizations, commercial industry companies, associations, media portals who want to join this campaign or otherwise interact with its organizers can contact us at this e-mail: roskomsvoboda@rublacklist.net <br><br>  It is in our power to do everything possible to ensure that the Internet in our country is convenient, fast and free, and the digital rights of citizens are respected by the authorities! <br><br> <a href="https://oborona.digital/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05f/669/a82/05f669a8279bbab2889d828474f57dff.png" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442256/</a></p>
