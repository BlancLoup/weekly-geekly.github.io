      In the kingdom of the far kingdom, in the thirtieth state, he grew up a turnip, and the hen Ryaba carried eggs. <br><br>  He wanted Daddy scrambled eggs and asked the hen Ryaba: <br><br>  - Do you want to exchange?  You give me eggs, and I give you a turnip. <br>  ‚ÄúI like to eat a turnip,‚Äù replies the Ryaba hen. <br><br>  They agreed to exchange 4 eggs for 1 turnip. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) How many eggs, at an agreed rate, cost 1 turnip? <br>  b) How many turnips cost 1 egg? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) 4 eggs. <br>  b) 0.25 turnips. <br><br>  <b>Task 2</b> <br><br>  The Ryaba hen wanted to peck at her turnips, and on that day she was too lazy to lay eggs.  How to be? <br>  Says Dedkov: <br>  - Ship a turnip in debt, please. <br>  Dedkov replies: <br>  - Yes, you, pockmarked, will forget what you borrowed, and then you will not give the eggs. <br>  - No, I will not forget.  Here's a feather for you.  You will present me tomorrow, and I will return the favor to you for your feather. <br>  ‚ÄúGood,‚Äù agreed Dedik. <br>  Shipped a hen Ryabe turnip, and in exchange took a feather. <br>  The next day, Dedkov returned the feather to the hen Ryaba, and in return received the promised eggs. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) How much did the feather cost before the start of this operation? <br>  b) How much did the feather cost after the start of the operation, but before its completion? <br>  c) How much does a feather cost after the operation is completed? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) It was not worth a fig. <br>  b) 1 turnip or 4 eggs. <br>  c) It is not worth a fig. <br><br>  <b>Task 3</b> <br><br>  He wanted to get dog hair for the treatment of radiculitis.  Bug in exchange for a turnip agrees to give wool as needed.  But here's the problem: a turnip grown by Dedk is given to a hen Ryaba in exchange for a feather. <br><br>  Then the grandfather says to the Beetle: <br>  - And you take the feather.  Tomorrow you will give it to Ryaba, and in return you will receive eggs. <br>  Bug happily agreed and allowed Dedkov to kick a dog's fur out of herself. <br>  He cured grandfather playing out radiculitis and thinks: <br>  "To know that magic power is concentrated in chicken feathers, since everything on them can be acquired." <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Why did grandpa think so? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) Quite an old man survived from the mind. <br><br>  <b>Task 4</b> <br><br>  Chicken Ryaba something I saw and says: <br>  - And let us evaluate all the products in the feathers! <br>  Grandpa scratched his turnip and answered: <br>  - Why not?  What is the difference, what is to be assessed if the proportions of exchange are established ?! <br>  And Bug in a sign of agreement something proyavkala. <br>  So the products produced on the farm began to be evaluated in chicken feathers. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Is Dedok right to say that with the immutability of the proportions of exchange, it makes no difference what product to evaluate? <br>  b) Why did the hen Ryaba need to evaluate products in feathers? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) Right. <br>  b) The chicken was not a fool at all.  She looked into the distance. <br><br>  <b>Task 5</b> <br><br>  Now the products have begun not to exchange one for the other, but to be sold, bought for chicken feathers. <br><br>  If Dedka needed eggs, he would pay 1 egg to the hen ryab and receive 4 eggs for it. <br>  If Ryaba's hen needed a turnip, she paid 1 feather on Dedka and got 1 turnip for a feather. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) What is the difference between the sale and the lending considered before? <br>  b) How many feathers were in circulation before, when lending? <br>  c) How many feathers were in circulation from now on when buying and selling? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) The fact that when buying and selling feathers are not removed from circulation after the completion of the operation, as when borrowing. <br>  b) Equal to the amount of debt.  When debt arose, the number of feathers in circulation increased, while debt repayment decreased. <br>  c) Arbitrary quantity entered into the circulation of speckled hen. <br><br>  <b>Task 6</b> <br><br>  Soon Ryaba's hen realized that there was no need for her to rush.  Why, if it's easier to kick feathers from the tail and pay them off ?! <br><br>  Then she thought about it and decided to still be carried, but not with simple eggs, but with gold, to decorate the chicken coop. <br><br>  As decided, so did. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Is it possible to say that after Ryaba's hen ceased to rush by simple eggs, she became a parasite? <br>  b) Why decorate a chicken coop with golden eggs? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) It is not possible, but necessary. <br>  b) Ryaba's hen went nuts on the basis of enrichment. <br><br>  <b>Task 7</b> <br><br>  Once the grandmother tried to pay for the products with a passerine feather. <br>  - What are you doing ?!  - here he hesitated Ryaba hen.  - So it is impossible, it is not necessary!  For such eyes you need to peck out! <br>  Grandfather was startled by clucking kurochkin and said grandmother: <br>  - You, old, of that ... Do not irritate the bird once again, it‚Äôs already some kind of anxious lately, it rushes at people with fists. <br>  ‚ÄúOkay, I won't,‚Äù the grandma replies. <br>  Since then, no one even stuttered about paying for food with passerine feathers. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) What is the difference between a passerine and a chicken feather? <br>  b) Why is Ryaba's chicken so excited? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) nothing. <br>  b) If grandma starts paying for food with passerine feathers, she will be able to retire.  Who, then, will produce products so that Ryaba‚Äôs chicken will exchange them for her feathers? <br><br>  <b>Task 8</b> <br><br>  Ryaba wanted to chick the hen all the time, and there was almost no feather left in the tail.  Then Ryaba's chicken said to the mouse: <br>  - Some kind of you are thin.  Are you malnourished? <br>  ‚ÄúI'm undernourished,‚Äù admitted the mouse. <br>  - Take three feathers, eat well and work with new forces.  And in a week you will return four feathers.  And you feel good, and I use. <br>  The mouse scratched her hollow belly and agreed. <br>  From that day, Ryaba's chick stopped pulling the feathers from her tail, and began to lend out, at interest. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Did the mouse win or lose from borrowing 3 feathers from the hen Ryaba? <br>  b) How much did the mouse win or lose? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) Lost. <br>  b) 1 feather. <br><br>  <b>Task 9</b> <br><br>  Once, grandfather and grandmother looked into the chicken coop and gasped from a myriad of golden eggs laid by speckled chicken. <br><br>  Dedka wanted to take the golden eggs, but Ryaba hen would not allow it. <br>  - Where are your hands stretched out?  My golden feathers are worth!  - she cackled. <br>  There were no extra feathers in grandfather and grandmother, everyone left for food.  Therefore, they did not touch the golden eggs of the hen Ryaba. <br>  Just in case Ryaba's hen hired a Bug to guard the henhouse from unwelcome visitors.  By that time there were so many feathers in Ryaba's hen that she could afford it. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Was Dedkur able to treat his radiculitis after the Bug hired to guard the hen house? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) Could not.  The bug stopped giving wool to her grandfather, because now she was getting feathers from Ryaba's hen. <br><br>  <b>Task 10</b> <br><br>  Dedad wondered why he was growing all day long ‚Äî he was growing a turnip, and he wasn‚Äôt adding feathers, while Ryaba hen and eggs didn‚Äôt carry normal eggs, and the whole chicken coop in gold and several feathers folded in the corner. <br><br>  Ryaba's hen noticed daddy's thoughtfulness and tells him: <br>  - Something does not like?  Well, let's get rid of feathers.  Let's write down on a piece of paper, who has how many feathers. <br>  So did. <br><br>  Now, with each purchase and sale, a certain amount of feathers was written off from the buyer's account, and added to the seller‚Äôs account.  But all the same, grandfather did not become richer, while Ryaba's hen got rich to indecency. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Why is the grandfather not enriched by the removal of feathers from circulation? <br>  b) Why did the hen Ryaba take the feathers out of circulation? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) What is the difference, exchange cash feathers or write down the available amount on a piece of paper?  What in the forehead, that on the forehead. <br>  b) Now the hen Ryaba could not pull the feathers from her tail, and not earn the feathers by borrowing them at interest, but simply enter the necessary amount of them in her piece of paper. <br><br>  <b>Task 11</b> <br><br>  In the end, Dedkov was so emaciated that he began to openly express discontent with radiculitis. <br>  - So the sciatica tortured or my feathers disliked ?!  - under the vicious yelping of the Bugs, Ryaba's hen crumbled.  - Okay, be it your way.  I propose to completely abandon the chicken feathers, and instead introduce cryptoons. <br>  - What do you think worth this thing?  - Dedk asked granddaughter. <br>  - You cho, older, not vchuhivaet at all?  - enthusiastically shook her granddaughter with pigtails.  - Kryptoyns are the coolest thing that can be the last squeak of modern technologies.  They are based on the blockchain! <br>  Dedik did not know what blockchain is, so he agreed to the cryptoons. <br>  Chicken Ryaba purchased equipment and began to mine cryptons.  And Dedkov didn‚Äôt have enough feathers to buy mining equipment for them, I had to grow a turnip in the garden again. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) What is the difference between writing feathers on paper and cryptoons? <br>  b) What education did granddaughter have? <br>  c) Why did the granddaughter advise grandfather and grandmother to settle for cryptons? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) The fact that the record on a piece of paper can be found, and the number of crypt nas in Ryaba's hen and you don‚Äôt know. <br>  b) IT. <br>  c) juvenile fool because.  She confused the technical realization of the media of exchange with their economic essence. <br><br>  <b>Task 12</b> <br><br>  Daddy tired of this katavasiya.  He took a blunt stick and for a start broke the Bug properly.  Then he went into the chicken coop and turned the hen to Ryaba's neck.  And what would you do if the chicken does not carry eggs, and all sorts of nonsense? <br><br>  He cooked Dad from Ryaba's chicken chicken soup and fed them his family.  Here and the end of the tale, and who read to the end, can get an MBA diploma. <br><br>  <u>Backfilling questions:</u> <br><br>  a) Did Dedk correctly? <br>  b) Who will lay the eggs now? <br>  c) What does the MBA diploma have to do with it? <br>  d) What did grandfather do with golden eggs? <br><br>  <u>Right answers:</u> <br><br>  a) Correct.  Chicken soup - delicious, do not die of hunger ?! <br>  b) No one.  We'll have to start a new chicken, probably. <br>  c) nothing to do with it. <br>  d) I purchased mining equipment on them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453976/</a></p>
