Indie games from eng. Independent - ‚Äúindependent‚Äù) are video games created independently of major publishers.  Most of the original free games also fall into this category.  Indie games are usually cheap or free, some of them being developed as open source.  The developers of indie games are most often led by ‚Äúnon-commercial‚Äù motives ‚Äî the desire for self-realization, the realization of their ideas and fantasies, some fame, etc. It can take years to create such a game or it can be completed in a few days or even hours, depending on its complexity. , participants, clearance. <br></blockquote><br><br>  A year and a half ago, I published a post-translation of " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/indie_games/31613">50 really good indie games</a> ." <br>  This cycle of posts is, so to speak, "second edition, revised and supplemented."  I sincerely hope that after reading you will find for yourself from two or more favorite games that you will always enjoy playing.

      In articles a huge number of links and text, it is quite possible that I somewhere made a mistake.  If you find one, please inform inbox or mail about it. <br><br>  It is worth saying that in some descriptions I use the slightly slang word ‚Äúbagel‚Äù - it turned out to be the most convenient.  What it means, you can read in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">almost the same name article</a> in Wikipedia. <br><br>  Enjoy! <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.miraigamer.net/cavestory/downloads_1.php">Cave story</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/552/de4/806/552de48064a3853bf9d829a8dc023e0c.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Cave story" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  This game is a true example of Japanese art.  A sad story honed to shine about cute rabbit-like creatures and a robot soldier suffering from amnesia.  Daisuki Amaya aka Pixel, as if a true wizard, brought me back to childhood, when an eight-bit processor worked wonders.  Actually, for the same reason, some young players do not understand the whole charm of the game and leave it without starting.  And after passing only once, you risk seeing not everything;) <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows ( <a href="http://www.shedevr.org.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D2033">Russian translation project</a> ).

And this he more than succeeded.  Believe me, in this game you will not be bored to die - just to die, because  she is incredibly complicated.  At the moment I have been buried 170 times and have never been congratulated on the victory.  And this does not bother you at all - each subsequent game is unique and unlikely to others.  To my joy and disappointment of the generation of the PlayStation One - old school music and graphics :) <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows, the expected version for Xbox 360, will cost money. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/68888">Post on Habr√© about Spelunky</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/darwinia/downloads/index.html">Darwinia</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/baf/134/018/baf134018fb5527fba1901639a91a218.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Darwinia" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  You never imagined, what could be the virtual world?  No, not the one that is WoW, but the one inside the computer.  The guys from Introversion didn‚Äôt quite succeed, but bad luck - they also imagined a virus!  And to deal with it, of course, the player will have to.  Darwinia skillfully combines elements of action, strategy and puzzles, she became the first indie game to reach the masses.  At one time, I was very surprised to learn that, from the graphic side, the game uses demoscene technologies - the main size of the game is its music files. <br><br>  <b>$ 16.60</b> . <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.clonk.de/cr.php%3Flng%3Den">Clonk rage</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s45.radikal.ru/i108/0912/45/2db640240bf0.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Clonk rage" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  True German quality - where else can you find a game in which you can arrange your life in this way (ok, Dwarf Fortress does not count)?  Advanced landscape physics, industrial and military development chains, partial openness of code for add-ons - this and much more contributed to the extensive community‚Äôs love for the game. <br><br>  <b>$ 22, the free version of the game is full-featured, but does not contain a bunch of delicious mods</b> . <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://intihuatani.usc.edu/cloud/flowing/">flOw</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/7b0/367/c1c/7b0367c1c119644bb16a8a2198e31b6d.png" width="150" height="150" alt="flOw" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Conceived as part of a thesis on the dynamic change of complexity in Enova Chen video games, this game is the first of the meditative games I have passed.  Being, in fact, a very, very advanced snake, flOw captivates the most pleasant picture and soothing music.  I assure you will get an unforgettable gaming experience. <br><br>  <b>Free flash version, $ 7.99 PS3</b> . <br>  Flash, PS3. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf fortress</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bbe/426/e3e/bbe426e3e3f4b2252a45362b1ee59737.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Dwarf fortress" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The depth and complexity of this game is simply amazing.  Most likely, Dwarf Fortress is the most detailed simulator on this planet.  The creators of the game, two brothers, have done a tremendous job, but despite this they think that their brainchild is far from being released.  The graphics in the game, one might say, no - by genre, it belongs to bagels.  Experts say that the gurus of the dwarf fortresses are like the characters of the ‚ÄúMatrix‚Äù - in the colorful symbols they see mountains, steppes, gnomes, walls, food ... <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows, Mac OS X. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/68968/">Post on Habr√© about Dwarf Fortress</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://koshutin.com/">Hammerfight</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s53.radikal.ru/i142/0912/f3/2241be81dabd.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Hammerfight" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Domestic development.  Fun game with an interesting story about the battle of pepelats fighting with swords, hammers, maces and a bunch of everything else that you will collect as you progress through the game.  A unique physics engine allows you to feel the brunt of controlling a flying barrel with various weapons.  The incomparable feeling of a successful strike bribed me from the first minute of the game and did not bother me during the whole adventure :) <br><br>  <b>$ 10</b> <br>  Windows <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/69663/">Waited for Hammerfall</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.chroniclogic.com/gish.htm">Gish</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/6a0/41e/d74/6a041ed745aa0bf0657bf4909169b02c.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Gish" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Surprisingly, the story about the resin ball, looking for his girlfriend can be interesting.  Especially when we are given to steer this ball.  And when we find out that he knows how to spin, shrink, jump and stick to everything ... And when it turns out that it is not easy to do all this ... In general, all this is enough to be a winner of IGF'05 :) <br><br>  <b>$ 20</b> <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://metanet.2.forumer.com/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D18527%26st%3D90">Death worm 2P</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/d7b/83b/f0c/d7b83bf0cb4548df09e44a35ec14386b.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Death worm 2P" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  A simple action game that perfectly took over the spirit of its original sources (Tremors, Dune, Beatlejus, and others).  As a result - the best (and only) sandworm simulator of all that you have ever played.  You can play together with two worms :) <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows  I will be very grateful to the finder of a good game link :) <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.toribash.com/downloads.php">Toribash</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/0b6/269/b05/0b6269b058b779e40c612b0a136e22aa.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Toribash" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Unique step-by-step fighting game with a good physics engine and the ability to control any joint of your protege.  I sincerely respect the comrades who have learned to play this game, because  I really like to watch their graceful fights and admire the cunning of the winner. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://nifflas.ni2.se/index.php%3Fpage%3D1003Knytt">Knytt</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e66/3ed/4aa/e663ed4aa85097f4570d3f0b2be4abc2.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Knytt" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  A magnificent silent trip across the expanses of an alien planet in search of parts of a crashed teleporter, filled with soothing music and an incredible atmosphere.  The game is long enough, but I would see it more as an advantage :) <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://zarat.us/tra/offline-games/eversion.html">Eversion</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea9/a44/afe/ea9a44afe4e8bb49fd199f73a8e7bd34.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Eversion" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Mario is more alive than dead.  This is also confirmed by indie developers who manage to add just one but significant feature to the concept of a simple platformer.  In this case, we have a multidimensional clone of a well-known game that adds a bit of logic to the classic gameplay.  And why in my eight-bit childhood there was no such game? <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://nifflas.ni2.se/index.php%3Fpage%3D1002Knytt%2BStories">Knytt Stories</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s51.radikal.ru/i131/0912/61/7fe830530002.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Knytt Stories" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Continued Knytt.  The kind developer added a few goodies, changing the gameplay only for the better.  If you like the original - do not pass by! <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://caravelgames.com/Articles/Games.html">Deadly Rooms of Death</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cfe/ca0/2b3/cfeca02b390457835e60c89620e20536.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Deadly Rooms of Death" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  A turn-based puzzle game in which you play an ‚Äúextraordinary underground scum fighter‚Äù, burdened to clear King Dugan's dungeons from cockroaches, goblins and other evil spirits.  With each move made, the monsters approach and, in order to defeat them, you must crush them with your Real Big Sword, which occupies a whole cage of the playing field.  Oddly enough, but the turn-based mechanics of the game very well fit into the overall concept.  Deadly Rooms of Death is considered one of the best (and underrated) indie games. <br><br>  <b>$ 20 for each episode</b> . <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://crawlj.sourceforge.jp/down_e.html">Dungeon crawl</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/f26/97f/38d/f2697f38decd79174ae4a7397dffff2c.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Dungeon crawl" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Allegedly based on Nethack, ADOM and other bagels, the game boldly introduces innovations into the genre, offering an expanded set of primary races and classes, as well as a diverse pantheon of gods that you can worship regardless of initial abilities.  Dungeon Crawl is more flexible and balanced than its predecessors, and in it the main logic and tactical skill than memorizing all the special features and abilities. <br><br>  <b>Free of charge</b> . <br>  Windows, Linux, <a href="http://www.magical-girl.com/crawl/">Mac OS X</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.tigsource.com/articles/2007/06/11/nikujin">Nikujin</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3b9/6aa/9d3/3b96aa9d36d6e7755bf62c9b9fda771b.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Nikujin" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Brutal hardcore game about nude ninja saboteur.  Despite the trivial management, you will not even have a training session immediately, let alone a campaign.  An interesting feature - the game Ikiki - author Nikujin - always turn out to be either hits or failures.  And this game is definitely a hit. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.datarealms.com/">Cortex Command</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/48b/5a4/4d5/48b5a44d5503b0555ab7df118c787a28.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Cortex Command" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  An amazing game in which you must defend against hordes of enemies from orbit, defending the vital brains needed to control your own units.  Exceptionally everything here is drawn in the style of Pixel-Art, and each pixel is a separate object.  This opens up a huge number of ways to kill enemies and distort the landscape.  For example, your unit may die from bleeding, because  his body is left with only a head, or you can crush a dozen enemies, dropping the landing craft on them.  Advanced AI, group tactics and an unusual physics engine are the main points of a large list of features that continues to grow.  The game is still in development, well, dozens of mods help the game to brighten up a long wait, changing the gameplay beyond recognition.  There is the possibility of playing Hot-Seat (up to four players with one computer). <br><br>  <b>$ 18</b> . <br>  Windows, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.venbrux.com/blog/%3Fp%3D107">Focus</a></b> </h3><img src="http://i023.radikal.ru/0912/41/7c49687514b2.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Focus" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Something reminiscent of the notorious N, Focus makes you learn to survive in the wildest conditions of your total destruction task.  The only thing that is in your arsenal (except for jumps, of course) is the ability to teleport for a short distance.  Like the heroes from the movie "X-Men" 2 and "Jumper", you will disappear, being on the verge of death.  But do not think that it will be easy - it will be terrible, terribly difficult! <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/">Battle for wesnoth</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/834/8b7/ed1/8348b7ed152b63f1a33097693530d466.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Battle for wesnoth" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Based on the game for SEGA Genesis <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsong">Warsong</a> (known in Japan as Langrisser), Battle for Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game that proves that loyal fans, united by a strong desire, can create great games.

Well, who would come up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a fighting game for passing about a humanoid rabbit Turner?  And not just how to do it, but one of the first among indie developers to apply ragdoll physics, and even attach to this a non-trivial combat system, which you cannot master from the first time.
