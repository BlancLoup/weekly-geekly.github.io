In our case, the latter take place, but still the main feature of the new models of ETegro Hyperion G4 servers is the significantly increased number of installed drives due to their transfer from 3.5-inch to 2.5-inch form factor.  For those who use SSD, such servers are much more convenient, and high-speed hard drives are increasingly moving to a 2.5-inch form factor, so such servers have long been no longer something that only a very limited user group needs.

      The filling can be extremely diverse, it is traditionally easy to pick it up for yourself in <a href="http://www.etegro.ru/configurator/servers/rackmount">our configurator</a> , so before reviewing the servers we only briefly recall the main features of the basic configurations: <br><ul><li>  Intel C602 Chipset </li><li>  up to 2x Intel Xeon E5-26xx processors </li><li>  24 slots with support for up to 768 GB of eight-channel DDR3 </li><li>  Network Adapters: 2 Intel Gigabit Ethernet I350BT2 </li><li>  1 (5 RS230 G4 SFF) slot PCI-Express 3.0 x16 </li><li>  Intel SAS RAID controller is offered as a daughter board with installation directly on the motherboard, while saving the standard PCI-E slots, or in the standard version of the expansion card </li><li>  An important feature of these platforms is the support of up to 2 expansion daughter cards from the set: SAS RAID controller LSI with 512MB of memory, SAS HBA controller or dual-port SFP + 10Gb Ethernet adapter.  They, in particular, significantly expand the flexibility of the younger model (RS 130 G4).  In the configurator are designated as mezz card </li><li>  Monitoring and control are implemented through the BMC processor and the KVM over IP function </li><li>  10 compartments for installation of hard drives with hot swapping with access from the front panel (24 bays + 2 spaces for 2.5 "drives with hot swapping on the back of the case in the case of RS230) </li><li>  750 W (1100W) chassis with dual hot-swappable power supply;  Intel Node Management support </li></ul><br><br>  And now - slides)) Let's start with the ETegro Hyperion RS130 G4 SFF model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/700/c53/e97/700c53e9765df6a8b378d11b04e8e9b9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e0/052/8a7/3e00528a7a409f19c474a2fbe1db1bef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a21/c91/916/a21c91916cc5541fb57e8f7a8f4986bd.jpg"><br><br>  The most radical difference is, of course, the front panel.  Instead of the usual slide with hot-plug under 3.5-inch drives, arranged in 4 in a row, in a 1U server there are five slides for 2.5-inch drives located in 2 floors.  In order not to go far, we will immediately look at 2U: in it the entire front panel is occupied by a long row of 2.5-sled, set vertically.  All the usual functionality in the form of hot plugging, convenient access and indication is in place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71a/f67/e70/71af67e7009834ffc45eccd83d59465b.jpg"><br><br>  The main ‚Äústuffing‚Äù of the platform remains the same as in conventional models - two processors and 24 memory slots occupy most of the board.  Pay attention to the shaper air flow - it would seem a trifle, but its presence and form, even in a 1U package, very significantly depends on the temperature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/116/0eb/5e8/1160eb5e8226a6cabeeb94c8a90c67cb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ea/30a/6b5/6ea30a6b5fa53687977ab58296f47291.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3c2/05c/cf3/3c205ccf349f104fa1b1d531b25de62f.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately before the air casing there are two blocks of three powerful dual fans in each.  Fans are made easily removable and installed using special rubber studs.  Between them, there is a seat for the battery power cache of the RAID controllers - perhaps, this is the only place in the case where it can in principle be located. <br>  Estimate the distance between the fans and the rear part of the disk basket - if we needed to carry our own wires (power supply and interface cables) to each disk, and not common ones to the basket, we would simply have no place to place them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05f/c61/240/05fc61240dadf8ac8b8bd0d68cccd3ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94b/937/274/94b93727450e3520ef435fb2d26c9fef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a9/9f7/f74/1a99f7f7461fed5b995dc63e4976528c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/afb/f5a/725/afbf5a72501a17b90ecf7b57403d4dbc.jpg"><br><br>  All remaining space in the case is reserved for expansion cards, which are traditionally placed in such cases with a raiser - a special design that allows you to "rotate" the connectors and arrange expansion cards parallel to the system board. <br>  All sorts of controllers are located here, such as a service processor or an integrated RAID controller and a few surface mount elements.  Especially attentive can see even the special Intel service connector on the last photo.  But in our opinion, the most interesting are still two connectors for special expansion cards, which are located close to the power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f91/e77/59c/f91e7759c9a473fad5af52b1712cf384.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d71/5bc/396/d715bc396f7775b4deb715626606121f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/153/287/f7c/153287f7c4ad49baec1246040b22000c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/747/9c6/eae/7479c6eaef629dad45c0ef1f851990d1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0b/a27/04b/a0ba2704b9762a4558893fecf9c83190.jpg"><br><br>  The design of these expansion cards is fully developed specifically for this series of servers.  They are quite compact and are installed parallel to the motherboard and regardless of the standard slots.  That is why it was possible to increase the available server functionality.  Here are 3 possible expansion cards, top to bottom: SAS RAID, SAS HBA and a network card with two 10G ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/842/710/c22/842710c22e46e3d69d86e2d98e48d9ea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5e8/2d1/a77/5e82d1a77ad3f0a71b6fc279bd6aa5ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6e6/862/fa5/6e6862fa502ea3c058f0fcfc433a5554.jpg"><br><br>  Power supplies remain unchanged - we still use compact, fast-recovery models.  A high degree of compactness is achieved by simplifying the design: it is not a bundle of wires that goes from the block to the board, but only a special connector.  Naturally, as part of the protection against failures, it is possible to install a second power supply unit with hot switching between them. <br><br>  Well, now let's quickly go over the differences between the 2U version of the ETegro Hyperion RS230 G4 SFF.  We have already seen the front panel, so immediately inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf0/e32/508/cf0e32508616961360363fa321243e66.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d9f/bb4/d91/d9fbb4d91ae7babe27b2a047a695f1e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad4/ed5/2e2/ad4ed52e20519e0fded7f3808c64366d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/998/c3f/09b/998c3f09bca70a20e1c8247d6db8f142.jpg"><br><br>  The vertical placement of the discs noticeably changes the front part: we have a new basket (still, the discs are not only different in form factor, but they are also twice as large).  Behind them again, the thick fans, however, are now single, but on the other hand, of a larger diameter and occupying the entire width.  The plastic air casing increased in size and ‚Äúsheltered‚Äù on itself a seat under the battery of the RAID controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f08/b35/298/f08b352986d64f4262442f36e055fb9b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f0/99d/097/4f099d097c82a26b2c0a3ae3dcad3be3.jpg"><br><br>  The height of the case has increased, which means we have more opportunities to install expansion cards.  In 2U, you can install up to 5 full-fledged pieces with the help of a raiser, plus subsidiary miniature cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24a/c26/8cf/24ac268cf51c10ddff50b98d84a8eaf2.jpg"><br><br>  Above the power supply appeared a free space - and we decided that it was unbecoming for him to remain empty.  Therefore, in it we placed another small basket on two discs (with a sled and hot plug - everything is as it should be).  Someone wants to place system disks here, someone - cache SSD - everything is in your hands. <br><br>  If something is unclear or you want to learn more about something, feel free to contact us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167693/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167693/</a></p>
