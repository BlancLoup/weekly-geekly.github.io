  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The lack of mass must be compensated by speed.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the Internet, everyone believes too much in technology and prays for beautiful tags.  Ok, Web 2.0, user generated content, tags, blogs, bookmarks, feeds, reflective logos, plus the obligatory inscription ‚Äúbeta‚Äù.  In Russia, all this is traditionally reinforced by the arguments "not, that ... made a beautiful service, then Googgle (Yahoo, Microsoft, substitute to taste) bought them for mad grandmas."  I do not argue, the amount of sales of Western startups fascinate. <br><br>  We have (for now) the process of really mass launching of vague startups proudly declaring ‚Äúwe are Web 2.0 too‚Äù is not too noticeable, but look to the West.  A lot of overlapping services that are virtually no different.  What is it about your service?  Tags, feeds, comments, the ability to create content yourself ... Everything?  Yes, we are no worse than others. <br><br>  However, let's look at a specific example: 42 (so, just in case, once again slowly and in words: <i>forty-two</i> ) of the bookmark service.  Do not believe?  See:

At the same time, I am sure that most of these services appeared when there were already other similar services.  Fight for users when there is already a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãcompetitors?  What is your advantage?  Why should I leave the service that I use now and leave for you? <br><br>  You may not have particularly compelling advantages, but at least tell the user what and how.  Find the one item that the user will mark even before they decide to try.  And it can be anything - design, usability, speed, interface in the native language, the ability to work with PDAs, more disk space, and you never know! <br><br>  Well, as long as it was a scientifically assaults, setting out what everyone can calmly think about for 5 minutes.  And now, briefly and to the point: our startups, which is very nice, began to send bloggers links to their projects.  Thank!  It's great, helpful and very comfortable!  But please, tell at least in two words what makes you unique and interesting.  Understand, it is necessary not only for me, it is necessary for your users.  The mythical ‚Äútypical user‚Äù is unlikely to carefully consider your service and look for what is good in it.  If there is a choice, the user will simply go where no need to look for anything.  If they sent me a link to a service similar to a dozen others, and I have no idea what its zest is, then I‚Äôm unlikely to look at it for a long time.  If, in response to a question about what is unique to you, you proudly answer with a 2-line letter and messages about your plans for ‚Äúintegration with Flickr‚Äù, which, as it turns out, is exactly that you can take photos from there, then I do not want to watch the service. <br><br>  This Microsoft can afford <a href="http://www.telnews.ru/news.php%3Fid%3D1271">not to advertise the output of any of their social project</a> .  Several tens of thousands of users will appear there without a clear concept and meaningful explanation of why this service.  But you are not Microsoft !!!  The lack of mass must be compensated by speed, brightness, originality. <br><br>  In Russia, startups, in principle, need to be more careful.  The local market is far from being so monetary.  Do not think that in case of failure, you can, say, <a href="http://www.ajaxplanet.ru/poiskovik-po-shodnoy-tsene/">sell your project on eBay</a> for a hundred or two thousand dollars.  Will not succeed.  A similar announcement on some ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù will remain an anecdote and no more.  The amounts are fundamentally different - shit, say, <a href="http://www.news2.ru/">News2</a> and <a href="http://www.digg.com/">Digg</a> .  I read about Digg, that the profit for this year will be 200 million dollars.  I am sure that Alexander Zhitnitsky does not even think about one percent of this amount.  And for some reason, those who want to buy <a href="http://www.blogsummit.ru/">BlogSummit</a> or <a href="http://www.itblogs.ru/">IT Blogs</a> for several million purely unconditional units are not yet visible either. <br><br>  So be unique or the best or just compelling.  Please do not focus on technology, remember about users, texts and images. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4740/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4740/</a></p>
