You are pleased that you do good to others. <br><br>  I spent a lot of time on dating sites.  By the number of contacts on the ‚ÄúMamba‚Äù, I am probably a record holder in Russia. <br><br>  About 12 million people are registered at Mamba and its partners.  Twelve million is half (according to some data, one third) of Internet users in Russia! <br><br>  I wonder how many of the regular readers of Habr are on dating sites?  Probably twenty percent, and maybe more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dating sites are a salvation from loneliness.  In my opinion, many visitors of dating sites (according to my data, a quarter) are people with serious mental (or psychological) problems.  The number of prostitutes is large on these resources;  about the same - insurance agents and sellers of dietary supplements ... <br><br>  One third of visitors to such sites are chronophages, that is, eaters of someone else's time. <br><br>  Yes, there is Odnoklassniki, there is Vkontakte.  But people are few and few, everyone wants a different kind of communication: look for not only a sexual partner, but a congenial person, friend, soul mate, regardless of gender, age, faith, nationality ... <br><br>  We decided to try to create a new network - a community of smart, kind, intelligent, educated people. <br><br>  We want to organize this network from among our students who <a href="http://school.ergosolo.ru/">study</a> at the <a href="http://school.ergosolo.ru/">SOLO-online</a> school. <br><br>  We will do this gradually, without haste.  People, passing our course of study, will begin to get to know each other in the process of training, and then (I hope so) will help each other. <br><br>  Today you can see the photos, read the short descriptions of "About Me", choose the one who is closer to you in spirit and hobbies. <br><br>  Our school is online a few months.  While 22 thousand people registered. <br><br>  We conditionally paid. <br><br>  If a person has no money (the cost of staying on our site for a month is 150 rubles, for three months - 300 rubles, for two days - 25 rubles, registration is free), and he will write us a letter asking him to do it for free - we will execute his request. <br><br>  I'm a brash man.  I think boldness is a wonderful quality.  That is, not insolence in communication, when you can get to rudeness, and insolence comes from the word ‚Äúaudacity‚Äù, when you really want to improve yourself and your environment, and maybe the world. <br><br>  I would like to do on our site without advertising, only due to voluntary contributions.  But if I succeed, I don‚Äôt know.  I believe that in the Internet community there are a hundred thousand or maybe two hundred of our like-minded people. <br><br>  And yet: we plan to soon translate our site into several languages ‚Äã‚Äã- English, French, German, Polish, Italian, Czech, Ukrainian, Lithuanian.  What for?  And in order to unite people not only of our country, but also of other states. <br><br>  I know that in five years, a maximum of ten, it is the Internet that will determine much in the political life of the world. <br><br>  Your Vladimir Vladimirovich Shakhidzhanyan. <br><br>  Often in the evenings, at 22:00 Moscow time, I spend (I will be today) <a href="http://ergosolo.ru/broadcast/">live broadcasts</a> on the Internet, where I discuss.  the ability to create a new network.  Judging by the first broadcasts, my idea is supported in Ukraine, in Lithuania, in the Czech Republic and in many cities of Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78352/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78352/</a></p>
