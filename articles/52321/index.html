  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Registering as an Individual Entrepreneur for freelance: Why and how?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After my article ‚Äú <a href="http://boliev.com/archives/367">Freelance: Expectations, Reality, Recognition,</a> ‚Äù several people immediately turned to me with a question about the legal problems in the work of freelance.  I will say right away that I am far from a lawyer, but at one time I made myself a PI, just for freelance, and therefore I have experience, and some knowledge in this area, and I can share it.  Although of course my conclusions may be erroneous, and for lawyers this article will surely cause a slight smile (or an attack of irritation), I will say it again, I just want to share my experience and tell you how I registered as an entrepreneur and what this piece of paper gave me. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Registration </h4><br>  Contrary to the general delusion, it turned out to be easier to get formalized as an individual entrepreneur.  The whole procedure took a week, and about a thousand rubles.  At first I applied to the tax office where I was charged 20 rubles, and I was handed a package of documents: a folder (you know such white folders, with a big inscription ‚ÄúBUSINESS #‚Äù), a questionnaire and a list of necessary documents ... something I could miss, more than a year passed ... Then I filled out the questionnaire, assured the notary (+ 200rub.) and brought it back to the tax.  In the tax I was handed a receipt (600rub.) Which I paid to the Sberbank.  Bank, and a week later, voila, voff is now an Individual Entrepreneur, one might say a businessman, a big man ... <br><br>  Some difficulty arose with the choice of the type of activity, because there is no such type of activity as website development.  After a long listing of the directory with the listed activities and their codes (OKVED - All-Russian Classification of Economic Activities), I chose the number 72.20 (Software development and consulting in this area) and 72.60 (Other activities related to the use of computers and information technology).  This is not a licensed activity, which means you will not have to score a head with any licenses. <br><br>  And of course taxation.  I chose a simplified tax system.  It is of two types: <br><ul><li>  You pay 6% of the total turnover (that is, all the money you earn) </li><li>  You pay 15%, but only from income (Total turnover minus expenses) </li></ul><br>  I chose the first option, because the expenses are not so big, and to report on the expenses - I think it‚Äôs not a simple matter (I hate keeping checks). <br>  On top of your entrepreneurial image, it would be nice to order yourself a seal that we will put on the contract.  The stamps can be ordered for any taste and color, in any desk of the type ‚ÄúSeals and Stamps‚Äù from 200 rubles and more.

    <h4>  Acceptance of payments. </h4><br>  As you know, you can take money from a client in two ways: <br><ul><li>  Cash </li><li>  Cashless </li></ul><br>  Here you need to know one thing, the fact is that when a client gives you money, he must account for these expenses to the accounting department (or tax), and he needs a check from you, which brings us to the problem: where to get the checks. <br>  If you accept money in cash, then you need a cash register, and this thing is not cheap, it costs from 15,000 of the most genuine Russian rubles and higher ... So I personally immediately dismissed the cash, and accepted payments only in the second way: by bank transfer.  It's all much easier.  You need a business account in any bank (I stopped at the Bank of Moscow).  To issue an invoice, you are given a package of documents, you collect them, fill out, certify and open an account.  Prices are different everywhere, but personally I pay 500 rubles a month for account maintenance, and about 2 percent for withdrawing money.  Although if the money is not withdrawn from a bank, but transferred to a credit card (provided that the Bank of Moscow credit card), then 2% turn into 0.2%, which pleases.  When choosing a bank, pay attention to their Internet services.  In the same Bank of Moscow there is a wonderful thing ‚ÄúInternet Banking‚Äù, with the help of which I can at any time access the balance on my account, all operations, print out a statement ... well, in general, it is convenient. <br><br><h4>  Do you need it? </h4><br>  The first thing that surprised me was that employers do not like non-cash payments, and do not like to sign contracts ... It is clear with contracts, all the same, the forwarding of contracts is time, and there is usually no time.  As for cashless settlement, I didn‚Äôt understand what the problem was, but the fact remains that for a year as a freelancer, I used my entrepreneurial opportunities four times, and then for local (not freelacne'erskikh) orders. <br><br>  As a result, it is worth making business if you are going to provide services not only remotely, but also for companies from your city.  Here, of course, it is possible without entrepreneurship, under an employment contract, but this is a matter of prestige.  If you position yourself as a studio, it is better to be an entrepreneur, if as a free artist, then an employment contract is enough, only not every company will deal with a free artist ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52321/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52321/</a></p>
