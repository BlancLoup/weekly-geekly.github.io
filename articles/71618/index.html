Everyone knows what it is. <br><br>  For many years everything was quite traditional, when often the student didn‚Äôt really know what was expected of him, but the teacher thought about what to take the student and was angry at the lack of initiative (it happens otherwise, of course, but it happens often).

      The head of our department (AS software), an exceptionally sane, albeit middle-aged professor, introduces a list to those students not just in the form of a topic, but with a detailed description: <br><br>  1. Theme. <br>  2. Detailed statement of the problem. <br>  3. Practical value. <br>  4. Novelty (reserve for the future when a person becomes a graduate student or graduate student). <br>  5. Approximate topics of the chapters of the work. <br>  6. Requirements for software. <br><br>  Maybe in other universities this has been done for a long time, but for me, for example, this practice is new and I meet it with pleasure.  Students will also be easier;  possible conflicts with the head of the diploma will be dealt with by the head in detail and meaningfully. <br><br>  But quite litdybra.  Most of the time I do the web, I teach the same subject in the university, and therefore it is quite obvious that the topics of my degrees are also related to the Internet. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will show the topics and my plans for students for their implementation.  I would like the views of the habrasoobshchestva and separate students of 3-4 courses of IT specialties about the prospects. <br><br>  Terminology is near science, otherwise it is impossible.  Under the concept of the Model everywhere hides a deep formal description of properties, relationships, patterns, based on the analysis of the object and other researchers. <br><br><h4>  1. Development of an automated web environment monitoring system </h4><br>  <b>Detailed formulation of the problem</b> <br>  Investigate the need for monitoring the web environment for search engines, site administrators, sociological services, security services, and Internet service providers.  Develop a web environment model, formulate a monitoring task. <br>  Review decisions in the field of monitoring, formulate criteria for the quality of decisions, substantiate the relevance of developing a monitoring system or refine existing ones, develop a plan for implementing the system. <br>  Develop an algorithmic, informational, methodological support system. <br>  Implement a prototype or subsystem of an automated monitoring system. <br><br>  <b>Practical value</b> <br>  Development of software solutions aimed at monitoring the web environment, demanded in many aspects of information technology. <br>  Creation of a prototype monitoring system. <br><br>  <b>Novelty</b> <br>  Web environment model.  Information and methodological support. <br><br>  <b>Approximate topics of the chapters of the work</b> <br>  1. Pre-project study of the web environment and monitoring tasks.  Review of decisions, problem statement <br>  2. Building a web environment model, developing monitoring requirements <br>  3. Algorithmic and methodical support <br>  4. Implementation of the prototype or subsystem speakers <br><br>  <b>Software Requirements</b> <br>  The solution should fully perform the functions of the monitoring system described in the work.  Extensive use of off-the-shelf software solutions and open libraries is allowed and approved.  The student should write with his own hands what is not ready. <br><br>  <b>Prospects for implementation</b> <br>  Internet (service launch), introduction to the enterprise intranet. <br><br><h4>  2. Development of models and methods for analyzing the behavior of web site visitors (person in the web environment). </h4><br>  <b>Detailed formulation of the problem</b> <br>  Analyze the need for analyzing human behavior on the Internet.  Develop a model of the web environment and human behavior.  Develop criteria for evaluating the results of the analysis of the behavior of website visitors.  Conduct a review of ready-made solutions (Counters, Google Analytics, CMS web analytics systems). <br>  Make and justify the decision to create a system for analyzing behavior.  Make a plan for implementation. <br><br>  <b>Practical value</b> <br>  The system of analysis of human behavior in the web environment.  Methods and algorithms for collecting data from the web environment, with wide application. <br><br>  <b>Novelty</b> <br>  The model of the web environment, the model of human behavior. <br>  Approximate topics of the chapters of the work: <br>  1. Pre-project study of the problem of human behavior in the web environment.  Review of decisions, problem statement <br>  2. Building a model of the web environment, human behavior, development of requirements for an adaptive interface <br>  3. Algorithmic and methodical support <br>  4. Implementation of the prototype or subsystem speakers <br><br>  <b>Software Requirements</b> <br>  The solution should fully or partially perform the function of analyzing the behavior of a person described in the work.  Extensive use of off-the-shelf software solutions and open libraries is allowed and approved.  The student should write with his own hands what is not ready.  It is not the amount of code that is appreciated, but the universality of the solution.  A huge plus will be the successful launch of a free service on the Web. <br><br>  <b>Prospects for implementation</b> <br>  Internet (service launch), creating a plug-in for CMS or a system for analyzing human behavior based on client-side scripts. <br><br><h4>  3. Development of models and methods for automated adaptation of interfaces to user needs </h4><br>  <b>Detailed formulation of the problem</b> <br>  Develop the idea that analyzing user behavior and making appropriate decisions about hiding, rearranging, transferring control elements to the quick launch panel can improve user convenience and the effectiveness of its work with the interface. <br>  Analyze the methods of building user interfaces, identify stages, techniques and heuristics, where information about user behavior and subject to automation can be used. <br>  Develop a model of the interface and user behavior, develop algorithmic and methodological software to automate the adaptation of the interface. <br>  Implement the layout of the software interface adaptation system on the example of the content management system of a web site or personal account of a web service user. <br><br>  <b>Practical value</b> <br>  Models and algorithms for working with an adaptive interface.  Algorithms for adapting interfaces of web systems. <br><br>  <b>Novelty</b> <br>  Models and algorithms for working with an adaptive interface.  Algorithms for adapting interfaces of web systems. <br><br>  <b>Approximate topics of the chapters of the work</b> <br>  1. Pre-project study of methods of building interfaces and human behavior in them.  Review of decisions, problem statement <br>  2. Building a model of the interface, human behavior, development of requirements for an adaptive interface <br>  3. Algorithmic and methodical support <br>  4. Implementation of the prototype or subsystem speakers <br><br>  <b>Software Requirement</b> <br>  Implement the layout of the software interface adaptation system on the example of the content management system of a web site or personal account of a web service user.  Make extensive use of the relevant web system API. <br><br>  What do you say, dear?  HS or progress? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71618/</a></p>
