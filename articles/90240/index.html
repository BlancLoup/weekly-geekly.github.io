  <section class="page js-page"><h1>UFNS-queues from the point of view of the programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, an attempt was made to obtain an extract from the Unified State Register for one organization.  The attempt failed, about which I would like to tell and discuss the situation from the point of view of an IT person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  First stage </h4>  To get an extract from the Incorporation - to make a request and transfer it to the UFNS Expedition.  There were no difficulties, the request was made in a printed form and I personally went to the Expedition's office.  The queues there are small, the receipt of the request is made quickly (less than a minute), the office is open all working day.  It is not clear for me only why it is impossible to issue a request through e-mail or through the terminal.  Receipt of an extract is not necessary, we are happy. <br><h4>  Second phase </h4>  Already more interesting - to find out if the statement is ready.  You need to somehow find out that the statement is ready and you need to come to get it.  By the way, there are two options for receiving an extract - either getting it in your hands (this should be indicated explicitly in the request), or sent by mail.  It simplifies the fact that the production time is exactly 5 days.  You can find out either by phone or try to come and find out from the issue window.  And to clarify the readiness of the statement you need to know its incoming number.  A copy of the request was stamped, but no incoming number is indicated there.  I was probably lucky and got a polite girl, who by phone found and dictated the number of my incoming document.  I was delighted, the document is ready, I can come ... And here comes an even more interesting stage. <br><h4>  Stage Three </h4>  Getting a statement.  Arriving on the same day (Friday), I found out that receiving an extract takes place in a place called ‚Äúconference room‚Äù (as was written on the ad), which I had been looking for for quite some time.  Because in reality it was called something like "Hall for visitors and paperwork."  Issuance of statements is made only 1 hour on Friday and 2 hours on a weekday, from 15.00 to 17.00.  Why so - it is not clear.  Further - worse.  Having stood near the closed window at number 2 for almost 15 minutes, I accidentally caught a girl looking out of plastic blinds to find out that this window was not the right department and I need to go to another window at number 2 ... Ie  There is neither a floor plan, nor a clear window structure.  Having reached the desired second window, another shock awaited me ‚Äî a line of 120 people.  It was a funny moment when it turned out that in order to get into the queue you need to write your surname on A4 paper under the free number, which is very ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù located in the corner behind the whole crowd.  I was not ready to defend such a queue, because I went to work. <br><h4>  Stage Four </h4>  "You came, and we sent your statement by mail."  Having escaped from work and asked for indefinite time, I went again to receive an extract in about a week and a half.  Once in the queue at number 68 (writing myself down on a piece of paper A4, and there are no pens there, I had to ask my neighbor to lend the instrument for a minute).  Defending about 45!  minutes  to me, the girl outside the window politely replies that my statement has been mailed to the physical address of the organization.  To a reasonable question, why it was sent by mail, whereas in the request it was written in black and white ‚Äúto hand out‚Äù, a calm answer was received ‚Äúwell, did you come for the first time?  Yesterday we picked up the weekly documents and sent them by mail. ‚Äù <br>  I will not express my entire storm, many probably and so will understand, that I wanted to say to the girl.  I will try to describe the questions that I had in the process of receiving the statement.  Perhaps someone can tell the answer to them. <br><ul><li>  What are the reasons why it is impossible to place an order for an extract without coming personally?  No documents were requested upon receipt of the request. </li><li>  Why it is impossible to make a service (at least a terminal) to receive a report on the status of the document execution?  I personally witnessed when a woman stood in line for an hour and it turned out that the document was not yet ready. </li><li>  Why it is impossible to make an ‚Äúelectronic queue‚Äù, as in some institutions (branches of banks or mobile operators)?  He came in, clicked on the desired button on the terminal and received a ticket with a number.  Then calmly wait for the number on the board and calmly go to the window.  Instead, you need not only to write down your surname under the number, but also to run around the entire hall, look for the person recorded under the number in front of you. </li></ul></div>
