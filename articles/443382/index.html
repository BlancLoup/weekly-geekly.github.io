      The Russian Public Opinion Research Center (VTsIOM) <a href="https://wciom.ru/index.php%3Fid%3D236%26uid%3D9581">provides</a> data on the frequency of use of bank cards by Russians to pay for goods and services.  As it turned out, over the last 4-5 years, 87% of respondents began to pay more often with cards. <br><br>  75% of those surveyed said that if they had both a card and cash with them, they would rather pay with a card.  The choice is determined by the convenience of card payments and the possibility of receiving bonuses from the bank. <br><br>  The card is most often chosen to pay for goods and services in online stores (92%) and in electronics stores.  When choosing the card itself, the respondents took into account the cost of maintenance and the availability of bonus programs.  If the bank increases the size of the commission or cancels preferential terms under which the commission is not charged, then 59% of users reduce the amount of use of such a card, and 17% stop working with it. <br><br><h3>  "World" launched analog Apple Pay </h3><br>  World cardholders <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5c7d04089a794772bbcfbc7f">can</a> now <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/5c7d04089a794772bbcfbc7f">take advantage of the</a> Apple Pay / Google Pay national equivalent, called <a href="https://mironline.ru/mirpay/">Mir Pay</a> .  The payment service can be used by all owners of Android-based smartphones (of course, provided they are clients of banks connected to the Mir system). <br><br>  In order to start working with the service, you need to download the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.nspk.mirpay">Mir Pay application</a> in the Play Market.  It is possible to pay with the help of a new payment service in any terminal where ‚ÄúMir‚Äù contactless cards are accepted.  The NPCS note that the protection of payment transactions in Mir Pay will be provided in full compliance with international security standards. <br><br>  In December 2018, the Mir system, which was never able to connect to Google Pay and Apple Pay (but succeeded with Samsung Pay), announced the development of its own mobile contactless payment application, which is available only for Android OS. <br><br>  Version for iOS <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/finances/18/12/2018/5c17c7449a79475624d8c8a7">will not</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Only those whom they want to let go are allowed inside. </blockquote><br>  <i>Vladimir Komlev, head of NSPK, about the iOS platform</i> <br><br><h3>  Canceled a total ban on cash withdrawals from anonymous wallets and cards </h3><br>  Last February, the State Duma <a href="https://vc.ru/legal/60269-vlasti-rossii-peredumali-vvodit-polnyy-zapret-na-snyatie-nalichnyh-s-anonimnyh-koshelkov-i-kart">adopted in its first reading a government bill</a> prohibiting withdrawing money from prepaid non-name cards and anonymous online wallets without full identification.  As it turned out, by the second reading this norm was abandoned. <br><br>  Currently, the law allows to withdraw <a href="https://normativ.kontur.ru/document%3FmoduleId%3D1%26documentId%3D324611%26rangeId%3D173044">up to 5,000 rubles per day and 40,000 rubles per month</a> from prepaid cards and anonymous wallets.  In the new edition of the draft law, the relevant committee of the State Duma on the financial market recommended maintaining this possibility.  However, only under the condition of passing the simplified identification.  To do this, the user needs to call the service passport data and phone number. <br><br>  After passing the identification, the user is given the opportunity to transfer funds to a bank account of a legal entity or an individual entrepreneur, to his bank account or to pay off a debt to a credit institution. <br><br><h3>  40% of AI startups don't really work with AI </h3><br><br>  As it turned out, not everything is an AI startup that has a mention of artificial intelligence in the title.  About 40% of companies that position themselves as AI startups <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/40-percent-of-ai-start-ups-in-europe-not-related-to-ai-mmc-report.html">actually</a> do this to attract the attention of investors.  And with artificial intelligence, they have nothing in common. <br><br>  And there is a reason to pretend, since since 2015, AI companies have attracted 15-20% more capital in rounds of financing than traditional software companies.  Their capitalization was also higher. <br><br>  According to experts, the results are quite objective, because companies are trying to make themselves more attractive to investors.  Various methods are used, including embellishment. <br><br>  In general, as in the story about the manufacturer of cold tea and the word "blockchain" in the name of the company.  The words are different, but the methods are the same. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443382/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443382/</a></p>
