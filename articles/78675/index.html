Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <sup>* or how to take the whole weekend for half a year ahead.</sup> <br><br>  The second part of the grand selection of indie games for Habrahabr readers.  A start was made in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/78674/">this post</a> . <br><br>  Why is everything stretched into four parts, and not in one post?  No, I'm not chasing a rating.  Initially, I wanted to shove everything in one post, but something did not work on the technical side.  The post is quite large - about 85 kilobytes of one text.  Then I wrote to tech support, and dear <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/shoohurt/" class="user_link">Shoohurt</a> answered me: <br><blockquote>  Igor &lt;xrazont@gmail.com&gt; <br>  I want to post a relatively large topic (~ 85 kilobytes of text with tags), but it does not work - after clicking on the "send" button, nothing happens at first, and then the message "Some error ... We know ..." comes out.  Is it really better for me to wait for this problem (if it‚Äôs a problem at all) to be fixed, or to post it some other way?  I would not like to cut the post apart.

      Alexander Savitsky &lt;as@thematicmedia.ru&gt; <br>  This is not exactly a bug, but rather a feature of the posting mechanism on Habr√©.  Ideally, it is better to post such big topics in parts (you can do it one by one at a time).  Otherwise, we will have to tinker with this topic manually, which is hardly good :) <br></blockquote><br>  I immediately thought that it was not worth a spar and divided the post into four.  But now you can write a dozen more!  The truth is that so many games will not be good ... <br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://2dboy.com/games.php">World of goo</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s13.radikal.ru/i186/0912/b5/9c07d5b025bd.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="World of goo" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Inspired by Pontifex, World of Goo, which shot the whole world, has become one of the most popular indie games.  Surprisingly, collecting towers and other masterpieces of architectural Goo-art from living mud drops can be a very meditative process, requiring some preparation and delivering true enjoyment to the strength of the whole structure.  A great soundtrack perfectly contributes to all this! <br><br>  <b>$ 20</b> <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Wii. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/42688/">Post on Habr√© about World of Goo</a> <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.elecorn.com/caster3d/">Caster</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i089/0912/90/1e67aed8e2d7.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Caster" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Episodic multiplatform third-person shooter, where we manage an ultra-fast lad who kills some monsters and restores the surrounding nature.  At first, everything is pretty boring, but as you progress you will get the ability to move very quickly and jump high and far - it is this feature of the game that makes it so hurricane. <br><br>  <b>$ 5</b> . <br>  Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, iPhone. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://ragdollkungfu.com/download.html">Rag doll kung fu</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s55.radikal.ru/i148/0912/38/7c82fd401546.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Rag doll kung fu" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  This game was the first indie game sold on the well-known Steam service.  Created by the designer from Lionhead Studios, Rag Doll Kung Fu is the best fighting game in which there are mushrooms for a reason, in which you can fly into space, in which there are parody videos shot in the backyard.  If you have not played in it for so many years - you know what to do next weekend;) <br><br>  <b>$ 15</b> . <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://adamcadre.ac/if.html">Varicella</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c21/491/82f/c2149182f5ac2e99fa6d28922f2d2674.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Varicella" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  An innovative game of the genre of Interactive Fiction, wise and inspired by history.  As Primo Varicella, the palace minister of Palazzo del Piemonte, you must take a powerful position while fighting rivals and other interested parties (for example, your dead younger brother‚Äôs crazy wife) in court.  This is a game in which every decision must be made wisely and repeatedly reviewed. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows binary, Cross-platform (java-powered). <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.ragdollsoft.com/ragdollmasters/">Ragdoll masters</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a8/5f6/1a7/3a85f61a7a971a28f4df05960ba61048.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Ragdoll masters" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa fighting game in which you control the cursor arrows of a flying prot√©g√© turned out to be extremely playable.  A great example is a simple and utterly difficult game, which in fact turns out to be quite complicated to complete. <br><br>  <b>$ 10</b> <br>  Windows, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www18.big.or.jp/~hikoza/Prod/">Warning Forever</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/43f/4cf/822/43f4cf822e9974b508733e02ac50e6f7.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Warning Forever" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  A shooter game consisting of a continuous stream of battles against a single opponent, each time becoming stronger, forcing the player to change tactics.  Because of its uniformity (in the good sense of the word) and intense gameplay, this game is considered one of the canonical indie shooters and a great addition to the genre as a whole. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.igneousgame.com/">Igneous</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af8/997/0c3/af89970c339f7e92dd9579376bc75e7f.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Igneous" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  ‚ÄúThat was supposed to be Sonic 3D,‚Äù they say.  And for good reason they say.  I haven‚Äôt seen such a crazy drive and intoxicating speed for a long time in games (in some ways the sensations of the game reminded me of the feelings of passing Serious Sam).  Even if the level is only three - it should not stop you from playing.  Let's rock! <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/">Orisinal</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5fc/a28/8c8/5fca288c82a72554e1e677e3ec2eb522.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Orisinal" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  This is not a game, but a collection of games.  The Orisinal Ferry Halima series uses ingenious ideas in beautiful, sweet-hearted adventures.  In them you will help the deer to cross the river in the sunlit forest, slide down the branch on the sheet with a small mouse, or sing a serenade to the girl on the guitar.  Orisinal games are masterfully made and successfully capture the sharpness of simple moments. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Cross-platform (flash). <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/multiwinia/downloads">Multiwinia</a></b> </h3><img src="http://s40.radikal.ru/i090/0912/68/15f7b119147b.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Multiwinia" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The guys from Introversion love to dream.  We did not have time to save the virtual flat men from the virus, as they were immediately bruised with each other.  The result was a very interesting multiplayer continuation of Darwinia. <br><br>  <b>$ 33.20</b> . <br>  Windows, Mac OS X. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.armadillorun.com/">Armadillo run</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e08/dd1/31b/e08dd131b39b7ff3eb5ecb0e1f776a6e.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Armadillo run" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  In Armadillo Run, your goal is to bring the small, armadillo curled up to the target, using a variety of sophisticated devices and a limited budget.  Metal beams, fabric, ropes, rockets and other materials can be used.  Almost always there are several solutions to achieve victory.  Armadillo Run is a wonderful game that will appeal to all who love to play with physical laws. <br><br>  <b>$ 20</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.teeworlds.com/">Teeworlds</a></b> </h3><img src="http://i023.radikal.ru/0912/09/7b436585eab9.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Teeworlds" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Gorgeous open-source multiplayer fun - a two-dimensional shooter with a multimedia graphics and a bad gameplay.

New blocks can be obtained from smaller ones.  As a result, we have a very exciting fast game that requires lightning-fast mental and physical reflexes ... as well as (eh!) Basic knowledge of mathematics! <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://amanita-design.net/samorost-1/">Samorost</a> / <a href="http://amanita-design.net/samorost-2/">Samorost 2</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/369/a58/f8a/369a58f8af30cfdb7469c968dff8d702.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Samorost / Samorost 2" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The game Samorost and its continuation takes place in a surrealistic world, reminiscent of the classic fantasy "Le Petit Prince" and "The Neverending Story".  In the Czech Republic, the word ‚ÄúSamorost‚Äù means ‚ÄúNugget‚Äù, and this name successfully conveys an organic and mysterious feeling from the game and a unique graphic style that combines the most beautiful landscapes in the background and the animated animation in the foreground. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Cross-platform (flash). <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/">N</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cb7/dfb/ba0/cb7dfbba0ae648cd140c61e866058e3f.png" width="150" height="150" alt="N" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  What do we have here?  An advanced physics engine, an extremely dynamic platform arcade game and the simplest, abstract graphics in one bottle.  Like bagels, in N is fun to die, trying to escape from death.  Along with the game is a level editor, widely used by numerous fans.  N won the audience award at IGF'05. <br><br>  <b>Free</b>  <b>$ 10 (Xbla), 24.90 (PSP), $ 24.90 (Nintendo DS) - play-asia.com</b> . <br>  Cross-platform (flash) + N + version for Xbla and PSP &amp; Nintendo DS. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/">Kingdom loathing</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8eb/75f/b80/8eb75fb80ed7ed942ade117d57c628a7.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Kingdom loathing" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  A free, web-based MMORPG where you can become a Seal Hunter or a Macaroni Master instead of a barbarian or wizard.  In place of such skills as strength, intelligence and charisma, came ‚ÄúMuscles‚Äù, ‚ÄúMystery‚Äù and ‚ÄúInsolence‚Äù.  Kingdom of Loathing is a fun, well-made parody of not only RPG games in particular, but also the RPG genre of entertainment in general. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Cross-platform (over-browser). <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.tale-of-tales.com/TheEndlessForest">The endless forest</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/eb2/4c1/328/eb24c132882085d149158a598353ec17.png" width="150" height="150" alt="The endless forest" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Multiplayer online game in which each player controls a deer with a human face.  There are no quests or any global goals, only an endless idyllic environment and a company of friendly deer.  There is also no uniform means of communication with other players, only body language and animal sounds.  Juicy graphics of the game is partially inspired by the works of the Japanese Hayao Miyazaki;  The peaceful nature of the game, devoid of violence or in-game communication, gives the player a unique gaming experience. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.eyezmaze.com/">Eyezmaze</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4e4/2cf/41b/4e42cf41bd9ff67e964e9bcf3c77fd4b.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Eyezmaze" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  From the beloved series of ‚ÄúGrow‚Äù games, in which you combine various ingredients in a crazy manner to the best result, to ‚ÄúChronon‚Äù (shown in the screenshot), an adventure puzzle game in which time plays a significant role, all Eyezmaze games are unexpected surprises !  The spirit of rash experimentation makes them completely explosive.  Just a few gaming developers can match the ingenuity of Eyezmaze. <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Cross-platform (flash). <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.ninjabee.com/outpostkaloki.html">Outpost Kaloki</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/097/df1/32c/097df132c8d4cf72efe2a11a7c1d2030.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Outpost Kaloki" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Economic simulator in which you head a network of space stations, earning on the service traveling on the galaxy.  As in many tycoon games, Outpost Kaloki requires a good micromanagement from the player, but avoids the usual game problems of the genre, being an uncomplicated, fast and fancy game.  Also one of the main advantages of the game is the absence of the word "tycoon" in the title! <br><br>  <b>$ 15</b> . <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.amaranthia.com/modules/aveyond/">Aveyond</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/444/a91/835/444a91835f712f59ea8b74d1eaaed61a.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Aveyond" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  This is a "pure" fantasy RPG, which takes us back to classic games like Final Fantasy VI.  But despite this, the game amazes us with the passion of the creator (Amanda Fitch) to her creation.  Amazing is the ease with which this passion is so easily felt in characters, dialogues and gameplay.  Frustrated with the shortcomings of her favorite games, Amanda began to study programming herself and write free RPG and adventure games, the unexpected success of which inspired her to work as a game developer. <br><br>  <b>$ 10</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.binaryzoo.com/games/echoes/index.htm">Echoes</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/9d3/f73/fa8/9d3f73fa833858ca4a34593bc1c66f4e.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Echoes" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The big mistake that many developers make in the process of creating games based on the classics, but with the latest technologies, is that they add a bunch of new things to the game without understanding whether they improve the original concept.  And only some of the developers really manage to add something worthwhile, such as the developers of Echoes, the modern reincarnation of the once popular game Asteroids.  They have increased the rate and speed of the emergence of new asteroids, but otherwise they follow the original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ancestor - the fans will not pass by :) <br><br>  <b>Free</b> <br>  Windows Xbox. <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp%3Ftopic_id%3D401276%26forum_id%3D6%26gforum_id%3D0">De blob</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c60/d20/56e/c60d2056e35c4ad71265452ef597e581.png" width="150" height="150" alt="De blob" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  Created by nine Dutch art students, De Blob is an unusual action-puzzle game, similar to Katamari Damacy in terms of playing style and carefree aesthetics.  The goal is simple: being a big drop of paint, you must paint the 17 target buildings in the city, scrolling around the NPC in order to change color and increase in size.  The good idea behind this game was noticed by the giant gaming industry THQ, who ported this game to Wii, but the original is still available for free. <br><br>  <b>Free (original)</b> . <br>  Windows <br><br><br><h3>  <b><a href="http://www.oasisgame.com/">Oasis</a></b> </h3><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/139/d9e/8bf/139d9e8bffde2830599becc1d581dcd1.png" width="150" height="150" alt="Oasis" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left">  The winner of the IGF'04 contest and the nominee for the title of ‚ÄúThe Most Downloadable Game-2005‚Äù from the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences, Oasis is a strategic puzzle game, which takes place in mystical Egypt.  As the king of scarabs, you must first discover new cities on the map and increase the number of followers you later put on the defenses against a horde of barbarians.  At first, the game is simple, but towards the end, survival requires good planning from the player, excellent knowledge of game mechanics, and, of course, a bit of luck :) A good idea, which is the basis of the game, is perfectly implemented and intuitive. <br><br>  <b>$ 20</b> <br>  Windows <br><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/78674/">Part one</a> . <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/78679/">Part Three</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/78685/">Part Four</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78675/</a></p>
