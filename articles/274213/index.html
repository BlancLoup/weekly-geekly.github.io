  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HIVE: the future of cloud PBX or where are we going next year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The corporate blog on Habr√©, in our opinion, is intended not only to tell the community about coders' techniques and to describe technical ‚Äúfeatures,‚Äù the blog on Habr√© is also intended to share news, thoughts, and mood with subscribers and readers.  Today we will not be long and tedious to describe how they wrote another front-end for CRM or how they integrated the cloud PBX refrigerator, coffee maker and Electronics at the same time.  We, as a cloud service provider, want to take stock of the past year and share what has been done in the past year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/312/683/ac13126834104c3481bf97aabae36f25.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing I would like to note is a clear upward trend in interest in cloud solutions.  We cannot say that at the beginning of 2015, no one was interested in virtual PBXs or CRM integrations, there was steady demand, we regularly connected new users and implemented integrated solutions, but we believed that a virtual PBX should live in a box and only in a boxed one. In appearance, it is able to provide small and medium businesses with the entire set of VoIP benefits.  In this case, our virtual PBX ZEON almost from the very beginning existed in two ways - a box and a public SaaS.  Cloud drive has significantly added integration with amoCRM and the launch of the project with FMC sim IP SIM cards.  The first sales experience of integration solutions clearly marked the trend - the clouds ‚Äúrule‚Äù and continue to sell only the box, without offering a public SaaS - omission, error and miscalculation.  On this very wave and under the constant nagging of sellers, we launched a fully cloud-based <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">HIVE</a> project, which, in our opinion, should become a locomotive product in 2016. <br><br>  Of the several interesting features added to the usual, at first glance, cloud PBX, I would like to mention ‚ÄúTrend 2015‚Äù - integration with FMC IP SIM-cards.  This is what ‚Äúshot‚Äù and what will probably be sold further.  Based on IP SIM, we plan to create several solutions for different business segments, but for now we will briefly show the solutions that have already been created.

To use this solution, there is absolutely no need to use softphones or IP phones.  IP SIMs connect to the cloud PBX directly, like the most common office phones and you can set up all the necessary call processing scenarios without the use of wires and redirects.  Calls from mobiles are included in the PBX statistics, they are recorded, mobile phones have short numbers, you can transfer calls from one cell to another, while outgoing from the cell phone number is not determined, but a single company number is determined. <br><br>  Something similar already existed on the market before us, but in those previous solutions there was a clear separation: cellular worked as if in two networks: corporate mobile and office.  In our case, this division disappeared and corporate cellular became the most common office phones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c69/b3a/0ab/c69b3a0ab19448abb1502a964dd9a3d0.png"><br><br>  Employees of a fully mobile company do not need to have a permanent place in the office or an interface in the cloud system.  You only need to set up all call scenarios once, download the IVR and assign short numbers to the mobile.  After that, you can run away and work on cell phones, while in constant motion.  From our point of view, this is an excellent solution for micro-businesses that do not want to spend money on the office and cloud PBXs, but want to look like serious and big companies with all the attributes of success: a beautiful incoming number, electronic secretaries, call transfers and voice alerts . <br><br>  The second incarnation of the HIVE cloud PBX integrated with mobile technologies and CRM systems is the IP SIM friendship and simple CRM cloud with a lot of incoming numbers ‚Äî a kind of SIM card with 100 or more virtual DIDs throughout Russia.  We decided to call it Multi IP SIM, because the client interacts only with his smartphone and only sometimes with a working computer.  The Multi IP SIM sales experience showed that we had hit the spot and found a way to make life easier for micro-businesses that are actively working with customers through ad sites and lots of incoming calls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/abe/f80/c0b/abef80c0b64f4ff8812033d6defd4434.png"><br><br>  All calls from all announcements come to a single SIM card, are recorded in CRM and upon incoming call directly on the smartphone you can see by what announcement the call came.  The communication history is stored in CRM, which allows you to collect call statistics, evaluate the effectiveness of ads for each of the products, and evaluate the conversion of advertising companies. <br><br>  If you add a mobile conferencing service to our integration and solutions, you can get a good tool for automating small business: mobile phones, CRM, cloud PBX are now components of a single information system with the ability to create, invent, try almost infinitely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cc/7b0/5b7/3cc7b05b731f4f339a1205b21639d09b.png"><br><br>  Cellular employees can now be connected to the conference based on the status of their mobile phone: busy, offline, off, talking.  Automatically dial up to those who were on the subway or who had their cell phone turned off, analyzing the fact of its appearance on the network. <br><br>  We work a lot on integration and we understand that integration is just that way of development of cloud services that should be actively pursued.  Just a couple of years ago, cloud subscriptions were perceived as a set of incomprehensible ‚Äúuselessness‚Äù, weakly connected with each other and not representing a single cloud-based IP for business, where each of the components performs a strictly defined functionality.  The situation is changing radically - a cloud PBX without CRM is wrong, a cellular connection that is not integrated with the office telephone network is very wrong.  We will work on integration in the coming year, give even more clouds, scripts, connectors and REST API, and our main salesman and sales muse, who turns the nightly vigils of developers into revenue, Nastya, will help us with this, actively using all the developments at the forefront of any business - in the commercial department, sitting on incoming calls. <br><br>  Congratulations to all with the upcoming holidays, we wish to move on, develop our own projects and improve skills.  We all work in a very dynamic and rich environment - in the field of IT-technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a7/066/dda/2a7066dda26d47bd9be63b6224571a54.png"><br><br>  See you next year.
