For an IT leader it is not enough to understand modern technologies very well.  <b>About what qualities the head in the field of IT should possess, in the translation article from Toni Bowers.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While most experts agree that leaders, as a rule, deal only with the management of a company, there is some specificity when it comes to IT. <br><br>  For example, Bob Hughes from Camden Consulting Group claims that there are important qualities that should be inherent in the IT leader, and they are not always the same as in any other field.  Below is a list of them - here are 9 signs of a strong leader in the field of IT:

      <b>1. Trust (giving employees the opportunity to take risks, even if it leads to failure)</b> <br><br>  It is very important that IT leaders create an environment in which employees are encouraged for reasonable risks.  This is often quite difficult.  We often hear: "Of course, we encourage our employees when they take risks, but everything needs to know the limit."  Why?  Perhaps the culprit is the consequences of what happens when some risky idea fails.  If employees are scolded or punished for this, they are unlikely to take the risk the next time. <br><habracut><br>  Of course, it is not necessary for employees to take risks that most likely will not be crowned with success.  Rather, risks may be justified in a particular area.  The leader must help delineate the boundaries and help employees follow the right direction when things are not going according to plan.  This requires maximum vigilance. <br><br>  <b>2. Leaders - strong and competent interlocutors</b> <br><br>  The ability to communicate is one of the fundamental leadership qualities, no matter what area the specialist belongs to - IT or any other.  Why?  A lot is being done only through connections - this is how initiatives are implemented, results are announced, etc.  Remember that communication is a two-way phenomenon, so listening carefully is as important as talking.  Successful IT leaders can listen and ask the right questions. <br><br>  <b>3. Collaboration</b> <br><br>  Collaboration is sometimes one of those things that IT professionals look down on.  However, many promising ideas and solutions come only if several people work on the problem.  That is why collaboration is so important.  No one can handle all the problems.  A competent IT leader should encourage collaboration when necessary. <br><br>  <b>4. Knowledge of your weaknesses and strengths</b> <br><br>  An IT leader should be aware of both his strengths and weaknesses.  It is very important to have your own management style, know where it works best and, if necessary, adjust the approach to this or that issue.  If you are not aware of your weaknesses, how can you cultivate yourself? <br><br>  <b>5. Leaders must solve problems.</b> <br><br>  Given the technical mentality and complexity of each specific problem, the desire and ability to solve emerging problems is a key parameter that the IT leader must possess. <br><br>  <b>6. Self-confidence (and in others)</b> <br><br>  Sometimes leaders do not feel sufficient confidence in themselves to control other people.  It is very important for the leader to keep employees under control and to be able to work with them, as this is the only way to succeed.  If a manager does not manage to ‚Äúrestructure‚Äù, he will slow down not only his development, but also the development of the entire organization. <br><br>  <b>7. Comprehending the strategy</b> <br><br>  One of the key parameters of the leader is the ability to see the big picture and look into the distance, analyzing the long-term prospects.  The IT leader must devote a development strategy to at least 15% of his working time.  You need to soberly assess what you really spend your time on and what you should spend it on.  Change your schedule, paying more attention to strategically important activities. <br><br>  <b>8. Making key decisions</b> <br><br>  An integral feature of IT leaders is the ability to make important decisions.  Leaders need to constantly make timely and correct decisions.  In addition, they should know not only what to do, but also why - it is important to explain the rationale of a decision by its employee and colleagues. <br><br>  <b>9. Be aware of trends and changes in the field.</b> <br><br>  In the modern IT-sphere, there are always some changes - therefore, in order to remain ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù, you need to quickly make the right decisions.  IT leaders must understand the situation on the market, and also do not forget to take care of the security of their company and remember their other responsibilities.  Of course, it is not easy to keep up with everything, but some IT executives still succeed.  The key to success is to be aware of the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pjaterka-naibolee-perspektivnyh-napravlenij-v-sfere-IT/">most promising areas in the field of IT</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps a lot of what has been said above will seem trivial to one of you.  However, do not rush to conclusions.  Just stop and comprehend every point above, try them on yourself and those with whom you work every day.  And draw conclusions only then. <br><br>  The article was translated by <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242529/</a></p>
