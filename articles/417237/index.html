And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/20/does-music-really-help-you-concentrate">according to a number of studies</a> , music can help tune in to a productive day. <br><br>  The only question is which musical genre to choose. <br><br>  At sites such as Reddit, Hacker News and Habr, more than one thread is devoted to discussing this issue.  We decided to analyze the views of the developers and select the most interesting ones.

This conclusion was reached in the process of studying the phenomenon <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/student/student-life/Studies/how-music-could-help-you-to-concentrate-while-studying-a6907341.html">known</a> as the ‚ÄúMozart effect‚Äù ( <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304394094112214">link to the original scientific article</a> ).  In the subsequent work of the scientific community on the topic, this hypothesis was criticized and refuted in a number of studies. <br><br>  Of course, business is not limited to Mozart.  For example, one of the residents of Hacker News <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D12849520">said</a> that at work he was accustomed to listening to Bach's Brandenburg concerts: ‚ÄúI listen to Bach while I work and never get tired of it‚Äù.  And someone helps to cope with the task of listening to Schnittke.  One of the users of Habr <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/372413/">noted</a> that he was ‚Äúperfectly cleaned the brain‚Äù by Schnittke. <br><br>  However, listening to the classics while working is not for everyone - it may seem too emotional to someone, and therefore, on the contrary, it will distract.  In this case, Reddit is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/7qtg4d/best_music_to_listen_to_while_coding/">advised to</a> take a closer look at the ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">classic crossover</a> ‚Äù musical style.  It is a kind of synthesis of classic with pop, rock or electronic music.  ‚ÄúSuch tracks will sound familiar, but will not distract,‚Äù writes one of the users of Reddit.  Among the performers of this genre are: pianist <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/nov%25C3%25B6-piano-2/1040443909">Maxence Kirin</a> , guitarist <a href="http://www.davidrogersguitar.com/">David Rogers</a> , violinist <a href="https://www.david-garrett.com/">David Garrett</a> . <br><br><h2>  Electonic music </h2><br>  One of the styles of this trend is ambient, which is characterized by enveloping, unobtrusive sound.  According to <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1610/1610.04255.pdf">studies</a> , this type of music allows you to focus on the task and improves the emotional state.  A popular kind of ambient are the ‚Äúsounds of nature.‚Äù  For example, on the site of the project <a href="http://rainymood.com/">Rainymood</a> you can listen to the sound of rain.  The developers additionally lay out the recording with electronic or classical music, which can be listened to in parallel with the sounds of nature (at the time of writing the article, the composition of the artist sounds like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJzIK5FaC38w">Explore In The Sky - Your Hand In Mine</a> ).  Among other projects in this area, people celebrate <a href="https://www.noisli.com/">Noisli</a> .  The soundtrack here is the most diverse - the sound of the wheels of the train, the crackling of the fire, the noise of the summer night and many others. <br><br>  In addition to ambient, users of the sites often mentioned trance.  In particular, it is known that the melody of this style is listened to by the team of developers of the mobile application Snapchat.  One of its advantages <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3027907/what-engineers-at-facebook-pinterest-snapchat-airbnb-and-spotify-listen-to-while-coding">they call</a> rhythm, which "at the subconscious level creates a feeling of moving forward."  Pinterest team developer Dmitry Kislyuk believes that trance helps him in his analytical work.  He also shared his playlists on Spotify, which he uses during coding sessions: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dkislyuk/playlist/58p3fnyDgA3q9BXkviO70p">Dreamy Trance</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/dkislyuk/playlist/0RPIGZESKdZPVRz3kWtVoh">Energy Trance</a> .  Many users of Hacker News agree with him.  One of them noted that in order to increase concentration, he listens to a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581">progressive trance</a> - according to him, he calms down and does not distract from work.  Here are a couple of radio stations where they play trance music: <a href="https://www.di.fm/trance">DI.FM</a> and <a href="https://www.radiorecord.ru/player/">Record</a> . <br><br><h2>  Rock and Jazz </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/742577/Classical-music-boosts-concentration-rock-distracting-men-Mozart-revealed">A study</a> of London‚Äôs Imperial College and King‚Äôs College of Music found that listening to rock music can prevent men from concentrating on the task and lead to more mistakes.  And what is interesting, listening to rock music had no effect on women's productivity. <br><br>  However, there is another point of view.  In particular, scientists from the Academy of Sciences of Iowa conducted an <a href="https://www.aaas.org/abstract/effect-different-genres-music-your-concentration">experiment</a> , during which 22 participants were asked to solve 6 tests while listening to different genres of music.  Estimated accuracy and speed of solving problems.  After analyzing the collected data, it was fixed that listening to rock or jazz helped the subjects achieve higher test results (in 89% of cases), compared to other genres. <br><br>  But despite the controversy and contradictory results of different researchers, these musical directions are often mentioned by the developers.  Mainly because listening to rock helps to diversify the monotonous work.  For example, one of Habrazhiteli <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/372413/">includes</a> heavy or fast rock / metal during ‚Äúnightmarishly boring development stages‚Äù, such as debugging.  Groups and performers that are recommended for listening: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/chon/6967071">Chon</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/artist/periphery/187683869">Periphery</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/animals-as-leaders/311508570">Animals as Leaders</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/intervals/4641328">Intervals</a> , etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b_/yz/sn/b_yzsnua-yx-p7ewlhvvw9wvqfq.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ginnerobot/4412096948/">Ginny</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a> Photo</i></font> <br><br>  As for jazz, on Hacker News one of the users <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D12848734">writes</a> : ‚ÄúMy brain turns on when I listen to complex music - with dissonant, rhythmically strange constructions.  So my playlist for ‚Äúfocusing‚Äù is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF">post-bop jazz</a> . ‚Äù <br><br>  Among the popular jazz performers in threads are recommended: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/artist/chick-corea/117338">Chick Corea</a> , a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/artist/chick-corea/117338">group of Steps Ahead</a> , pianist <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/artist/keith-jarrett/72348">Keith Jarrett</a> , as well as saxophonist <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/artist/john-coltrane/120199">John Coltrane</a> . <br><br><h2>  Soundtracks and game music </h2><br>  ‚ÄúUsually songs with words, on the contrary, are distracting, because I start to sing along and think about the meaning of the text.  Therefore, I believe that such music is not suitable for coding sessions, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3027907/what-engineers-at-facebook-pinterest-snapchat-airbnb-and-spotify-listen-to-while-coding">says</a> Snapchat developer David Tian. <br><br>  According to <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/psychology-workout-music/">studies</a> , music with words helps during intense exercises - running or training in the gym.  But when performing complex cognitive tasks, they can, on the contrary, dispel attention.  For this reason, many developers while listening to soundtracks for movies and games.  On the one hand, such compositions can be unobtrusive and play background, on the other - rhythmic and able to create an atmosphere that helps to concentrate. <br><br>  One of the residents Habra <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/411781/">said</a> that the following compositions help him during his work: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DjrbN2y5r-vU">Zerg 1</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBO0ZW15qYtQ">Departure</a> (from DN3D), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOBm2mz3IHoM">GLA 1</a> (from CC Generals), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DiCq8gUh7x-Y">Gallente 004</a> .  You can listen and download this type of music on the sites: <a href="http://ocremix.org/">OverClocked ReMix</a> , <a href="https://www.vgmusic.com/">VGMUSIC</a> .  On Reddit, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemusic/">separate thread was</a> created for this. <br><br><h2>  Selection of resources </h2><br>  In addition to individual music trends and performers, users of Habr, HN, Reddit and Quora recommended paying attention to audio projects that play background music for work (something like <a href="http://rainymood.com/">Rainymood</a> , which we talked about earlier).  Based on the recommendations, we have compiled a small list: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://musicforprogramming.net/">Music for Programming</a> - project developers state that the most effective way to concentrate is music without words and drum sounds, consisting of random noises.
