The most complete guide to new products from Lenovo - under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/942/dfe/560/942dfe56096b40aaa8d43747d024762f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo YOGA Book</font> </h2><br>  The Lenovo YOGA Book laptop amazes not only with its scope, but with the modifications presented: the device is offered with two different operating systems - Windows 10 and Android 6.0. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7af/78b/93d/7af78b93d7111012149ad679cec2bfbc.jpg">

      The first thing that catches the eye when meeting - a very unusual design of loops.  Not only does it allow you to rotate the laptop, somehow, to a full 360 degrees, it also consists of 130 elements.  The design from the first touch makes it clear that it is reliable and, I‚Äôm not afraid of this word, is a premium one.  Standard for Lenovo Transformers modes - ‚Äúlaptop‚Äù, ‚Äútablet‚Äù, ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù and ‚Äúconsole‚Äù, of course, work here. <br><br>  The unique keyboard Halo Keyboard does not look like the usual version - there are no traditional mechanical buttons on it.  The tactile response function works 100%, editing documents and replying to mail is quite realistic.  In addition, the smart keyboard can be trained and has the function of predictive typing.  LED backlight touch keys look like in films about the distant future - not a hologram, but close. <br><br>  However, typing is not the only task of the keyboard.  This panel can also be used to enter graphics using the Real Pen stylus.  The stylus can write on paper located on top of the keyboard panel with ink and at the same time with virtual ink.  The panel recognizes the pressing force, the thickness of the lines is regulated in the most natural way for a person - by simple pressing.  Permissible deviation of the pen to 100 degrees, the technology of electromagnetic resonance (EMR) can recognize up to 2048 gradations of pressure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/485/7d1/dbe/4857d1dbefcb8dbf354da6aa7aa285d2.jpg"><br><br>  Technically, Lenovo YOGA Book is made in a very thin case, its thickness is only 9.6 mm, weight - 690 grams.  At the same time, the technical part did not suffer - both versions of the notebook are equipped with an Intel Atom x5-Z8550 processor, Full HD IPS-display of 10.1 inches.  As for the memory, the laptop is equipped with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of memory of the internal flash drive.  By the way, you can expand the memory using microSDXC memory cards.  The integrated Intel HD Graphics 400 is responsible for the graphics. <br><br>  Both versions of the laptop support work with 2G / 3G / 4G (LTE) networks, equipped with Wi-Fi (802.11 a / b / g / n / ac), Bluetooth, GPS, and HDMI connectors. <br><br>  Refined in every sense of the word design.  Having touched Lenovo YOGA Book once, I don‚Äôt want to let go ‚Äî a work tool that is pleasant to use and can be proudly displayed. <br><br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/279978/">A detailed review of Lenovo YOGA BOOK</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo MiiX 510</font> </h2><br>  Universal laptop transformer MiiX 510 looks more like a tablet.  Perhaps this is the merit of the keyboard, made on a leather backing.  The decision is justified - it is easy to remove the keyboard, put it back or place it, as fantasy tells you.  The keyboard is traditional and full-size - Lenovo believed that typing text from a tablet should be comfortable.  Properly done, by the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b4/a17/479/0b4a17479425468400eced4819c407d2.jpg"><br><br>  The laptop is running Windows 10. However, it does not interfere with its transformation into a tablet.  To take the keyboard with you or not to take it - the only question is the convenience of the user.  In the case of using a laptop without a keyboard, it turns into a powerful and convenient tablet, the stand located at the back, has a tilt angle of 150%.  Placing the tablet on a table or any other surface is much easier thanks to the built-in stand. <br><br>  Without a keyboard, the laptop weighs 880 g., Its thickness is only 9.9 mm.  The device received a battery with a capacity of 39 Wh, the stated battery life is 7.5 hours. <br><br>  MiiX 510 is built on a 6th generation Intel Core i7 processor (top of the range), has a 12.2-inch display protected by Gorilla Glass.  Graphics chip built-in, Intel HD Graphics 520. 8 GB of RAM, internal PCI SSD can have up to 1 TB, depending on the configuration.  A set of support for wireless networks standard: Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0, optional - LTE. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo YOGA 910</font> </h2><br>  Laptop Lenovo YOGA 910 - also a transformer.  All branded chips - a rotation of 360 degrees, a powerful and reliable system of loops of 130 elements, 4 modes of operation - in place.  The laptop is very thin - only 14.3 mm and weighs less than 1.4 kg.  For such thickness, the performance seems transcendental. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/847/4c4/242/8474c4242db6d9b7f96e617357bce8b6.jpg"><br><br>  Depending on the modification of the laptop, you can choose a screen resolution of 13.9 inches - 4K or Full HD.  The frames of the screen are very thin compared to the previous generation - their thickness is only 5 mm.  The laptop is based on the seventh generation Intel Core i7 processor.  The integrated PCIe SSD has a capacity of 1TB.  YOGA 910 can be equipped with up to 16 GB of RAM.  The device runs on Windows 10. <br><br>  The laptop is equipped with a fingerprint scanner - the problem of memorizing complex text passwords is eliminated.  Recognition of the owner takes a split second and you do not need to memorize anything.  The device battery is capable of autonomous operation for 12 hours. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo P2</font> </h2><br>  The Lenovo P2 smartphone proved to be a worthy successor to the P line. Compared to the first version, it received smoother hulls, although the screen size remained the same - 5.5 inches.  The AMOLED-screen with a resolution of FHD (1920x1080) and with a protective glass Corning Gorilla Glass 3 did not fail to illuminate the stand - the screen remained bright. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd9/61d/76b/bd961d76b550cd3c7515b781e5ff0cf6.jpg"><br><br>  A thin metal case, a fingerprint scanner from the bottom in front, combined with a physical home button, Android 6.0 - recognizable details of the P-series. The smartphone fits comfortably in your hand and looks like a reliable device.  Weight - 175 gr., Thickness - only 8.5 mm. <br><br>  P2 got a battery with a capacity of 5100 mAh.  Such a battery is able to stretch a full three days with a fairly dense load.  Under the load refers not only calls and SMS, but also games, the Internet, the work of the camera and other smartphone systems.  Not without fast charging - Turbo Power technology allows you to charge your smartphone for 10 hours of work in just 15 minutes. <br><br>  The smartphone runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 3 GB 3 GB RAM and 32 GB internal memory.  If desired, the internal memory can be expanded using microSD memory cards up to 128 GB. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ed/4c8/bf6/3ed4c8bf6602d5618466b50a00d61446.jpg"><br><br>  The main camera with a resolution of 13 megapixels, front - 5 megapixels.  The main camera is equipped with a CCT flash, autofocus system and stabilization system. <br><br>  Depending on the modification, the smartphone can work with one or two nano-SIM SIM cards.  All versions of the device support GPS, GLONASS, BDS and LTE networks.  To say that the device caused an increased interest - to say nothing. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo PHAB 2 Pro</font> </h2><br>  A device around which an aura of mystery has already formed.  It's all about the technology Tango, which was developed jointly by Lenovo and Google.  Virtual reality technology allows you to significantly expand the capabilities of phablet, for example, arrange virtual furniture in a real room or take a tour of the museum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9d/43f/431/f9d43f431131e5daaa07524f6a46efdb.jpg"><br><br>  Lenovo PHAB 2 Pro is equipped with a 6.4-inch Full HD 2K-display, on-board Qualcomm 652 processor. The phablet is equipped with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of internal memory.  The battery has a capacity of 4050 mAh, a fingerprint scanner is located on the rear panel. <br><br>  To hold a phablet in hand is convenient.  Yes, it is large and falls out of the class of compact devices somewhat, but this does not prevent it from being used at all.  The main tool of virtual reality is the camera.  The camera resolution is 16 Mp, plus a depth sensor on the rear panel and a mass of sensors responsible for the correct perception of the surrounding reality by the phablet. <br><br>  Right at the exhibition one could try to place the furniture, measure the distance from the corner to the corner in the room or just play with the AR-mode of the camera.  It turns on quite simply - by pressing a button in the camera application.  A virtual animal, such as a cat or a dragon, will happily explore the real world on a phablet screen.  A painted cat walking around a real table is a little scary, but on the other hand, why be surprised after a recent pokemon boom? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo K6 series</font> </h2><br>  K6 series smartphones include three devices at once.  The main differences are easy to guess by name: K6, K6 Power and K6 Note.  The entire line has common features - the presence of stereo speakers and Dolby Atmos surround sound system, support work in LTE networks and are controlled by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 processor. The fingerprint scanner in all three smartphones is located on the back panel, immediately below the camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b5/126/f1f/4b5126f1f8ba8d597b9092f2bfb3efcb.jpg"><br><br>  Strong middle class - Lenovo K6 is a full-fledged multimedia device running Android 6.0.  The smartphone has a 5-inch IPS-screen with a resolution of FHD (1920x1080).  The amount of memory is quite decent - 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of built-in, plus support for microSD memory cards with capacities up to 128 GB. <br><br>  The main camera with a resolution of 13 megapixels has phase autofocus, the resolution of the front camera is 5 megapixels.  Depending on the modification, one or two SIM cards may be available, the battery capacity is 3000 mAh. <br><br>  It is logical that the K6 Power differs from the K6 in a powerful battery.  The battery capacity is 4000 mAh, which could not but affect the thickness of the case - the K6 Power is somewhat thicker than the K6. <br><br>  K6 Note is the most advanced, but also the largest.  The smartphone has a large screen size - 5.5 inches and a more serious camera - 16 megapixel dual CCT-flash.  Memory is also more - 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal.  The battery is the same as in the K6 Power - 4000 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/68d/47e/70f/68d47e70fc2d2ec578069c3e2bf00758.jpg"><br><br>  The K6 lineup is a decent sample of affordable smartphones.  You can choose any of the three options, depending on personal preferences and get a reliable, high-quality smartphone in a metal case with a good filling. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Lenovo YOGA Tab 3 Plus</font> </h2><br>  Tablet Lenovo YOGA Tab 3 Pus - an improved version of the previous model.  Nothing has changed in appearance - the same stand, the same cylindrical battery, JBL surround speakers and four modes of operation are the usual YOGA in all its glory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04a/619/510/04a619510abefa547f044d2cb693e29f.jpg"><br><br>  YOGA Tab 3 Plus got a 2K-display size of 10.1 inches.  Now you can stream streaming audio via Bluetooth to your tablet, or high-quality Miracast video. <br><br>  The tablet battery has a capacity of 9300 mAh and supports fast charging with a complete charger.  This capacity is about 18 hours of battery life with the most active use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55c/fe6/6c1/55cfe66c162e593eeedec3737138f6c9.jpg"><br><br>  YOGA Tab 3 Plus received a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, Qualcomm Adreno 510 graphics, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory.  The memory can be expanded using MicroSD memory cards, wireless modules - a full set: LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.0. <br><br>  The tablet received two cameras, the main one with a resolution of 13 megapixels, the front one with 5 megapixels.  The weight of the device is different for different versions.  The Wi-Fi version weighs 637 grams, the LTE version is 644 grams. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Moto Z Play and Moto Mods: Hasselblad True Zoom</font> </h2><br>  Of course, Moto introduced their new products.  The brand introduced a new smartphone from the line Z - Moto Z Play.  He received a reinforced 3510 mAh battery - Z Play almost 2 times thicker than Moto Z. Fast charging technology allows you to get 9 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes at the outlet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0a/480/0a0/c0a4800a0fbcee487a7f194af355fb8c.jpg"><br><br>  In the presence and water-repellent coating - rain, spray and other wet trouble smartphone is not terrible.  Of course, it is not worth plunging it for a long time under water. <br><br>  The screen is 5.5 inches in size, Super AMOLED, Full HD, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass.  Stunningly bright in any situation, with wide viewing angles - what you need for a variety of activities - watching videos, photos, surfing the Internet, games. <br><br>  The main camera with a resolution of 16 megapixels is equipped with dual autofocus - laser and phase.  The front camera is wide-angle, with a 5 megapixel sensor and flash. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/722/0d4/451/7220d445112a2d90cf6e7759964abc09.jpg"><br><br>  Smartphone stuffing looks pretty serious: Qualcomm Snapgragon 625 processor, 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of main memory.  Naturally, support for working with microSD cards up to 2 TB.  A full set of wireless technologies: Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n 2.4 / 5 GHz, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, 4G LTE, NFC. <br><br>  The modularity of the Moto Z Series smartphones is no secret to anyone, but at the exhibition the world was presented with a new camera module.
