  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems in the implementation and sale of electronic document management systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Our organization develops and sells an electronic document management system and platform in Ukraine.  In this article I want to share the experience of communicating with customers, from dating to discussing the ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù and possible problems with closing the system sale contracts.  The ‚Äúrakes‚Äù we are attacking will be described. <br><br><h2>  Introduction of the customer to the system </h2><br>  Rarely what document management system is simple in terms of learning.  But the one who needs it, of course, understands, studies, often with our help.  Everything is used - ICQ, Skype, forum, telephone conversations. <br><br>  Our site has a free version for 5 users, you can study unlimited.  There is also a trial license for six months for 50 (or more) users.  The customer studies, immediately builds his business processes, designs document types, gets users and departments.  All this time he quietly lives and enjoys, without the conclusion of the contract and at no cost on his part.  Do not like it - quit and leave.  He can extend the trial license by agreement with us as long as we like, until we recognize him as a ‚Äúcheater‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  We will take your system, but ... </h2><br>  Finally, our customer made the decision ‚ÄúYes, we will take and implement your system!‚Äù.  That sounds great, but for now this is just the beginning.  We determine the number of modules, how many client places we need - the cost is calculated easily, there is a calculator on the site.  What follows next?  Come on, sign the contract, get a license and use it! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But no - it turns out the customer still needs something.  Namely - customization, refinement for themselves, as well as this ‚Äúlist‚Äù of wishes and innovations, without which it seems to him it is simply impossible to continue on.  In this list, usually no one puts the problem of implementation - it is somewhere far away, and in the list, in fact, software development. <br><br><h2>  Development of technical specifications </h2><br>  If your customers know how to write technical tasks, you are incredibly lucky.  Even more lucky if you are paid for the time spent on the preparation of TK.  But a classic customer is not a director of a firm, but rather his technical specialists plus their management.  For example, one or two employees of the IT department and their head.  People are technicians, but they do not always know how to write and explain. <br><br>  As a result, you can only get a ‚Äúgeneral description‚Äù of what they want from them, but to ask them questions and clarify details is your concern.  The person says: ‚ÄúI want your system to be integrated with 1C!‚Äù.  For him, it seems to be obvious and nothing to discuss, but you, as a developer, know that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  Items in the TK are added as desires.  Here there is no limit to perfection and you need to say in time, ‚ÄúStand, let's nevertheless sign the TK.‚Äù  A signed TK gives you a fixation of requirements and at least protects you from immense development. <br><br>  You will most likely encounter the problem of ‚Äúdetailing TK‚Äù: write in more detail or, conversely, limit yourself to only general formulations.  If you start to write the details - not enough time and effort.  Do not write - allow free interpretation.  But you can accept the rule: "everything that is not described in the TK, of course, is not obvious and should not be."  There is only one trouble with this - for your customer this rule should be obvious and understandable.  It is worth trying to convince him of this, but the law was not written to him, he will be offended and demand. <br><br><h2>  A contract that is good for a customer </h2><br>  Technical issues are interesting, but we have forgotten the main thing for which we work.  And we work for the money.  The signed and paid contract brings money to the company, and you, as a developer (or implementer), may have a premium.  And here begins the most unpleasant site. <br><br>  From the moment when the customer began to study your system and the time when he ‚Äúreached‚Äù before signing the contract, it may take a long time.  For example, half a year.  But here's the thing: technicians have already voiced the approximate amount of the purchase.  Under this was ‚Äúallocated money to the budget‚Äù and it seems that one thing is clear: the thing that was in the cost calculator on the site reflects the license value of the product, but, alas, does not include the cost of all those ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù that you wants to get the customer.  You are very lucky if the customer is ready to add money and take into account the cost of improvements.  In the worst case, the cost of the product allows you to turn a blind eye to the fact that you will not be paid separately for the work. <br><br><h2>  The right approach </h2><br>  The correct way out when selling complex software systems is to separate flies and cutlets.  Here is the license, so you paid for the ‚Äúready-made system‚Äù, the price indicated on the website.  This is one contract.  But the second contract, which is called the "Contract for the introduction and refinement."  It describes all the wishes, all technical items and it is estimated and paid separately. <br><br>  Why is it important?  Because you will receive money only after the contract is closed.  So, it will be very easy for you to transfer the license out of the box and you have already earned money. <br><br>  Execution of technical specifications - a difficult thing, there is your schedule, but you have already sold the product and the first part of the income received.  Having executed TZ and having closed the second contract you receive the money for "completions". <br><br><h2>  Wrong approach </h2><br>  And there is also a wrong way out, and he is ‚Äúloved‚Äù by all customers: they will stuff the cost of selling a license and add a certain amount for ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù, but they will issue it as one contract.  It is easier for them because their leadership will ‚Äúbreak,‚Äù if they sign two pieces of paper, not just one.  And most importantly - now you are in their power.  As long as you do not fulfill all the wishes, all the technical "buns" and everything that was spelled out as "improvements", you will not get anything.  The contract may even "hang" - a difficult situation in the organization of the customer, the crisis, the money was - but they are already there.  Sorry, but alas.  You will not sue him anyway. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Our organization takes the wrong approach.  They attacked this rake many times and whether it will be possible to ‚Äúbreak‚Äù it is still unknown.  Please tell in the comments about your experience how you sell ‚Äúbox systems‚Äù and how you make improvements and suggestions.  It would be very interesting to find out whether your customers are ready to pay for the "refinement" of amounts that are comparable or larger than the cost of the product "out of the box". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242353/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242353/</a></p>
