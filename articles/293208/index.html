Today we will tell you the story of one cat that checked it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/326/c35/a5b/326c35a5bb9c47d5a481514d647dab5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meet her name is Linda.  Now she is about 2 years old, she was thrown to the door of the shelter ‚ÄúEared Nanny‚Äù when she was about 11 months old.  It was raining heavily that day, she was sitting in a plastic bag and looked fearfully at the volunteers who discovered her.  The cat had injured hind legs and she could not walk at all, crawling a little, standing on the front.  It took treatment for six months before Linda could run again. <br><br><h2>  The success story of one animal shelter with a difficult fate </h2><br><br>  Recently, an unusual call came to our office - Tatiana called - the owner of a shelter for homeless animals from the city of Bataysk (Rostov region).  This is a small shelter created by volunteers, in which more than 70 stray animals currently live.  She asked: ‚ÄúWill our widget help find their new home for their pets?‚Äù. <br>  Despite the fact that the attendance on the shelter site is low, less than 300 views per day, we still decided to try hanging <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/">up the callback button</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaa/5e5/caf/eaa5e5cafb8740dcb6221ac9768b9963.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b9/cb2/30e/4b9cb230eb134fa2995072cbe50db3b7.png" alt="image">

      An hour after installing the widget, a boy named Dima ordered a call and took the young cat home. <br>  Here's what he told us: ‚ÄúI had long thought about taking an animal from a shelter, I visited the site for several months, but did not dare to call.  Putting your phone number on the site was easier than calling.  Also, when I saw a new button, with the promise to call back in 28 seconds, I wondered if I would call back.  After I talked to a volunteer from a shelter, all my doubts disappeared. ‚Äù <br>  The boy took the cat from the shelter on the same day.  Despite the care and treatment in the shelter, the cat was still thin and distrustful of people.  After two weeks of being at home, she gained weight, her white fur gained luster, and devotion and tenderness to her new owner appeared in her eyes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c1/eb0/df0/0c1eb0df092c4b7a8b59212ac29bb279.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23e/8ea/0db/23e8ea0db4cb4e32a0186e13e4e88163.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Previously, with the help of the site, the shelter managed to find about two, three hosts per month.  After installing the widget in the first week, 2 cats and one dog found a new dad and mom.  After talking with people who took advantage of the callback, it became clear that people in the shelter are mostly not decisive, because taking an animal under their care is a serious decision.  Therefore, many animals continue to live in a shelter for years.  Enter your phone number is much easier than to call yourself and ask all the questions. <br>  In the shelter ‚ÄúEared Nanny‚Äù there are still a lot of animals waiting for a tender and kind owner who will never betray them.  In addition, every day on the street there are new animals that, for whatever reason, their owners no longer need.  If they are not helped, most likely they will die, since for a small, defenseless animal, there are many dangers on the street. <br><br>  Linda's all ended well, in 28 seconds (that is how much time passed after Dima left his phone number), she found a new, loving owner.  As Tatiana said: ‚ÄúIt was the quickest‚Äú adoption ‚Äùfrom our practice in the last 5 years.‚Äù <br> <a href="http://www.pozvonim.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e15/96b/001/e1596b001e894da7a72be0d147ea0bf5.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  Respectfully, <br>  pozvonim.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293208/</a></p>
