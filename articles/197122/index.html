Then he was in the alpha version, we watched the habraeffect with some anxiety, we were proud to have stood it quite adequately and thought about how we would start the new school year.  Half a year has passed, and perhaps it's time to share the news, especially since we have them. <br>  But first, briefly about the gifts: we are in the company of Santa Claus, we are <a href="http://papeeria.com/dedmoroz">holding a New Year's hakaphone for real Technicalists</a> .  Participate, win a subscription for 1 year! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  From Alpha to Beta </h5><br>  We became so confident in the availability and reliability of the service that we <a href="https://plus.google.com/114845278978846632632/posts/9TNnknSaaNX">changed the status of ‚Äúalpha‚Äù to ‚Äúbeta‚Äù</a> .  We make backups and are able to recover data from them, the compiler factory automatically scales with increasing load, and the monitoring sends us an SMS as soon as it sees something suspicious, and sends it again if it has not received a response.

It is simpler than complete, but it is quite suitable for simple edits.  One of us managed on the way to another start-up party to roll out a business card on the iPhone, send a PDF to the printing house near the action site, and (most incredibly) get the business cards printed on time. <br><br><h5>  Co-editing </h5><br>  Often, several people work on the text, and the possibility of co-editing is very useful.  We are working on Google Docs implementation (several cursors, real-time updates), but for now we have co-editing in Wikipedia style: the one who edits is blocking the file, and the rest see this file only for reading.  Locks are obtained and removed automatically. <br><br><h5>  Projects </h5><br>  We removed the ‚Äúone project per user‚Äù restriction and made projects of various degrees of publicity: open, private and archive.  Open projects are visible to everyone to read and compile, and you can create as many as you like.  Look, for example, at a <a href="http://papeeria.com/p/04923839aa145b11671799afc77e8769">non-trivial poster</a> (it‚Äôs also on the right of the picture). <br><br>  Private projects are visible only to their owner and those to whom the owner has granted access and their number of private projects is limited by the tariff plan (yes, by the way, we have tariff plans, see below). <br><br>  But we understand that the project ends sooner or later, surrenders to the archive and may not be returned to it.  We also have <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BPapeeria/posts/HCRCQE1RcWG">archived projects</a> .  They cannot be edited or compiled, and the owner and invited collaborators can read them, as well as private ones.  And the number of archival projects is not limited. <br><br>  Any project to which you have read access can be copied with a couple of clicks and finished with a file. <br><br><br clear="right"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5b/546/9d0/f5b5469d08cfa7943a637e527bcd9cf1.png" align="right"><br><h5>  All sorts of stuff </h5><br>  Almost every week there are all sorts of necessary little things: wrapping lines, the simplest auto-completion in the editor, the preservation of directories, and so on.  Recently, for example, the <a href="https://plus.google.com/114845278978846632632/posts/BLMVfcgUCQ6">first version of Atstsky Literacy</a> , also known as spellchecker, for the English and Russian languages, appeared. <br><br><h5>  Templates </h5><br>  We have a <a href="https://plus.google.com/%2BPapeeria/posts/H2SmpV81UN8">pack of ready-made templates</a> .  Those who write high-cited articles will most likely come up with templates from ACM and Springer, while users will simply like the minimum workable Cyrillic document or a pretty professional resume approved by the best HRs. <br><br><h5>  Subscription </h5><br>  And finally, we have <a href="http://papeeria.com/about/pricing">paid rates</a> and the first paid users.  We, the users, love and appreciate.  Come! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197122/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197122/</a></p>
