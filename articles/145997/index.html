  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Brands in new gTLDs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps the hottest discussions about the introduction of new top-level domains were unfolding in connection with the registration of brands and the problems of protecting trademarks.  Some companies believed that their own domain is very important for advertising and promoting their products and services, others considered new gTLDs to be useless.  Someone spoke out against new domains due to the fact that large companies are actually forced to buy their domain in order to keep up with competitors and protect their trademark, someone considered new gTLDs not as a significant area for business development. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  These and many other disputes continue, but now we can sum up some of the results. <br><br>  Brand domains really turned out to be in demand - they accounted for 1/3 of all applications (664 of 1930).  The main areas of activity of these companies are technologies (77 applications), media (72), production (56), Internet (49), services (46), automobiles (43).

      The largest companies, for which the first round of registration of new gTLDs was calculated, reacted ambiguously to the innovation: 42 out of 100 most profitable companies according to the Fortune 500 rating applied for their own domain. This is not a boom of new domains, but not a failure. <br><br>  It is also worth noting this trend: a number of large firms are not applying for brands (or not only for brands), but for names of general importance, for example, L'Oreal - .beauty, Google - .cloud, .blog, etc. <br><br>  Some considered it a serious problem that many companies with similar brands would apply for the same domain names.  There are such cases, but they are few.  It is now known that two companies each will compete for .monster, .sas, .guardian, .merck domains. <br><br>  The fears that companies will start registering expensive domains only to protect their trademark, prompting their competitors and all self-respecting companies to such actions were not justified.  The application was submitted, as a rule, by those who have plans for the development of their domain, and the majority of applicants are large enterprises that will not afford the cost of the application. <br><br>  But there are exceptions - for example, the construction company MiTek applied for three domains, and in the text of each of the applications you can only see the repeated phrase ‚ÄúTLD will not be resold.  Purchased for brand protection only. ‚ÄúIt should also be noted that, according to the rules of ICANN, the new domain can not just be staked out, you must meet the technical requirements to support your own zone.  So MiTek have every chance of losing a few hundred thousand dollars for nothing.  At one of the foreign resources, this application is considered "the most stupid application for a new domain." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145997/</a></p>
