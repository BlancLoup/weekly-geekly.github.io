Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Anatoly Matov, head of development at <a href="http://ustart.pro/e2e4lab">e2e4.lab</a> .

      Anatoly sat down at a computer in the 10th grade, made his first website in the 11th.  Since 2009, he has been developing professionally: studio, start-ups, forming teams of departments.  Now gone with his head in e2e4.lab. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  Managing development is no different.  It sounds formal, but the way it is. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work</b> <br><br>  Team building. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  When a project is just launched or it is necessary to ‚Äúquickly revive‚Äù development, it is not enough.  Well, for example, I go to bed at 4, and wake up at 10. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you work?</b> <br><br>  This is 24 minus those 6 that I sleep and minus a couple more.  It turns out, 16-14. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  Usually in the format of a 5-10 minute snack before a shower, listening to music in VK or reading the news on Medusa. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  There are two ways to get me to work: a bicycle - and then most often I get absorbed in my thoughts about work, or a taxi - then Confluence / Slack. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  My todo manager?  Here it is (shows A4 sheets in sweeping illegible lines). <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Confluence.  We close some projects without using the task tracker at all. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  Task tracker - TargerProcess and JIRA. <br>  Repository - GitHub and your Bitbucket. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  Atlassian and Ruby Ecosystem. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  Yes of course!  The main direction of development is Ruby.  It is based on the Sinatra framework, and to take into account our specifics (quick return of any of the 100k + pages), we are working on a Sinatra wrapper for caching, called it Marfa.  Plus a couple of little ones, but more about that later. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  My real job is no longer writing code, but communication, so I‚Äôll talk about them.  It is annoying when you encounter the habit of communicating "as in the Russian Russia" not at all in the Mail, but among colleagues, for example.  Unfortunately, in the past I came across a shaking of the air: they transmit the negative without address, and not to a specific person who can make a decision - this is a sign of unwillingness to resolve the issue. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  I read a little and mostly practitioners - those who did what he wrote with their own hands.  For example, Rework did not finish reading (smiles). <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Paper.  Only paper. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  ThinkPad X220 and nothing more.  Retrograde: waiting for the Thinkpad Retro Project (smiles). <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  Native listen-to-listen playlist. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  The good old rule of three nails. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Darer to defend their decisions, because there is experience, reasoning and flair. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Listen to yourself and do what you really like. <br><br>  Forget the word "full stack".  The more you know, the more junk in your head, and the less depth of immersion in each direction. <br><br>  Be just a specialist - those who are aware of the market as a whole, but a professional in one particular direction. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321416/</a></p>
