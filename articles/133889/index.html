On the one hand, the pioneer "Respect and Respect," on the other - the next one is already going along the trodden path ... In short, as always, a double-edged sword.  And whether HTC was the first to be lucky to acquaint customers with the new and unusual OS Windows Phone 7, or Samsung, entering our market with its Windows Phone, no longer need to bother and especially imagine it - everyone already knows that Microsoft has a new axis. .  And this ... This is the Omnia W - the first alternative to mozarts, radars and titans. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is what? </h4><br>  As I said, HTC was the first to bring WP7 smartphones to the Russian market - this happened back in September.  Budget, last year, but quite a good Mozart appeared on the shelves, accompanied by a massive advertising campaign on TV and on city billboards.  Radar and Titan followed him.  And only literally a week ago, Samsung, without a particular pump, presented the first windshield in Russia - the Omnia W. Something tells me that this smartphone will still be quite difficult, since one of the rivals has been on the market for a couple of months and is cheaper by several thousand rubles, and after a couple of weeks, sales of the Nokia Lumia 710 will start, which will also be 1,000 rubles cheaper.

It is clear that it consists of a pile of small items, but the feeling is that there is something monolithic in the hand: no extraneous squeaks, badly fitted panels or something like that.  The only complaint is probably only to the two-position button of the camera, which rattles a little in the upper position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dd/1c8/324/0dd1c8324ff054a21147d84074be3829.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Super AMOLED, 480x800 pixels and, of course, a capacitive sensor.  It seems there is nothing to find fault with, but in the editorial office we are a bit spoiled and sometimes picky.  The fact is that the grain is visible ... Well, that is, it is not the end of the world, but after the release of the iPhone 4 with its retina screen, and the same Galaxy Note, whose pixel density per inch exceeds the resolution when printing, 480x800 pixels on the diagonal 3.7 "already seems not enough. <br><br>  Otherwise, everything is fine: the viewing angles are wide a little more than full, the color rendition is traditional for Super AMOLED at altitude.  Well and what is most remarkable - such a display consumes less energy, which in smartphones is worth its weight in gold. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The configuration of the hardware stuffing in the devices on Windows Phone 7 mostly depends not on the manufacturer, but on Microsoft, which sets a certain level of performance so that their OS does not slow down and does not appear in the anecdotes about Estonians.  Apparently, in connection with this, the chipset in the Omnia W is not much different from those installed in the rival gadgets of the same generation.  Vindofon Samsung is built on the basis of the Qualcomm MSM 8255 chipset, which includes an ARM processor with a frequency of 1.4 GHz, 512 MB of RAM and 8 GB of main memory, which, unfortunately, can not be expanded.  The operating system on this hardware feels great, and according to subjective sensations it behaves somewhat quicker than on the same HTC Mozart, which will be older, and which has a gigahertz processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d21/bc3/2a7/d21bc32a7cea17371ea00743759bcac0.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Testing the performance of WP-devices, I think, we will continue using the utility WPBench.</i>  <i>Omnia W she scored 95.5 points, and I, as his ‚Äúowner,‚Äù awarded 69th place overall</i> <br><br>  In addition, it is worth noting that the Omnia W is able to work with our satellite navigation system - GLONASS.  That is, not separately, but in combination with GPS - this feature can be activated in the settings.  This does not give any super-magnification of accuracy (although there are changes for the better regarding the work with only one satellite constellation), but the location is much faster and is less often lost.  The signal is often able to catch, even while in the room. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The quality of the pictures that can be made with the Omnia W five-megapixel camera is quite good in principle, but as always, in low-light conditions, there are noises, and the LED flash does not save - its power is simply not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72d/7cc/1c9/72d7cc1c98b82f014413d7e6476cb139.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href=""><i>"Assistant incomprehensible devil Alexei Goncharov" in full resolution</i></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/101/e3f/703/101e3f703901b89d4172080a576955be.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href=""><i>Full-resolution air suspension game chair</i></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/3c9/a45/b363c9a452a017a693a78f6dcdfed8e5.png" alt="image"><br>  <a href=""><i>Lunch in the MK-shnoy dining room in full resolution</i></a> <br><br>  Maximum video quality - 720p at 30 frames per second.  Severe winter Chertanovsky landscape looks pretty good, I think. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VJKCb0_afPY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg92EVDNy1maFPdSuWgsqab8S5gIQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But it was pretty scary to keep the device during the video shooting at the height of the third floor - somehow it is unreliable to sit in his hands in landscape orientation. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  7.10.7740.16 - this is the latest firmware version at the time of this writing.  The Zune program just offered to upgrade to it in order to fix some minor Exchange and voicemail bugs.  This, of course, is neither hot nor cold for me, but okay, I will spend half an hour on the update. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/4ba/30f/dfd4ba30fd97e5783819e4bbdd031413.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In terms of customization of the interface from Microsoft, everything is still strictly, so manufacturers are getting out of the situation as they can.  HTC makes its own hub, and Samsung decided to place their applications in the Marketplace in a separate section of the Samsung Zone.  There are currently 18 programs in it, a third of which are dictionaries, and the rest is occupied by all sorts of widgets, entertainment applications like FunShot and several useful utilities: RSS Times, Wireless MAnager, Video Call, MiniDiary. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  The Nokia Lumia 800 has a battery capacity of 1,450 mAh, the Lumia 710 has a capacity of 1300, and the HTC Mozart also has a capacity of 1300. Omnia W decided to equip it with a 1500 mAh lithium-ion removable battery.  On paper, this makes the gadget cooler.  In fact, I didn‚Äôt notice a special increase: that Mozart, that the Omnia W has been working stably for me for a day, after which I still think half a day that I should have already put the smart on charge, until he himself plaintively asks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fee/b5e/b28/feeb5eb28dbaefd2de472900f5f536bd.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Competitor </h4><br>  Despite frequent comparisons with HTC Mozart, the main competitor of the Omnia W is still the Nokia Lumia 710. It has about the same characteristics, a bit more attractive price.  But its design does not bother me at all, so I would have overpaid a thousand and would have taken Samsung right now, and would not have been waiting for Nokia in mid-December. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b8/ab1/6e2/8b8ab16e2ecba26ae0f5cb1129487375.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Samsung suddenly managed to make an attractive gadget at (attention!) A pretty reasonable price!  This, of course, can not but rejoice, because in the last couple of years the price tags for the company's products have already been overworked and, in my opinion, have prevented sales from being made better than they were.  In the case of the Omnia W, the situation is perhaps more favorable: although this smart is once again more expensive than its competitors, the price difference is not so great, and the quality and design are on its side. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> WP7.5 Mango (7.10.7740.16) <br>  <b>Processor:</b> ARM 1.4 GHz (Qualcomm MSM 8255) <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 512 MB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 8 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 3.4 ", Super AMOLED, 480 x 800 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 2.1, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB 2.0, 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> 5 megapixels, flash, autofocus + 0.3 megapixels.  for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1500 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 58.8 x 115.97 x 10.9 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 115 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 15000 rubles </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133889/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133889/</a></p>
