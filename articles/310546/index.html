  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New in our big data program and three scholarships for training</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Habr, hello!  Soon, on October 5th, the fifth <a href="http://newprolab.com/bigdata/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dnew">batch of the Big Data Specialist</a> program will start here.  Now an active stage of preparation for the organization of this 3-month marathon is underway, and my colleagues and I wondered what would be new in this set. <br><br>  The program already exists on the market for 1.5 years, it has been tested and worked out from different sides, but there are important changes due to the fact that the technologies are not standing still. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a16/bd2/c18/a16bd2c18f564b4ca1d319400be7c4f2.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. Apache Spark 2.x </h3><br>  The entire second module of our program, which is devoted to the development of recommender systems, is based on Apache Spark.  On the first set, we used version 1.3.  In a relatively short time, Spark managed to go from a tool that is constantly falling for unknown reasons, to a solution that many <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Newprolab/data-science-week-2016-rambler-co-apache-spark">companies have implemented as their core business</a> .  We always keep our finger on the pulse and use the latest version of Spark on our cluster.  The new version has a <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2016/07/26/introducing-apache-spark-2-0.html">lot of improvements and changes</a> in the field of working with the tool itself, so this will be covered in our program.

    <h3>  2. Spark Streaming Workshop and Workshop </h3><br>  These two lessons were experimental in the previous sets.  Practice has shown that it is very interesting and useful for listeners.  The master class is our graduate and data engineer from E-Contenta, which is our partner.  He talks about how they apply Spark Streaming to online recommendations of video content.  At the seminar we analyze several practical cases, including the analysis of the content of tweets in real time. <br><br><h3>  3. Deep Learning Master Class </h3><br>  This activity was also experimental in the past.  We are going to meet our listeners if they have any special request for a particular topic.  Last time, many wanted to hear about deep learning: what it is, what modern achievements, what is under the hood, what intuition is behind this tool, etc.  This master class does not provide practical skills in working with deep neural networks.  If there is such a need, it is better to use our <a href="http://newprolab.com/deeplearning/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3Dnew">special short program</a> on this topic, which we announced at Data Science Week 2016. Presentation by <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Newprolab/data-science-week-2016-new-professions-lab-deep-learning-big-data-for-executives">reference.</a> <br>  Estimates for this lesson were very high, so we decided to leave it in the program. <br><br><h3>  4. Chat bot in Slack </h3><br>  Our main communication platform during the program is Slack.  In it, students can effectively communicate with each other, with our teachers, ask questions during the online broadcast, and of course ask the organizers questions. <br>  Most of the questions to the organizers are related to laboratory work, which the guys perform mostly at home.  There are incomprehensible things, sometimes it seems that something does not work, etc.  Approximately 80% of the questions are repeated among listeners, and from set to set, so it is logical to optimize it using modern technology.  This time we will use the chat bot in Slack, which will slightly relieve our coordinator and technical team. <br><br><h3>  Now about scholarships </h3><br>  Microsoft is a partner of the New Professions Lab in big data education.  This partnership brings the entire range of Microsoft cloud technologies to work with data to the educational program. <br><br>  The scholarship covers half the cost of education (90 thousand out of 180 thousand rubles).  A total of three scholarships are offered.  A candidate for a scholarship should already have at least one year of experience, while at the same time he or she should be motivated to master the field of big data. <br><br>  To get a scholarship, you must: <br><br>  a) Be no older than 28 years old at the time of application. <br>  b) Write a motivation letter.  Be sure to include information about your education, work experience, projects you have been working on (supplemented with links to the product or fragments of program code), your career plans for the next 3-5 years. <br>  c) Solve the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kfzBlrCyFhtA1aSzKcFF_TkRYd76iLXvmdto1mruFLU/edit">competitive task</a> <br>  d) Send the completed task, resume and letter to info@newprolab.ru by <b>September 26.</b> <br><br>  Results will be announced within a week after the deadline. <br><br>  Come, it will be interesting!  And, of course, we will be happy to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/310546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/310546/</a></p>
