  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to implement an idea?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4d/ed3/b94/d4ded3b9474a116b1d5696c0099ef9af.jpg" alt="image">  A very popular topic on Habr√© is startups. <br>  And here I am reading a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/90745/">topic</a> - send ideas to mail.ru, the best will be selected, you will meet with the CEO and, as I understand it, decide on what conditions you will jointly implement the idea. <br>  And then you read this topic and the realization comes - too many people need to be trusted to take advantage of the offer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  It is necessary to state it clearly and clearly by sending it by mail - you must trust the employees who will parse these ideas and select those who will be able to get to face-to-face meeting. </li><li>  It is necessary to ‚Äúsell‚Äù it to the CEO of mail.ru - you must trust the CEO, hope that the terms of cooperation that you will be satisfied with, and if you don‚Äôt agree, then everyone who has already laid out the idea will honestly and honestly ‚Äúforget‚Äù about her </li><li>  Finally, even if you agree, you can only hope that all agreements will remain in force, that any changes in the terms of cooperation (and they will no doubt be in the course of the development of the project) will suit you personally. </li></ol><br>  To be honest - too many questionable factors. <br>  On the other hand, it is not entirely clear what to do with ideas that are spinning in my head, but there are not enough resources for implementation.  And it‚Äôs good if you can afford to give up everything and plunge into your startup, hire people, have a plate of buckwheat yourself a day and dream of a bright future, it‚Äôs bad if you have a wife, two children, whose job you don‚Äôt throw ready, because to feed children with one buckwheat is somehow not comme il faut. <br>  In addition, collecting a team wants to avoid anarchy, to hedge against the fact that one of the team members decides to build ‚Äútheir own amusement park‚Äù alongside, taking your idea and ready-made developments. <br>  Again, as a healthy person, you must be aware that the likelihood of commercial success is not so high; therefore, burning bridges is too great a risk. <br>  There is a true concept, promoted by <a href="http://nerabota.ru/">Sergey Azimov</a> , the essence of which is that startups need to be done, not taking away anything from you except time.  That is, no financial investments.  But it seems to me in such a case it is unlikely that you will be able to cope if the plan is beyond your power.  And it‚Äôs not entirely clear what to do if a startup takes time that you simply don‚Äôt have. <br>  Easy way, apparently, no.  It is necessary to write out the options and evaluate the advantages and risks of each of them. <br>  But before that I want to learn from the community about the actual alternatives.  Interesting is the opinion of people who already have a specific experience in solving the issues listed below and a positive / negative result. <br>  Accordingly, a social survey!  :) <br><ol><li>  How did you cope with your startups, if you couldn‚Äôt make them yourself, how did it end? </li><li>  At what stage do you need to try to ‚Äúsell‚Äù your idea, whether you need to embody something or describe the idea in detail with financial evaluations, a planned strategy of promotion in a couple of paragraphs, etc.  is enough? </li><li>  If "sell", under what conditions? </li><li>  Who are you ready to offer your idea besides the best friend, brother and wife? </li><li>  If these are specific people, then how to reach them, if it is a company, then who and how to reach it? </li><li>  What other important questions are not included in the list? </li></ol><br>  I think the community, and I personally for sure, would be grateful for your answers! </div>
