      About three weeks ago, we discovered a website on the Internet, one-on-one copying the content of the original content of our store.  At first it seemed to us that someone decided not to strain at all, having torn off our content for his store.  We were simply amazed by the fact that in addition to the banal theft of the name, pages describing the delivery procedure, information about our company and the manufacturer‚Äôs guarantees were literally copied.  The fraudsters changed only four things - the date of the founding of the store, the TIN - to non-existent, the address - to the fictional one and the name of the director. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/compusale/pic/0000esr8"><img alt="compusale.ru against scam" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14d/aca/b43/14dacab43f7667a68b7dccee9fb19f50.jpg"></a> <br><br><br>  Looking closer, we recognized a uniform scam at this store.  Well, having contacted them under the guise of buyers, we finally dispelled our doubts.  By the way, a distinctive feature of a fake website was that all laptops were worth three, or even five times cheaper than the cost, which caused obvious suspicions.  So, MacBook Air, which costs 67,770 rubles, was sold on a fraudulent website for 8,000 rubles. <br><br>  The terms of the sale of goods also seemed funny to us: it is either 100% prepayment, then the delivery is free, or 20% prepayment for the goods, or payment for the goods at the time of receipt.  Complete nonsense;  Indeed, who will pay in advance for the entire product, if you can pay only 20% or wait for the courier. <br><br>  So, we decided to buy some cheap laptops as a joke.  Firstly, the site did not indicate the store‚Äôs phone number, that is, we could not find out the information about the availability of the model we need, or agree on the delivery time by phone.  Secondly, there was no standard feedback form for online stores through which you can order a laptop.  Just an e-mail on a free hosting.  We wrote a letter saying that we want to buy this and that, deliver it to us by courier to the office, and we will pay there.  Soon we received the answer that the order was received, formed, but we need to pay the courier, otherwise no one will bring us anything.  The scheme of fraud has become simply obvious. <br><br>  We attended to the issue of the legal closure of this ‚Äústore‚Äù and wrote to Ucoz, where the scam site was hosted, writing how things were.  In addition, we tried to punch the owner of this false shop, in order to humanly ask him to close the site.  With a high probability, we know who it is.  Whoever wants to fool around - let's take off the date in a personal, but, in general, once again messing around with this eccentric with the letter ‚Äúm‚Äù is a waste of time.  By the way, the same people own (and still work) the site <a href="http://mobilniki.3dn.ru/">mobilniki.3dn.ru</a> , which is also an obvious scammer - they sell the customs confiscated goods. <br><br>  Now this sharaga is not available.  We would have forgotten about this story, even Habra could have been unworthy if it were not for one BUT.  Scammers really managed to throw someone. <br><br>  Last week, we wrote a man who complained to us about this ‚Äúonline store‚Äù.  He said that he had paid for courier delivery at a store similar to ours, however, did not receive the goods, and asked us to comment on this case.  He even suspected us of the organization ‚Äúkidalov‚Äù, because, I quote: ‚ÄúAt least in the tab‚Äú about us ‚Äùthe same was written as that of you (about the company, quality assurance, emphasis on the buyer) ... On this palenom the site was written: Compusale.my1.ru laptop store was founded in 2007, and you have Compusale.ru in 2008, i.e.  most likely either everything is torn from you or it is you. ‚Äù  The logic, let's call it A., is quite clear: the name seems to be the same information (the differences are only in the year of foundation, the INNe and the names of the director). <br><br>  We are very sorry that A. from scratch lost his money by paying for the delivery, which will never happen.  But this is also a lesson for absolutely everyone - you, as well as your friends, and your slightly less experienced friends, and all the owners of their small or large Internet businesses. <br><br>  We answered A. that compusale.ru does not have a relationship with the store where he made the purchase, and gave him a couple of recommendations which, in fact, it would be useful to read and remember to everyone. <br><br><ul><li>  Telephone for communication.  Any respected customer online store, even closing, should at least have a telephone for communication.  This is an axiom. </li><li>  Corporate e-mail.  The online store is simply obliged to use the corporate e-mail to communicate with its customers.  Yes, this is not a guarantee of crystal honesty, however, a factor worth paying attention to.  (Sharaga used mail to mail.ru) </li><li>  Address.  There should always be a clear geographical reference. </li><li>  Certificates of payment systems.  Shops, if they accept money through WM or Ya.Money, must have special certificates confirming the existence of a legal entity.  Fraudsters will not receive such certificates, because they need to shine their data - a passport, other documents.  Is that fraud is assumed to be very large. </li><li>  Details for bank payment.  If they are, this is an indicator of the existence of a legal entity.  If the store works illegally - without a legal entity - this is a reason to doubt its honesty. </li><li>  Other details.  If the site contains additional details such as an INN, they can always be checked for specials.  services.  For example, at <a href="http://www.valaam-info.ru/fns/">http://www.valaam-info.ru/fns/</a> you can check the TIN of any company.  Take our from about the page of information on the company - it will turn out.  Take the one that was listed on the fake website - 7808458173 - you will not find anything. </li></ul><br><br>  Counteracting this type of fraud, as you all understand, is very difficult, but possible.  You just need to periodically monitor the information environment regarding your Internet project.  Now no one is surprised at the appearance on the Internet of clones of ‚ÄúVkontakt‚Äù or ‚ÄúOdnaklashnikov,‚Äù however, it is the owners of the original portals and startups that first of all need to be vigilant.  There are legitimate ways to shut down malicious sites - this is an appeal to the newsletter, and directly to hosters.  Not the most legitimate, too, exist - from DDoS to brute force.  But the most important thing - having learned about the presence of such a sharaga - still try to close it. <br><br>  In the comments, we will be happy to hear your ways of identifying such fake sites, maybe even their addresses, as we add we will update the post itself.  We are sure that this information may be useful to you.  The e-commerce market will grow, it is possible that by warning someone you know, while you are far from online purchases, you will not let them lose their hard-earned money. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47046/</a></p>
