  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is Wickr?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  All of you, for sure, remember the <a href="https://wickr.com/">Wickr</a> app, an anonymous chat that leaves no traces, which arose after a story with a leak of information from the NSA.  TechCrunch <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/05/06/encrypted-wickr-foundation/">reports</a> that in the near future, the application is waiting for a big change, as recently it became known that co-finder and ardent privacy advocate Nico Cell is leaving the post of CEO in order to assume the position of head of the Wickr Foundation.  Since the topic of communications is close to us, we could not pass by and decided to tell you what Wickr has there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8b/2ec/e8a/d8b2ece8a1d94d1b8c855146e8ad580f.png" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Wickr is an online messenger, which appeared in 2013 after the story of Snowden.  According to the developers, Wickr differs from hundreds of similar chats in that it is 100% anonymous, reliable, leaves no trace not only on devices, but also on servers.  It was reported that the application uses encryption standards AES 256, ECDH 521, RSA 4096 TLD.  Wickr was introduced as a safe alternative to ‚Äúthis is your facebook‚Äù.  The idea came to taste, and in 2014, Wickr spent the first round of funding, raising 9 million.

      At the very beginning of its creation, Wickr was presented as a replacement for Facebook and Skype.  Niko speaks against Snapchat, saying that the chat is deceiving users because it stores all the information on its servers only by erasing it from the gadgets.  By 2015, Wickr has already raised 39 million. <br><br>  Today, Wickr is in the process of being divided into two parts: a commercial organization that will continue to develop Wickr as a business, and a non-profit organization, which will promote safe communications.  Nico Sell herself will be in charge of the Wickr Foundation, and Mark Fields, one of the leaders of the Strategic Investment Group, will take over the business. <br><br>  The name Niko Sell, widely known in the West, may not be familiar to all Russian readers.  This is a very curious person who, in particular, always appears in public in sunglasses.  Not so much is known about Cell - she is about 40 years old, she grew up somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, has a bachelor's degree in management (with a focus on nuclear strategy) Dortmouth.  Niko Sell is known as a fierce advocate of privacy rights, and in addition to the Wickr app, he is a co-founder of the DEF CON HAER conference, gives lessons in children's programming camps, and is an expert on cryptotechnologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a8/34c/67f/8a834c67fa404649b21734cf56e14a36.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Today, the application has grown into a powerful organization, which will soon be divided into two parts.  It is not clear how Wickr will earn money, considering that the application is free and cannot interest advertisers with any information about its users, however, it is already known that selling a certain standard for organizations that want to create a corporate chat or even an application is an option. based on security and privacy.  Simply put, become a B2B platform. <br><br>  In the future, according to Nico Sell, she hopes to see an industry where all applications will work according to a similar scheme - providing the user with 100% security.  Being a specialist in the field of crypto, Niko Cell considers this area the most advanced, where, as in rocket science, the best minds are concentrated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b3/415/19f/3b341519fd2640cfa347e95449177661.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To date, Wickr has 6 million downloads; more than 1 billion messages have been sent and received.  Nico Sell herself, she said, is going to spend a lot of time in Washington in order to convey his idea to the legislators. <br><br>  Ps We in Rocket Callback are also in favor of confidentiality and therefore, unlike other similar services, we do not have access to the records of conversations of our clients. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290344/</a></p>
