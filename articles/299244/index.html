Funny in this case is that when working with large MI these problems almost never arise, but they ask more questions, but none of them feel panic about the services of the complete file.  On the one hand, this is understandable, in the segment of large stores, to the filling list, they have already become slightly accustomed.  But still it is worth noting that for ‚Äúkids‚Äù - this addiction happens much more difficult. <br><br>  "Silently crawl, snail, on the slope of Fuji, up to the heights" <br>  Kobayashi Issa

      As you know, in order to understand the cause of fear, you need to try to put yourself in the very position in which the object under study is located.  What we try to do in this article. <br><br>  Meet Petr Ivanovich, a resident of Saratov, a future serious Internet entrepreneur, and now just a sales manager in a certain company of Horns and Hoof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26a/fe8/dc5/26afe8dc5b614ec6bc56034627e36f96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><br>  Peter Ivanovich decided long ago to ‚Äútake life into his own hands,‚Äù and as everyone knows, one of the common misconceptions about this is that you need to open your own business. <br><br>  Occupation in general is not tricky, besides, a rather logical choice is to open a business on the Internet, this is accompanied by many factors that I will not enumerate in this article. <br><br>  And so, one fine day, Peter Ivanovich decided to open his online store. <br>  Decision is made.  Now we must determine what this store will sell. <br>  What do real samurai Russian business usually do for this? <br>  They are looking for a long time, what the world is missing, formulate hypotheses, test them communicating with their potential customers, consider the economy of the product, communicate with other entrepreneurs working in the chosen field so that they tell them about possible rakes ... In general, nothing unusual, but it takes time. <br>  And there is no time for Petr Ivanovich, because he has already made a decision.  You remember this suicidal expression ‚Äúwhat is there to think, it is necessary to jump,‚Äù or this is ‚Äúthe man said, the man did.‚Äù  Well, our hero thinks something like this, He is a real man, so if he ‚Äúsaid‚Äù, then it will be necessary to ‚Äújump‚Äù and ‚Äúnot think‚Äù, nothing from the bridge, and it‚Äôs scary without a parachute.  Therefore, after thinking a couple of hours or a couple of days, he decides to sell curtains. <br><br>  Yes, and God take off.  At first glance, the idea is really good, everyone needs curtains. <br>  Of course, it would be desirable to at least make sure of this, but what the hell is not joking can and will succeed. <br><br>  How many books and articles have been written, including by your humble servant that novice entrepreneurs would commit, such idiotic leaps into eternity. <br>  Well, what to do, the Russian people in general at the organic level does not digest all sorts of instructions.  To make sure of this fact, it is enough to observe how most people assemble furniture from Ikea. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/feb/655/337/feb65533739e4e77ae02c900a616a2ef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, let us return to our unfortunate, of course, we all understand that without knowledge of the market, the economy of the product, without knowing whether there is any demand for his product at all, he has no more chances than the newly hatched turtle to crawl to the sea among a flock of hungry gulls, but our hero does not know it yet and desperately rushes to storm freelancing in search of a cheap Tajik programmer who will make him a super-store for three kopecks. <br>  Of course, this store should be with the author's design and some hellish super-features that will never come in handy, but how do our hero know about it, because he is driven by inspiration.  At the moment, he is not an entrepreneur, but ‚Äúthe creator of his future.‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, the found freelancer begins to slowly eat his brains and money, feeds him with breakfast and after-breakfast in general, spins the dynamo to the full. <br>  Petr Ivanovich could spend a couple of days and create an unpretentious template store on his own knee using one of the many platforms that give this opportunity.  But he is not stupid and thinks about the future, because no one knows what will happen with this platform when 100,500 visitors of hungry curtains visit the site, besides it is too simple and cheap, which means it cannot be good and anything else in that spirit.  In general, for some important reason, he believes that the money that he spends on his own heaped-up IM is not a waste, but an investment. <br>  And then, after a year and a half and a couple of hundred thousand later, he finally gets his crooked, under-genuine, but such a dear IM.  For him, this is a real family holiday, his spouse, deprived of leave this year due to embezzlement on the ‚ÄúFuture of the Family‚Äù, looks at her husband with undisguised delight, ‚Äúwhat a fine fellow he has made, did it all, did, now quickly unwind and ... " <br>  The peculiarity of this situation lies in the fact that since they do not know a damn thing about what they are going to do, dreams begin to grow like puff pastry in the oven.  In their dreams, they have already become masters of a small curtain empire, they have their own private plane, a skyscraper in New York, a house in the Bahamas, eternal youth, and God knows what else.  Just do not say that this has never happened to you.  Business is generally for dreamers for the most part, and the less you know, the more you dream, it is the law. <br><br>  Well, having planned enough, Pyotr Ivanovich nevertheless decided to get down to business and then it began ... <br>  The story about this will be long, so let's fast forward a year ahead. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9f/153/417/f9f153417c64441fb7c57f6f3233604f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  During this year, he learned that SEO does not always work.  For a while, I thought that Yandex Direct was created in the devil's lab specifically to torment and rob unhappy Internet entrepreneurs.  I tried to pour traffic from social networks and again leaked a lot of money.  During this year, he aged for five years, became suspicious to pain, lost faith in people, finally began to read books, redid his IM for two or three more times, and maybe even demolished it and made it all over again.  And he finally began to get something. <br><br>  Bingo!  Drums!  Timpani!  Petr Ivanovich has become a real samurai, now you can break the crowbar about him, and he will not even frown. <br>  His business is getting better, a small stream of orders pours from the store for 5-7 a day.  And he rushes like a scalded eel to addresses on his own car, hauling curtains.  He himself communicates with clients, he completes and packs himself, at some point his wife, son, daughter, mother-in-law joins him.  It turns out a real family row, just like in the tale of the turnip, remember. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bb/c00/0ce/6bbc000cecff409c9d002157662a251e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then a big, very big turnip has grown.  His store is now big enough to gobble up his entire time and the time of his family. <br>  And he decides to go to the ‚Äúother level‚Äù, take the employees and rent a normal warehouse.  He does all this with his own hands, he learns all this at night, because during the day he is busy and all this is eating money, buggy, mowing and not working on holidays. <br>  The most valuable resource becomes time.  The most consumable material nerves. <br>  It is ridiculous, but for many owners of MI, it is this transition to another level that becomes the cause of the collapse ... Because they are faced with new problems for solving which the experience gained earlier is absolutely useless. <br>  They are again at the beginning of the path where the micro shop should become a normal working enterprise, with its own vertical of power and rebuilt business processes.  This task is complicated by the complete lack of time. <br>  Here, as they say, the client has matured, it is at this stage that the complete operators can be most useful, because they can give the entrepreneur as much time as he needs, offer a ready-made, rebuilt logistics system, reduce costs for the warehouse, for employees, for departures, yes almost everything.  At this stage, the value of the complete file reaches its 100% and, in theory, the only question that should arise for an entrepreneur is ‚Äúwith which operator to start cooperating?‚Äù <br><br>  What really happens? <br>  Yes, nothing happens.  This store is too expensive, there is blood, sweat, a lot of time spent, lost faith in people.  It is not even a business, it is a religion, a religion of the most holy curtains.  The proposal to stop at one moment, to do all the things for which a person has spent almost all his time until this day and at the same time save, sounds to our hero as a call to invest all his money in MMM shares.  Our Petr Ivanovich rushes day and night trying to re-invent the bicycle, because life is generally a complicated thing. <br><br>  Petr Ivanovich, do not be so, here is the website of our friends at <a href="http://yambox.net/">yambox.net,</a> visit them, come to their warehouse, they have a team of 500 people who every day try to make your life easier.  Well, or choose another company, thank God there are a dozen, of course, not all companies offer something really interesting, but you have a choice. <br><br>  Regards team generate.club </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299244/</a></p>
