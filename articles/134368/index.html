  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scheduled message service</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once a friend of mine, a young entrepreneur Kotenkov NA, completely left his business to the trust management of his partners in order to distract himself, to see the world and free his head for new ideas.  In the end, this led to the creation of a scheduled message service called <a href="http://decwill.com/">DecWill</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt was not quite easy to make such a decision: to leave the project created by own hands, the management of which brought not only profit but also pleasure. <br><br>  But it turns out, sometimes it is very useful to temporarily step back from the daily race to achieve goals and look around.  In our daily life, you seem to be sitting behind the wheel of a car and rushing at high speed along the path you have chosen in advance.  Or even, perhaps, not you chose it.  Because of this pace, you simply can‚Äôt look around 360 degrees and see all the possibilities that you‚Äôre rushing by. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, it often happens much better if you have to deviate several times from the planned route.  It is very important to see detours.

      I changed my lifestyle and stopped the racing car!  I had the opportunity to distract myself and pay attention to reading and thinking.  I thought a lot about those Internet resources that are rapidly gaining or gaining popularity, about the importance of the network for modern society as a whole.  In the course of these reflections, I was born the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service of the planned messages. ‚Äù <br><br>  Imagine: the ability to send messages with the condition that they will be delivered if there is no message from you within a specified period.  Remember the movies where the characters used this technique?  Compromising will be sent to the right places if the hero is killed.  Or, for example, a more mundane use: send a will.  If there is no activity from you for, say, a month, then the message you sent will be sent to selected people. <br><br>  Such a service was eventually implemented and named DecWill (Declaration of Will).  Users can write any messages, attach photos and documents to them, assign them to any specific date or when there is no activity on their account.  You can send reminders to yourself or another person, congratulations, "letters to the future."  You can also keep a diary and customize its sending for any date or in case of inactivity, and the selected person will read your records. <br><br>  Express your wishes and comments about the service, they will be taken into account for the finalization of the service so that it meets the needs of its users. <br><br>  PS: One and a half months after the launch of the service, a similar function appeared in Yandex.Mail.  However, its functionality is not so wide: you can send letters only on a specific date, and the choice of date is limited to only one year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134368/</a></p>
