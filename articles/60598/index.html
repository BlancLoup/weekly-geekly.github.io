  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Euroset does not return money for defective phone. A series of the first in which the hero is faced with difficulties, but finds friends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell Khabrasoobshchestvo about the history associated with the notorious Euroset.  Repeatedly used her services and everything happened: both repair, and return.  In April of this year, the Nokia 2630 mobile phone was bought in one of the network's shops. Together with the phone, an extended warranty was purchased (it allows you to simplify the process of returning / exchanging / repairing, etc. + gives you a year of additional guarantee).  As it turned out, in fact, only one year of additional guarantees is given. <br>  The phone was defective.  The marriage was that the speaker during the conversation "gloh" and fought with current.  lightly fought, but noticeably.  Since the phone was needed urgently, it was decided to return it to the store, and buy myself another one. <br>  No sooner said than done.  Passed in the nearest salon Euroset Klimovsk-1 for examination on the 10th day after the purchase (just for the very extended warranty).  At the same time, I warned the receiving employee (unfortunately I did not remember his name) that I want to return the money, i.e.  break the contract of sale.  The phone was accepted, and in return they were given a receipt, where in the line ‚Äúrepair status‚Äù was ‚ÄúExamination of customer goods, Warranty 1-2 years‚Äù.  In any case, clarified that I just want to conduct an examination.  I was assured that everything is fine and I went home. <br><br>  And then it began to incomprehensible. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After about two weeks, they called me back and said that I could pick up the phone. <br>  Further communication took place with the shift seller Tatiana. <br>  She said that the device was repaired under warranty and I can check and pick it up. <br>  Please return money was declined. <br>  At first they told me that the phones were not subject to exchange and return and showed the appropriate piece of paper.  I had to remind them of article 18 of the Consumer Protection Act.  To this I was told that "the law has changed and the money can be returned only if the phone could not be repaired or it got into the service under warranty three times." <br>  I was embarrassed that I missed something in the law and showed them their own ‚Äúcertificate‚Äù (it‚Äôs a guarantee), where clause 3.2.1 is, which says that I can claim a refund in case of marriage. <br>  Tatiana slightly "surprised" and went to "call the leadership."  One of the phrases she said was (almost literally, there are witnesses): "We handed over the phone for examination, and they, as always, repaired it."  As a result, the money was not returned to me and they offered to write a claim to the ‚ÄúPRO-service‚Äù (they carried out repairs). <br>  Considering that I handed over the phone to the store and the store owed me the money too, I decided to write a complaint in the name of their manager. <br>  No sooner said than done. <br>  But for some reason, Tatiana refused on my claim to put a stamp on the receipt and stamp of the store.  Although I made a copy.  After several minutes of admonition, she wrote on my copy of the claim her last name and the word "accepted." <br>  Since the shop had to take 10 days to process the claim (according to Tatiana), it began to wait. <br>  At the same time, just in case I called the Euroset hotline and asked if I had done everything correctly.  The girl on the phone said that everything was so, although the seller had to put the seal and signature.  In addition, they assured me that it was just a misunderstanding and that I owe money back. <br>  After 10 days, no one called. <br>  Well, yes, we are not very proud and we can call ourselves. <br>  The girl asked for my name, found a claim and promised to call me back in the evening. <br>  Nobody called back <br>  Well, yes, forget - with whom at work does not happen.  I call again.  Ask for the name and IMEI of the device.  They say that Victoria is dealing with the claim and she will call me back in the evening.  I leave my mobile just in case. <br>  More on this day, no one from Euroset called. <br>  On Saturday I woke up in a good way and saw the missed call.  I called back.  Tatiana picked up the phone from the salon Klimovsk-1 and said that she received an answer to my claim. <br>  The answer was that the money will not be returned, because  the device was sent for warranty repair (allegedly stated in the repair receipt). <br>  I decided that the claim does not reflect all the perepity of this story and called Victoria himself.  good phone was specified in the answer. <br>  Called.  Explained.  I heard a new version of the refusal: the defect was insignificant, so a repair was made, and since there was a repair, then there can be no talk of a return. <br>  They do not accept any reference to their own guarantee agreement (clause 3.2.1.) Or to Article 18 of the RFP. <br><br>  In desperation, I decided to put the claim again here <a href="http://impravo.ru/jaloba/177-evroset-ne-vozvrashhaet-dengi-za-brakovannyj.html">impravo.ru/jaloba/177-evroset-ne-vozvrashhaet-dengi-za-brakovannyj.html</a> <br>  It seems like the official representative of Euroset is answering there and made a bet on the publicity of the discussion.  But, judging by everything, this will change little. <br>  The amount for the phone, of course, is trivial, but it has already leaped into the principle. <br>  I think that I will have to file a lawsuit in court, but first decided to ask the opinion of the Habrasoobschestva on this situation.  (And at the same time to arrange some anti-PR, Chichvarkin‚Äôs departure apparently had a bad effect on them, or I was just unlucky).

      <b>UPD:</b> Thanks to everyone who answered.  I once again re-read the receipt that I received when I received the phone - there is nowhere anywhere the word repair or maintenance, and the rules indicated on it speak specifically about expertise.  As a result, I decided to write another complaint with the help of a lawyer with all references to the law, and if this does not help, then go to court.  As soon as there will be a final of the story - I will definitely tell you. <br>  Thanks again to everyone. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> <a href="http://zavhozmk.habrahabr.ru/blog/61242/">Series 2nd, final</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60598/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60598/</a></p>
