  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SEO - good or evil?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's talk about SEO.  I noticed that many Hobrazhiteli do not like this industry IT.  Comments such as ‚ÄúI sincerely hope that the development of search engine algorithms will reduce this pseudo-activity to complete farce‚Äù, ‚ÄúSEO is a gop-IT‚Äù are supported by many. <br>  I propose to understand - is search engine optimization so harmful? <br><br>  There are a number of stereotypes about optimization.  I will try to dispel some of them. <br><br>  <b>SEO will die soon</b> <br>  Optimization will not die while search engines generate traffic.  So far, the search engines are the main generators of traffic on the Internet and there are no prerequisites that something will change much in the coming years.  Google, Yahoo, Baidu, Live, Yandex - among the most visited sites in the world.  A certain competition to them is made only by large social networks.  As long as it remains, sites will be optimized and promoted.  Web resources compete for visitors.  Visitors - this is an increase in sales, the cost of advertising on the site, etc.  That is, the struggle is actually for money.  In some subjects it is a lot of money. <br>  Search engines will change the algorithms, optimizers will adapt to them.  This is an inevitable process, so maybe it's worth taking it for granted?

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Optimized texts cannot be read</b> <br>  If the text is in the spirit: ‚ÄúOur company sells stools.  In the presence of wooden stools, iron stools, plush stools.  Our stools are the most stool-like, ‚Äùof course, it‚Äôs not very pleasant to read.  But such texts have little relevance to professional SEO.  So seo pioneer can write, but just as unprofessional - webmaster (or marketer, sales manager, secretary) can write terrible text with stylistic and grammatical errors on the site.  The text will not be optimized for search engines, but will be just as terrible in terms of perception.  I think we all have met such sites more than once.  So can the matter be in the unprofessionalism of a specific performer, and not in the industry as a whole? <br>  In quality seo-copywriting you will not even notice the keywords.  Usually their entry leaves about 5% of the text. <br><br>  <b>Purchased links are not needed, make quality sites and people will link to you</b> <br>  In any small competitive topics do not promote the site due to internal optimization.  Without links, nowhere, and your competitors will put them on their projects, rest assured. <br>  Do not strongly expect that you will be referenced by other resources in good faith.  First, in order for you to get links, your project should be recognized.  That is, to begin with, you have to declare and please yourself at least somewhere (social networks, forums, off-line).  Secondly, links to you will be put with words like ‚Äúinteresting project‚Äù, ‚Äúhere‚Äù, ‚Äúsite name‚Äù or just give a URL.  These are not the words for which you would like to move.  Thirdly, if it works, then for mass projects, try to get natural links for the site of a company selling concrete or chemical fertilizers.  No matter how high-quality a site you create, it will receive few links. <br><br>  <b>SEO is easy</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI made a website on the people, I registered meta tags, I bought links on the faces, and now my website is on the top of the query‚Äú slippers from Zhmerinka ‚Äù!  SEO is very simple! ‚Äù- such statements can be easily found on the forums. <br>  Not so simple really.  SEO is a very dynamic area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity: search engines change algorithms - optimizers are trying to keep up with them.  This is an endless catch-up game.  Seoshnik should be constantly up to date.  Over the year, search engine advancement is changing more than in some areas of activity over the decade. <br>  Large seo-companies open their <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/news/.info_news/2903/">research centers</a> studying search engine algorithms.  In popular themes there is a real battle for the top ten.  There are still 10 people willing to get visitors from the search. <br><br>  We now turn to the most important question: <br><br>  <b>SEO is evil</b> <br>  Those who think so argue that SEO helpers litter the Internet with satellites, link to high-quality resources and send their promoted resources to all requests. <br>  Let's try to figure it out.  There is a grain of truth here: satellites are being made, grids are being built.  But people usually do not see such sites, they are made for robots.  In addition, the satellite and govnosayt are not synonymous.  There are many satellites with useful information and beautiful design. <br>  Regarding sales links - have you ever thought that this is the main income of webmasters from their sites?  Tens of thousands of people make a profit from selling links on their non-commercial projects.  Someone 5-10 dollars, someone 1000-2000.  Selling links through exchanges like sape.ru and xap.ru brings in much more money than participation in banner exchange networks and even more than contextual advertising. <br>  Links on the site do not irritate the user's eyes as banner advertising and do not interfere with navigation, as a block of contextual advertising is placed in the middle of the page. <br>  Littering search results - who said that only poor-quality resources are being promoted?  Believe me, the optimizers themselves are much nicer to display in the top sites with beautiful design and useful content.  There is a trend - the more competitive the subject matter and the higher the cost of promotion, the more qualitative resources are on the first page.  If only because customers who spend $ 1000-2000 per month on promotion can afford to order a quality website.  This is not yet the rule, but the trend is visible.  Secondly, when the competition is great, the user must not only be attracted, but also kept on the site.  When the resource is ugly and inconvenient, the user will run away to another, located on the next line in the search. <br><br>  Each of us has come across a situation where it is difficult to find a thematic site on demand, since the first places are bulletin boards, forums and catalogs.  Doesn't seo do a good deed by pulling thematic resource to the first place by the relevant request? <br><br>  Another of the claims to search engines and SEOs is the commercialization of search results.  This is when you enter the information request "car", and you are offered some sites about car rental or sale;  enter ‚Äúflowers‚Äù, hoping to get to the site of floristics, and you are given only online flower shops.  Here is largely a claim to the search engine itself, whose algorithm can not strike a balance between commercial and information requests.  But work in this direction is underway.  Segmentation of search on information, commercial sites, blogs.  The same Rambler builds a <a href="http://beta.rambler.ru/">vertical search</a> , dividing sites into groups.  Gogo.ru offers its own version.  Yandex Blog Search is also a search segmentation. <br><br>  Although most search engines have a negative attitude towards optimizers, the latter, of course, push them into development.  Do you remember what search engines were about 3-5 years ago?  How poorly selective was the issue and how easy it was to influence it by changing only the text on the page and adding meta tags. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24881/</a></p>
