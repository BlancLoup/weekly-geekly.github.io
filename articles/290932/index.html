I and Co. have been developing Internet projects since 2009.  We did projects for such companies as Sberbank, Rosneft, Dom.ru, and others, but in the summer of 2014 they said it was enough (those who did the project business will understand;).  By the way, on the Megamind we have a <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/">blog</a> that we are constantly updating.

      Now I am teaching a project management course at PGNIU, a haunt tracker in IIDF.  And I lead the development of the project <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna">Carrot Quest</a> - a service for managing users and communicating with them. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/055/8db/b17/0558dbb17bcd60ecfc2556a51aaf795b.png" alt="image00" width="1108" height="465"></a> <br><br>  Today, the zoo of the various services and tools of Internet marketing is huge.  But the big problem is that they all work independently of each other and to make them coexist, you need to write more than one line of code.  Because of what in a dynamic business constantly have to spend money on the management of this zoo. <br><br>  Email services, online chat rooms, pop-up windows - they all know almost nothing about your potential client: at what stage of the purchase he is, what actions he performed, what product or service he is interested in, etc.  Without this data, all internet marketing is just guesswork and monetary risk. <br><br>  This is especially important for web services and online stores, when you need to increase the conversion in the first and re-sale.  If you know everything about each user, your communications with him will be more personalized and more accurate.  This directly affects sales. <br><br>  We have created a service that combines the most important tools of internet marketing: eCRM, email newsletters, pop-ups, online chat and web analytics.  And due to their merger, new hacks appear.  This is what is called Marketing automation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd2/9c8/ba3/dd29c8ba36eb6cece599b4801cba2191.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  <b>CRM and personal analytics</b> </h2><br>  Imagine that you know everything about each user.  All his key actions on the site, what product he added to the basket, what function he used in the service, what article he read, what he talked with the operator, read the email newsletter, where he came from and how much money he brought for the whole life cycle. <br><br>  With this data, you know what interests your user and how you can really be useful to him.  As a result, successfully bring it to the sale, both the first and the second one (create letters with a suggestion, prompt in the chat, show pop-up windows, etc.). <br><br>  Marketing becomes meaningful and effective only when you know your users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0f0/23d/839/0f023d8391f9e977057a44697f39edea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here on the shelves laid out all the visitors to your site.  They can be divided into segments by any data and actions that they did on the site: <br><ul><li>  by the source of the transition to the site (domains, utm-tags); </li><li>  in the city and region; </li><li>  on the actions that they did on the site (for example, they registered, added goods to the basket, subscribed to the newsletter, paid the subscription twice, did not return to the site for 14 days or came again, and any other action); </li><li>  According to the data they left on the site (the presence of mail, name, etc.) </li><li>  on loyalty and willingness to purchase (scoring users by points); </li><li>  by the amount of money the user has brought; </li></ul><br>  All these parameters are easy to configure.  We made it so that any marketer could customize our service for their tasks, almost without resorting to the help of programmers.  Plus, in the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna">blog,</a> we constantly provide various cases that help customers use the Carrot Quest to the maximum. <br><br>  Of course, it is important to know how many users you have who, for example, bought more than 3 products and never returned to the site.  But it is even more important to return them and bring them to re-purchase. <br><br>  You can choose either one user or the whole segment and send him 3 types of messages: <br><ul><li>  Chat message; </li><li>  Pop-up window; </li><li>  Email </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>3 simple cases, how chat, pop-ups and emails work in a team</b> </h2><br><br>  1. We send a personal trigger letter to the user that he dropped the registration or the basket.  At the same time, we give him some kind of bonus or promotional code and he returns to the site from this letter.  Already on the site, we personally show him a small pop-up or chat message with a promotional code so that the user does not lose it.  Thus we advance on the funnel.  All this is sent automatically by triggers. <br><br>  2. The user wrote to us in the chat from a mobile phone and left.  We answer him in the chat, and the carrot quest forwards the message to the mail.  The user continues to communicate with us from your mail.  When the user returns to the site (already on the PC), he continues the same dialogue in the chat.  The user chooses a convenient channel for himself. <br><br>  3. We trigger (or manually) send ‚Äúold‚Äù users a pop-up about updates in the service.  The user answers it - asks to show how it works (the pop-up turns into a chat).  We are here in the chat activate the user in this new feature.  A week later we remind him of her (Carrot Quest himself forwards this message to the mail). <br><br><br>  Our main task is to make it so that the support, sales or marketing department, without straining programmers, can do complex scenarios of communication with users, support users, and return those who have left. <br><br>  Here is a small table of the features of the teamwork of chat, pop-ups and emails. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/65c/d76/c9b/65cd76c9baaaeccd2b3a12774c2137a4.png" alt="image02" width="613" height="788"></a> <br><br>  Of course, what could be "communication" without evaluating the effectiveness?  Full analytics is available for all types of messages.  For example, for mailings these are all important actions: open rate, click rate and replay rate. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/01b/8f9/a18/01b8f9a1894ecda6c24afc75a0676cfe.png" alt="image04" width="684" height="142"></a> <br><br>  And you can see right here who exactly did this action, go to the card of this user and see what he did next, after reading the message. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cc1/5b7/467/cc15b7467fa776e526eb5de374c91ef4.jpg" alt="image06" width="1450" height="900"></a> <br><br>  As a result, you set up automatic messages in the chat and e-mail, do manual mailings and get all the answers in one service. <br><br><h2>  <b>Measure the conversion of each action</b> </h2><br>  The goal of your business is to increase profits.  The question is, how do your actions affect your business, how does your promotion affect your profit, where do you ‚Äúlose‚Äù your customers, how do your operators and the sales department work?  All this is important not just to know, but to constantly monitor and improve. <br><br>  By collecting data on user actions in Carrot Quest, you can instantly configure different funnel options and evaluate the effectiveness. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/1e9/c64/739/1e9c64739639b7acf7000fc688b2387f.png" alt="image05" width="921" height="313"></a> <br><br>  Collect the funnel can be faster than to say the word "Mississippi".  And, probably, even easier. <br><br>  Also just created a funnel to segment by channels, by email distribution, by utm-tags and so on. <br><br><h2>  <b>What is different from competitors?</b> </h2><br>  People often ask: ‚ÄúAnd how are you different from ...?‚Äù <br><br>  So that's what makes us different from: <br><ul><li>  Google Analytics tells you what's going on, and Carrot Quest shows who does it.  And gives the tools to communicate with them. </li><li>  Intercom sees only registered and chat users, Carrot Quest sees all users.  Also, there is analytics in Carrot Quest and almost everything can be configured without the help of a programmer. </li><li>  Online chat rooms.  They make it possible to communicate only with those users who are on the site, but for us this is only the tip of the iceberg. </li></ul><br>  This is the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna">product</a> we make.  The way we had to go is not easy, but we are proud of our every step. <br><br>  Thanks to all who support us.  Make reposts, help us and your friends find each other. <br><br>  And of course, let's argue in the comments about how it works and who needs it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290932/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290932/</a></p>
