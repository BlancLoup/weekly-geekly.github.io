      <strong>Good but unloved</strong> <br>  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (hereinafter Call of Duty 4 or CoD4) - the game is really very good.  She came out on several platforms at once, playing it, you get real pleasure, Call of Duty 4 shows a very good sales dynamics.  What else do you need? <br>  This is a difficult question.  Talking with developers and representatives of publishers, I always roll back to the same topic.  Briefly, it can be characterized by a meme ‚Äúwhy do you poison us?‚Äù  In fact - why?  Why about the game, which is interesting, sold, spectacular, which is like the millions of gamers in the world and, damn it, you yourself, write nasty things?  Well, not bad things, but - criticism.  And, which is especially offensive to developers and publishers, the criticism in your review takes a much larger volume than on praise.  Even if we face a very good game. <br>  So why do we, the journalists, do this?  To be honest, then - on the childish, naive confidence that in the beautiful everything should be beautiful.  When a game is bad, much is forgiven.  When a game is loved, everything is forgiven.  If the game is just very good, interesting, and most importantly - confident in its ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù and ‚Äúinterestingness‚Äù, then it‚Äôs probably not a sin to remind - what exactly has she done that, having jumped over the bad status, she could not become her favorite ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e3d/4b4/025/e3d4b4025d4cf7cd43a5a92200d014d2.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Sort Russian</strong> <br>  So, what prevented Call of Duty 4 to fall in love with me?  Quite a few things.  To be precise - four, one of which is clearly contrived - the plot.  The other three claims relate to the technical implementation, the duration of the solo campaign and the fact that Call of Duty 4 is not a first-person shooter at all.  What is it?  About this - at the very end. <br>  In the meantime, let's start with the plot.  As is known, the current political situation puts foreign developers in a very difficult position.  It lies in the fact that developers, damn it, is completely incomprehensible: how to show Russians in games?  Enemies?  It seems that this has not yet come to this point, especially since it is not the Russians who are blowing up NATO soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Non-Russians give ultimatums and go to cut out the Kurds.  Non-Russians are building (or are not building) an atomic bomb under the guise of a power station.  And most importantly, for some reason, these Russians are also fighting with world terrorism.  And, sometimes much more fiercely. <br>  On the other hand, the right word, it is impossible to believe that the Russians are good.  One has only to look at their eyes, at their combat bears with a ring in their nose, and at their matryoshkas - like nuclear warheads and their balalaikas, instantly turning into skilled Russian hands in a Kalashnikov assault rifle - and at once everything becomes clear.  If we still remember what the Russians usually write on the fences and the Reichstag - doubts are dissipated completely. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/969/8a2/d61/9698a2d6160465157703461585f7ad30.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  As you probably already understood, the plot in Call of Duty 4 is a traditional anti-Russian cranberry, sweetened by arguments about the fact that, unlike the dirty Arabs, Russians are both bad and good.  Well - as in the joke about the police and the coffins. <br><br>  <strong>Death dummy</strong> <br>  What saves the Call of Duty 4 graphics from being ordinary is textures.  Thanks to their clarity and quality, you somehow believe in the world behind the glass of the monitor.  True, the rest of the nuances of the pictures of this faith thoroughly interfere. <br>  I can‚Äôt say that I‚Äôm a big supporter of the new fashion on hypertrophied physics, where from the slightest touch polygons, like fluff from a dandelion, fly to the corners.  However, when confronted with such physics as in Call of Duty 4, you involuntarily begin to think: at least some - but there will be progress. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/235/0c2/2c5/2350c22c51aa4a6b0d2a5f22605ae883.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  For physics in Call of Duty 4 - four years ago.  Bouncing bottles on the tables, which for some reason do not break (plastic?).  Indestructible walls of no matter what material (but the baby flies and the ‚Äúhole‚Äù texture is molded).  Pre-animated explosions. <br>  By the way, the models of fighters and the death of enemies are very well animated.  The variety, which bestows on the obscene aunt with the ragdoll oblique technology, briefly allows you to drive away the thoughts of the pathetic theatricality of the action. <br>  Unfortunately, special effects and light do not stubbornly refuse to hide the scenery cardboard from us.  And if there, where the lighting does not play a special role (sun-drenched streets of eastern cities), the textures stretch the image to the level ‚ÄúI believe, I believe, I believe!‚Äù, Then you just have to enter the house, light the corners or swim into the fog - it immediately becomes clear how toy world Call of Duty 4. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8ff/ba1/bf7/8ffba1bf783a1dd4097e401233dc0666.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>Run don't think</strong> <br>  If everything is done correctly and skillfully, the solo campaign of Call of Duty 4 lasts no more than 8-10 hours.  This is despite the fact that no one will allow you to act incorrectly here, and for operating ineptly two excellent crutches are provided - automatic restoration of vital energy (you just need to crawl away from the battlefield and take a little breath in the nook) and automatic saving.  Truly, the concern of designers that a gamer, God forbid, do not beat, do not get tired of thinking and do not drool from anger at an impassable stretch of the path knows no boundaries. <br>  As in all previous episodes of the game, Call of Duty 4 is built on the principle of a corridor filled with triggers and script events.  As part of a detachment, our hero runs through places of military glory: the Middle East, Siberia, Russia, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the sea and the air - performing a variety of responsible tasks.  In general, it looks fantastic, without giving the gamer a second to think. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/51d/6ac/7fe/51d6ac7fe6c30baa778347db3fdbb04e.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>With the wind!</strong> <br>  Call of Duty 4 is truly a top class ride.  While you go from start to finish, you will be shown a lot of interesting things.  Hunting for tanks, rescuing a hostage, fighting in a swamp, storming a television company, bombing a city, execution with execution, mass slaughter and even a nuclear explosion.  They will even be shown to participate.  A little bit ... <br>  Do you know why I could not love Call of Duty 4?  I practically did not play it.  I showed her.  All 8 hours of live broadcast, I felt like riding an escalator, on the walls of which the most fantastic battle scenes from recent history were depicted.  Here is the attack of the terrorists.  Here is a supertank.  Here is a lonely standing tower of a crane, near which a bomb falls.  Here is the famous Ferris wheel over Pripyat.  I stand and stare.  And I do nothing more.  Nothing‚Ä¶ <br>  Probably, I am an old-fashioned fool, but I, you know, got used to shooting in shooters.  Desirable a lot.  And aptly. <br>  When in 1998 I was first offered not to shoot directly from the doorway, but for half an hour to walk lightly, considering the beauty and everyday life of the Black Mesa science laboratory, I, believe it, even rejoiced at such an unusual move. <br>  Then there was Operation Flashpoint - where the hero made a cog of war.  Then - Medal of Honor, where the cog of war made the "favorite cog" designers!  Finally, the Halo project completed everything - showing that the computer genre of shooters can be engraved on consoles as well. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fa2/ee3/47c/fa2ee347c71256b45f8ceba767fca04b.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>New genre</strong> <br>  I will repeat for the third time: Call of Duty 4 is a great, very interesting, high-quality, addictive, sometimes very beautiful game.  A game that I will never love. <br>  A game that I will not love for alienity.  Consoles took the original computer genre, adapted it to their gamers, to their technical capabilities and now - as a handout - are trying to return it to the PC. <br>  A game that I will never love for brevity.  Yes, there are so many events in Call of Duty 4 that is enough for three full-fledged shooters.  So what?  I want to play 40 hours, not 8. 40 hours to shoot monotonous monsters in monotonous interiors, and not to ride a squirrel in a theater of military operations, so I did not feel anything. <br>  Call of Duty 4 I will never love for contempt for me.  It‚Äôs only at first glance that it seems that I am a hero.  I am a tool that is needed in a detachment, just to click on the next triggers and occasionally shoot mad enemies.  The rest of the guys will do themselves.  Schooled and beautifully - so that I could enjoy the spectacle and, apparently, be self-satisfied with my free hands and keyboard. <br>  Call of Duty 4 is a nice and bright game.  But this is not a shooter.  Not our shooter, the leading pedigree from DooM and Quake.  This theater, interactive thriller, a virtual diorama the size of eight hours.  The thing that combines slaughter and uselessness.  Strength and infirmity.  Ponty and stupidity. <br>  In general, the shortbore. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16751/</a></p>
