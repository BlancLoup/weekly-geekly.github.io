      <b>Do you make music?</b>  Have you thought about how many intermediaries need to be involved in organizing your concerts in order to simply recoup the cost of transporting props, purchasing new equipment and conducting rehearsals? <br><br>  <b>Create software?</b>  Have you ever thought about how many people should download the application you have written and use it at least several times to make sense in your work? <br><br>  Probably, you have already understood everything and know how it depresses, how you give up and it seems that it is almost impossible to achieve anything.  At some point, you could not stand it and quit everything. <br><br>  And we will not blame you.  And we will not blame anyone for giving up when he tried to interest the right people with his ideas and faced enormous difficulties. <br><br>  However, in something we are absolutely sure.  No need to strive to what you are doing, like a huge number of people.  This is not something to strive for and worth worrying about. <br><br>  This rule is.  It works regardless of what you do: run a startup, write a book or write a music compilation.  Whatever you do, the principle is the same. <br><br>  <b>You only need to worry about finding a caring person</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Because it is possible</font> </h2><br>  It is most likely that you will fail if you set a goal for yourself to collect a certain, pre-calculated number of people, upon reaching which there will be a sense in the realization of your ideas. <br>  Doing so is a direct way to frustration.  Let us explain: you will not be allowed to work with obsessive thoughts that the number of clients you need (visitors, readers, etc.) is extremely unattainable. <br><br>  You cannot do anything. <br><br>  You can not even decide where to start. <br><br>  But everything will be much easier if you try to find only one caring person.  It is quite feasible.  <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/9-kommunikativnyx-navykov-kotorymi-dolzhen-obladat-lyuboj-uspeshnyj-lider/">It‚Äôs all about making contacts</a> , as a result of which you will have the opportunity to talk with other people about the current state of affairs and the purpose of your work.  And to achieve this is not very difficult. <br><br>  <b>You can organize something like a support service - this will allow you to be in touch every day</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Good feedback from one person will give you a positive attitude to move on.</font> </h2><br>  Quite seriously, you will have an incredibly powerful incentive to continue doing your work if it interests at least one person.  After all, you managed to do something that influenced the life of another person.  Completely unfamiliar to you.  This person believes in you. <br><br>  From now on, you have the opportunity to look back at your first success and remember what feelings the person who triumphed feels.  This is useful if you make a mistake, fail, or just want to admit you are defeated and leave. <br><br>  One of the main reasons why people quit what they started is, in our sincere conviction, the absence of any visible interest from the others.  It seems to them that if they disappear, no one will notice. <br><br>  <b>Find at least one admirer or client.</b>  <b>At least one person will appear who needs your work.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>After that, there will be an excitement to get one more person, and this desire will motivate and push you forward.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. You do not have to shout into the void</font> </h2><br>  The most difficult part in the process of creating something is when you lay out your creation, but no one answers.  As if you are trying to scream into the void, in response to receiving complete silence. <br><br>  Once this situation broke the author of the article, John Westenberg, heart.  It seemed as if he had lost his way in the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãvoices, no one noticed or did not want to notice what he said or did.  It killed him. <br><br>  When John offered something, but did not get an answer, the usual reaction was to delete everything connected with it.  He was starting to hate his creation.  And destroyed it.  Then I started all over again.  We bet that he is not alone in this, and other people often feel that way. <br><br>  But if your strategy is not only to shout about your project everywhere, try to interest one particular person to them.  At the very least, this is how you will manage to avoid oppressive silence.  You will have constant contact with this person. <br><br>  <b>Silence will not put pressure on you, and the desire to give up everything every day will become less and less.</b>  <b>Over time, it may completely disappear.</b>  <b>Everything is possible.</b>  <b>But you can definitely say that you will be much more confident in yourself and your business.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. It will make you appreciate every victory.</font> </h2><br>  Do you know what failure is?  This, for example, when the number of page views of a blog falls.  When decreases the number of readers and recommendations in social networks.  Against this background, a terrible depression begins, and ... John Westenberg goes to his angelicly patient girlfriend and complains that the whole world hates him. <br><br>  It looks very self-centered, pompous and ridiculous.  And every time he does that, she tells him about it.  She also says that everything is in order, as long as at least one person is interested in what John is doing today. <br>  And she is right.  Need to appreciate every reader. <br><br>  Taking anything for granted is a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/zhalovatsya-zdorovyu-vredit/">very bad habit</a> .  Thinking so about your readers and believing that they are not going anywhere is just awful.  Do not do this.  It is necessary to appreciate every person who cares about what you are doing. <br><br>  <b>After all, they are all real people, with their problems and feelings, with a limited amount of free time, part of which they decided to spend on you.</b>  <b>If you are not a selfish scumbag, this should make a difference for you.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Every day you can count on at least one person.</font> </h2><br>  We know what you think now.  One person is not enough to create a group of fans or potential customers, which would allow you to start implementing something large-scale.  And you are right.  100% right. <br><br>  But remember how much easier it was for you to interest only one person. <br><br>  And if you do it every day?  Every day at the top of your to-do list should be one simple task.  Find another person and talk about what you are doing, and also try to explain how it can be useful to him. <br><br>  If you do this every day for a year, not everyone will respond.  Not everyone will like what you do.  Some will remain indifferent.  But even if 50% of the people you interviewed are interested in, in the end you will get 180 people. <br><br>  <b>180 people who need your work!</b>  <b>Try it and you will succeed</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. One really interested person is better than 10 random fans.</font> </h2><br>  John Westenberg has always believed that it is better to have one person personally associated with him and his work than a dozen lightly interested people who are today and may disappear tomorrow. <br><br>  We believe that all visitors or customers can be divided into two groups.  Rooms and people.  Numbers are those that should not be taken into account.  This is just the faceless statistics that you can see in the counter of visits to your site. <br>  They are the main part of the many visitors who have visited the pages of your blog or viewed your work.  These numbers can be impressive.  But they do not matter.  It's just puzomerki. <br><br>  People are those who constantly communicate with you, who are looking forward to new works and contribute to their creation. <br>  They are reliable.  They are loyal.  They are with you for a long time.  After some time you will know them all by name, because you will have many amazing conversations with them.  Most likely, this team will consist of those whom you collect one person by using the procedure described above. <br><br>  <b>People are the ones who matter.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. You can ask this person to make comments and suggestions for your project.</font> </h2><br>  Whatever you do, feedback is very important.  John Westenberg can never see the flaws in his work until they are pointed out by other people.  The reason is that he is reliably stuck in his own distorted reality, where he firmly believes in his exceptional abilities.  That is so much haughty John Westenberg. <br><br>  But, having received a quality and honest feedback from someone, he can take the place of this person, look through his eyes and see his work from another point of view.  John likes it.  Like to discover what he is wrong. <br><br>  Having the opportunity to personally contact the person, you will be able to receive sincere and very useful offers every day, and for this you will not need to beg people to leave their comments or wait until some anonymous troll gives an exaggeratedly one-sided opinion. <br><br>  <b>Just imagine how many new things you can learn.</b> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. You can create yourself a defender</font> </h2><br>  This is just a dream.  A person who likes what you are doing, and who is well acquainted with all the subtleties of the work, could be your strongest advocate.  If you do it right and find someone who really cares about your business, you will start creating your own team. <br><br>  They will find other people and share your work with them.  They will spread the word.  They will defend your good name, fight for you and advertise your project wherever it is needed. <br><br>  Do you know which of the bands in punk rock can be called the best of all time?  This is Fugazi.  They never became the leaders of the charts, and their songs never played on the radio.  But they had loyal fans, after each performance they went out into the world and told other supporters of punk culture that they found a band that plays authentic, real and incomparable underground music. <br><br>  <b>It worked.</b>  <b>The group has become a legend!</b> <br><br>  So how do you find this one person?  How to interest him?  It is very easy.  You must first define the search criteria, then find someone who meets these criteria, and contact them. <br><br>  John Westenberg prefers to deal with creative people doing something similar to his work.  Bloggers, writers, artists - all the same: <br><blockquote>  I go to Twitter, look through the list of their subscribers, select the people who are most actively following their work, and get to know them. <br>  At first, I get in touch with them and explain what came out to them, since we are interested in the same work.  And I would like to share my work with them.  Of those with whom I tried to make contact this way, about 80% responded. <br>  Almost every one of them will have time to watch your work, unless, of course, you are ‚Äúspamming‚Äù or behaving rudely.  This is not a situation where you can actively send emails or tweets to hundreds of strangers, your communication should be extremely personal and trusting. </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">I would like to add something about the phrase ‚Äúeat the whole world bit by bit‚Äù.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">This can be done only in this way.</font> </h2><br>  When John Westenberg and his girlfriend need to clean up the apartment, they start from one corner.  First of all, they clean the sofa. <br><br>  When Jobs and Wozniack just started Apple, they didn‚Äôt try to sell thousands of computers at once.  At first they sold one. <br><br>  When the group Green Day was just starting to make music, it did not sell platinum albums.  They sold each item individually to people they talked to after their speeches.  Somewhere at the very beginning was the first record they sold. <br><br>  When any of the multibillion-dollar startups were just starting their journey, they didn‚Äôt have hundreds of clients and supporters, you can be sure of that.  At first they found their first customer. <br><br>  If you start small, it does not mean that you are finished.  On the contrary, this means that you have set yourself a real goal, which you can easily achieve by <a href="http://magistrategy.ru/news/5-uprazhneniy-pomogayushchikh-zaryaditsya-energiey/">performing actions intended for this very purpose</a> . <br><br>  It is clear that this concept can not be called revolutionary.  Recruit the first 100 customers.  Earn the first hundred dollars.  All this we have already said.  But we are so not indifferent to this topic that we will repeat it again, in a more brief form: <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">All you need to do is worry about finding one person who cares.</font>  <font color="#0071c5">The rest is quite easy.</font> </h2><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/pyat-sekretov-vospitaniya-sily-voli-ot-agenta-fbr/">Five secrets of willpower education from an FBI agent</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.com/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299146/</a></p>
