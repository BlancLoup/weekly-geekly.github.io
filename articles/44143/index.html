  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geomancing or "wherever I want there and I am"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has long been looking for people of a special plan - those who can afford to live and earn money, anywhere, thanks to Internet technologies.  Of course, with reservations, visas, family, etc., this will not allow to be embodied in full.  I mean the lack of communication geographic location and source of finance.  That is, if I want to leave for 2-4 weeks in another country, dump for a week, the second in Komarovo and at the same time all the important processes for my financial independence will not stop. <br><br>  Of course, it can be argued that any more or less successful start-up is such a person, but this is 100% wrong.  I myself wanted to become so independent, and in my experience I felt that a startup is tying you to geography, as in principle any day job: <br>  - if a startup is legally registered and if you are the CEO, then you need to work with papers and ‚Äúmanage the team‚Äù, and most likely investors will keep you on a short leash so that you are within access. <br>  - if you are a programmer, a designer in a startup, you also need to be in the same place to solve problems quickly.  Yes, Skype conferences help, but again, most likely, not having a great background, investors will also be asked to be always in place.  And the salaries of startups are not so wonderful for a full life abroad. <br><br>  The question arises, who is this person who can receive money and at the same time live where he wants, leave the country when he wants.  The following images formed in my head: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>

      1. <b>Freelancer</b> with a very large client base, experience, portfolio, which is constantly loaded and can be located anywhere.  In my experience, there is no stable high income for freelancers, either empty or very thick.  <i>But the script is quite real.</i> <br><br>  2. <b>Blogger</b> .  Man, media on his feet, can post from anywhere and with anything.  Such people who run their blog and get good money units, for the simple reason that blogs are quite difficult to monetize and require a lot of time.  <i>This option is also possible</i> <br><br>  3. <b>Owner of his own business</b> , site, project (or several) bringing a stable income.  Sites with income you can just buy.  For example, dozens of sites with low and medium income are sold on digitalpoint.com, the price of the site varies from income multiplied by 6-18 months, well, or just as storguesh.  In theory, you can buy such sites to the desired 2-5 thousand dollars per month and not be tied to geography.  I'm really sure that the content of 10-50 sites is a huge gemmor.  On the other hand, buying sites on the same subject, you thereby strengthen their position and income.  <i>Option is possible</i> <br><br>  I would like to know if there are people among you or your friends who have gained geographic freedom thanks to the Internet, maybe there are some other possibilities besides the listed ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44143/</a></p>
