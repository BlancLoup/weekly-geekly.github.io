  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A look into the future of the profession. What should a programmer have to do besides programming?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sooner or later, in any professional activity, there comes a stage of summing up intermediate results, when a person thinks about prospects and answers many important questions for himself about the future in the profession and the desired direction of further development.  Where to go?  What awaits us next? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My point of view is this: in the near future, programming skills will be needed for almost any activity.  As well as the skill of elementary administration (I emphasize - elementary, that is, install, delete, configure tasks on a schedule, configure the network and the Internet).  For aesthetes of the genre - compress the cable and assemble the computer.  Look at the advanced technical devices: microwave - you need to program, bread maker - you need to program, telephone (smartphone) - program and administer.  And the number of such devices will only increase, along with the increasing complexity of the scenarios of their use.  I think everyone can remember the myths about coffee makers with Internet access.  Yes, I completely forgot about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/infosecurity/121229/">cars</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/121055/">vacuum cleaners</a> . <br><br>  Now each of us who can solve basic elementary tasks with a computer (several years ago the term ‚Äúcomputer scientist‚Äù was used, which meant a vague symbiosis of the administrator and programmer), is used by friends (for whom these actions are akin to magic <sup>1</sup> ) to perform elementary tasks.  I predict that in a few years these tasks will be standardized and all of them will be solved by much less effort.

      The parallel with the art of reading and writing is obvious to me.  Feel the closeness of the terms "writing art" and "programming art" <sup>2</sup> ?  Previously, when the ability to read and write was not part of the general skills, those people who knew how to write were attracted by their acquaintances ‚Äúfor thanks‚Äù or on a fee basis for performing these very tasks of reading and writing.  The ability to write was highly appreciated, the scribes were well paid for, the quality of <i>writing was good, beautiful</i> - that is, appreciated.  calligraphy.  Feel the similarities?  For those who do not feel it, I suggest the opposite: what code is called e ... coprocode? <br><br>  Where are the scribes now?  Where is calligraphy?  With the advent of typography and universal education, scribes (along with calligraphy) are a thing of the past.  Yes, many of them could write the same thing much <i>more beautifully</i> , but at what cost?  Imagine any document, but written by a trained calligrapher (or just a scribe), and even on hand-made paper.  Timing and budget beyond good and evil.  Write fast and cheap (but relatively <i>worse</i> ) or long and expensive, but <i>more beautiful</i> and <i>better</i> ? <br><br>  Yes, and now there are applications for calligraphy.  But, as a rule, for art and similar "not applied" tasks.  Memorable inscriptions, "antique", etc. <br><br>  I predict again: there will be a time when the ‚Äúart of programming‚Äù will be valued along with the ‚Äúart of writing.‚Äù  And then the question will arise - ‚Äúare you a programmer?  What else can you do? ‚Äù <br><br>  I want to finish with words that I think fit very well with the topic of this topic: <br><blockquote>  Anyone should be able to change diapers, plan invasions, cut pigs, design buildings, manage ships, write sonnets, keep accounts, build walls, set bones, facilitate death, execute orders, give orders, collaborate, act independently, solve equations, analyze new ones problems, fertilizing, programming computers, tasty cooking, good fight, dignified die.  Specialization - the lot of insects. <br><br>  Robert A. Heinlein </blockquote><br><br><h6>  Total </h6><br>  In the near future, programming will be in increasing demand.  The described scenario is probably far enough away from the current moment, so that there is no need to urgently take any radical decisions.  Programmers are needed, and will be needed for a long time.  However, remember - this may change. <br><br>  PS In more practical terms, I can advise you to look into <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/118558/">parallel worlds</a> - as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/tangro/" class="user_link">tangro</a> said - "there is a lot in the world, besides computer technology ..." <br><br><hr><br>  <sup>1</sup> A.
