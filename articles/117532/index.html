The pioneer with this idea was Biglion, who very soon will ‚Äúplay‚Äù several (and maybe one) Ford Focus car, the discount on which, according to Biglion, is 70%.  BigBuzzy (with their action ‚ÄúAudi without Focus‚Äù) and Darbury (Russian Group with Miss Group) followed him. <br><br>  All would be nothing if it were not for the mystery of the shares held Biglion and BigBazi.  And yesterday a ‚Äúsolemn‚Äù discovery of the essence of the action and its conditions to the people took place.  Made it BigBazi. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I will start with a little background and tell you how it all began.  It will be about BigBazi, whose action I have been following for the last few days, not only because I wanted to win a car, but because it was very interesting to learn the essence of their mesmerizing, mysterious action - audi with a discount. <br><br>  It all started about a week ago, when the BigBazi website reported that very soon there would be a special offer for all registered users - a discounted car.  Nothing was reported about the conditions of the action, and moreover, nothing was known about the car (it was covered with a mysterious yellow case).  Here is the information that has been communicated to users: <br><br>  - BigBazi has been waiting for this promotion for a whole year. <br>  - Any registered user can participate in the promotion. <br>  - Subscription by SMS and email is available on the start of sales <br>  - This is not an auction and not a lottery <br>  - The action will begin on April 14th. <br><br>  On the promotion page, all users had the opportunity to leave comments. <br><br>  How events developed further: <br><br>  Night from the 13th to the 14th of April - the first users began to monitor the situation with the action, write comments and wait for the case to be removed from the car and the veil opened.  The morning of April 14 is more and more comments, the number of waiting times is growing.  The action is actively discussed.  Dinner - the first skeptics and assumptions that this might be a divorce began to appear.  18.00 - the number of comments exceeds 1000. Tension and excitement grows.  BigBazi answers all questions that the action is about to take place.  Literally - "you waited a whole week, wait a few more hours, minutes, seconds."  Evening, 9 pm - many people write that they can no longer sit at the computer, that they update the site every half minute throughout the day ... 11 pm - there are more skeptics, a group of VKontakte appears - <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club26099783">Club awaiting audi on BigBizzy.ru or Naebuzzy.ru</a> <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/club26099783"><br></a>  where communication goes into a new form and where comments are not moderated by the BigBazi administration.  In 10 minutes the group grows to 100 people.  At 23.00 comments on the page with the action of more than 2500. <br><br>  Interesting comments and assumptions about how they could be fooling begin to appear.  For example - one funny "screenshot": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3b/d09/f7a/f3bd09f7ab4a1860ba24310e6479a771.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  0.00 - "lay down" site.  Moreover, it looked as if a stub had been hung on it, because the content was delivered quickly and without failures (502 bad request): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/608/39e/c69/60839ec6987a68ea4994f6d51c426d6a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All that remains for the waiters is the VKontakte group created by them, where they begin to say abundantly that all this is a divorce ... Some were going to go to sleep, some were going to sit until the end and update the page until they see the cherished conditions of the action. <br><br>  At 00.25 I was able to enter the site (like many others) and read the conditions of the action ... The mysterious curtain was opened.  Are you wondering what you need to do to get a car?  I will tell (the <a href="http://bigbuzzy.ru/discount/">prover link</a> ): <br><br>  - Indicate complete and reliable information about yourself <br>  - Bring 5 of your friends, and moreover, these friends should put in a personal account on the site for 100 rubles <br>  - During the action (which will be held on April 25) the fastest to answer the quiz questions. <br>  - And the most important thing is to put in the personal account 5,000 rubles. <br><br>  Cool, is not it? <br><br>  User dissatisfaction (judging by the comments on the site, in the group) is growing with incredible force.  People simply can not believe that everything they have been waiting for all day is only the first step on the way to the cherished car. <br><br>  Everybody is interested in the question of the number of cars - BigBazi says so: ‚ÄúWe cannot say how many cars we have, but we can say that there are more than 2, 3, 5, but only ONE car is being played at the moment‚Äù. <br><br>  And now let's estimate what this is all about.  The cost of the car is 1,500,000. In order to collect such an amount (based on the terms of the promotion), only 300 people are needed.  300 people who put 5000 rubles to the account in BigBazi + 150,000 (500x300) from each friend of the user.  Is it possible then to return this money?  The administration claims that YES, it is possible, you just need to just write them a letter ... Do you believe that?  How many letters will the administration need to send to get their money back? <br><br>  From all this I want to make a single conclusion and draw the attention of everyone who was actively waiting for this car (or maybe waiting until now) - there is no freebie.  Do not be fooled by sweet speeches, expensive prizes, especially in Russia, where nothing is done just like that and no one will ever give you too much from your pocket.  This is the law of our harsh country, where the main rule is to make money in any way ... <br><br>  RIP Bigbuzzy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117532/</a></p>
