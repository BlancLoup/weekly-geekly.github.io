This site is focused on Western users and is not available from Belarusian IP (in Belarus, which is one of the world's largest exporters of brides and prostitutes, recently introduced compulsory licensing of online dating services).  In addition, these domains were repeatedly mentioned in spam, for which they were blacklisted. <br><br>  An anonymous provocateur accused <a href="http://tut.by/">Tut.By</a> of pornhosting and spamming, and also personally accused Yuri Zisser (owner of Tut.By), to which some of these domains were registered.  Everyone who understands the business of hosting providers and registrars knows that the registration procedure is simplified in this way - all domains are processed for one person.  Surely, it was known and the author of compromising.  So such an accusation is just a petty meanness. <br><br>  Despite the ridiculousness of "compromising", the reaction of the portal Tut.By was not quite adequate.  Instead of calmly explaining the situation (in fact, practically any major hosting provider has similar questionable sites, and condemning the hosting provider for this is the same as condemning an online store for accepting cash currency), they started retaliatory actions.

      At the request of Tut.By, the relevant topics have been removed from the forums, so now they are only available in the Google cache.  In general, the censorship of forums is a rather characteristic act for the leadership of the largest portal in Belarus, which <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1043/">limits the freedom of speech in forums and blogs</a> so much that sometimes it <a href="http://forums.tut.by/showflat.php%3FBoard%3Darticles%26Number%3D2722114%26page%3D0%26view%3D%26sb%3D5%26o%3D%26fpart%3D1%26vc%3D1">becomes ridiculous</a> . <br><br>  Yuri Zisser himself, the owner of the portal Tut.By, came up with an <a href="http://bybanner.com/index.php%3Faction%3Dcomments%26id%3D3048">explanation</a> : ‚ÄúAll of these links lead to the same site (some of the‚Äú mords ‚Äùhave their own designs), which is an ordinary dating site, absolutely analogous to Mamba.Ru in terms of functionality and on content, only oriented to western audiences.  We don‚Äôt have any super profits.  This is the most common client hosting at our standard rates, he said.  - Yesterday we really tried to play it safe by asking to remove certain branches of the forums.  In vain.  Let it be.  I already talked to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Belarus about this, they are in the know, we have no complaints ... A big request to non-respected competitors to stop the black PR company, obviously, caused by the opening of <a href="http://hoster.by/">Hoster.By</a> .  We figured out and know by name who started this campaign and keeps it afloat, and if necessary we can prove it. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to our information, the claims of Yuri Zisser that they know the perpetrators ‚Äúby name‚Äù are not based on real evidence.  In fact, the management of Tut.By has not yet figured out exactly who laid dirt on them.  There are several suspects.  Among them are the former owners of Hoster.By, the developer of <a href="http://www.blog.inf.by/">the Belarusian Blogging</a> service Andrei Vopnyarsky, and also the main competitor of Tut.By in the hosting market - <a href="http://ext.by/">the Extmedia company</a> .  Anyway, the portal Tut.By, like any large company, has quite a few enemies. <br><br>  We asked Maxim Savchenko, Director of Extmedia LLC for a comment: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult to call this publication‚Äú compromising ‚Äù.  Rather like a childish prank.  The whole situation is sucked from the finger and is explained by the compelled necessity of Belarusian hosting providers to register the domains of their clients for one account or to indicate their administrative contact.  Given that hosting companies by definition do not control the content of their clients, and only respond to incoming complaints, sites with such ‚Äústrawberries‚Äù are guaranteed to every more or less large hosting provider.  The information that we are considered the organizer of this story, we also perceive no more, as a joke.  We have different target audiences and price groups and we, in fact, are not competitors.  In addition, the number of paid accounts in service is about three times as high as the affected colleagues.  In addition, we have civilized and good-neighborly relations with this company.  We sincerely wish our colleagues not to worry about nothing! ‚Äù, He said. <br><br>  Andrei Vopnyarsky also sent his comment: ‚ÄúI was surprised to mention myself among the suspects in this incident.  Why, on the basis of what and by whom was such an unfortunate assumption made in my involvement in the publication of ‚Äúcompromising evidence‚Äù?  Why did they switch the arrows from the problem to Extmedia and me personally?  I do not understand.  Moreover, nobody has addressed me with Tut.By.  Compromising material first appeared on the <a href="http://forum.onliner.by/">online forums</a> , where only registered users can post their posts.  It would be logical to ask the owners of the above resource for help, rather than to build accusations and publish them in the media, ‚Äùsaid Andrei Vopnyarsky and added that he is waiting for clarifications and apologies from Yuri Zisser. <br><br>  Although Extmedia denies its guilt, but there is a possibility that in the near future, ‚Äúretaliatory‚Äù actions will follow from Tut.By.  What they will be - we can only guess.  We will monitor the situation and be sure to report them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4506/</a></p>
