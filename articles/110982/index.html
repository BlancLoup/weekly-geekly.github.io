  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Clodo.ru cloud hosting - results of 2010</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past 2010, after a long and fascinating development stage, we presented a <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/">cloud hosting of Clodo.ru virtual servers to the court</a> .  Over the past year we have come a long way: from designing on paper to developing and putting our project into operation.  We have developed and successfully launched a product that meets all the principles of Cloud Computing.  We provide our customers with server infrastructure (IaaS) based on XEN virtualization technology.  In addition to the traditional virtual server with fixed parameters, we offer customers to rent computing resources with payment for actual consumption. <br><br>  With this post, we will summarize our work for 2010 and tell you about plans for the New 2011 Year. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  The beginning of the way </h4><br>  Our company, in the past, was a consumer of the services of the kind we represent today.  We were clients of many hosting companies, but the quality of services left much to be desired.  We bought our servers, but over time we realized that our hardware is a burden for the company.  Therefore, the history of creating a cloud hosting of virtual servers is trivial - we created a service that we wanted to use ourselves.

      The implementation of our grand project required money.  And the money is not small.  A startup in the idea stage has few chances of getting funding.  But, given the innovative component, we quickly found an investment in sufficient volume. <br><br>  Choosing a data center to host our infrastructure, we considered about 15 different options.  As a result, we chose the <a href="http://www.oversunmercury.ru/">Oversan-Mercury data center</a> .  In addition to technical excellence, Oversun bribed us with an approach to the client.  Taking this opportunity, we want to thank <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/climax/" class="user_link">climax</a> Maxim Klimko for all kinds of consultations and new connections. <br><br><h4>  Team </h4><br>  While the first batch of <a href="http://www.hp.com/">Hewlett-Packard</a> equipment ordered by <a href="http://www.tristan.ru/">Tristan was</a> already assembled on our order at a factory in Europe, we began to assemble a team to implement our ambitious plans.  The process of recruiting specialists is generally a topic for a separate article.  We can say that we are incredibly lucky!  We have assembled a small, but ambitious team - true professionals! <br><br>  In April, as a part of five people, we began to develop and in August we offered habriu people to take part in testing our product. <br><br><h4>  Testing </h4><br>  About 800 people responded <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/101123/">to the test proposal</a> .  At that moment, our solution was quite different from what we are offering now.  Testing the pilot version allowed us not only to get rid of a large number of errors in the code, but also made us reconsider our approaches to implementing dynamic scaling of virtual servers.  The interface of the resource control panel has evolved from a ‚Äútoy‚Äù into a strict and functional one.  The technical support service processed more than a thousand requests from our beta testers, which gave us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat the tool should look like to accompany clients. <br><br>  At the end of September a completely recycled product was ready.  It remained only to test the billing system.  This can be done only by having real customers with real money.  Understanding that a young company does not have the opportunity to get a large number of clients with money, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/clodo/blog/105016/">we offered everyone to get a bonus</a> of 1000 rubles for testing virtual servers.  As a result of this promotion, we received more than 1500 users who helped us not only to debug the billing, but also showed us the flaws in the corrected branch of our product. <br><br>  We express our deep gratitude to everyone who took part in the testing process of the <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/">clodo.ru</a> hosting project!  Our innovations are not only our work, but also your merit! <br><br><h4>  Cloud hosting Clodo.ru </h4><br>  Since the introduction of our project into commercial operation two months have passed.  In an effort to become the best in the market, we never for a second stop in our development.  We try to realize every wish we receive from our customers.  For example, the list of December innovations is as follows: <br><ul><li>  The list of operating systems available for installation on virtual servers has been expanded.  CentOS, Fedora, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE and Arch Linux - among this variety, everyone will find exactly what they need.  Each operating system is available for installation both on virtual servers with a fixed configuration - <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/hosting/vps-resources/">Virtual Server</a> , and on virtual servers with automatic allocation of resources - <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/hosting/vps-resources/">Scale Server</a> . </li><li>  The control panel has the ability to restore the virtual server from a backup.  The backup depth is 5 days.  Backups are created automatically, and the backup service is free! </li><li>  On virtual servers, the opportunity to increase the size of the system disk. </li></ul><br><h4>  Results of 2010 and plans for 2011 </h4><br>  We are proud of the work we have done in 2010.  At the time of this writing, <a href="http://www.clodo.ru/">Clodo.ru cloud hosting</a> services 584 clients.  Currently, 923 virtual servers are working on our cluster.  We are sure that next year these numbers will change significantly! <br><br>  In 2011, we will show you 2 fundamentally new products made in the concept of Cloud Computing.  In 2011, we are planning to build new clusters both in Russia and abroad.  Our clients will be able to choose not only the number of resources they need, but also the site for their placement.  2011 will make us even more cloudy :) <br><br><h4>  Happy New Year! </h4><br>  We want to congratulate all the participants of the largest IT community in Russia on the coming 2011!  In addition to the traditional wish of happiness in the New Year, we wish you that the New Year will bring into your life many new, interesting and profitable projects!  So that all your beginnings in the New Year will be doomed to success!  Happy New Year! <br><br>  <b>PS We</b> remind you that until January 10, 2011, we are continuing the New Year promotion, in which you receive a bonus in the amount of the top-up amount to the account! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110982/</a></p>
