Tips from the person who made it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  From the translator.  The original text is quite difficult to read, so the translation is crooked in places, but I tried. </blockquote><br>  <em>A couple of months ago, I was asked advice: ‚Äúhow to move from design to design‚Äù.</em>  <em>As a person who passed this way, I answered with pleasure.</em>  <em>After that, I decided that my advice could be useful to other people.</em>  <em>If you are a developer who wants to become a designer, this article is for you.</em>  <em>About why a developer can be a good designer, read the article <a href="http://method.ac/blog/design/programmers-designers.html">‚ÄúYou're already a pretty good designer‚Äù</a> .</em> <br><br>  I recommend starting the transition from software development (web applications, mobile applications, traditional software).  If you do not have such an opportunity, then try to do it in the near future.  I am sure that the approach to software development will change in the next five years, which will benefit people with skills in both design and development.  I think that in the future the designer will be more like a <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/ideas/what-makes-a-design-technologist/">design technologist</a> .  Therefore, do not view your current job as a hindrance, but use it as a starting point for a new vocation. <br><br>  I made a list of tips that will come in handy at the beginning of my career.  The profession of a design technologist was only being formed when I started working, therefore, some of my discoveries were made using the ‚Äúscientific at random‚Äù method.  I don‚Äôt think I would change it, even if I could.  My advice may be useful, but it is worth saying that it is sometimes worth plunging into the abyss of the new to get lost, with the belief that you will find the right path and learn something in the process. <br>  There is one more thing that can be taken from my answer - refrain from the mental separation of design and development.  When you create wiframes, you mean the code that you write.  When you program, you update the user interaction.  Separation is the first step to pipeline development.  We have many examples of terrible software based on this approach.

    <h4>  Advice </h4><br>  Remember, these tips are based on my views and the things that shaped my approach.  Much is just my opinion, with which other designers may disagree.  But this topic becomes even more interesting. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 1: Do not abandon development </h5><br>  A little more, and the software designer will need an understanding of how to develop it.  I have been talking about this for half a decade, and this is already becoming a reality.  Developers interested in design do not even realize that their experience is their biggest asset.  Designers will have to work desperately to get the skills you already have. <br><br>  It is important to keep your skills up to date.  If your goal is to shift the focus to design, then your daily development tasks may change, but your skills can still be applied.  The most obvious area where they can be applied is prototyping.  Interactive design is complicated, so prototypes are becoming more necessary.  Your skills in web programming will allow you to create more sophisticated, accurate and, I hope, insightful prototypes.  Ultimately, the real goal is not to see the difference between your design and programming skills.  The skills learned from each focus are interconnected, interchangeable, and equally important for creating good products. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 2: Follow Design Dependencies </h5><br>  Attempting to master the design universe in a swoop doomed to failure.  I advise you to approach this smoothly.  A great way is to start with what is most important for software (its functions), ending with what makes it convenient to use (its appearance).  Information on this topic can be found in the article <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/26/designing-for-a-hierarchy-of-needs/">‚ÄúDesigning For A Hierarchy Of Needs‚Äù</a> .  I decided to change the order, adapting for our case (if you looked at the diagram by reference, the list below starts at the bottom and moves up): <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de7/f7c/9c8/de7f7c9c8763241a7632f73e678f96fe.png"></div><br>  The steps are from rational to emotional.  Studying design in this order is optimal for two reasons.  First, each step depends on the previous one - for example, the study of visual design without an understanding of the interaction design will lead to bad consequences.  Secondly, transitions will gradually move you from purely logical (quantitative thinking) to better (aesthetic thinking). <br><br>  You are probably already familiar with reliability and design for performance.  However, it is important to understand how design can influence them.  Design (for organization) refers to the information architecture and the importance of the content.  Ordering and structuring are associated with the traditional design of the interface, which is traditionally presented through wireframes.  User interaction (design for interaction) defines the details of how a person will use the software (moving from a static interface to an interactive interaction experience).  Aesthetics (design for aesthetics) is a visual and motion design.  It is easy to find materials for studying each step; in the article I want to explain precisely the sequence in learning. <br>  There is another step that is not included in the pyramid, and it is perhaps the most important.  You need to learn how to use all these skills at the same time.  The ultimate goal is to perceive all aspects of the design, not as separate stages, but as variables in a complex equation that are taken into account throughout the process.  While the hierarchy of steps is needed for mastering, then a set of all skills is needed for solving problems. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 3: Use design for everything. </h5><br>  During my internship after college, <a href="http://www.tree-axis.com/stella/">Stella Lai</a> gave me this advice, and it was the best professional advice I have ever received.  Try using it literally.  Obvious areas are how you look and how your house, apartment or room is organized.  I would suggest not to dwell on this.  Your letters should be written and composed beautifully and clearly.  Your dialogues should be based on how you listen, how you maintain eye contact, how you react (verbally and non-verbally).  Everything you do should have a reason, regardless of the cause.  Design requires constant practice and is a great way to keep growing. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 4: Think about users </h5><br>  The work that you do with the soul is likely to be better than the one you don't care about.  So what to do in the case when you just can not force yourself?  Think of the users for whom you work, instead of concentrating on the product itself. <br>  By taking care of the users of your product (website, program, etc.), you automatically improve its design.  In the opposite direction it does not always work.  The more you empathize with your users, the better the results. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 5: Learn from your guru </h5><br>  Reading is great, but I learned a lot more from communicating with experienced, knowledgeable and trustworthy people.  If you find yourself in this situation, ask questions and listen.  I want to emphasize the importance of listening.  In the short term, it is important to absorb as much good information as possible.  While you are learning, drop your preconceptions and give impetus to your thinking.  In the long run, this is important because it is a vital skill in your work. The best designers I know are excellent listeners.  You will constantly have to listen to colleagues, clients, etc.  So be good at it. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 6: Learn to write and speak </h5><br>  At the beginning of your practice, it will be important to absorb ideas that will help shape your own philosophy and approaches.  However, at some point (better sooner) it will be important to formulate your point of view for those around you.  Thoughts that spin only in your head can make you biased, irrational, or even erroneous.  Sharing your thoughts with other people, opening yourself to criticism, you will improve your thinking.  Writing is also important for the designer.  I learned a lot from my blog.  I would like to offer blogging as a first step to sharing ideas. <br><br>  In the long run, I suggest you try to speak to an audience at least once.  Some love it, some hate it.  I spoke 5 times or so, and despite all the excitement, I see this experience as a reward.  The skills necessary for a successful performance (for example, the ability to talk, brevity, work with the audience, etc.) will help you in your daily work, especially when dealing with clients.  Sometimes the correct presentation of the work is no less important than the design itself. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 7: Identify and solve problems </h5><br>  Many projects that you see in the portfolio of other designers are only good examples of visual design (embellishment), but no more.  There are countless people who represent their work in this way, and the skill has become widespread.  Avoid pixel problems, your task is to solve problems.  Look at your work through this prism.  Determine what problems you are trying to solve in the process of creating a design (for example, users do not understand where to click further in a specific sequence of steps, or the current visual design does not match the brand's mood).  Good designers solve problems, the best - make sure that they solve the right ones.  The exact definition of a problem is half the battle to solve it. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 8: Trust your intuition, but check </h5><br>  Trends are changing, but elegant and rational products will never go out of style.  It is good to listen to your instincts, but you should always, first of all, understand why you are doing something.  ‚ÄúBecause that's right‚Äù is a good way to start a conversation, not to finish. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 9: Be Self-Critical </h5><br>  You will never be perfect, but this is no reason not to try to be.  There is always something that can be improved.  Your work and experience can and should progress.  When it becomes difficult - push, but do not hide your head in the sand. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 10: Imitate time-tested solutions </h5><br>  Few things prove good design than how long it remains in demand. Look at time-tested solutions to improve your approach.  It does not have to be software, the process of creating a good chair is not much different from creating good software.  Look at how the predecessors solved similar problems, and try to understand why they did so and not otherwise.  Blindly echoing design trends, in a couple of years you can put together an excellent portfolio. <br>  Focus on operating systems - this is the most time-tested and finely adjusted piece of software.  Explore the nuances, understand the design patterns and know them like the back of your hand.  When to use dropdown, and when radio buttons?  Why?  It is important to know the explanations for most of these design patterns. <br><br><h5>  Tip # 11: Imagine not forgetting implementation </h5><br>  Our ideas should be ambitious, but the execution should not be left behind.  This will allow us to see the prospects of the product, while ensuring that it can exist.  Both are important, but can harm because of a lack of balance; consistency is important here. <br><br>  The world of design is changing rapidly.  Designers who can work with code become designers.  Your transition will not happen overnight, and many of your ideas will have to change.  However, you will be surprised that much you already understand.  A big part in your becoming a designer is the realization that you already know how to creatively solve problems as a developer, and much of your thinking is universal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215441/</a></p>
