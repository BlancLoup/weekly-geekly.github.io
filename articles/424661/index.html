These small and fast moving guests have not yet been detected with existing technology;  today there is only one confirmed discovery of a mini-satellite.  The commissioning of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Synoptic_Survey_Telescope">large LSST telescope</a> will help confirm their existence and track their movements around our planet, which will give us amazing scientific and commercial opportunities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúMini-satellites can be interesting laboratories for testing scientific knowledge and technology in near space.  These asteroids reach Earth from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter due to gravitational interaction with the Sun and the planets of the solar system, says Robert Jedik, lead author from the University of Hawaii at Honolulu.  ‚ÄúThe problem is finding these small objects ‚Äî it's difficult even despite their proximity to us.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt present, we do not fully understand the composition of the asteroids,‚Äù adds Mikael Granvik, a co-author of the work, working at the Luleovsky Institute of Technology in Sweden and at the University of Helsinki in Finland.  ‚ÄúMissions usually bring a tiny amount of material back to Earth.  Meteorites make it possible to indirectly study asteroids, but the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere destroys weak materials as they fall. ‚Äù

      ‚ÄúMini-satellites are an ideal target that will allow you to bring with you quite large pieces of asteroid material, protected by a spacecraft, so that they can be carefully studied on Earth later.‚Äù <br><br>  It is believed that mini-satellites are from 1 to 2 meters in diameter, and are temporarily gravitationally tied to the Earth-Moon system.  They can fly past the Earth or make one turn around it, and eventually run away from the gravitational pull of our planet, or enter the atmosphere. <br><br>  Having studied the results of mini-satellite research over the past ten years, Djedik and his colleagues show that the existing technologies are able to detect these small and fast moving objects only by chance. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMini satellites are small, and their speed across the sky exceeds the ability to detect most asteroid surveys,‚Äù explains Djedik.  ‚ÄúSo far, we have only found one mini-satellite in orbit around the Earth, this is a relatively large <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_RH120">2006 RH120</a> object <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_RH120">with a</a> diameter of only a few meters.‚Äù <br><br>  LSST, which is being built, should be commissioned in the next few years.  It is hoped that he will be able to confirm the existence of mini-satellites and help track their orbits around the Earth.  In this paper, which is part of a collection of articles describing the vicinity of the Earth-Moon system, the possibilities that will appear due to the detection of mini-satellites are emphasized. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLSST is a dream tool for detecting small and fast-moving asteroids, and we hope that it will continuously detect temporarily captured objects on an ongoing basis and will begin work in the next five years,‚Äù says Djedik.  ‚ÄúHe will have a giant mirror collecting light from dim objects, and a camera with a huge field of view capable of covering the entire sky at least once a week.‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúAs soon as we start finding mini-satellites more often, they will be ideal targets for satellite missions.  We will be able to run short, low-cost missions, and use them as landfills for larger space missions, and enable the nascent asteroid mining industry to test their technologies. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what small asteroids will turn out to be - monolithic blocks of stone, fragile heaps of sand, or something in between,‚Äù says Granvik.  ‚ÄúMini-satellites that linger long enough in orbit around the Earth allow us to study the density of these bodies and the forces acting inside them, which will allow us to solve this mystery.‚Äù <br><br>  Djedik summarizes what he said, sharing his expectations: "I hope that someday people will go to the solar system to study planets, asteroids and comets, and I consider mini-satellites as the first steps of this journey." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424661/</a></p>
