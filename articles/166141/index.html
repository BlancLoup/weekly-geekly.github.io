And indeed, about a week ago, five bus shelters with electronic interactive panels appeared on Tverskaya Street.  I will try to share with you basic information and first impressions of the authorities' attempt to breathe new life into the transport system of Moscow. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Foreword </h2><br>  As the first deputy head of the Department of Transport and Road Infrastructure Development in Moscow, Yevgeny Mikhailov, said: <br><blockquote>  Now passengers of buses, trolley buses and trams have a minimum of information, and then mostly in printed form - in the form of schedules, traffic patterns of different routes and a list of stops.  It is updated by the relevant services of the city manually.  New stopping modules are equipped with touch screens and interactive electronic panels and have a wide technological functionality.  With it, you can learn not only about the timetable and routes of vehicles, but also where the bus you need is at the moment and when it is expected to arrive, whether it will meet traffic jams on its way.  An interactive map with a navigator will help the passenger to choose the shortest route to the desired point of the city.  And the video surveillance and the presence of a ‚Äúpanic button‚Äù will help even in the late evening to feel safe at such a stop.  Here you can also use wireless Internet access, recharge your mobile phone, get acquainted with all the city news. </blockquote>

      According to him, the installation of two types of pavilions was planned in Moscow.  Within the Garden Ring, central highways and embankments of the city it was planned to place multifunctional complexes with the possibility of placing interactive information and advertising.  In the metropolitan residential areas, on avenues and highways beyond the borders of the Third Ring Road, there are stops with an electronic block of route information and an advertising "running line". <br><br>  "The promised - three years waiting"?  No, contrary to the saying, I had to wait only 4 months, and on January 10, the townspeople saw 5 new stops on Tverskaya. <br><br><h2>  basic information </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e8/e6d/9cb/0e8e6d9cb00c40b517dacc7296a5c3f2.jpg"><br><br>  Emerging stops are equipped with modern lighting, the pavilion is well protected from wind and rain.  On a large touch panel, videos are broadcast telling about Moscow‚Äôs intelligent transport system.  At the bottom of the screen is the menu, which indicates the time remaining until the arrival of transport, and the order of buses and trolley buses.  However, as the bright red inscription on the panel says, ‚Äúthe arrival time is a test one‚Äù and it is not recommended to focus on it. <br><br>  As you already understood, many of the promised functions of smart stops are not yet available, including the main one - the ability to track the movement of public transport and find out the expected arrival time.  However, today almost all the rolling stock of Mosgortrans is already equipped with GLONASS equipment, which means that the realization of this possibility is also not far off.  In fact, the problem is really close to the solution, since the system is being established to collect information from sensors mounted on the road and traffic data, and then the program calculates using a special formula when a particular bus reaches the bus stop.  But today, at smart stops, you can view the routes of traffic, find out which cafes, banks and metro stations are nearby, as well as find out the telephone numbers of rescue services.  In the future, it is planned to realize the possibility of direct calling on the phones of rescue services.  All information is still available only in Russian, but in the future it will be translated into foreign languages, which is also a disadvantage due to the desire of the authorities to arrange conditions for tourists to visit the capital. <br><br><h4>  Usability? </h4><br><blockquote>  In the course of the experiment, it is important for us to check how this technique works in winter conditions, when splashes of reagents or snowballs fly from it. </blockquote><br>  - Elena Novikova, a spokesman for the capital's information technology department, said. <br><br>  Judging by the articles on this topic, the equipment does not work very well in winter conditions: the screen is often covered with a layer of ice, and it will not work if you touch it with a gloved hand, that is, there may be problems with operation during the winter period.  From vandals stop also protected to a small extent. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Whether these stopping complexes will appear on other streets of the city will be decided on the basis of the ‚Äúexperiment on Tverskaya‚Äù, which will be held until the end of January. <br><br>  I believe that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping ITS (Intellectual Transport System) is the most promising sector for investment, especially for Moscow, with its transport situation.  The fact that a start has already been made is a big plus, although this development is still quite raw (recharge the mobile phone, but look at the necessary addresses, banks, cafes on the map).  Well, a few numbers.  GLONASS for Mosgortrans cost the state-vu 700 thousand rubles, 5 station complexes in 17 million, and according to the Federal State Statistics Service Moscow plans to spend 210 million on the development of ITS until the end of 2021. <br><br>  Sources: <br>  <a href="http://www.rg.ru/">Russian newspaper</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.m24.ru/">Moscow 24</a> <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I will be glad to accept all comments and corrections on the text in personal messages. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <i>(Experience of ITS development in Tambov and Orel)</i> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLKBZ_gw8O0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQgzsgSGeiOU-EmCDaywVt_dQeSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsBuqw56zp8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgpzBu4Hypdk9wP9H_Oyfwl7FbxXQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> <i>(From Habrayuzer)</i> <br>  <a href="http://minsk-guide.org/">Minsk Guide</a> (Minsk Transport Schedule, <b>Android Client</b> ) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yuraminsk/" class="user_link">yuraminsk</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.bus64.ru/">bus64</a> (Routes and stops in Saratov) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/rubyfox/" class="user_link">RubyFOX</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.cdsvyatka.com/site/pages/map/">CDS Kirov</a> (Service for displaying the movement of transport online in Kirov) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/yosemity/" class="user_link">yosemity</a> <br>  <a href="http://maps.nskgortrans.ru/">nskgortrans</a> (Routes and stops of public transport <i>+ minibuses</i> in Novosibirsk) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lord_d/" class="user_link">Lord_D</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.traffic22.ru/">traffic22</a> (Routes and stops of public transport in Barnaul, analog bus64) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fwhisper/" class="user_link">FWhisper</a> <br>  <a href="http://bus47.ru/">bus47</a> and the <a href="http://transport.orgp.spb.ru/Portal/transport/main%3Bjsessionid%3D2DB6365728E22AB2CB03EA05855D5AC2">St. Petersburg Public Transport Portal</a> ( <i>1.</i> Routes and stops of public transport in St. Petersburg and its area, analogous to bus64; <i>2.</i> Laying routes by any public transport, including tracking buses equipped for disabled people, searching for stops and streets.) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/foxnet/" class="user_link">foxnet</a> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.bus55">My route - Omsk</a> (Mobile version of the famous Omsk system My route.
