    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today, one of the most interesting offers for those who are going to update their laptop - ASUS Zenbook UX32A-DB31.  Moreover, it is interesting even for users who are not yet ready to buy via the Internet, and with huge markups order all their new clothes in the nearest electronics stores.  See for yourself: Zenbook is only 1mm thicker and 50gr heavier than the famous Macbook Air - the recognized standard of ergonomics and style - and it costs only 27,000 rubles in Russia, while Apple's gadget is cheaper than 41k from us. <br><br>  It seems that everything is very good and interesting, but there is a better option - much better!  On Amazon, this same Zenbook <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00863L2MI/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26creative%3D390957%26creativeASIN%3DB00863L2MI%26linkCode%3Das2%26tag%3Dqwintrycom-20">can be bought for $ 523</a> .  Exactly 10 thousand rubles cheaper than in Russia. <br><br><h4>  How good is Asus's Zenbook? </h4><br>  First of all - great appearance and ergonomics.  It is convenient and pleasant to use the ultrabook, since the device looks very interesting and feels the same way in the hands.  Engineers of the company decided not to subtilize much and left the Zenbuku Prime aluminum case and slightly improved the lid, which now opens much more smoothly and gently. <br><br>  The dimensions of the laptop are also important: <br>  Length: 325mm <br>  Width: 223mm <br>  Thickness: 18mm <br><br>  Moreover, 18mm is the thickest part of Zenbuk, which gradually decreases, and at the end reaches 5.5mm, which is almost two times thinner than today's average smartphone. <br><br>  Another advantage of Asus Zenbook is the optimal display size - 13.3 inches, as well as the well-chosen resolution of 1366x768.  Compared to Prime, which had a full 1080p, it was apparently reduced, but for such a screen the resolution of 1366x768 is more than enough, and the battery began to live longer. <br><br>  What else brings to the daily, or rather, nightly experience of using Zenbuk, pleasant notes is the soft backlighting of the keyboard, which is rarely supplied by mid-budget models.  And here it is, and this, as they say, sets the style for the whole computer. <br><br>  However, Zenbuk has several drawbacks. <br><br>  First of all, for $ 522 you buy a Zenbook with a built-in Intel HD Graphics 3000 card, and the Russian model for 27 thousand comes with an Intel HD Graphics 4000. However, it‚Äôs almost impossible to notice the difference in everyday work, and playing video coding or playing some Powerful and demanding games on such an ultrabook are a dubious pleasure, to say the least. <br><br>  Also, the buyer should keep two things in mind: <br><br>  Upon arrival, the ultrabook for him will have to buy a power cable - 150-200r <br>  If you are not able to print blindly, it is better not to even think about stickers and order a regular laser engraving, which today costs $ 20-30. <br><br><h4>  Purchase and delivery </h4><br>  As mentioned above, it is best to buy Asus Zenbook on Amazon because of pretty tasty discounts on it.  However, we are not alone so clever, so ultrabooks are pretty quickly dismantled - if you click on the link you see the message ‚ÄúOut of Stock‚Äù, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00863L2MI/sr%3D/qid%3D/%3Fie%3DUTF8%26camp%3D1789%26colid%3D%26coliid%3D%26condition%3Dnew%26creative%3D390957%26linkCode%3Dur2%26me%3D%26qid%3D%26seller%3D%26shipPromoFilter%3D%26sort%3Dsip%26sr%3D%26tag%3Dqwintrycom-20">click here</a> and go to the full list of sellers who have this laptop in warehouses.  Choose carefully - someone may have free delivery, but the overpriced price of the device itself, someone this delivery will cost big money, and someone may have a too low rating. <br><br>  Perfect option: <br>  Seller with more than 50 sales <br>  Delivery within 10 $ <br>  Price up to $ 525 <br><br>  Now let's calculate how much a Zenbook will cost us with all the costs and additional purchases. <br><br>  The calculation will be made on the example of a <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/phones">parcel post</a> - a service for purchases in the USA. <br><br>  So, Ultrabook + delivery to the warehouse in the USA + shipping by the CPCR Express to Russia + insurance + laser engraving of the Cyrillic alphabet on the keyboard + new power cable: <br><br>  522 + 8 + 80 + 18 + 20 + 5 = <b>$ 653</b> or <b>21000r.</b> <br><br>  On average, Zenbuk will reach the warehouse of the parcel in 5 days, and it will take you about 10-14 to reach your house.  Most importantly, the delivery of the SPRS completely excludes any contact with the Post of Russia, so you can not be afraid of theft and vandalism. <br><br>  Thus, the net savings at the maximum range of services will be released on 6000 rubles.  If you refuse to insure and engrave, you can save another $ 40 or 1300r. <br><br>  Total we save 7300r. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187348/</a></p>
