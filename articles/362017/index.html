  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What we should set up a house: "smart home" under the control of Lumia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Most recently, the smart home was an expensive, complex mechanism: a closed system that could only be installed by trained specialists.  The control was rather primitive: the components of the system were not interconnected in any way, they were controlled from one console separately.  It should be added that the cost of such systems was such that only fairly well-off people could afford them.  Naturally, everything changes, and now the key to the smart home is becoming an ordinary smartphone, for example Lumia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e53/fda/d63/e53fdad630b94a44a3354751a86a311b.png"><br><br>  With the help of <a href="http://www.insteon.com/">Insteon</a> equipment and Cortana assistant it became possible to control the house by voice: turn the light on and off, adjust its brightness, control the temperature, humidity, open and close the blinds.  It is enough just to say ‚ÄúCortana, it's cold in the room‚Äù, the voice assistant will offer to make it warmer.  It is getting dark outside the window: "Cortana, turn on the light and blind the curtains." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to make this possible, Insteon, together with Microsoft, developed a special <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/insteon-for-hub/eecfed66-32df-4ebc-8be2-8b9fea0a538a">Insteon for Hub</a> application for managing the system through Windows Phone.  Management can be carried out through integration with voice assistant, and using a standard interface.  Unlike other platforms, the owners of WP8 smartphones were able to control various functions (lights, heating, cameras) through the ‚Äútiles‚Äù on the start screen.  In the same application, there is a ‚ÄúGuest‚Äù mode, when access to certain functions of the home system is restricted to unauthorized persons or children.  Equipment can be purchased separately, at about $ 4,000 per gadget, or as a set from $ 12,000.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e72/a02/353/e72a023539244e448c4f461759690ebf.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike previous generations of smart home systems, Insteon supports Mesh network topology, along the ‚Äúwired‚Äù and ‚Äúwireless‚Äù part of the system at the same time.  That is, each gadget simultaneously receives and transmits a signal.  Having received a signal on any of the channels, the device duplicates the received data, sending it to all devices installed at home.  Different network elements located at different ends of the dwelling interact with each other as follows: a motion sensor responds at night to your movement at night, transmits a signal to a light sensor, the light turns on in the direction of your route and turns off when you have passed.  The probability that the signal from the device is lost is extremely small, because the signal, again, is distributed through two channels simultaneously: via wired and wireless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2f/da1/736/c2fda17365cb43fab9902e4405c9a605.jpg"><br><br>  The heart of the system - INSTEON hub, which is externally a small white box with an LED indicator and a LAN port, is an intermediary between all components of the home system and a smartphone, its software is adapted to the Windows Phone 8.1 operating system. <br><br>  Dimmers connected to the central ‚Äúhub‚Äù are responsible for the remote control of the light: on, off, brightness and timer.  With Lumia, you can set the time to turn on the lamp and the light level when the light is turned on, so you can get a great alarm clock.  Offered also LampLinc Dimmer is designed to connect to any wall outlet and can control incandescent lamps up to 300 watts. <br><br>  Speaking of light bulbs.  In the arsenal of INSTEON there are Insteon LED Bulb LED bulbs.  The advantage of the 8W bulb is that you can control it from your smartphone directly, without any plug-in modules and cable connections.  Each individual light bulb can be controlled remotely manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd1/a6f/d0d/fd1a6fd0d6f342b38e801ab74e0f5a75.png"><br><br>  But you can make the light turn on automatically when a person enters the room.  To do this, simply install the Insteon Motion Sensor motion sensor.  No more thinking and wondering whether the lights are turned off in the apartment or not. <br><br>  And if the motion sensor worked, when the owner is not at home?  This is where INSTEON Wireless Security IP Camera comes in, the cameras whose images will be sent directly to Lumia via the built-in Wi Fi module.  Cameras are distinguished by panning (300 ¬∞) and tilt (120 ¬∞), as well as night vision (infrared LEDs work up to 26 feet).  When motion is detected, the sensor sends notifications directly to Lumia, and the two-way built-in microphone and speaker will add the ability to not only see but also hear what is happening at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/630/7a5/ff8/6307a5ff8d5f4c909cfb9174c061622d.png"><br><br>  Another useful gadget in everyday life is a thermostat that measures not only temperature, but also humidity.  It can control heating and cooling, fans, give commands to other devices.  With it, you can use additional wireless thermostats as a pair, which will control the devices and control the temperature in other rooms.  Magnetic sensors on doors and windows are also available, which allow you to set a command to automatically turn on the light with Lumia after the blinds are closed and vice versa.  Or, for example, when closing the door. <br><br>  On cold winter nights, you can set the temperature to automatically increase through the thermostat.  As you can see, there are many possibilities, the smart home has become more accessible and the key to it may already be in your pocket if you are the owner of Lumia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da6/f03/39f/da6f0339f5154248863afd1d97927820.jpg"><br><br>  Are there alternatives?  It should be noted also the company <a href="https://nest.com/">Nest</a> , won recognition for its stylish thermostat, which can be programmed for air conditioning and heat, as a similar device Insteon.  Tracking the movement in the room, Nest independently adjusts the climate.  Thermostat remembers which temperature you prefer.  You can control Nest's smart thermostat with Lumia through the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/roost/dae7ec0c-e20e-45b8-903f-bbca580a7f84">Roost</a> app.  There is also a project of the Thai developer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nuuneoi">Sittiphol Phanvilai</a> - ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù, managed with the help of Nokia Lumia 920 through speech recognition through the Windows Phone 8 API, available to all third-party developers.  NFC is involved in this project to identify the owner of the house, and Bluetooth to exchange data between the phone and the "house". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/2c8/d8f/4702c8d8fa274baca051a7687681dee1.jpg"><br><br>  High technology has already entered everyday life.  Soon, waking up in the morning from the soft light of a lamp that turned on at seven in the morning and having drunk freshly brewed coffee to wake up, you will be able to look at the newly printed images from space taken with Lumia.  And then watch from the subway car, on the way to work, moving the cat through the apartment through the Insteon Camera, driving him from corner to corner, then turning on and then turning off the desk lamp light. <br><br>  <b>And we write in: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/MicrosoftLumia">Habrahabr</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://twitter.com/LumiaRussia">Twitter</a> |</b>  <b><a href="http://vk.com/MicrosoftLumia">VKontakte</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MicrosoftLumiaRU">Facebook</a> |</b>  <b><a href="https://plus.google.com/112598323683416588312">Google+</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362017/</a></p>
