Some children's psychologists say that the fascination with gadgets among children of different ages is a new reality, so categorically prohibiting or hiding is not the best solution.  It is better to adopt other devices and show how much interesting things can be done outside the home. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/mvideo/blog/286828/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eeb/7c1/328/eeb7c13281c5ff9d55f6d8858d4ba869.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Our children with incredible speed master everything new and high-tech, realizing the craving for knowledge and new discoveries.  On the one hand, this is good, but when the whole range of interests comes down to the tablet and game console, many parents begin to sound the alarm.  Evil technologies have locked the child at home, and he communicates with friends only through instant messengers!  But in our childhood everything was the opposite, and parents spent hours searching for a child on the street. <br><br>  But they are not to blame, and modern electronics manufacturers all the more.  Children slide to the forefront of progress, and their parents' hobbies of yesterday do not attract them anymore.  But this does not mean that you can not find a compromise between gadgets, exploring the world and active entertainment with friends or family on the street.  So we made a selection of ideas how to distract a child from cartoons and games.  Well, the main advice of all child psychologists: do not forget to study and test these devices with your child, because the time spent together is even more valuable than the gift itself.

    <h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Quadcopters</font> </h2><br>  Having played enough in computer games, the child has already gained management skills with the help of joysticks.  Great, now is the time to uncover these skills in the real world and learn how to control technology.  And this is not as easy as it seems.  It will not work in a couple of clicks to start the mission anew, so mastering the copter will help develop perseverance and patience, and you will have to become an example to follow and stop despair in case of failure.  So that the learning process does not become too tedious, you can come up with goals that are interesting for the child - for example, learn how to land the rotor in a specific location. <br><br>  Buying the most sophisticated model is not worth it, because the main goal is a training one, and you shouldn't blame it for breakdowns either.  But to teach the repair technique can and should be - this experience will be useful in adult life. <br><br>  This, of course, is not the club of a young aircraft designer, but much better than staying in the summer in the walls of a house. <br><br><h3>  Pilotage skycap </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae0/7b2/391/ae07b239149545e9e72ca9f6ca705f71.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Control method <br></td><td>  remote controller <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Communication interface <br></td><td>  radio <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Power and charging <br></td><td>  Li-Pol 450 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally <br></td><td>  720p video camera <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  55 grams <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemyi-kvadrokopter-pilotage-skycap-micro-s-kameroi-rtf-oranzhevyi-rc18167-40065264">Pilotage skycap</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Extremely compact palm-sized copter model, which is perfect for exploring this type of technology.  You can even try it in the room, adjusting to the control of two joysticks on the remote, and already on the street to check the possibility of video shooting with a built-in camera.  At the same time there is a computer application for mounting rollers. <br><br><h3>  Parrot Airborne Cargo Drone Mars </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e9/be4/020/2e9be4020b98d32c2634d20b850c50bc.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Control method <br></td><td>  Android / iOS smartphone <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Communication interface <br></td><td>  Bluetooth <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Power and charging <br></td><td>  550 mAh from USB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally <br></td><td>  15 fps VGA camera <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  63 grams <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemyi-kvadrokopter-parrot-airborne-cargo-drone-mars-40064052">Parrot Airborne Cargo Drone Mars</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Despite the abundance of professional camera models of copters in the Parrot line, this manufacturer has a model for beginners.  The lightweight and maneuverable Cargo Drone Mars is made of practical flexible materials and is equipped with the usual microUSB for charging, and instead of the control panel, a child‚Äôs smartphone or tablet is useful here.  In addition, it can carry small loads. <br><br>  As a result, we get not just a copter, but a high-tech Bluetooth device from a famous brand that will make a child achieve success in flying. <br><br><h3>  Mixberry MHD-020BK </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1e6/d3e/5b0/1e6d3e5b0d2992a257b42da870de0ae8.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Control method <br></td><td>  Android / iOS smartphone <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Communication interface <br></td><td>  Wi-Fi <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Power and charging <br></td><td>  Li-Pol 750 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally <br></td><td>  720p 30 fps camera <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions and weight <br></td><td>  80x310x315 mm, 148 grams <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemyi-kvadrokopter-mixberry-mhd-020bk-40064786/">Mixberry MHD-020BK</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  But what if you combine a camera for video shooting and control from a smartphone in one copter?  Easy and agile Mixberry is ideal for young pilots who are ready to reach the top of the panoramic shooting and learn the subtleties of control.  The application for smartphones and tablets allows you to choose the level of pilot training, removable batteries can be purchased for future use and charged via USB adapter.  There are no problems with spare parts (after all, anything can happen to quadrocopters).  An important feature is the recording of video in HD-resolution on a memory card, plus connecting to a smartphone via Wi-Fi, which allows you to release the copter tens of meters away. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Radio controlled models</font> </h2><br>  Radio control flying technology is a great option that develops reaction and perseverance, but it can only be controlled in calm weather.  When the weather is not flying, land modes of transport are ready to enter.  Here it is important not to leave the child alone with the toy and actively participate in the process: suggest a route, choose a detour path and push for creative thinking. <br><br><h3>  Pilotage Monster ONE RTR 4WD </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/294/e22/c0c/294e22c0c5c4cf9c5df4fd9359fd3706.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Control method <br></td><td>  Remote controller <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition <br></td><td>  4xAA (remote), corporate Li-Ion <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally <br></td><td>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup to 45 km / h <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions and weight <br></td><td>  20x32x39.6 cm, 1350g <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemaya-mashina-pilotage-avtomodel-monster-one-rtr-4wd-1-10-rc16588-40062848">Pilotage Monster ONE RTR 4WD</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Radio-controlled ring cars are good in the summer on a special court covering, but we live in a country where a warm sunny day is more the exception.  Optimal to take an SUV, ready to conquer potholes and lawn, if not snow tracks.  Large-format Monster ONE is equipped with an active independent suspension and differentials on both axles, which will allow you to climb steep hills and overcome loose sand.  A child takes a new look at walks in the park and rest with his grandmother outside the city. <br><br><h3>  Pilotage RC47810 and RC47808 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/926/178/5a7/9261785a7855d1f7ae816645acedff20.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c78/689/09a/c7868909a94fe9c3e9baca668b50c984.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Control method <br></td><td>  remote controller <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition <br></td><td>  2xAA (remote) built in from USB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally <br></td><td>  Light effects, metal bucket and board <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Dimensions and weight <br></td><td>  17x26x44 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of products on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemaya-mashina-pilotage-rc47810-40065314">Pilotage RC47810</a> and <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/radioupravlyaemaya-mashina-pilotage-6ch-rc47808-40065312">Pilotage RC47808</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Among the toys on the radio control, there are also advanced working models that develop a creative approach for the child to choose the environment.  By adopting a mining truck and a radio-controlled excavator, you can turn an ordinary walk into a well-coordinated teamwork.  Filling every time new volumes of sand from the sandbox, the desire to build virtual houses of cubes will quickly dissolve. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Giro scooters</font> </h2><br>  Even an ordinary walk can be turned into a fascinating activity, ready to give a lot of joy to the child.  Walking in the park is boring, tired of scooter, but if you walk to the park, where the child is waiting for a ride on a hoverboard.  How do you like that?  This technique is popular with modern youth.  It is difficult to call this type of recreation active, and a ride on a hoverboard doesn‚Äôt exactly replace a sports section for a child, but it will help to diversify leisure.  By the way, a hoverboard develops the skills of body coordination in space, which is also not bad. <br><br><h3>  iconBIT Smart Scooter Kit Black </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ae/799/920/2ae799920c8570d415bb840970b4df84.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Wheel diameter <br></td><td>  16.5 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Allowable weight <br></td><td>  20-110 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum speed and distance <br></td><td>  15 km / h, up to 20 km <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery <br></td><td>  4400 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight: <br></td><td>  10.5 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/giroskuter-6-5-duimov-iconbit-smart-scooter-kit-black-sd-0012k-50045815"><b>iconBIT Smart Scooter Kit Black</b></a> <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/giroskuter-6-5-duimov-iconbit-smart-scooter-kit-black-sd-0012k-50045815"><br></a> </td></tr></tbody></table>  The base model with 6.5-inch wheels is designed to move on asphalt and other flat surfaces.  The scooter is ready to reach speeds of up to 10 km / h and it works for more than three hours on a single charge.  An interesting help for skateboarding and cycling, which develops the skills of body coordination in a child, and at the same time does not tolerate household gatherings at the TV. <br><br><h3>  iconBIT Smart Scooter 10 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/421/ce0/b39/421ce0b39f22aa8fa1ecea2afb4121ca.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Wheel diameter <br></td><td>  25.4 cm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Allowable weight <br></td><td>  20-110 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum speed and distance <br></td><td>  15 km / h to 20 km <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Battery <br></td><td>  4400 mAh <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  12 kg <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/giroskuter-10-duimov-iconbit-smart-scooter-10-white-sd-0004w-50046404">iconBIT Smart Scooter 10</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  In order not to be limited to movement on asphalt, it makes sense to consider the option of buying a hoverboard with ten-inch wheels, providing better throughput and an angle of entry up to 15 degrees.  In addition to the size of the wheels here and more weight, equal to 12 kilograms, which should be taken into account before the grand summer vacation plans with the child.  Most likely, you will have to wear the equipment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Telescopes</font> </h2><br>  Nothing motivates the study of the new, as the awareness of the scale of the world around us and the amount of the unknown.  For any child, the starry sky is an absolutely mysterious space.  Why not try to study it together?  With the help of an ordinary amateur telescope, you can see quite a lot for a novice astronomer.  The main thing is that the weather did not let down, and the sky was clear.  Consider the craters and contours of the "seas" on the moon, count the Pleiads, see the satellites of Jupiter and the Ring of Saturn.  With a telescope, you can see the grandiose Andromeda alive and look at the dense cluster of stars in the sleeve of our native galaxy.  Do not forget to supplement this with a Hubble gallery of pictures, and as soon as the child sees Venus, show photos from its surface made by Soviet aircraft. <br><br>  The main characteristic of the telescope is the maximum magnification value.  In addition to it, when choosing a model, it is worth paying attention to the limiting magnitude.  It shows the level of luminance of objects available for observation.  The higher this value, the duller the stars and planets can be studied through the optics of the apparatus. <br><br><h3>  Synta Protostar 50 AZ </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/61e/a07/e77/61ea07e77c34842264a01f9302340045.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Type of <br></td><td>  refractor <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Relative hole <br></td><td>  1:15 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Magnitude <br></td><td>  11.1 m <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum magnification <br></td><td>  450x <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/teleskop-synta-protostar-50-az-10008177">Synta Protostar 50 AZ</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  To start exploring the night sky, it is not at all necessary to mortgage real estate and purchase professional equipment.  You can start with an accessible refractor telescope with a relative aperture of 1:15 and a magnitude of 11.1 m, which is enough for viewing Jupiter's bands with three main satellites, as well as other comparable objects.  Depending on the goals, you can combine the magnification with three eyepieces and two lenses. <br><br><h3>  Celestron AstroMaster LT 70 AZ </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58a/12c/81a/58a12c81a1f61b1c6d3fe6b7ebea57dc.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Type of <br></td><td>  refractor <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Relative hole <br></td><td>  1:10 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Magnitude <br></td><td>  11.7 m <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum magnification <br></td><td>  165X <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/teleskop-celestron-astromaster-lt-70-az-10009476">Celestron AstroMaster LT 70 AZ</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Among amateur telescopes, another main parameter of choice is the collecting ability of optics, which increases brightness in comparison with studying the sky with the naked eye.  In the AstroMaster LT 70 AZ telescope, the relative aperture value is 1:10, and the star magnitude reaches 11.7 m, which makes it possible to view more than six satellites of Jupiter, the outlined contours of the rings of Saturn, and even the Andromeda core.  What to say about the tens of thousands of stars on a clear night, if you get away from the city.  An impressive sight. <br><br><h3>  Synta NBK130650EQ2 </h3><br><h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/228/fc5/4c2/228fc54c288713e9b4eaed394cb2f821.jpg"></h1><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Type of <br></td><td>  reflector <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Relative hole <br></td><td>  1: 5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Magnitude <br></td><td>  13.1 m <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Maximum magnification <br></td><td>  260x <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td><h1>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/teleskop-synta-nbk130650eq2-10008505">Synta NBK130650EQ2</a> </h1><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  If you are interested in discovering the panorama of the universe yourself, it is better to immediately get a reflex telescope with a mirror.  This design was invented by Newton, and the most famous reflex-type telescope is in orbit of our planet.  From the obvious differences in front of refractors: the relative aperture is 1: 5 and the limiting magnitude 13.1 m, which will allow enchanted to peer into clouds of dust and gas at the sleeve of the Milky Way, count two dozen stars in the galaxies and consider the structure of Mars.  Moreover, there are annually raised bright sandstorms, which can be seen live. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Smart watches and trackers</font> </h2><br>  Go swimming, do jogging to increase stamina and attend sports sections for physical development - seriously?  It is easiest to involve the child in the sport on a personal example - checked.  And so that the incentive is enough for both you and the child, turn the sport into an exciting and high-tech competition.  Physical activity trackers or smart watches with a pedometer can help in this matter.  A child can compete with himself, with average indicators, with friends or parents.  But at the same time it is necessary to agree on measures of encouragement in case of reaching the goal.  I ran 30 km in a week - get a long-awaited CD with a new toy, everything is fair. <br><br><h3>  Jawbone UP MOVE </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3a/1bf/2b6/c3a1bf2b6e54266a5e3557b59f6849d3.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Sensors <br></td><td>  Movement, pedometer <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Compatible with <br></td><td>  Android, iOS <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition <br></td><td>  CR 2032 to 6 months <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  6.8 grams <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/smart-braslet-jawbone-up-move-jl07-bfr-em-50042934">Jawbone UP MOVE</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  To collect a report of the distance traveled and record the results of the swim in the pool?  With this tiny tracker, all information will be synchronized with the mobile application of the smartphone.  The tracker works simply, efficiently and consistently accurately, which is especially important in competitions with peers. <br><h3>  Asus vivo watch </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85d/11b/ade/85d11bade3a29c17c3923b04e8d7ec28.jpg"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Sensors <br></td><td>  Pedometer, movement, heart rate monitor, UV radiation <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Compatible with <br></td><td>  Android, iOS <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition <br></td><td>  123 mAh up to 10 days <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Weight <br></td><td>  50 grams <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Description of goods on the site <br></td><td>  <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/products/smart-chasy-asus-vivo-watch-black-silikonovyi-remeshok-30024290">Asus vivo watch</a> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  If the child deserves encouragement and has long asked for smart and tricky watches on hand, the basic model from Asus will help to combine business with the useful.  Economical stuffing and capacious battery provide up to 10 days of work on one charge, and the full range of smart technologies includes a magnetic charger and heart rate monitor.  A robust, robust enclosure is included, and the abundance of Kood OS capabilities will allow you to collect data on physical activity in applications on smartphones and tablets. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#ec2028">Maybe something else?</font> </h2><br>  Within the framework of one publication, it is impossible to consider all the ideas of developmental gifts for children who can distract them from watching TV and the virtual gaming world.  Nevertheless, the main guarantee of victory over the home imprisonment of the ‚Äúchicks‚Äù is very simple: do not fight it as an enemy.  Connect the fantasy, remember childhood and choose a high-tech theme for interesting leisure.  Show yourself as a good friend and loyal assistant, ready to share many interesting activities in addition to computer games.  This approach will not only discourage the child from an interest in the tablet, but also strengthen family relations.  Be happy, learn new things and inspire others to break away from the sofa on a day off!  And remember that in this case in the first place should be your own example.  Children always focus only on him, and not on theoretical stories about the dangers and benefits, flavored with parental orders <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/d16/199/fa7d16199fca4fee89c0b96fa9919513.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402211/</a></p>
