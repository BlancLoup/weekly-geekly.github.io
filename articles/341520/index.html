Mikhail Boldyrev and Stepan Rogonov prepared an online course ‚ÄúBasics of Inquiry‚Äù, in which system administrators, network engineers, developers and other IT specialists of the company study scenarios for investigating incidents in the field of information security.  The students worked on practical scenarios with the research of the Windows event log, creating an exact copy of the disk, analyzing the digital storage and file system, and researching the technology of presenting information about network interactions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8b/d72/a57/e8bd72a57aa5e6137af5989cf799e4cb.jpg" alt="image">

      Ali Abdulmadzhidov and Oleg Ilyin described for the company‚Äôs personnel 4 typical cases for responding to unwanted software faced by people.  ‚ÄúFor example, we described what an accountant should do if his computer was infected by an advertising banner,‚Äù explains Ali Abdulmadzhidov. <br><br>  A company representative, I &amp; I intern, Pavel Nesterov, said that Kaspersky Lab was satisfied with the work of the students, who showed results that met the requirements of the customer. <br><br><h3>  New data protection: voice instead of password and holding elections using blockchain </h3><br>  Student Emil Melnikov investigated the methods of identifying users by voice for the operating system of the company Biolink.  Using the user's biological and digital identity as a key is one of the features of this operating system.  Also in the framework of the project, Emil developed a prototype, which the company will later use as the basis for the operating system's continuous authentication module. <br><br>  The head of product development at Biolink, Ilya Egorkin, said that he liked the research approach and the independence of an IT university student: ‚ÄúThere was a very difficult moment in work, because of which Emil was stuck and disappeared for several days.  But he dealt with this issue on his own, without asking for help from the company's specialists.  He managed to solve the problem. ‚Äù <br><br>  For Veche.io, Bogdan Vaneev and Konstantin Munichev have developed a system for creating and conducting voting on the blockchain.  Bogdan Vaneev singled out 5 advantages of the developed system: ‚ÄúIt is safe - no one will delete already saved voices;  open - anyone can find out if his vote was taken into account, count the votes on his own and verify the results of the survey;  private - real names / surnames or any other data of the voters cannot be opened, all that is visible is what this or that person voted for;  simple - we mask all the difficulties of working with the blockchain with our application and graphic interface;  Cheap ‚Äî nationwide voting through this application is cheaper than conventional voting methods. ‚Äù <br><br>  Veche.io CEO Alexander Gryaznov noted independence in finding solutions, responsibility and team cohesion.  But, according to the customer, students need to learn how to more strictly follow the schedule, plan work more precisely and roll out a complete product themselves, not modules. <br><br><h3>  Information security for the operating system and cheaper data collection from offices around the world </h3><br>  Three students - Aydar Sabirov, Nadezhda Troflyanina and Anatoly Tykushin - created the project ‚ÄúAdaptation of the life cycle of developing secure software for the Sailfish OS‚Äù for the Open Mobile Platform.  To this end, the team analyzed existing processes in the development of the OS, developed guidelines and checklists for manually checking the source code of the application, developed an automated pipeline for performing static and dynamic analysis of OS components, implemented the developed practices into the workflow. <br><br>  Kirill Chuvilin, the company's developer community manager, praised the team for the excellent implementation of the task, meeting deadlines and the ability to communicate.  He noted that the company wants to work with the university in the framework of industrial projects and beyond. <br><br>  Artyom Bakhtin, Bulat Saifullin and Vasily Podtykhov helped Finca in collecting files from network devices in customer's offices around the world.  ‚ÄúThe IT infrastructure of the company has been widely separated, and in order to improve its work, we have identified the shortcomings of the IT solutions and the business process,‚Äù explains Artyom Bakhtin.  Students developed a business process to add new journals with files and reduced the cost of collecting information twice.  To do this, they automated configuration management on instances of the Splunk Enterprise system, which the company uses to collect data. <br><br>  Rustam Abdullin, a cybersecurity analyst at the company, did not single out the minuses in the work of the IT university team.  The customer liked how students identified and assessed risks and took appropriate measures, he evaluated the skills of young specialists, their ability to plan time and set priorities. <br><br><h3>  Digital assistants in processing large amounts of information </h3><br>  Oleg Ignatov, Evgenia Lyashenko, Rustam Gafarov and Kamil Ahiyarov did the project for the German company OWN.  For their product ‚Äî online boards for collaboration and distributed teams ‚Äî students built a platform with which people can create and add digital assistants.  These assistants process large amounts of information, for which an ordinary person takes a lot of time.  In addition, students created two more agents: News Agent - adds news on a topic of interest to the board, Intellectual Property Agent - analyzes companies' intellectual property (patents). <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine how much time a person will spend on processing 250 patents, and our agent spends less than a minute getting data and processing them with plotting graphs,‚Äù comments Oleg Ignatov. <br><br>  According to Sebastian Denef, CEO of OWN GmbH, he did not anticipate how much work the team had to do.  ‚ÄúWhat the guys have done is a huge and complex work: API, interaction between agents.  Each team member contributed as much as possible.  We are very pleased with the result and we are glad that we are opening a company in Innopolis, where we were offered students a job, ‚Äùadded Sebastian Denef. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b1/9b6/bd1/0b19b6bd14c772b2e5216cb5db662ea6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Alexander Nedorezov, Ruslan Mustafin, Alexey Merzlikin and Hayk Badalyan worked for Innosoft, the founders of which are also graduates of Innopolis University.  The team made the project "Size" (LabelThem) - an online tool for marking objects in images.  ‚ÄúThe customer needed a system that makes markup of objects of interest in the pictures, which can be used to train neural networks (or machine learning algorithms).  Previously, Innosoft hired external resources to perform this routine work, and it was expensive.  The system implemented by us reduced the customer's expenses on image layout from $ 75 per 1000 images to $ 20 per 1000 images, that is, almost 4 times, ‚Äùsays Alexander Nedorezov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e1/490/5a7/3e14905a76a64aac0289bc5cf44126a7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Executive Director Vyacheslav Lukin said that students quickly penetrated into the task assigned to them, figured out how to reduce the cost of the process and completed the work by 99%. <br><br><h3>  Systems for working with clients and candidates for work </h3><br>  Anastasia Golovatenko, Ivan Zusik, Elizaveta Kasnakova, Alexander Makhnev and Bulat Mukhutdinov developed a web application for the selection of candidates for work in MTS.  In it, applicants leave a video message, and recruiters, after viewing it, put down grades according to their competencies, accept or reject candidates.  The annex is a table with the rating of applicants, so that the company can compare them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWith the system, the time for recruitment is reduced, excluding the initial interview and the time to travel to the company's office.  And we added a timeline to the application with all the upcoming stages of selection, so that the process was as transparent and understandable for the candidates as possible, ‚ÄùAnastasia Golovatenco added. <br><br>  Maria Merkulova, Project Manager, Recruitment and Recruitment Department, MTS: ‚ÄúWe are grateful to the university, whose students have exceeded all our expectations.  It is important for us that recruitment is simple and convenient, and they have combined several needs for this, which has not yet been on the market. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ea/92e/d95/2ea92ed9578f87a437bb9696276cb9fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Ak Bars Bank has set a task for students of Innopolis University to create a platform through which bank employees and customers will propose ideas for improving banking processes, voting and commenting on ideas.  Alexey Solovyov, Timur Shakirov, Temur Beysov and Ilya Khomyakov developed the necessary functionality of the application, which they placed on the bank‚Äôs servers to start testing by the bank‚Äôs employees. <br><br>  Damir Galiyev, head of the project office for innovative development of the bank: ‚ÄúWe wanted to give such a task so that the students could cope with it, and that their work did not leave somewhere later on the shelf.  Therefore, we have chosen a task from our strategic program.  The students did what was required of them, moreover: the bank has already launched processes to support the developed solution and create related processes. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Systems for auditing, business intelligence and monitoring sites </h3><br>  From KAMAZA, Viktor Vanichkov, Vladislav Dmitriev, Timur Faizrakhmanov and Vladislav Vasilyev received the task to develop an automated system for recording the results of audits conducted.  The system automatically creates checklists and conducts audits according to their data, draws up a schedule for conducting audits, exports checklists and audits to XLSX and generates reports on audits conducted. <br><br>  Pavel Dmitriev, Deputy Chairman of the KRPS PJSC KAMAZ, noted that the students coped with the task and the company was satisfied with the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4af/ad7/bb3/4afad7bb33775c23f72fc717d0141d9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anton Khvorov, Vyacheslav Stepanov and Ivan Dmitriev helped the web development company Flatstack.  Students have developed a system that monitors the status of sites.  She notifies the user about the problems with the site in any convenient way - letter, call, SMS, message to Slack, Telegram. <br><br>  Timur Wafin, Technical Director of Flatstack: ‚ÄúThere are similar services in the world, but students offered technical solutions that reduced the cost of the system.  During the work with the students, we also learned something from them.  They coped with the task by 85%, they did not have enough time to complete the mobile application, in which users could already register and pay for services.  We wish students to be more confident and assertive in order to be able to tell the customer no if he is mistaken. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/375/e00/adc/375e00adc4a8be44d576de6b45e71bca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the company Visiology, Alexander Simonenko, Ekaterina Sysoeva, Nikolai Yushkevich and Andrey Vyshvkin developed an application for user analytics.  ‚ÄúThe company has a BI platform and a web interface, as part of an industrial project, we made a mobile client using the Xamarin.Forms framework.  With it, we developed a mobile application for mobile OS ‚Äî Android, iOS, Windows Mobile ‚Äî using one code, ‚Äùsaid Nikolai Yushkevich.  ‚ÄúThe company needs such mobile applications to increase the number of users and increase the usability of the platform, but there is no business interest in supporting the project if the code is separate.‚Äù <br><br>  Alexey Nikitin, head of the company's development department: ‚ÄúStudents know how to prioritize and quickly adapt to changing requirements.  They successfully dealt with the new technology for themselves and implemented all the basic requirements.  From the negative sides: all the deadlines were broken, which the team set.  There is not enough time for testing and fixing obvious bugs.  But all critical flaws have been fixed and the application meets the tasks.  It looks damp, but I think it is acceptable for an industrial project. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  Digital Assistant at the checkout </h3><br>  Zilya Yagafarova, Igor Bisarnov and Anton Pesegov worked on expanding the functionality of the Dooglys trade automation system using speech recognition.  ‚ÄúEntering information into an order at the checkout is the most time consuming and difficult part of the process: 90% of the errors are committed here.  Our solution will improve the performance of the outlet by up to 30% and reduce the number of errors entered by the user during the order processing process, ‚Äùsays Zilya Yagafarova. <br><br>  The team conducted a study and based on it developed and implemented a speech recognition system.  According to the developers, it was necessary to teach the system to understand inaccurate cashier requests.  ‚ÄúWe worked to make the program understand that‚Äú Chocolate Cheesecake ‚Äùis‚Äú Chocolate Cheesecake 130g ‚Äùin the menu, so that she would offer the options available in the menu to the word‚Äú Apple ‚Äù- Apple Capcake, Apple Pie, ‚ÄúApple strudel, given the morphological analysis,‚Äù explained Zilya. <br><br><h3>  Developments for students around the world </h3><br>  For the electronic platform of the P2P company, which it is preparing in conjunction with Rostelecom to implement and distribute electronic textbooks in schools in Russia and the world, three students worked - Dmitry Samoylenko, Yevgeny Bobrov and Ruzilya Mirgalimov.  They developed an application that stylizes the look of textbooks. <br><br>  P2P CEO Mikhail Savin: ‚ÄúTextbooks should be recognizable and unique, so we identified a separate area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork for their design.  The work was difficult and at first caused difficulties for students who still needed to work together among themselves.  But in the end they managed, distributed the roles in the team and quickly adjusted to the changes in the work. ‚Äù <br><br>  IRTech asked Liana Gareev, Dilyar Galiyev, Alexey Zhuravlyov and Igor Bobko to find out how school performance in Russia and the CIS countries is changing due to external factors: weather, family size, class composition, school level and others.  Students developed a visual assistant who, based on the results of these analyzes, gives advice to children and parents on how to improve school performance. <br><br>  Head of the Innovations Department of IRTech, Maxim Muchkaev, explained that the analysis results would be useful for the ministries of education and business.  ‚ÄúWe are surprised at the result of the students who worked as a team of young professionals.  We worked for the first time in such a format with students and there is a desire to continue such cooperation in the future.  To do this, we will take into account the nuances of working with students on the example of this year‚Äôs experience in order to more clearly set the task for them, ‚Äùadded Maxim Muchkaev. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341520/</a></p>
