  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why we do not like tickets and what is a typographer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f1/268/c05/3f1268c051d441d090858726f938d356.jpg"><br>  Why are you sawing a startup?  An island in the ocean would be nice, but there is something that makes you get up and walk when <a href="http://tjournal.ru/paper/startup-life">you want to lie down and die</a> .  Belief that we have the right understanding of the essence of things and, having embodied our ideas, we will change the world for the better.  Yes, you heard right: our stopitsot features will add something sensible and beautiful to the world.  I do not think that in this we differ from 90% of the teams.  The best fuel than the super idea is hard to come up with.  But sometimes it is this super-idea that makes illogical things to do. <a name="habracut"></a>  Today I‚Äôll talk about two features of Usedesk: we have abandoned one feature, although it is familiar and necessary to most potential customers, and another one was added, despite the fact that, to put it mildly, its use is 90% unclear.  So: <br><br>  <b>Why we do not like tickets</b> <br><br>  There is no ‚Äúticket‚Äù in Usedesk.  Untranslatable into Russian, understandable only for IT specialists and technical support - you cannot use it in communication with customers.  That for a client a ‚Äúletter‚Äù, ‚Äúemail‚Äù, ‚Äúappeal‚Äù, ‚Äúrequest‚Äù, ‚Äúquestion‚Äù - on the other side turns into a slang ‚Äúticket‚Äù.  If Usedesk brings together companies and customers, the word tick as the central term in the service does not match, it divides.  We want the support and the client to speak the same language, and even if they think the same language, it is absolutely wonderful.  A person writes to a person, not a car and not to the presidential administration.  My hands are drawn to my face when I hear cold and arrogant in a pipe: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - What is your request number? <br><br>  - Where can I see it? <br><br>  Yes, companies are more comfortable to identify.  But in this case, you force the client to dance around you, although the commandment says that you need to dance around the client.  Let him choose what to call him - name, email, phone, topic of the question.  There will be those who find it easier to call the ticket number.  Please, we do not offer to cancel the numbers.  I just want a person in the center with a name and a problem, not a ticket with a number.  When you go into the room, and there 3 Sergey, you do not say: ‚ÄúDisorder.  How to contact them now?  Why not name them N345b2, A243k9 and 405NJ8.  Another thing!" <br><br>  We realize that breaking the habit is difficult, and it is almost impossible to inculcate your mentality.  Anticipating a storm of misunderstanding, we make one more reservation. <br><br>  Usedesk is not a service desk or helpdesk in the usual sense.  This is primarily a tool for communicating with customers, and not for setting and solving problems within the company.  This is not JIRA.  We conceived Usedesk as a step from Outlook and Ixel to CRM.  It is suitable for companies that gradually understand that the mail <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/usedesk/blog/252045/">does not solve the problem of quality support</a> , and maintaining customer loyalty is important.  Therefore, we took client orientation as a starting point in all aspects. <br><br>  <b>What is a typographer</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúTypographer is a convenient tool for online preparation of Russian text for a web publication.  It helps to avoid monotonous adjustments, placement of quotes, non-breaking spaces, special characters, corrects some input errors, and so on. " <br><br>  Why do we have built-in tools in Usedesk for web designers and proofreaders?  We want the world to have more beautiful long dashes instead of hyphens and fewer double spaces.  Literacy and typography - this is courtesy to the reader, it does not matter if you write an article on Habr or a short answer to the client.  Errors in words and commas speak of your disregard for language - and this is half the trouble.  The trouble is that a competent client will immediately understand that he is being held for a fool.  On the contrary, by the right quotes, the Christmas tree is immediately visible to ‚Äúits‚Äù, and it is easier and more pleasant to communicate with your own. <br><br>  If we discard the lyrics, the typographer is needed when sending answers if: <br><br><ul><li>  Your answers are long consultations or complex instructions.  Correct typography helps the eye to run easily on the line, information is perceived better. </li><li>  Your customers are thrilled to the Russian language.  Here you can not lose face. </li><li>  Your customers do not experience the thrill of the Russian language.  <s>Make him experience.</s>  Do not lower the bar, from the good - for the better. </li></ul><br>  How does the typographer: you write the text, and the client he already comes magically edited and beautiful. <br><br>  Yes, you guessed it, our motto is dementia and courage.  Sometimes the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbroadcasting your vision seems hopeless, but the response even in the hearts of the units gives hope.  And we continue to move towards our goal: remove another brick from the wall between the company and the client. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289398/</a></p>
