Thus, a wide range of Java developers focused on open technologies will be able to develop and distribute their CUBA applications absolutely free of charge, as well as to change and develop the platform themselves! <br><br>  Who is not familiar with the platform, we invite you to read on <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/">our website</a> or read the first article about the platform <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/haulmont/blog/204834/">on the</a> platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/9a5/615/e2b9a56151144809bb75d2a81565b620.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Our way to the free software market </h1><br>  With the release of the platform in 2014, we began to popularize it, taking part in various events, both in Russia and abroad.  The year 2015 was illustrative when we entered the international market and attended a number of conferences, such as <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/blog/2015-06-02/397">DevoxxUK</a> in London and <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/blog/2015-12-08/466">JavaOne</a> in San Francisco, and also began negotiations with major domestic companies.  Then it became obvious that the requirement for free licensing of the platform is a prerequisite for expanding the community.  Separately, it is worth noting the Russian market, which has become most focused on the use of open technologies, giving preference to domestic products.  Analysis of the factors listed above pushed us to make a decision on switching to perhaps the most popular license in the open source world - Apache 2.0. <br><br><h1>  Where's the trick? </h1><br>  I am sure that since childhood, each of us has been told the phrase that free cheese is only in a mousetrap.  So it is very likely that you have a question indicated in the title of this section.  Let's take a closer look at the proposed licensing model, which in our opinion takes into account the interests of all parties. <br><br>  The CUBA platform is a standalone product that includes a number of <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/framework">features</a> specific to all corporate applications, such as managing roles and user access levels, creating a user interface, filtering data, scheduled tasks, auditing, and more.  All this is now absolutely free, not only for creating and distributing your applications, but also for modifying the code of the platform itself, as well as expanding its functionality. <br><br>  If you have already been developing at CUBA, then you probably know that the platform is accompanied by optional tools that increase the efficiency of the software development process.  So, in order to reduce the threshold of entry, we developed a specialized IDE - <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/development-tools">CUBA Studio</a> , which presents the capabilities of the CUBA platform in an intuitive and developer-friendly way.  With Studio, you can create a ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù application in a few minutes, and within a couple of hours you can grow it into a <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/quickstart">small full-featured system</a> .  To increase the convenience and speed of development, Studio allows you to visually design a data model and user interface (including automatically using an existing database), supports autogeneration of the code for screens and their controllers, services, lists, etc. <br><br>  CUBA Studio is free in full-featured version, but with a limit of 10 entities in the data model of your application.  Thus, you can quickly develop a prototype of your solution and explore the capabilities of the platform.  Later, when your application goes beyond the limitations of the free version, you will have the choice to continue developing for free in the usual Java IDE, or to purchase a commercial Studio subscription for the developer, which in addition to removing restrictions also gives access to <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/add-ons">premium add-ons</a> .  Add-ons include a report generator, charts and maps, business process management, and full-text search, enabling you to extend the capabilities of your applications with minimal effort. <br><br>  According to the tradition of monetization of free software, we also offer <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/services">paid services</a> , such as training, consulting, custom development and technical support contracts, which will allow you to use the platform with full confidence in our timely guaranteed support from our side. <br><br>  As you can see, there are no pitfalls and everything is extremely simple - <b>the CUBA platform becomes public domain under the Apache 2.0 open source license, published on <a href="https://github.com/cuba-platform/cuba">GitHub</a></b> , and some additional (but not mandatory) tools and services remain paid.  From our point of view, such an approach to licensing at the same time is in the interests of the developer community and will allow financing the further development of the platform. <br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  In the epilogue for this article, I would like to note that with the transition to the world of free software, we hope for a significant growth of an active developer community, which in turn will serve as a catalyst for the further development of the platform.  We will be glad to see your ideas, feedback and questions on our <a href="https://www.cuba-platform.ru/support/">forum</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283346/</a></p>
