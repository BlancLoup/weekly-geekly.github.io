  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call tracking systems: let's measure calls</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Practically all modern analytics systems are sharpened for services that allow determining the efficiency of a particular advertising campaign on the Internet, the lead of which leads to a call.  Ideally - with the subsequent sale of a product or service, in the average version - to the desire to purchase goods. <br>  People prefer to communicate, if not at the beginning of the order of the goods, then exactly after the purchase - the order of the goods in the online basket and checkout.  On condition of expensive purchases, the buyer prefers to communicate by phone immediately.  And whatever the visionaries say, you don‚Äôt want to buy an apartment and a car without talking to a specialist.  That is why telephony remains one of the most sought-after channels of customer interaction in Russia.  Today, business makes maximum use of the possibilities of promoting its product and checks how much it has spent on promoting money.  More and more advertisers are focusing on call effectiveness.  After going the hard way from the drill of the sales department and the turnover manager of the call center and the marketing specialists, the business owner or his marketer eventually connects the call tracking system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Prehistory</font> </h2><br>  Call Tracking appeared on the Russian market in 2010.  Today it is a separate branch of the evolution of analytical metrics and marketing.  Less use - you lose the "beautiful" numbers.  Plus - calls come to you.  According to TNS company statistics, in 2014 only 7% of apartment buyers remembered the number of developers in St. Petersburg.  The company number is remembered after 3-4 interactions, at the same time, the first contact occurs at the time of entering the site or contact with another advertising medium (banner, ad, etc.).  Of course, in each industry there are different periods of buying goods or services, and what is good for a developer, where buying an apartment can take months, in a taxi or beauty salon, ordering a phone call is a couple of hours or a day.  This fact must be taken into account when choosing a calltracking system and its tariff, but first we will make a small excursion - what is a call tracking service. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Static and dynamic call tracking</font> </h2><br>  In 2010, static call tracking appeared for the first time in Russia.  It allowed you to bind one number to one advertising source - a banner, contextual query, ad, etc. Later dynamic call tracking appeared on the market - it represents the same technology of linking the number to a specific session (user‚Äôs visit), only this time the number is bound only for some time the session is unique for a given visitor (visible only to him on the site).  This technology allows you to track the flow of visitors to the site in relation to advertising campaigns on the Internet.  The received data is transmitted to one of the metrics - Google.Analytic, Yandex.Metrica, CRM-system or displayed in the interface of the call tracking system.  Both static and dynamic call tracking allow you to record phone calls, which makes it possible to monitor the work of the call center and (or) the sales department and / or the contextual advertising agency.  Dynamic Call Tracking allows you to drill down on all data by browsers, session time, devices, and many other parameters.

    <h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Choosing a call tracking service</font> </h2><br>  Like any agency, we in Realweb choose from the market leaders.  That is why we propose to talk about two systems, between which the leading advertising agencies are running, offering promotion in digital-e - CoMagic and Calltouch. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Tariffing and pricing</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ Algorithm CoMagic assigns the number to the session for a fixed time selected when the service is connected (by default, 15 minutes).  If the user is longer on the site, the number is released and allocated to another user.  By reducing the tracking accuracy, you can purchase additional numbers yourself to increase it.  The average tracking accuracy to the keyword is 80%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b1a/ef4/4c2/b1aef44c2a0548fda22ff3e68dd9aa10.png">  " <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The Calltouch algorithm knows how much time a visitor spends on your site, and reserves a phone number for the entire visit time + freeze time (short time after the tab is closed, from 2 to 60 minutes).  In the case of dynamic pinning, the phone number is assigned all the time while the user is on the site, and is allocated to the next user only if the previous one has already left the site.  It is important to note that the phone number needs to be kept by the user for some time after leaving the site, as it may take a certain number of minutes to make a phone call.  In the aggregate, the algorithm allows to ensure the average tracking accuracy to the keyword at the level of 95%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bb5/9d8/c82/bb59d8c8233248c992b7f437b93da78e.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Both approaches have the right to life.  However, in the first case, it turns out that in order to fix all users who are on the site, it is necessary to fix phone numbers for 48 minutes (this is the length of the user session length in the example), it will be quite expensive.  If, on the contrary, the user spends little time on the site, for example, 1 minute, then with a fixed assignment, the number will hold on to this user for another 14 minutes, which forms redundancy and will affect the cost of the service.  Thus, the substitution algorithm has the greatest effect on the cost of call tracking.  For the end user, the difference in the algorithm may mean that in order to ensure the same accuracy in the Comagic algorithm, in some cases more numbers are needed, which may affect the cost of call tracking. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The minimum package in Calltouch is 3000-4000 minutes, depending on the tariff.  In CoMagic - 1000-9000 minutes, depending on the tariff.  Everything that goes above the package is charged at 1 rub / min in both systems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Telephony</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ Both systems work with a licensed telecom operator, provide the ability to transfer calls in real time and to SIP, store numbers on request. <br>  ‚Ä¢ An important fact, both in Calltouch and in CoMagic, the "cleanliness" of the numbers is automatically checked.  The ‚Äúsilence‚Äù time is at least 3 months without calls to Calltouch, at least 1 month without calls to CoMagic, respectively. <br>  ‚Ä¢ There is a possibility to connect your numbers in Calltouch, in CoMagic there is no such option at the moment. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The geographical coverage of Calltouch in Russia is wider than that of CoMagic (60 regions and 28 countries).  CoMagic geography has expanded to 37 regions of the Russian Federation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Functional</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ Connecting tracking sources to Calltouch integrates automatically.  In CoMagic, this feature is manually configured.  Both systems are integrated with Yandex.Metrica and Yandex.Direct, Google.Analytics and Google.Adwords, synchronized with CRM and provide the ability to create agent accounts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ CoMagic gives the user greater access to the settings and the connection / disconnection of numbers and the online consultant, while Calltouch performs all settings on its own, which eliminates the possibility of errors and speeds up the service connection. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Both systems provide the ability to connect online chats and offline application windows that appear on the site during off-hours or in the absence of consultants.  In CoMagic, this is your own service, and in Calltouch, statistics from third-party services are transmitted using ready-made integrations or an API.  Webhooks options, an open API and the ability to track application forms are also offered by Calltouch and CoMagic. <br>  ‚Ä¢ As for reporting, the report ‚ÄúAll sources‚Äù, ‚ÄúEnd-to-end analytics‚Äù is in both systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5c8/29b/339/5c829b33960a43b68dafe20c708325b6.jpg"><br><br>  The Calltouch interface is more focused on displaying statistics and is aimed at its convenient, user-friendly, intuitive presentation.  In March 2017, Calltouch introduced a new personal account with a fundamentally new report structure and additional features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/55e/3f0/11c/55e3f011c1bb47d8a8c765c8d0ea7cd3.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In both systems, it is possible to generate a report on UTM tags.  Both systems allow you to record and listen to phone calls.  You can also replace the default number on the site with the service number, thus obtaining statistics on all calls from online. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9d3/be3/ad5/9d3be3ad573541528abee07a0c911456.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6ef/68a/012/6ef68a01268d48228a4c48d8750f631a.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In Calltouch, it is possible to set the uniqueness period of a call from zero to infinity (when uniqueness is tracked from the moment the service is activated), in Comagic the maximum uniqueness period is set at 30 days. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Keywords can track both systems. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Calltouch has an Optimizer - Yandex.Direct Advertising Call Management System.  The main functions are to increase the number of calls and reduce the cost of a call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/661/481/04f/66148104fb584482a7712f9fdc4b277b.png"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In both systems, it is possible to replace the phone by ‚Äúwrapping‚Äù them into special codes, however, Calltouch can automatically find phone numbers on the site that need to be replaced. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Both systems allow you to customize your greeting, settings, and forwarding schedule.  On both systems, you can connect the voice mail service to those who could not get through.  Both services are integrated with SIP-telephony (communication via the Internet) of your campaign. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0d75bb">Security and Tech Support</font> </h2><br>  ‚Ä¢ Both services are aimed at customer interaction and comply with all basic security requirements: Access via HTTPS protected protocol, Compliance with federal law No. 152-FZ, Compliance with federal law No. 242-FZ. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Calltouch schedule 7 days a week from 9:00 to 22:00, CoMagic - during all working days from 9:00 to 19:00. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Calltouch allows you to hide phone numbers of callers in your personal account, which prevents the transfer of this information to third parties: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9c8/80f/bdf/9c880fbdfa64452daf7f98a08844fdc5.png"><br><br>  <b>Before using call-tracking, you need to make basic settings and take into account a few simple points:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ During the initial setup, you need to check the operation of JavaScript, the presence of counters of call-tracking systems, the sufficiency of the pool of allocated numbers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ When installing call tracking systems on the site, programmers should check the safety of the layout in accordance with the instructions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Numbers that were clickable on the site before should remain clickable with number substitution (when clicking on them, a substitute number should be shown). <br>  ‚Ä¢ We must strive to avoid annoying errors in the interpretation of the data.  In this case, further sales channel management decisions will be based on incomplete or distorted information, this is guaranteed to prevent the optimization of the advertising strategy. <br>  When choosing a calltracking system, be sure to pay attention to the algorithm for assigning phone numbers, the accuracy of determining, setting uniqueness, technological features and, of course, the cost - the effectiveness of your business depends on your decision.  If you have been using telephony as a marketing tool for a long time, but do not measure it, be sure to try.  Sure, the results will surprise you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294962/</a></p>
