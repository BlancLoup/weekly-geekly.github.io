It is likely that since you visited us, you have already heard something about the Petersburg ‚Äúconstruction of the century‚Äù, as some media have managed to christen our project.  But it does not matter if not. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24f/cbd/b8d/24fcbdb8d6014b1c941924358f3e996a.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Visualization of the project "Lakhta Center".</em>  <em>St. Petersburg, Gulf of Finland, 2018</em> <br><br>  In order to arrive at a common starting point, we recall in a few words what this is about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Lakhta Center is a public business complex that is being built in St. Petersburg, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland.  It consists of two buildings - a multifunctional and a skyscraper.  The skyscraper belongs to the category of supertolls, and at the time of delivery in 2018 it will reach a height of 462 meters, becoming the highest in Russia, Europe and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings">11th in terms of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù in the world</a> .

      During the construction of the tower has managed to stick a few more loud titles and records.  For example, pouring the bottom slab of the foundation hit the Guinness Book of Records, and a month ago ‚ÄúLakhta Center‚Äù took second place in the global listing of the tallest buildings with a twisting shape.  Of course, the collection of records - not an end in itself, just "it happened", as one of our leaders put it.  The project is noticeable, and it is noticed. <br><br>  The second building - multifunctional (MFZ), is also very interesting.  Our engineers and builders believe that it is structurally more complex than the tower.  If you probably saw the skyscrapers, then the MFZ will definitely surprise you. <br><br>  We are confident that the construction of skyscrapers and modern construction is a matter of high technology not only in the direct but also in the figurative sense.  And not necessarily the actual construction or architectural - the scale of the involved specialists from different areas is huge.  For example, did you know that skyscrapers are being "tested" by aerodynamic experts?  Or that the vertical construction of the tower is monitored using satellite navigation systems?  Or how is the icing problem solved?  (We know that snow is thrown off with some shovels from some skyscrapers, but we will not use the spatula technology). <br><br>  Such questions can still be found very, very much.  We are planning to talk about their decisions in our posts.  We will try to talk about the most interesting of the experience gained in four years from the start of the project.  We hope that you will be interested with us. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1a/649/efc/b1a649efc6af423fbff9d90d2058140f.jpg"></a>  <em>Lakhta Center.</em>  <em>Memorable picture on the basement plate (2014, clickable)</em> <br><br><h2>  And some organizational information. </h2><br>  Material for posts is provided mostly by our technical experts.  They will prepare answers if there are any profile questions in comments.  And since the obligation to answer questions is pleasant, but not essential, preparation may take some time.  We hope for patience and understanding. <br><br>  <em>For questions related to the project, please contact the press office: <a href="">press@lakhta.center</a></em> <br><br>  Potential contractors - welcome <a href="http://lakhta.center/ru/status/orders/">here</a> . <br>  Partners and operators are wanted <a href="http://lakhta.center/ru/relations/interplay/">here</a> . <br><br>  Where are we still talking about the project: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/lahtacenterinfo">The official channel "Lakhta Center" on YouTube</a> .
