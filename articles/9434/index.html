  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tim O'Reilly's Rules of Life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Tim O'Reilly was interviewed and told many things that he had already said many times before.</strong>  <strong>But there is something interesting.</strong>  <strong>I will give here the most interesting of his quotes.</strong>  <strong>It turned out something like Esquirer's "rules of life".</strong>  <strong>So, "the rules of life from O'Reilly."</strong> <br><br>  1. People in the last two years have started to think about web 2.0 in a new way.  Someone figured out how to use the ‚Äúnetwork effect‚Äù in the realm of, say, video or news.  But it seems to me that I have to remind people all the time that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing collective intelligence and ‚Äúnetwork effects‚Äù to mobilize unused resources is the fundamental aspect of the changes that occur in web 2.0. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  2. Remember, for example, Nintendo Wii: the main thing there is the use of inertial sensors.  They allow you to play interactive games: you do something by playing it in front of the computer, rather than typing on the keyboard.  Such sensors will be embedded in mobile phones, and I really think that we are on the verge of "the principle (paradigm) of interaction".  In the next phase of technology development, for example, there will be such things as speech recognition.  This will generate a whole new class of mobile applications.  I think we are still waiting for a lot of surprises.

      3. To be honest, I think that a new generation of exciting new applications will be located in a slightly different area than the Internet. <br><br>  4. Present the Nintendo Wii - you control the application by moving objects in space.  And what if you do this with your mobile phone?  And what if you can go into the room and talk to your computer, and not type on it? <br><br>  5. When blogs just appeared, everyone was equal, and now there are top 100, and many blogs belong to publishing companies.  There was once a time when every newspaper was like a blog - some printer said: I will make a newspaper. <br><br>  6.Windows is a serious challenge.  It will not disappear to a greater degree than the computer hardware disappeared.  Web 2.0 can be compared with the history of personal computers.  In the early stages of the computer industry, we had computers, and the software was not so important.  All the big companies were hardware companies.  But when the hardware became standardized with IBM computers, the software became more valuable than the hardware.  The hardware did not disappear, it just began to bring much less profit.  This profit is concentrated in software from Microsoft and other similar companies.  And what is happening today - software becomes something taken for granted, just as a hardware device once took for granted. <br><br>  7. I‚Äôm actually going to come to Russia for the first time towards the end of this year.  I really want to visit St. Petersburg.  As far as I heard, there are many interesting specialists in Russia, and within the framework of my business I would like to get to know Russian hackers and programmers better. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.akzia.ru/" title="Promotion.Online">Promotion.Online</a> <br>  Link to - <a href="http://www.akzia.ru/tema/28-05-2007/1805.html" title="full interview">original</a> <br>  PS By the way, the editors of the Promotion collects additional questions and wishes for Tim and are ready to give them to him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9434/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9434/</a></p>
