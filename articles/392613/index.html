  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The tale of how we copter tried to register</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As you probably know, on March 30, the law on registration of UAVs entered into force.  Everyone who has a device weighing more than 250 grams must be registered with the Federal Security Service and the Federal Air Transport Agency.  Also, the drone operator must have special permission to control the UAV - evidence of an external pilot.  At the same time, the law does not state how the registration should take place.  Let us see how the registration procedure was clarified 90 days after the adoption of the law. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dc/743/3c4/7dc7433c4ac44c7ea777e86dd3407ce2.jpg" height="300"><br><br>  When this law was passed in December, we didn‚Äôt doubt for a second that by the time when it would be necessary to register a copter - the registration procedure would work ‚Äúas usual‚Äù.  But nevertheless, they considered it their duty at the first opportunity to decide to go through all the procedures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And then we take a kopter, we get up at 6 in the morning and move on an electric train in order to be in place by 11 in the morning.  Approaching the building of Rosaviation on 37 Leningradsky Avenue, one could see strange people with large backpacks with the naked eye.

After waiting a little late and journalists, we decided to ‚Äústorm‚Äù the checkpoint, which as a result was divided into 2 zones: the copter zone and the zone of people eager to file an application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71f/f7c/868/71ff7c86840b451daaec595509b27e16.jpg"><br><br>  Along the way, all the new people came up with new devices, those who were without applications on the spot filled them.  Here, by the way, the <a href="https://vk.com/doc156197_437384859%3Fhash%3D9da97cf90c829b3137%26dl%3D71c1decbdeb4b0bd61">application form</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e69/a02/b78/e69a02b785d3475e8a13a07a33aea3f2.jpg"><br><br>  After calls were made to all possible departments, trying to figure out what to do, the guard came, who, as it turned out, was more knowledgeable than the others, and sent us to the "Expedition" department, which is just around the corner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b9/c2c/4cb/0b9c2c4cb1ed454182b7e5a0fc56c8c5.jpg"><br><br>  After a couple of minutes wandering around in search of the door, it was found. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/227/804/893/227804893ec547babbdd20a1b5b485c7.jpg"><br><br>  Then everything was very fast: we somehow pressed inward (no one obviously counted on such a number of visitors) went to the window, handed over statements, gave us papers where to call to find out when to wait for a refusal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ab/272/54b/7ab27254bc4e455784ce4d0b397799e0.jpg"><br><br>  According to the results of the visit of Rosaviation - as expected, no one was waiting for us there.  We are waiting for an official response. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/947/402/d5c/947402d5c53ffa966365c56ee5acc086.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Photo taken <a href="http://www.mreporter.ru/reports/64609">from here</a></i> <br><br>  Next is my IMHO, about the need for a law: <br>  If you think about it, then in Russia you can find many similar procedures in other areas.  However, the difference is that there the procedure was either run in for years, or it was not so thoughtlessly and transiently accepted. <br><br>  In particular, close to me is the registration of radio equipment.  There, too, under certain conditions, any equipment must be registered (but not certified), including self-made.  Moreover, during registration, things are also indicated that radio amateurs often update or may not have them (for example, there may be no antenna when registering a transceiver).  But no one requires re-registration when changing (although it seems necessary, but even in the HRCH they were told that they already have something to do without it). <br><br>  The registration procedure is also interesting: each radio station must have a call sign;  callsign for ordinary people is issued to the operator (analogy with the pilot);  in order to obtain a license operator, you must pass a simple exam, which checks the basic knowledge of what can and can not be done on the air.  The exam can be taken by an accredited organization, now we have a regional branch of the Union of Radio Amateurs of Russia, the main purpose of which is not to register, but in which there are people who can adequately assess people and their knowledge. <br>  It seems to be very similar to what the lawmakers want to do.  And also there is no online registration.  That's just it all works very well with that, also concerns not very large number of people. <br>  Now, almost in every small town there are sections of aircraft modeling in which there are people who are able to assess the preparation of "external pilots" and the state of airplanes. <br><br>  Now we have the fact that no one can fly legally, while there are no sanctions as such (except for violating the air code, a fine of 3000-5000 r), and people in the bodies themselves say that if you don‚Äôt be impudent, then who they are not. <br>  But even if the registration of the copters worked, it still would not solve the problems, the license of the external pilot cannot be obtained, the coordination of the flight plan is also not the easiest and quickest procedure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392613/</a></p>
