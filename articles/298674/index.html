  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most worthless waste of money</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since the goal of this article is not to generate the maximum possible amount of self-hatred in people, but an attempt to jointly discuss the problems that have accumulated, I decided not to write directly in the forehead about the design in the IT field.  No, let's discuss this area that is far from your direct income as <b>interior design</b> and draw interesting parallels, considering that in the world of high technologies everything changes 100 times faster than in the world of real estate.  In general, who knows - he will understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9fd/d86/9f4/9fdd869f4a954b7e50822bd1d3404f77.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the sight of our attention today there will be a 75% true story about a prosperous bachelor who has just bought a studio apartment in the center.  Next, our character by itself, it took a design repair of his lair and refuge: a mini-bar, space for TV and console, music center - in general, everything as it should be.  For the hundredth time, a design project is approved, completely inhuman money is being poured into work and materials, and now, six months later, our bachelor invites friends and colleagues to boast legitimate success.  The guests are delighted, they make a selfie against the background of a designer fireplace and for the whole evening our character becomes the ‚ÄúKing of the ribbon‚Äù for all his friends.  In general, universal rejoicing.

At that very promo party, our bachelor businessman met his old friend's sister and feelings suddenly flared.  The romance spun around, after a while she moved in with him, and then suddenly it turned out that instead of a designer single lounger made from skins, an urgent need to squeeze a double bed in the Victorian style.  Time passed, and it took her to place her dresses and shoes somewhere.  Well, a couple of thousand dollars and a day of work - and the crafting fireplace went for scrap, and a wardrobe from IKEA took its place.  <i>‚ÄúBut it could have opened a new point with this money,‚Äù the</i> studio owner saw off with a look. <br><br>  Some time passes, the lovers get married, and naturally, further pregnancy occurs unaccounted for in the initial design project.  Why unrecorded?  And because there is glass all around, sharp corners, fragile interior elements and loud speakers.  Where does all this the new wife of our hero send?  That's right - in a landfill.  Then it turns out that even twins are expected (well, why not), which means that the XBOX home cinema and play area in the blink of an eye mutates into a fenced-off nursery with two beds, a changing table and other accessories.  So, and there is still no place to put the stroller in the corridor, so it is quite logical that the wife is already beginning to look closely at the hipster mini-bar, which was used exactly once at the apartment presentation a year ago. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8e0/17b/950/8e017b95055dfcd7a32daae2ad0fd942.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And so, the designer of that hipster interior, who came in a couple of years to visit, hoping to take a photo of the created masterpiece on his new website - instead of the triumph of taste, strollers and diapers, breast pump, cat tray and spouse exercise bike see.  And the owner with a bottle of whiskey and dumb questions in his eyes: <i>"And why did I then decide to save money and refused to rent warehouses closer to the center?"</i> <br><br>  To complete our story, let us assume that our hero‚Äôs entire business was based on a samostroi, obtained by using fraudulent papers, and right now our invented character is selling his apartment to Gypsies for half the cost, since he decided to leave the country with his family.  Well, freaked out man, let's say.  And so, the newly populated Roma owners hire the same designer so that he removes all this ‚Äúnonsense‚Äù and makes a normal interior with crystal, gold and all that is necessary. <br><br>  Let us turn to conclusions: two or three years ago, no one in the world could have foreseen hundreds of momentous things: the dollar rate and sanctions, the behavior of contractors and the emergence of new trends among consumers.  Changing the range and pricing, the unexpected emergence of strong competitors and the announcement of the Cold War ‚Äî none of Russia's most expensive illustrator, usability manager, or even art director (interiors, of course) simply cannot predict all the conditions that have appeared from nowhere. <br><br>  Business today is increasingly going to sail, not seeing the opposite shore, and he just tries as often as possible to adjust the course depending on the constantly changing weather conditions.  And here a great advantage is received by those who invest not in the ‚Äúexpensive-bohato‚Äù, but in the flexibility of the entire system, in an opportunity to dodge an iceberg in a matter of seconds or transfer to a rescue helicopter.  Willingness to change today became more important than the wow effect yesterday, don't you think so?  Well, at least regarding the interior design? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298674/</a></p>
