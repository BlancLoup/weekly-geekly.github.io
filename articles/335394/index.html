We hope this summer in spite of the bad weather you managed to relax.  Autumn is coming - it's time to learn.  Taking into account the previous courses - we have greatly updated our program - we have added a lot of practical training, we are talking more about practical cases.  In this post I would like to tell you in detail about all the innovations.  For those who have little time: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Decreased price</b> </li><li>  <b>8 additional hands-on workshops</b> </li><li>  <b>Additional classes on business</b> </li><li>  <b>Deep Learning Classes</b> </li><li>  <b>Remote learning available</b> </li><li>  <b>Plus 2 lessons in the introductory course</b> </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now everything is in order.

    <h3>  8 additional hands-on workshops </h3><br>  So that our students could immerse themselves even more into the details of the development of algorithms - we added <b>8 additional seminars</b> in which completely practical tasks will be considered ‚Äúfrom and to‚Äù.  Earlier in our courses, some students did not have time to do their homework, because  The program is very rich and complex.  Now they don‚Äôt get anywhere - there will be even more tasks and practice =) <br><br><h3>  Additional classes on business </h3><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataschool/blog/328556/">As we wrote earlier</a> , there are a lot of courses on the market today, in which we are talking about analytics and machine learning, about technical limitations, development and testing of algorithms.  <b>But there are few places where issues related to the assessment of the economic efficiency of these algorithms, as well as the process of introducing them "in prod", are discussed</b> .  It is on this basis that, in addition to the formation of technical skills, our schooling is based - we teach not just analytics (you can learn this with great desire and without us), but to answer business questions.  <b>Now we have added even more classes dedicated to product analysis and economic impact assessment and the introduction of ‚Äúin the product‚Äù</b> - you will not find this on the cursor) <br><br><h3>  Deep learning </h3><br>  In connection with the development of modern approaches to the analysis of images and videos, <b>we added classes about Deep Learning</b> - we will not be deeply absorbed in technical details, because we understand that most likely you will hardly find it useful in work in the near future, but it is useful to know approaches to modern algorithms for analyzing such complex objects as images, videos and texts. <br><br><h3>  Online training </h3><br>  Many regretted that our classes can not be engaged remotely - <b>now classes are available online</b> .  This does not free you from practical exercises and homework.  Of course, classes in the classroom are more productive and motivate a person to work, but sometimes, for various reasons, it is convenient to be present remotely, especially if this is a lecture. <br><br><h3>  10% discount </h3><br>  Despite the fact that the number of classes and the duration of training has increased - <b>until August 31, students receive a 10% discount on the course</b> .  So, to date, the Data School course is becoming one of the best in terms of price-performance ratio (at least we wanted to do this) <br><br><h3>  Plus 2 lessons in the introductory course </h3><br>  For those who are still just starting to study data analysis and want to improve their mathematical skills and browse through the mathematical component of data analysis, we have good news - <b>now we have added 2 additional classes to our <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/introductory">introductory course</a> !</b> <br><br>  Recall that if you are interested in purely learning machine learning, various mathematical approaches and you are not in a hurry to use it in real business problems - a large number of courses are available on Coursera, Edx and many other platforms.  After which you can tackle tasks on Kaggle. <br><br>  But our experience shows that even participation and successful performance in Kaggle competitions do not help in solving industrial problems (fans of sports programming competitions came to a similar conclusion - participation in competitions like ACM has little to do with industrial software development).  Moreover, this experience is acquired only by trial and error and will never be described in books - even in our lectures we do not tell all the subtleties that we have put into practice. <br><br>  In addition to updating our main course, we also start our courses: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/">Basic course for analysts</a> - September 18 </li><li>  <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/datamba">Course for Managers</a> - September 19 </li><li>  <a href="http://bigdata.beeline.digital/introductory">Introductory course</a> - August 21 </li></ul><br>  See you at the School of Data!) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335394/</a></p>
