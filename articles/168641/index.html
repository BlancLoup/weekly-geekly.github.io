Such a classification, apart from its incompleteness, suffers from ambiguous interpretation and does not take into account the real goals of the product.  However, it is this classification that is used by many customers when contacting the studio, as well as many studios are trying to rate and segment their work on the same clich√©. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What does this lead to?  Focusing on these categories, some customers and studios forget to think about the goals of the site.  Many customers think in terms of ‚Äúwhat do I need a website?‚Äù, And not ‚Äúwhy do I need a website?‚Äù.  They think what modules or functions to implement on their website, how much news should be placed on the main page, which photo should be in the header and what else can entertain a visitor to their website.  In this case, the customer does not ask the question "For what?".  What are all these modules, functions, design for, what is the site for?  Many studios also do not ask this question, and the customer receives the desired site directory, which later becomes an inefficient platform for sales with extremely low conversion. <br><br><h5>  What is the site for? </h5><br>  This is a key question that every customer must find the right answer.  We will consider sites developed for business purposes.  The goals of such sites may be different: from cost reduction to sales tool.  In any case, a commercial organization, making financial investments, should be guided by the possibilities of returning the invested funds and their multiplication.  This is the very essence of the existence of an organization. <br><br>  Consider the main types of profit that can be obtained from the work site:

    <ul><li>  profit from sales of goods or services from the site; </li><li>  profit from the quality process of communication with partners, investors, potential customers; </li><li>  profit from stimulating demand for a product or service; </li><li>  profit from cost reduction; </li><li>  profit from the monetization of traffic. </li></ul><br>  <b>The first thing that the customer must independently determine before he begins to invest money in the development of the site is what kind of profit he expects.</b>  <b>Making this profit will be the goal of creating the site.</b> <br><br>  Accordingly, the achievement of this goal will mean the successful work of the studio and the customer to develop the site. <br>  In most cases, companies develop a website for the purpose of making a profit from the sale of goods or services, so we will look at this category in more detail.  Profit from such sites, of course, depends on the number of your sales, so for simplicity we will call this category of sites so - sites for effective sales. <br><br><h5>  Features online sales of goods or services </h5><br>  After several sales cycles, you can make very accurate conclusions about the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. <br>  In the analysis it becomes clear that the quality of the site is one of the most important factors for successful sales, but not the only one.  A website for sales will be a truly effective tool if: <br><br><ul><li>  the goods or services that are offered are competitive at least with respect to competitors advertising in the neighborhood; </li><li>  there is a demand for the goods or services offered, and consumers are actively using the Internet to search for them; </li><li>  the site and the company will have a positive reputation, and public opinion will be on the side of the company; </li><li>  Call center operators provide professional communication with customers and have sales skills. </li></ul><br>  Obviously, if you do not take into account these simple rules, you should not count on high performance indicators of the site and hope for conversion.  The site is only an element of the sales chain and it is not necessary to demand a miracle from it or from Internet advertising. <br><br>  <b>The task of the site is to establish communication with the consumer, to make it convenient and predictable, to convey the company's offer, and also to provide an opportunity for self-service (choosing and arranging the purchase of goods, familiarizing with services, calculating prices in calculators, etc.)</b> <br><br><h4>  So what is needed for effective online sales? </h4><br>  Four components are necessary for this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/177/033/567/17703356784f4a4e697a7de5a1eeef05.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  advantageous to the target audience a proposal that satisfies its needs; </li><li>  an effective website that will broadcast to the visitors the competitive advantages of the company and the offer will be convenient and understandable to the consumer; </li><li>  effective online advertising channels; </li><li>  effective application processing; </li></ul><br>  <b>The entire sales chain will be as effective as the weakest link.</b> <br><br>  It is necessary to consider these four components together, which means that when developing the site all this data should be taken into account. <br>  In this context, the studio engaged in the development of this class of sites should take on much more than the usual site producers.  A successful result requires the inclusion of the following additional specialists in the process (besides the designer, layout designer, programmer, and manager): <br><br><ul><li>  Marketer.  If the client company does not have its own marketer and there is not enough marketing data, the studio provides advice to its specialist. </li><li>  Copywriter  His task is to develop a selling text that will transmit information about the offer on the site in a language understandable to the consumer. </li><li>  Specialist in website design and interfaces.  Its task is to formulate the requirements for the site, accumulate information from different sources and design the site structure, the user's routes on the site, as well as suggest the arrangement of information blocks on the pages and develop a prototype. </li><li>  Advertising Specialist.  Its functions include the preliminary planning of the advertising campaign, the definition of sites for future placement.  In accordance with the results of this planning, landing pages can be developed for visitors from various advertising sources. </li></ul><br>  Combining the efforts of these specialists affects all four components of effective sales, which allows us to achieve fundamentally different indicators as compared to the local impact on each component separately.  The whole cycle of works takes considerable time and, accordingly, requires certain budgets and preparation of both the customer and the performer.  However, increasing conversions allows increasing the number of applications and orders at unchanged budgets of an advertising campaign, which very quickly compensates costs. <br><br>  In the following articles, we will look at each link in the chain of online sales in detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168641/</a></p>
