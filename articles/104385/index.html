This device will be on sale in September of this year in Germany, after which we can expect its appearance in our market. <br><br>  This is the last currently announced phone from the Wave line, the Wave 525 and Wave 533 models have been previously presented, among which the new device will occupy its price niche at about $ 300. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite the modest price, the device promises to be very interesting to the general public by including all the modern trends in the world of mobile devices.

      The first and foremost among them is the Social Hub.  This is a complete solution, which is part of the new TouchWiz 3.0 interface, and functions on top of the device‚Äôs operating system.  It includes mechanisms to support a variety of data formats with a special implementation of their data.  The user gets a completely redesigned phone book concept, in which you can add not only a phone number, but also data from social networks, email or IM.  These data can not only be viewed, but also made contact with their help in just a couple of movements, which previously was only in the dreams of advanced users of various smartphones, among which I once was.  As a result of using Social Hub, a device user can get a more holistic Internet image of his interlocutor, when, just looking in the notebook, it‚Äôs already clear where and what our interlocutor can be busy with. <br><br>  The next indisputable advantage of the device is its case - part of it is made of metal itself, and the set comes with a fold-out leather protective flip that allows you to carry the device in your pocket even with a bunch of keys without fear that the screen will quickly lose its appeal.  In general, judging by my previous communication with Habr users on the subject of cases in our company's devices, this is an ideal phone for those who do not want to see too much plastic on the case, as well as think about some kind of additional protective case and other unnecessary details, only distracting in the work.  The thickness of the device is 11.8 mm. <br><br>  Technical characteristics of the device are also at a decent level.  The smartphone runs on bada OS, supports GSM and 3G networks, is equipped with Bluetooth 3.0 and Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n modules, an autofocus 5-megapixel camera with LED-backlit, 3.5 mm audio output, GPS receiver, 90 MB of internal memory and supports microSD / microSDHC memory cards.  The only thing that can be confusing is the 3.2 "WQVGA TFT screen with a resolution of 240x400 pixels, but you should not forget that this device is designed to solve more pragmatic tasks than to be a multimedia expensive toy. Although it certainly does not cancel the fact that its resolution is at a sufficient level to view the same clips from youtube, and as much as possible realizes the money invested in the purchase. <br><br>  The cost of the phone in Russia has not been disclosed. <br><br>  PS: Live photos of the device can be seen <a href="http://badaportal.com/zhivye-fotografii-samsung-s7230e-wave-723-s-vystavki-ifa-2010.html">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104385/</a></p>
