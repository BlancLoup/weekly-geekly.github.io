We continue to talk about wealth.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I advise you to read from the <a href="http://nos-s-dest.habrahabr.ru/blog/41860.html">beginning</a> . <br><br>  In the photographs, the author of the book ‚ÄúUpgrade monkeys.  The big story of a small singularity ‚Äùlooks like a nerd and a loser.  Despite this, a significant proportion of his statements are supported by personal practice.  One of them is the statement that a person perceives shocking information much better than low-level portals on the Internet constantly use. <br><br><blockquote>  Thoughts on the topic.  Try on two phrases.  The calm statement ‚Äúin summer the Russian economy will face great difficulties.‚Äù  A less calm statement ‚ÄúThe newspaper Argumenty and Facts, when talking about the problems of the economy, expecting Russia in the summer, noted that Vladimir Putin had turned out to be an asshole in life‚Äù.  Despite the fact that the statement is likely to be false, you will remember not only the affiliation of the former president of the country to a certain type of people, but also less vivid statements that are nearby. </blockquote>

      It should be noted that people who use false statements, together with this method of presenting information, and not mentioning that the statement is false, should be shot right away.  But how does everything said above relate to the internal filters mentioned in the first part?  Soon everything will become clear. <br><br>  The filter that collects information about everything related to cars is clear and simple, but only for men.  Most women who have set a goal to buy a car will not receive a filter.  There is not enough of a critical mass of knowledge, but since the information about the machines is quite popular, it will not make problems with it.  It will be enough to read a couple of magazines, watch a series of thematic programs or talk to a familiar man, so that the filter inside the filter starts to boil, absorbing and digesting information. <br><br>  Like a woman, a person who decides that wealth is something that he lacks should receive a critical amount of knowledge.  Since the television has not yet begun to broadcast talk show ‚ÄúHow to become rich‚Äù will have to climb for knowledge in the wilds of books. <br><br>  We go to the bookstore, see what we have to read: ‚ÄúMillion per week‚Äù (23 pages), ‚ÄúHow to find a brilliant idea in yourself‚Äù (50 pages).  These books write two types of writers.  Poor practices and rich theorists.  The man who earned a million does not know how he did it.  He is engaged in the substitution of concepts and assumptions.  Talking about morality and ethics, about children's complexes and the benefits of masturbation.  To form the minimum knowledge required for the filter, you will need to read 3-5 such books. <br><br><blockquote>  Thoughts on the topic.  Try not to read simplified brochures.  Do not read the book, in the title of which there is a phrase ‚Äúfor dummies‚Äù.  Teach yourself to read books for beginners.  If you yourself can not understand the basic set of functions of the program, then it is worth considering the choice of another profession. </blockquote><br><br>  And now strange advice for the lazy.  In the blogosphere of the Internet, there is competition for the right to be read.  But at the same time there is no popular good blog.  The most readable authors, among whom extremely rich people come across, compete in arrogance and appreciation, while not forgetting to mention their experiences and attitudes.  Why this form of filing information is successful, as mentioned above. <br><br>  A 100 page monotonous book written by a loser can do you less good than a single entry in a rich man‚Äôs cynical diary. <br><br>  It is worth noting again.  It is not necessary to read in order to increase your knowledge in the field of earning money, the obtained information in its pure form will not help you to become a millionaire.  Otherwise, each of us would have two or three very rich friends.  By absorbing the information mentioned above, your personal wealth filter is formed. <br><br><blockquote>  Thoughts on the topic.  I advise all designers and people who are about to start a business to read Lebedev's Followers.  Good luck to you and your filter. </blockquote><br><br>  Continuation does not follow ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25223/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25223/</a></p>
