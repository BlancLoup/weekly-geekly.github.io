      - Well ... I do not know.  Nothing, I guess. <br><br>  - Well, as you say.  I'm a little worried, to be honest - for the first time a programmer goes through this procedure ... <br><br>  - Well, you will not put an enema, Katyusha.  Do not worry, I will not eat you. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, I'm glad to hear that.‚Äù  So, a tradition has been accepted in our company two years ago - before an employee retires, we conduct an interview, according to the results of which we are writing detailed material on the corporate portal. <br><br>  - Yes, Katya, I know about this tradition.  It is interesting to read such materials.  True, it gives them some sugary and playfulness, as from the speeches of May 9, but still interesting.  You learn a lot about new colleagues you have worked with for decades. <br><br>  - That's why I worry - you have been working in our company for almost 40 years. <br><br>  - So you were not even born when I was already moving mountains of automation.  - Stanislav Sergeevich laughed a little tightly. <br><br>  - Well yes.  I don‚Äôt imagine, honestly, what it is to work 40 years in one company, in one position.  In general, what is 40 years, I can not imagine! <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  No, that's how it is.  Now it seems that it was so fast, so recently, and at the same time so long ago.  Ugh, somehow from this phrase gives mothballs ... <br><br>  - What gives?  Swearing some? <br><br>  - Oh, the difference of generations.  This is such a stinking garbage, it was previously kept in the closet so that the bugs did not eat the fur coat. <br><br>  - A, clear.  Okay.  Stanislav Sergeevich, I don‚Äôt want to take a lot of time from you - I know that the female part of our team organized a banquet in your honor - so if you don‚Äôt mind, let's begin? <br><br>  - Well I do not know.  Let's. <br><br>  - So, we open your case.  - Katya said with mock severity.  - you came to our company in the distant 2015, to the position of "1C Programmer".  Well, what is a programmer - I understand, and what is 1C?  Is this sort of discharge something, or category?  First Grade Programmer?  Or, as you say, the stack? <br><br>  - Well, yes, something like a stack.  There was such a platform, very popular.  It is still possible to find places where solutions based on it are spinning.  Almost everything worked for us then. <br><br>  - And then what happened?  Out of date? <br><br>  - Well ... The founders of the company, with age, ummm ... They retired, and everything rolled on an inclined plane.  The platform has ceased to develop, although it hasn‚Äôt been very special before ... Decisions have become clumsy, and the further, the worse.  The segmentation was narrowed, the Internet technologies in the platform did not develop, and by that time there was nothing without it.  Somehow like this. <br><br>  - Clear.  However, 15-20 years you worked on it? <br><br>  - Well, yes, something like this.  First developed, then supported what was.  Then, when it became completely unbearable, they left it. <br><br>  - And what was done on this platform?  What are the solutions? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Many things.  We then had a good team, interesting.  Almost everything in the company was automated.  Many solutions were made that were shown at conferences. <br><br>  - Ie  You, on behalf of our company, spoke at conferences, with stories about automation experiences? <br><br>  - I myself am not, the chief traveled.  He was our ideological inspirer, and he programmed himself, and encouraged us to this.  I also made some cool decisions then, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãintegration. <br><br>  - Why didn't you go to the conferences yourself? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Just did not go.  Somehow it was scary, and why, again ... <br><br>  - What do you mean why?!  At least to find out about you!  After all, if the platform is popular, and you make great decisions on it, it is very valuable for other employers!  Didn‚Äôt you think about that? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  I thought maybe.  But somehow it did not work out.  Although the guys offered to go, the same boss promised to help with the report.  I just made a report for the management once, on one of the technologies of interactive learning and accumulation of big data on UI. <br><br>  - I did not understand everything, okay ... And what, did this report help you? <br><br>  - And what about, Katya.  I was remembered, I spoke very well.  Then it helped me in my career when the head of programmers was required. <br><br>  - Oh, Stanislav Sergeevich, here I am a fool!  You worked as the head of the programmers, and I said that you were 40 years in the same position!  Please forgive me! <br><br>  - What are you, Katyusha, do not worry, I was not offended.  It has long been, and not for long, just a few years. <br><br>  - Oh, and here it is noted that you participated in the project of strategic development of the enterprise!  What role did you play, what did you do?  Terribly interesting! <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  If you look formally, then I was in the second role. <br><br>  - On the second?!  Those.  were you, roughly, deputy head of a strategic development project? <br><br>  - Well, yes, sometimes he really replaced him - he liked to dump in the middle of the day. <br><br>  - What did you do?  Automation? <br><br>  - Not.  Well, or more precisely, they were also engaged in automation, but for the most part they worked on optimizing business processes, organizing teams, working on strategic development indicators, increasing sales, improving supplies, working with production, and designing. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI ... I'm shocked.‚Äù  You are programmers!  How have you been entrusted with all this? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  They did not trust us, they entrusted the boss.  He made some documents there, proposals, he found the key idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtransformations, which the management and the owner really liked.  It seems to him and this project have made a big bet, well, and he pushed me into this project. <br><br>  - In the sense of push through?  As a friend? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Not as a friend, I was really interested in all this, and it worked.  Yet from our IT department we went, we were really cool back then, we seriously raised our efficiency, and I was there, I understood all the methods, the whole essence of this work, so he pushed me. <br><br>  - And what exactly did you do?  From the above. <br><br>  - Procurement and design development.  Then there was such a popular method - Scrum, increased the efficiency of teamwork.  So I introduced it in the design department, which developed new products. <br><br>  - And what, what were the successes? <br><br>  - Oh, this is an interesting story.  We then closed the project for a month, which they had been dragging like rubber for two years. <br><br>  - Incredibly, I'm just amazed at you ... And what did you do with the supply, Stanislav Sergeevich?  Also this scrum? <br><br>  - Nearly.  For the supply of clean Scrum did not fit, because of the unlimited planning horizon - this is not a project activity.  They invented a special method mixed with Scrum and controlling - it was more suitable for their work.  Well, I organized the team, it worked well.  There Tatiana worked as a boss, well, you do not know, she has been retired for a long time. <br><br>  - And the results were? <br><br>  - Of course.  Not so much had time to do, but the key task - filling the consignment stock - was fulfilled.  Although no one could perform it before us, there were always interruptions. <br><br>  - These are amazing results, Stanislav Sergeevich!  And ... - Katya hesitated a little, she felt a little uncomfortable because of her own hotness and haste - it was time to ask the next question.  - What happened next?  It seems that after such successes, you were prepared for the road to top management? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  There is a complicated political story.  The chief left, in general, from the company, and our entire project was somehow quickly covered ... Despite the results achieved. <br><br>  - How?!  Is that possible?  Didn't you try to develop this business?  After all, this is probably much more interesting than being just a programmer? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Although, what is there, I know, of course more interesting.  But, somehow, there, then, the new leadership, the chief programmers set me up, new tasks, a new round of automation ... Somehow it all ended by itself. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDamn, but I'm really sorry, even though this story happened many years ago ...‚Äù <br><br>  - Yes, I am sorry too, Kat ... To be honest, I then ... I don‚Äôt know ... And, okay, I‚Äôm going to retire ... I first felt important at work, necessary, or something ... To, you know, not in a computer poking around, do not poison jokes with admins, but do something real, useful‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - I ... I understand you ... You do not believe, but I really understand ... Damn, I'm breaking up now ... <br><br>  - Oh, how would I not let a tear go along the bearded cheek ... There was never such a thing, neither before nor after ... How wonderful a dream is remembered, like an oasis with palm trees and a lake in the middle of the desert ... can only steb over users and write govnokod, ensured the uninterrupted supply of key customers with spare parts.  And they helped to finish the project of developing a new product, which then brought the company a significant profit ... It's like a fairy tale, damn, about Cinderella ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand one thing, after all, how you could do it.‚Äù  This is a completely different, specific area.  How? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  As he said ... Tyry-Pyry-rastopyry.  The essence, it seems, was that for the organization of any activity it is not necessary to know its specifics, it is enough to understand the basic principles and something like the type of activity - streaming, design, or tact.  And then there are ready-made techniques that need to be adapted to reality, and everything will be scratched up.  By the way, I remembered, we and the motivation system did then, it‚Äôs your path ... <br><br>  - Stanislav Sergeevich, I will now go to the director and will demand that you be left in the company!  You are an incredible person!  How did you, as a programmer, make motivation systems ?! <br><br>  - Well ... They did it somehow.  This is just the simplest.  It is enough to determine what exactly a person needs to pay for so that it is both profitable for the company and motivates the employee for the results. <br><br>  - and all? <br><br>  - And that's it.  The rest is a matter of technology - to bring an indicator, or several, to automate and go ahead. <br><br>  - It sounds a bit trite - to withdraw, for what a person should pay ... Do not you think? <br><br>  - So in banality lies the very secrets of something.  Here is the designer, for example - they were paid a salary.  Who on salary will achieve results? <br><br>  - Well, this is understandable, no one will, the salary system is flawed by itself. <br><br>  - Yeah, we replaced their salary with a percentage of sales. <br><br>  - It's like that ... They are not sellers. <br><br>  - Not sellers, but they create products that are then sold.  If their result does not depend on the sale, then they will construct it endlessly. <br><br>  - And if you pay a percentage of sales, then they will be completely raw to give it to production, do you not? <br><br>  - No, what's the point?  If you make it raw, it will not be bought at least more than once.  We need a balance of time and quality, but the trick is that earlier this balance was attempted to be kept by the boss, and now the designer himself.  Themselves, the forward of the engine, ran to the production, watched how their parts are made, the technologists helped, the workers explained - if only to quickly all the shoals to settle and start mass production.  Well and, accordingly, they reacted very quickly to the claims - they contacted the designers of the buyers, their technical services, they settled all the questions, went on business trips to look at the work of the products on the spot.  But the main thing - all by yourself, without waiting for managers or kick in the ass.  They didn‚Äôt really need a boss either. <br><br>  - Yes ... And how did the personnel department react to such a system? <br><br>  - Perfectly.  Then they had Tanya as their boss ... Hmm, that‚Äôs a coincidence ... She‚Äôs carrying Taneƒçek ... She was delighted, said she never understood motivation systems as well as she did with us.  We took her to the team then. <br><br>  - I‚Äôm listening and I catch myself thinking that I‚Äôm no longer believing you, Stanislav Sergeevich.  Painfully beautiful, everything worked out for you.  How could it happen that after outstanding success you became just a programmer again? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  The bosses changed, sort of like they said at first that we would continue somehow, and then everything died down, after a couple of months ... <br><br>  - Didn't you try to insist, talk with the management, promote the project and, I apologize, yourself? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Somehow it was not before.  The new chief, new projects, thought later back ... Well, never returned.  Pancake‚Ä¶ <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - Yes, I, somehow, forgot about all this ... I do not know ... <br><br>  - Does it hurt to remember?  Sorry if negative emotions caused you, Stanislav Sergeevich, I really did not want to.  If you need something, you just ... <br><br>  - What, validol or what?  - Stanislav Sergeevich laughed.  - Do not be afraid, Katyusha, I do not drink and do not smoke, I do not complain about my health, the blow is not enough for me.  It‚Äôs just ... I don‚Äôt know ... As if it wasn‚Äôt all about me ... Damn ... <br><br>  - Ok, then I suggest changing the topic!  What is all about sad, but about sad!  It is written in your case that you were engaged ... now, if I read it correctly ... bitrix? <br><br>  - Well, bitrix.  Also an unfamiliar word? <br><br>  - Well, yes, to be honest, I did not hear.  Is this technology replacing 1C? <br><br>  - Nooo, this technology, buried together with 1C in a mass grave.  - Stanislav Sergeevich laughed.  - The company-developer belonged to 1C, and gradually became strongly attached to the "mother".  Well, and, respectively, connected by one chain ... <br><br>  - What does this mean?  Some kind of metaphor? <br><br>  - Damn, the difference of generations ... There was such a song.  In short, the bitrix did not survive.  We made a website on it and tried to build a task management system.  It seems also the strategic monitor, for management of the company, drew. <br><br>  - This, it turns out, is also some kind of platform? <br><br>  - Not really, rather a hack, a set of tools for php. <br><br>  - Oh, again a new word.  Also from the mass grave? <br><br>  - Nah, it's a fairy tale.  Unhappy php soon 60 years anniversary!  As he is still alive, I‚Äôm not going to let go of my mind ... Well, we haven‚Äôt been working on him for a long time, since the bitrix has turned down. <br><br>  - Ok, I understand.  Now the question is probably unpleasant, if something goes wrong, you immediately ... <br><br>  - Ask not to be afraid, Katyusha, I‚Äôm saying, Kondrati is not enough. <br><br>  - Good.  After this big strategic project you became the chief of programmers.  I personally find it very interesting - with your experience, your knowledge, confirmed results ... Why didn't you go further up the career ladder?  And in general, what did you do as a boss?  This one too ... Like him ... <br><br>  - Scrum. <br><br>  - That's right, Scrum implemented?  Or what did you do? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  Nothing much was done.  As they said ... "Sit, poking, hands and arms."  That's how they lived. <br><br>  - I can not understand, to be honest ... Just worked something, so it turns out?  Did you complete the tasks?  Projects, or what have you had? <br><br>  - Well yes.  There ... - Stanislav Sergeevich paused, looked up and, for some reason, looked at the ceiling for a long time.  Katya did not dare to break the silence, and did not find a more suitable occupation for herself than to stare out the window.  So they sat for a few minutes. <br><br>  - You will then edit everything, but since we have such a conversation, I immediately apologize ... Shit, we somehow engaged.  This is what they used to do in a week, they began to do it in six months.  What used to run and work, somehow got stuck, neither this nor that.  Then again the management changed, again the new course, again all projects were thrown up ... <br><br>  Katya was silent, staring with big eyes into a suddenly brute, bearded face that suddenly became such a lost, somehow childishly offended face.  She still did not dare to speak. <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.  How many times have I thought about it ... It seems there is no one to blame but myself ... And my hands were, and my head, and knowledge, and experience ... It was possible to build the best IT department, at these conferences, their mother, to drive ... I knew exactly then what should be done, and the guys were the same ... But ... Damn ... Igor was then reduced, but I did not defend ... <br><br>  Stanislav Sergeevich suddenly sobbed.  Katya, from surprise and awkwardness of the situation, began to blush, and was already ready to fail on the spot.  She had to be a vest for tears before, but so that the old, experienced, bearded programmer ... With all due respect to him, and to her shame, Katya strengthened with the desire to complete this meeting as quickly as possible. <br><br>  Stanislav Sergeevich, however, quickly pulled himself together, rubbed his eyes with his fists and smiled encouragingly. <br><br>  - Okay, Katya, forget it.  What was, then passed.  Let's move to completion. <br><br>  - Well, I agree.  I have the last question from unpleasant, let's not foreplay.  How did it happen that you lost the position of chief of programmers? <br><br>  - Well, everything is simple.  The fact that soon new technologies will be needed for work was clear to all.  And everyone began to study them, even the experienced 1Sniki.  And I somehow got away, for which I paid. <br><br>  - And how, why?  With your outlook, experience, knowledge ... <br><br>  - Well I do not know.  Frankly speaking, I waited for a very long time that I would decide and begin to be a real manager, build a career in this direction, apply all the knowledge that I once received. <br><br>  - And why not? <br><br>  - Well I do not know.  It seemed that the moment was inappropriate, that we had to finish the project, or wait for the end of the year, or learn a little, or read a book. <br><br>  - So if you have experience already ... <br><br>  - Yes, I know, I know, Kat, you can not speak already about this experience, be he wrong ... I am an asshole, that's the answer.  How was an asshole, and remained.  I've missed it, until there are no people left in the company, which can confirm my experience.  A fairy tale left alone, that was once the Great Project, and Stanislav Sergeyevich Borodaty took part in it. <br><br>  - Why are you so yourself, Stanislav Sergeevich.  If I am you so from myself ... <br><br>  - No, you are, Katyusha.  It's easier for me, believe me.  I have been trying to answer this question all my life, and even in my heart I somehow avoided harsh language, it all seemed like there was time ahead, that ... I don't know ... <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - How to explain to you ... It always seemed that there is a person in the world who answers for me or something ... Well, that I don‚Äôt have to decide everything myself, that you can still make a mess, another day, another week, a year.  What will come, he will prompt, give the answer, or direction, or kick in the ass. <br><br>  - What kind of person is this? <br><br>  - Well ... I do not know.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Infantilism is probably some kind of ... Refusal to take responsibility for their own destiny, naivety ... As you wish, name it. I never believed that everything was so, somehow, that life goes on without thinking about me ... Damn, how can I explain it ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- It seems, I understand ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, you do not understand, I know for sure, I remember this age ... And I can not explain. And if I can, then you will not understand. Okay, let's move on. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Oh, well, as you say. Further here about javascript is written. Also technology?</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After reading the next line in the case, Katya looked up in anticipation of an answer, but Stanislav Sergeevich was silent. His eyes, not seeing, looked out of the window, as if immersed in a contradictory inner screen of thoughts. Katya again did not dare to break the silence, and with mock thoughtfulness stared at her manicure. Damn it, this old man was already beginning to annoy her. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Ja-va-script. - By syllables, lingering, thoughtfully muttered Stanislav Sergeevich. - This is a programming language, which was then the most popular. We made a new information system on it, using the freymork ... how is it ... Damn, what's the difference ... In short, Katya, write further, which was programmed in javascript, lived merrily and well, automated the whole company, what we are immensely proud of and remember in a chair by the fireplace.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Uh ... Well, I'll write. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- No, well, not so straightforward, you know how beautifully, you can turn around there, patterns, mention a couple of projects, they are all there, I got bonuses for them. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Yes, yes, of course. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- All, let's probably round it up, I‚Äôm really waiting for the female team with a banquet. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Excuse me, if something is wrong, so what am I, then, uncovered before you, like an old marazmatic ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Why, you're all right! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I understand everything ... </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- You see ... Yes, of course, you understand, I‚Äôm not your first! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, all then? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Wait, the last, traditional question: what are you planning to do in retirement? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Well I do not know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I really don't know. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I will go to the sea!</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358072/</a></p>
