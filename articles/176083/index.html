  <section class="page js-page"><h1>People began to move to Yukoz</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Previously announced the relocation of Yandex.Narod sites on the uCoz platform.  The process of moving was planned in stages.  And today it began.  Today, DNS servers for People 1 sites, that is, sites created in the workshop, and not in the site builder, have moved and switched.  All of these sites now run on Ucoz servers.  Previously sent warning letters of this content: <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou received this letter because you own the site created in the Workshop on narod.yandex.ru.  We want to warn you that from 5 to 8 April your site will be unavailable for editing due to the move from the Workshop to the uCoz service.  You can continue to work with him already on the new site.  Entry to the interface for editing will remain in the same place - on narod.yandex.ru.  Moving will not interfere with the operation of your site.  It will be available to visitors as usual, the address and content of the site will be saved.  You also will have new modern tools for the development of its resource.  If you don‚Äôt like something, you can pick up your site from uCoz and move it to another site. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And today, Ucoz is appealing to prudence: ‚ÄúI really want to ask everyone to remain calm and understanding.  Only calmly and in the case will be able to solve any problem, imaginary or real.  For our part, we will show all possible professionalism and responsibility.  Our support specialists, developers and system administrators are ready to stay awake and help all users of sites that have moved.  In return, we would very much like our users to behave correctly, not to panic.  And if there are questions, they are clearly formulated, do not forget to indicate the addresses of the sites and read that they are answered, and ideally - the answers to similar questions, if any, have already been. ‚Äù <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/942/bc6/4a4/942bc64a4914ffb205cfa1b47260127d.gif" alt="image">  It is clear that many owners of popular sites will be in a state of shock.  Ucoz has prepared a <a href="http://faq.ucoz.ru/faq/34-1">page</a> with frequent questions that may arise when moving.  The procedure of moving itself: after logging in to your account on Yandex, you receive a message that can be seen in the picture on the left.  Having agreed to move (and you have nowhere to go) you will receive a message: ‚ÄúThe Authorization application in the control panel of the site requests access to your data on Yandex: Date of birth, Username, Name, gender, E-mail address.‚Äù You will have to agree again.  To continue, you must agree to the user agreement.  You can also: download a backup (site archive), or refuse to use the service.

A link to the archive will come to your inbox soon. ‚ÄùWell, at least you can download the backup.  Site after moving in adequate condition.  No visible changes, only the logo has changed (favicon).  Those who stayed on the People and are not at all familiar with the technologies of Yukoz will have to get used to and master a new platform if they need to edit the site.  But this can be done calmly and then.  And our advice is this: create a new website on Yukoz (it's free) and practice there to not accidentally destroy the popular website dear to your heart.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that a direct link to the people has disappeared and you can get to your site at the link above: narod.yandex.ru.  It remains to be patient and it is better to wait a bit until after the start of the move everything settles.  In the meantime, you can speculate on such a question: "Why is the people of Yandex not profitable, and Yukoz profitable?".  It must be said that in all this history with the move, the fact that Yandex did not abandon folk websites to its fate is encouraging, and one can hope that Yukoz will do the same with their sites in the future, if something suddenly happens. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176083/</a></p>
