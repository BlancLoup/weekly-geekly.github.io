Of course, Facebook is the leader in this industry. Experts predict that by 2012 more than 78% of companies will spend a lot of money on advertising and promotion on Facebook, thus it is not difficult to predict that the facebook platform is becoming the main tool for a successful business. <br><br>  We all know that Facebook is quite a young network, so there are updates almost every week, such changes do not always please marketers or developers.  They always have to search through a bunch of information resources in search of optimal business strategies with new updates on Facebook.  There are blogs and Facebook marketing forums on the Internet, and dozens of developers are developing new business applications for Facebook every day, but this whole stream of information risks passing by people who may need it. <br><br>  Unlike Facebook, Twitter has such information resources <a href="http://business.twitter.com/">Twitter for Business</a> and <a href="http://oneforty.com/">OneForty</a> where the user can find out in one place about new applications or tools, without spending a lot of time searching for information.

      It seemed strange to us that the Social Network No1 did not have such a center for business where entrepreneurs could find in one place everything they needed for successful Facebook marketing.  Therefore, we decided to take the initiative and create such a resource.  <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/">Fbbusiness</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For this, we have selected, in our opinion, an ideal domain that will reflect the main essence of the project.  We have divided the site into several sections so that everyone can find what he is looking for. <br><br>  For example, in the <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/mindmap/">Mindmap</a> section <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/mindmap/">,</a> we have collected and will collect all the most useful articles, instructions, tips, video tutorials on Facebook marketing using mental maps.  Every day we monitor blogs and resources of the best Facebook experts, choose the most useful and update our map.  In the future, we ourselves plan to make our own instructions and screencasts, but at the moment we do not have enough resources for this. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d8/e60/732/2d8e6073281d514f00a40e0fe6659b1a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/jobs/">Projects</a> section, businesses can find facebook developers for their projects or developers can find projects for themselves. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c6/a47/85b/5c6a4785b7039f5e3f1fee914436005d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/discussions/">Discussions</a> section, we hope that all businesses will solve certain problems in working with facebook, develop strategies or simply share their successes, discuss new updates on Facebook and so on. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/105/48c/76b/10548c76bbfc2a4597c0e6bc578fe43a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, the most important section is the <a href="http://fbbusiness.com/custom-post-types-landing-page/%3Flanding_page%3Dapp">Marketplace</a> here, we will daily update the list of all business applications, plug-ins, scripts, tools and templates for facebook pages.  In general, all that you need for successful marketing on Facebook you can find with us. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c5/3fe/5ca/9c53fe5ca906be1c65b5d61096c2d3d9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you probably have already noticed that the resource is more focused on the English-speaking audience, and probably you have wondered why all this is on a habr?  There are several reasons for this: After we had gone through several startup resources, for example <a href="http://www.killerstartups.com/Social-Networking/fbbusiness-com-business-apps-for-facebook">KillerStartups,</a> we received hundreds of reviews and all were positive, everyone agrees that such a resource is needed and that we would not stop.  But unfortunately (and perhaps fortunately :)) we did not receive any criticism, although we ourselves know that we have many shortcomings and a lot more to do, but we would like the habrosociety to appreciate us, your opinion is very important to us perhaps you will have any ideas or development tips, maybe something is missing for you. <br><br>  Secondly, we want to invite developers of business applications for Facebook, scripts, plug-ins, as well as designers who may want to make and sell templates for fan pages through our resource.  Also, maybe we will be interested in investors, we still have some ideas on development and functionality, and for this we may need a little more money (although we can do without investments since we started running for a month but raised good money) <br><br>  In general, we are waiting for your comments and comments on our resource and are thankful in advance for your time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118365/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118365/</a></p>
