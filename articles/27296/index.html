    <a name="habracut"></a>  Trains write about the indescribable sensations of a silent, evenest non-decreasing acceleration after touching the gas.  And about the indispensable disgrace waiting for any lumbering Ferrari or Porsche, who made a mistake, stopping next to Tesla at a traffic light. <br><br>  Motor efficiency on average 90%.  For comparison, internal combustion engines have an efficiency of about 20%.  It is also cool: during braking, kinetic energy is not wasted, but a generator is started, which, braking the machine, generates energy and saves it for the future. <br><br>  The local ruler, Arnold Schwarzenegger, was one of the first customers.  But the very first copy received Elon Musk.  He invested the first $ 7.5M into this company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81b/e46/b04/81be46b04fec22a89a25255e5a863346.jpg" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10" alt="Elon Musk" title="Elon musk"><br>  Elon Musk is best known as one of the cheerful founders of <strong>PayPal</strong> .  He has a wife, 3 dogs and 5 sons younger than 4 years old, he was born from a South African father and a Canadian mother and grew up in South Africa.  I bought the first computer at 10, at 12 I wrote and sold the first commercial program - the space toy Blaster.  At the age of 17 he left his parents to avoid compulsory military service and participation in the suppression of local blacks.  He made his way to the USA, barely scraped up $ 1 a day, received a grant to study at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.  Received degrees in economics and physics.  I studied for exactly two days at Stanford, after which I left to create an office for writing web-based software for news organizations. <br><br>  He is currently working as chairman of the board of directors at Tesla Motors and SolarCity, while the main work is the executive and technical director of the space transport company SpaceX. <br><br>  He writes a blog at teslamotors.com.  Fasting of August 2, 2006, <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog1/index.php%3Fp%3D8%26js_enabled%3D1">The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)</a> : <br>  "... Tesla's strategy is to enter the high end market [with the Roadster], where buyers are willing to pay a lot and then go down the market as quickly as possible <br>  ... The second model [code name: White Star, scheduled for 2009] will be a four-door sports and family car at about half the price of $ 89k for the Tesla Roadster, and the third model will be even more affordable. <br>  ... we will offer modest-sized and priced solar panels from SolarCity, a photovoltaic company (where I am also the main financier).  This system can be installed on the roof of your house in an inconspicuous place due to its small size, or as a carport for a car and will generate about 50 miles of electricity per day. <br>  If you travel less than 350 miles a week, <strong>you will be in the "energy plus"</strong> with regard to your transportation. " <br><br>  source: <a href="http://ata2.livejournal.com/13116.html">ata2.livejournal.com/13116.html</a> <br><br>  UPDATE: <br><br>  Thank you all for the interesting comments.  I learned a lot of new things.  I want to clarify a couple of questions that have arisen more than once in the comments. <br><br>  1. The latest version of the transmission 1.5 is really only one gear.  See the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog4/%3Fp%3D67">blog post of the</a> main techie Tesla Motors. <br><br>  2. The latest version is really more than 300 horsepower.  See <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog3/%3Fp%3D76">this</a> old blog post where the comment "... It is interesting that only the European version has a power of 300+ hp, while the option for the USA remains with 247 hp"  was the answer "We need to update the site - all cars will be with 300+ hp ..." <br><br>  Those.  just as usual, the documentation lags behind the real possibilities :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27296/</a></p>
