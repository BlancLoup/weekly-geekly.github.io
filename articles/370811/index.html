So confidently that they are already considered ‚Äúclassics‚Äù: they are recognized and respected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03c/b24/17b/03cb2417bbb11331f6f3c2aabd25f834.jpg"><br><br>  Headsets are reissued regularly: now the wire is better, then the remote control with volume control, then another little thing - in the Cloud gadget line is no longer to be considered.  And it became one more.  So, on the one hand, the novelty can be safely considered as a logical development of conventional Cloud.  Or as an "improved" version of the simple version of Core - this is how to look.  Here we are now and see ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  Everything is clear at a glance: no inventions of bicycles, the overall style has not changed a bit.  According to the style, Cloud Silver is closest to the "Xs", but the name says more about color palette than anything else.  Logos are printed in gray on the headband and completely embroidered with black.  Strictly and carefully.

      Everything else is so familiar and familiar to you that you don‚Äôt want to spend much time on this: metal guides on the speaker cases create a strong but flexible structure.  Adjustment on the vertical axis - there is, on a horizontal cup suspended on a conventional hinge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d17/f6a/fb1/d17f6afb1dfff6d3e9b17fa218236b51.jpg"><br><br>  The one-piece headband with imitation leather lining on the outside and the memory foam inside has not changed either.  The speaker cases themselves are made of soft-touch-coated plastic, the color is traditionally black, like most of the colleagues.  And yes, like all this most, the black soft-touch will collect dust and fingerprints - a tribute, so to speak, to the traditions of the ancestors. <br><br>  The weight of the headset is still the same 320 with a small gram: there will be no discomfort from such ‚Äúears‚Äù, even with prolonged use.  The lack of adjustment in the longitudinal plane is compensated by the flexibility of the metal fasteners.  The springing effect and the twisting force are perfectly matched: they hold onto the head well and do not squeeze the eyes out of the skull. <br><br>  Classic (almost any aspect of the headset can say the word here), soft ear cushions made of breathable leatherette filled with polyurethane foam, endowed with the ability to ‚Äúremember‚Äù the shape of the head, only contribute to that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca7/6b8/6ba/ca76b86ba6679610dfd5986055e0616e.jpg"><br><br>  The microphone, like the rest of the representatives of the Cloud line, is removable.  I want to listen to music and not to attract attention - easier than ever: they took off the microphone, picked up the 4-pin cable to the smartphone or player and was done.  Fortunately, the model still sounds worthy. <br>  Connection type - standard for HyperX headsets.  The cable in the fabric braid is a little more than a meter long, which ends with a 3.5 mm four-pin jack, on it is the simplest remote control with a mechanical volume control in the shape of a wheel and a microphone off button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16b/dd8/5d4/16bdd85d427cdf75121fabe8352a0e4a.jpg"><br><br>  The complete two-meter extension cable is equipped with a split tip with the same conventional 3.5 mm jacks - you need to connect to a PC with separate inputs - please.  A laptop with combined into one "telephone" multi-contact is similar. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Equipment</font> </h2><br>  Grade, what is called, Spartan.  The headphones themselves, an extension cable, a microphone, and a mesh case for carrying and storing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4bc/0a8/bed/4bc0a8bed31968e8115adbd6440e0482.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Characteristics and sensations</font> </h2><br>  Well, what can we say about the next "Cloud"?  "Five hours, normal flight?".  As usual - no unpleasant sensations like squeezing of the head, flattened ears and other discomfort, great sound, the ears do not sweat. <br><br>  Voice communication at a height: the electret condenser microphone has always been a feature of the series.  The narrowly focused sensitive element implements passive noise cancellation, it recognizes well even a quiet voice in the evening silence. <br><br><h4>  Headphone specifications: </h4><br>  <b>Speaker:</b> Dynamic (53 mm) with neodymium magnets; <br>  <b>Type:</b> covering, closed type; <br>  <b>Frequency response:</b> 15‚Äì25000 Hz; <br>  <b>Resistance:</b> 60 Œ©; <br>  <b>Sound pressure level:</b> 98 dB / mW at 1 kHz; <br>  <b>Nonlinear distortion factor:</b> &lt;2%; <br>  <b>Input Power:</b> <br>  Nominal - 30 mW; <br>  Maximum - 500 mW; <br>  <b>Weight:</b> <br>  Headphones - 309 grams; <br>  Microphone - 13 grams; <br>  <b>Cable:</b> fabric braid <br>  The length of the fixed part - 1.2 meters; <br>  Extension cord - 2 meters; <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> <br>  Headset - four-pin 3.5 mm minijack; <br>  Extension cable - two three-pin 3.5 mm minijack (headphones and microphone). <br><br><h4>  Microphone specifications: </h4><br>  <b>Sensitive element:</b> electret, condenser microphone; <br>  <b>Pattern:</b> narrowly targeted, with noise reduction; <br>  <b>Frequency response:</b> 50‚Äì18000 Hz; <br>  <b>Sensitivity:</b> -39dBV. <br><br>  A number of certificates received from TeamSpeak, Discord speaks separately about the quality of voice communication.  Unlike the older brother (CloudX), this Microsoft headset was not ‚Äúofficial‚Äù.  But there are no technical differences!  That means Cloud Silver also works just fine with the Xbox One and One S, and with other consoles: the PlayStation 4 and even the Nintendo Switch.  Connectors are standard everywhere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/383/d45/743/383d45743d71a5d77516de6ea088ca6f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Sound</font> </h2><br>  All gadgets from the HyperX Cloud line have always been on the verge of games and music.  For the ‚Äútournament‚Äù headset, they lack the precise definition of the direction of sound, and the official positioning does not make a purely musical option.  Deciding exactly how to use your favorite piece of iron is, of course, the user.  The manufacturer only offers options.  It is necessary for the games - microphone, headset, hooked up, phoned the team - and into battle.  I want to sing and dance - there is a wire for mobile phones and players, plug in and enjoy the music. <br><br>  In game use everything is almost perfect.  The general direction of the sound is captured, voice communication at a height, special effects delight the voluminous bottoms.  And what else does an ordinary gamer need for happiness?  Look at the market and make sure that real competitors - one, two, and obchelsya?  And to find something similar, with a normal microphone, and with a noise (albeit passively implemented) is altogether difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/338/a96/adf/338a96adfd8eba623124c7a025361d98.jpg"><br><br>  With music, everything is great too.  The default setting is neutral, somewhat flat - but it‚Äôs better.  It is always possible to adjust slightly for yourself with an equalizer, but some kind of ‚Äúblockage‚Äù in the frequency response is not always possible, without detriment to quality, to pull it where it should be. <br><br>  The overall sound is quite soft: rock, jazz and classic can be listened "as is" from the box.  For genres, more ... outstanding in terms of characteristic sounds are to raise the tops and bottoms.  And then the metal will sound like it is necessary, and hard rock will sing, and basovitye negros will normally chant intoned about the difficult life of a gangster. <br><br>  And if you are not an aesthetic music lover (who, incidentally, is unlikely to use a gaming headset as an everyday one) and not a fan of extremely heavy styles, the sound from Cloud Silver will definitely not disappoint you.  The only thing I would like to emphasize is that the headset is selectively demanding on the power of the audio source.  Input resistance, after all, 60 ohms - modern flagships cope with this without problems, but any consumer goods from aliexpress and low-cost laptops can produce a volume below the desired level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8000c">Another cloud</font> </h2><br>  The headset has a very rich pedigree.  From the very beginning of this "game" line, both users and reviewers have noted a good, in general, sound quality and a balanced approach.  In this reincarnation, the headset has a strict design and a reasonable ratio of price, equipment and characteristics.  Well, everything that you are accustomed to (high-quality assembly, strict lines and neutral design) did not go anywhere.  Nice to use, and even nicer to get as a gift. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a0/7c9/1ec/4a07c91ec44e4676d0b290fcf211d292.jpg"><br><br>  The headset is sold exclusively in the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekSilver">DNS at a price of 6,499 rubles</a> .  Compared to Cloud Core, you get a volume control panel, carrying case and strict color scheme for just 6,499 ever-wood surcharges, and from the much more ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù version of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278990/">HyperX Cloud-X</a> you are equipped with ‚Äúwinter‚Äù velor ear cushions and a hard case. <br><br>  And until the end of September in the DNS there is a <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekAlloyDNSSeptember">discount</a> of 1000 rubles for the HyperX Alloy FPS keyboard.  And yes, do not forget to subscribe to our blog, what if suddenly and on fast SSD discounts will be delivered?  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370811/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370811/</a></p>
