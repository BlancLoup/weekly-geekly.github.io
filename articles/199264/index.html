But comments on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/199024">this article</a> ... In order to <s>bury myself even a little deeper to</s> dispel stereotypes about the Uzbek programmer, I decided to write about our life. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Programmers in Uzbekistan </h4><br>  We try to sit still. <br><br>  IT is not enough here.  90% are concentrated in Tashkent, the rest of the regions working in the industrial sector, or freelancers.

      Here, as in other countries, there is a shortage of personnel.  If programmers can still solve the problem of poaching or learning, then with QA and PM it is a disaster.  Few people see value in them, and we and our team have not been able to find an intelligent QA for half a year. <br><br>  Recently <a href="http://www.gazeta.uz/2013/09/20/software/">a decree was issued on stimulating the IT market</a> , programmers were exempted from paying taxes.  But I treat this news with caution (a lot of ideas and no good ideas came up with ideas for this). <br><br>  When I worked in a branch of a Russian company, it was my responsibility to conduct interviews with programmers.  At the end of my career I looked at the list of candidates who passed through me.  They turned out to be over 30. And this is over 2 years of work.  I can say honestly, there was not a single Senior'a among them, everything was mostly ‚Äúaverage‚Äù and below.  I was interested precisely in the leading developers, who the hell would be lifted from their seats, which would bring new knowledge and experience to our company.  Not to say that there are no tough specialists here, I invited them to my place, I introduced them to our director, but they could not agree on the salary.  The authorities did not hear my ‚Äúplea‚Äù and I went to the Americans (in Tashkent) - to the team of my dreams (Senior FullStack, Senior Back-End, Front-End Ninja and UX). <br><br>  Basically, all local offices feed on outsourcing.  There are government agencies involved in the modernization of state structures.  Branches of large IT companies units.  Programmers here, as in one boiler - many know each other, or heard.  The probability of meeting a friend to a colleague, when switching to another company, is 80%.  Freelance is popular. <br><br><h4>  Ravshan and Dzhamshuty </h4><br>  My team and I love to make fun in the style of ‚ÄúKnopaschke pressed, spineramana pashchel-pashchel, if-if, shaitanman, <s>busy</s> loading!‚Äù.  They are, but they are very far from IT.  People from villages (village) speak Russian badly.  It is them that you see on your streets, it is they who go to work.  And you will not even notice us, you will not even guess that we have something in common with that person with a broom.  In big cities, everyone knows Russian. <br><br>  In general, if we talk about the national composition, then among the IT people, the majority are Russians, Ukrainians, Tatars, Bashkirs, Jews and Russianized Uzbeks.  In my story there was only one person who does not know Russian.  We communicated with him in Uzbek.  He did not pass, because he did not know the basic things in his specialty (and the authorities could not figure out how to communicate with him (the authorities from Moscow)). <br><br>  Some fear that the comments in the code will be in Tajik and Uzbek.  Rave.  We would have laughed if we would have met such a comment.  Everywhere (which I know), the standard is English and Russian.  I can‚Äôt answer for everyone, because there is another ‚Äúleague‚Äù, about which it is better to be silent, because ‚Äúus‚Äù still has access to the habr without a proxy. <br><br><h4>  Have come </h4><br>  Many are leaving.  To Moscow - for money, to St. Petersburg - for brains.  The most talented people left for Peter.  But basically everyone is trying to dump in the United States and Canada.  This year, several of my friends left (Israel, California, Ireland).  The following year, several more people gather (Ukraine, New Zealand).  No one wants to go to Russia from my team, but they consider this option as a spare or transit point to Europe.  Remain mainly family people, indigenous people or who loved this country for sunny days.  Uzbeks generally do not take long to leave the family.  And believe me, being far away from their homeland is not at all high.  People here are tolerant (on their own or not), for insulting them on national grounds ‚Äî they are imprisoned.  Now in Tashkent they even imprison a favorite Tashkent word insulting visitors from the regions. <br><br><h4>  Self esteem </h4><br>  The fact that our programmers in Russia will work for 20k is nonsense.  Everyone understands that different regions have different living expenses.  For example, my classmate went to St. Petersburg, works in a company known to each of you.  I would be funny if he agreed to a salary of less than 100,000 rubles. <br><br>  By the way, 20k in Uzbekistan is a good salary for which to really live. <br><br><h4>  Costs </h4><br>  I live alone, renting a one-room apartment in a good area.  I get to work about 15 minutes by bus, or 30-40 minutes on foot.  Vegetables, fruits are cheap.  I‚Äôm giving up my approximate expenses per month: <br><br>  Rental housing (incl. Services) - 6,000r. <br>  Food - 4,000r. <br>  Transportation - 400r. <br>  Training device - 200r. <br>  Pool - 1000r <br><br>  6,000 for a one-room apartment is considered expensive in the area, even though there is everything in the apartment.  On average, such an apartment will cost 4500. There are still additional costs - among IT people there are many extreme lovers, and we often go to the mountains (70 km from Tashkent).  Summer Mountain Bike (DH), Charvak (reservoir among the mountains), paragliders, trips.  In winter, every weekend we go skiing (Chimgan, Beldersay).  Over the weekend, this costs us an average of 2,000 rubles, multiplying by 4 -&gt; 8,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  I think, in vain, you all were so scared for your salaries and for your programmers.  My opinion to this program - no one will go.  There is a program for the resettlement of compatriots, more often it is used by those who find it difficult to adapt in a new country.  Our programmers will never be lost anywhere.  If we want to leave - we will leave ourselves, without the help of others. <br><br>  We have many brainy developers who are in great demand, who have already been taken away, who are still being hunted from other countries.  There are Krivorukov developers.  There are shabby ones who break prices for ridiculous experience and knowledge.  And as one of the Habr participants said in the comments to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/199024">this news</a> : ‚ÄúThey differed from the native St. Petersburg people only by their appearance‚Äù.  Apparently, it's in tan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199264/</a></p>
