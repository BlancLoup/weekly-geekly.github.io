About limitation says a period of about 2.5 years, during which I put the idea into practice, about the spontaneity of the number of letters and interviews.  In total, about ten letters were written, and an invitation for an interview was received twice. <br><br>  So, let's start in the prescribed manner (due to the age of events, some facts may be inaccurate).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Summer 2006</b> , went to <a href="http://company.yandex.ru/inside/job/">http://company.yandex.ru/inside/job/</a> chose a vacancy from the ‚Äúsystem administrator‚Äù group, answered questions, sent a resume.  In response, silence.  In general, it is not surprising why a company with a serious profile needs a graduate student (5 course), with little experience.  What ever happens, everything happens. <br><br>  <b>February 2007</b> , went to <a href="http://company.yandex.ru/inside/job/">http://company.yandex.ru/inside/job/</a> chose a vacancy from the ‚Äúsystem administrator‚Äù group, answered questions, sent a resume.  Reply to the letter - ticket.  It is already nice that the vacancy will not be lost and someone will look at the resume. <br><br>  After a couple of days call on the cell, an invitation for an interview in the office on a scooter.  Everything is like on the <a href="">map</a> : metro, minibus, office.  The office is really struck by its scope and some originality.  Those interested can rate the office format in the article <a href="http://ya-excursion.narod.ru/">‚ÄúExcursion to Yandex‚Äù</a> , in general, the photos are completely consistent with what they see.  This is the first thing that was found in a search engine for this topic, because you know that day I was clearly not in the mood for photographs. <br><br>  The meeting was held with the head of the department and the head of the group in the classical style: the question is the answer.  Sometimes an answer was taken to solve a problem or an approach.  Not everywhere do we have clusters of 50 cars each in Russia. <br><br>  Talked 2 hours.  At an impasse raised the question of salary, somehow did not think about it.  He walked for the sole purpose - to try his hand.  Parted. <br><br>  Two days later the letter: <br><blockquote>  "Hello, <br>  Thank you for your interest in our company and time. <br>  spent on an interview with representatives of Yandex. <br>  We thoroughly evaluated the results of our negotiations, <br>  and, despite the fact that you possess some <br>  our knowledge and experience, at the moment we are not ready to do <br>  You job offer.  However, if you do not mind <br>  We will be happy to consider your candidacy for future vacancies. <br>  in our company. " <br></blockquote><br>  What ever happens, everything happens, but they themselves are to blame for what they wrote about the future. <br><br>  <b>Summer 2008 (Moscow)</b> . <br>  Due to the fact that at one time managed to exchange e-mail directly with the head of the administration department, wrote directly to her.  The answer in the form of filling out a questionnaire on their website did not suit me, and I suggested sending the answers (and my thoughts) to all vacancies in the System Administration group.  And here the most interesting begins.  Two years later on the site all the same questions. <br><br>  Our valiant system administrators are still: <br>  1) Install FreeBSD on 50 machines at once; <br>  2) Upgrade kernels and packages on 10 or more machines at once; <br>  3) Copy the server on the fly; <br>  4) And they certainly work with RAID arrays. <br>  etc.  etc. <br><br>  Sarcasm, sarcasm, but of all the new issues there was a maximum of 5. i.  In fact, you can safely send last year's resume and go for an interview?  Although if you connect your head and the Internet, you can find answers, for example in this <a href="http://duki-log.blogspot.com/2007/11/google-os.html">blog</a> , and then go for an interview. <br><br>  The last option is clearly cheating by the candidate, and I think the answers to some questions are not correct, but the fact remains. <br><br>  The deed is done: summaries and answers to the questions have been sent, an invitation for an interview has been received.  A letter came: "The meeting will take place with Tatyana ... (Head of the administration department) and Anatoly ... (Head of the group)." Ba ... All the same people.  It's nice to meet old friends a year later.  But they probably don't remember me anymore. <br><br>  For the year, the team leader has grown significantly, because  There were many questions, on business and the most pleasant they were interesting.  Moreover, in contrast to the first interview, it is clearly remote from those that were in the test tasks.  Apparently not only did I have the impression that the solution of many of the questions posed for a long time is some kind of clever documentation inside Yandex. <br><br>  After two hours of conversation, it seemed that I could at least expect another interview, and at most a job.  However, after 2 days, the same is already familiar negative response. <br><br>  So, the general results: <br><br>  1) As stated above, it is necessary to go to the interview.  Of all the places where I was: Yandex, Rambler, KAV and Svyaznoy, Yandex liked the most: the office, the approach to the candidates, the team. <br><br>  2) All the minor information about many large companies can and should be found on the Internet.  Even the salary in Yandex is not a secret.  Try, for example, to break through the mailbox of the personnel manager, who will invite you for an interview.  The rest is a matter of technology, I found at least two blogs, which describe in detail the procedure for applying for a job in the same Yandex. <br><br>  3) Colleagues from Yandex (I know you are reading Habr, there are many of you here) ask for pzhl.  guide change questions on the site, because soon the summer of 2009, you know.  :) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46571/</a></p>
