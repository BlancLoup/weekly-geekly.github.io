However, it turns out that this postulate is hopelessly outdated. <br><br>  Sleep in the workplace improves performance, American scientists have found.  In the US, the practice of short siesta during working hours has already become popular in many corporations.  However, not all chiefs rejoice at the prospect that employees will doze off at work. <br><br>  Now sleep lovers have arguments in their defense. <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúIf you have a nap in the workplace, and you are caught by the boss, feel free to be embarrassed.  Just explain to him that you are sharpening your mental abilities and increasing your efficiency, ‚Äùwrites The Daily Mail (full text on the website <a href="http://www.inopressa.ru/">www.Inopressa.ru</a> ).

      The evidence was provided by scientists who for the first time were able to establish that a short nap during the day strengthens the memory and facilitates the recollection of important facts.  Professor Matthew Tucker, who led a team of researchers, acknowledged that this idea often encounters resistance.  ‚ÄúThe time given to a short day‚Äôs sleep is considered counterproductive in an atmosphere that requires mental acuity and significant memory work,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  He and his colleagues from the sleep lab at New York University decided to prove that this was not the case.  They considered the effect of a short dream on the process of recalling facts.  The study was conducted on students.  During the experiment, volunteers were asked to memorize pairs of words, for example, ‚Äúclock - hands‚Äù.  They also tested the ability of students to memorize actions - they were asked to accurately track the mirror image of a complex pattern.  Then half of the group was closed in a soundproof room.  Although they were allowed to sleep for about an hour, on average, it took about 47 minutes to sleep. <br><br>  While they were dozing, another group was relaxing reading magazines and watching movies.  6 hours after the start of the experiment, both groups of volunteers were tested again.  Although both groups showed equally good results in mirror images, those who had a siesta showed better results in memory tests compared to those who were awake during the day.  Those who took a nap remembered 15% more pairs of words. <br><br>  Researchers believe that the first phase of sleep, when we do not dream, takes one and a half to two hours after falling asleep and can play a decisive role in the process of remembering the facts.  At this time, there is just the state that is required for ‚Äústoring‚Äù the facts so that they can then easily be retrieved from memory.  However, if you sleep longer and go to the sleep phase, accompanied by dreams, the effect of the previous stage can be reduced to zero. <br><br>  Nevertheless, scientists warn that, although a short siesta can help recall facts during the day, it is unclear how long this effect is for long-term memory. <br><br>  Among the famous siesta lovers - Sir Winston Churchill, who regularly resorted to an afternoon nap, after which he took a bath.  He did not violate the ritual even during the Second World War.  With a 20-minute sleep, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher prepared herself for a weekly meeting with parliamentarians. <br><br>  <a href="http://superstyle.ru/">superstyle.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8841/</a></p>
