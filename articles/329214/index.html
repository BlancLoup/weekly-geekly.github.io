  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Korean colleagues: understand and forgive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  I work as a simple developer in one small, but proud Korean company.  As experience shows, joint work with Koreans rarely passes without a trace: someone retires in horror during a probationary period, someone learns to sour kimchi, someone's eye twitches at the sight of a Korean.  Well, your humble servant moved so much that she suddenly went to study at the Orientalist.  Now our Korean friends for me are not only dear colleagues, but also an object of study.  I really want to understand how to build business and labor relations with Koreans in such a way as to gain as much benefit as possible (except for harm).  Today I will share some thoughts on this matter. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c43/440/717/c434407176f1980fc2cd1a7bbbd37821.jpg" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, it is worth making a reservation that all people are different, and Koreans are also different.  However, the Korean organizational culture has inherent characteristics that turn into a rake for the ‚Äúwhite monkey‚Äù.  Basically, these features are rooted in Confucianism, which is not so easy to etch from Korean.  If a Korean lived / studied / worked for a long time in the West, or just travels frequently, something in his head clicks and his way of thinking becomes more like ours.  But the real "Korean Koreans" may not even realize that people outside the Korean Peninsula may be some other. <br><br>  So, you want to get a job in a Korean company, or you are absorbed, or Korean customers have appeared.  What nuances it would be good to know in order to experience as little culture shock as possible?

    <h2>  Hierarchy </h2><br>  Korean society is strictly ordered at all levels, starting with the family and ending with the state.  All relationships are built on the principle of "boss-subordinate", "father-son", "older brother-younger brother", and so on.  When we first met the Koreans be sure to find out the status of the interlocutor.  The status, first of all, depends on age and a post.  By the way, Koreans are often aware that it is impolite for a European to directly ask about age, so they resort to simple tricks like ‚Äúwhat year did you graduate from?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow many children do you have?‚Äù. <br><br>  This principle is pronounced in the language, there is not just "you" or "you", there are special levels of politeness, which are necessarily expressed grammatically.  And by the way, in Korean there is no word ‚Äúbrother‚Äù, or ‚Äúsister‚Äù, there is only, for example, ‚Äúelder brother‚Äù or ‚Äúyounger sister‚Äù. <br><br>  In the ideal Korean world, the younger ones by status respect the elders, and the older ones care for the younger ones.  In life, unfortunately, this is not always the case: relationships can remotely resemble hazing. <br><br>  Here are examples of how this feature can manifest itself: <br><br><ul><li>  The wonderful flat structure of your organization / team can be perceived by Koreans as chaos.  If you are consumed by the Koreans, wait for a change </li><li>  Koreans may have difficulty communicating with their subordinates who are older in age.  A simple trick is to pass directions through a European. </li></ul><br><h2>  Power distance </h2><br>  South Korea belongs to countries with a high power distance index.  This means that the depth of the hierarchy tree will be on average higher than in Western organizations.  The ratio of livestock bosses to the livestock of subordinates will also be higher.  The boss is addressed ‚Äúon you and in a whisper‚Äù; it is not accepted to dispute the decisions of the leadership.  In addition, the higher the head, the harder it is to physically reach him. <br><br>  For us, in principle, is a normal reasoned criticism of management decisions.  But in Korea, this can be a terrible insult, especially if done in the presence of other subordinates.  And not only the boss himself is likely to be offended, but the entire Korean team will look askance at you. <br><br>  The high power distance index is stitched into the Korean consciousness so securely that it sometimes overwhelms even the instinct of self-preservation.  Here, for example, are textbook examples from the history of Korean civil aviation: <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0_Boeing_747_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2593%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5">The crash of Boeing 747 in Guam</a> and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0_Boeing_747_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4_%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Catastrophe of Boeing 747 near London</a> .  One of the reasons in both cases was that the co-pilot simply did not dare to point out to the aircraft commander a mistake.  After these cases, Korean Air revised the crew's interaction procedures, and since then there have been no more disasters. <br><br><h2>  Collectivism and "friend or foe" </h2><br>  Koreans are very closely associated with the team, whether it is a class at school, a department at work or a dance group.  The interests of the group prevail over personal, and the personality outside the team is not even considered.  The group will stand up for their representative, even if he is nosyachil.  In return, full loyalty is required, and confrontation with other members of the group is not accepted.  Moreover, the Koreans tend not only to unite in groups, but also to isolate themselves, to separate themselves from everything that is not included in the group.  All external can be perceived cautiously and even hostile. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_7tPjQmbrx4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  With this, apparently, the fact that Koreans are often afraid of foreigners is connected.  This can occur at different levels.  The simplest thing is that you need something from your Korean colleague, but he is pretending to be dead, suddenly you will be left behind.  Or the ‚Äúnot invented here‚Äù syndrome can happen when the results of your work are not very eager to use, even if they are objectively good.  At the same time, Korean companies are sweeping the world wide, opening their daughters and buying other companies.  Suppose somewhere at the top decided that such cooperation would be beneficial.  What really?  Integration of foreign teams may not be worked out, ordinary Koreans are not happy to interact with these barbarians and quietly sabotage.  Two years later, the new leadership comes and does not know what to do with all this overseas economy.  Of course, this is a pessimistic scenario, but quite possible.  Here is <a href="http://www.koreabusinesscentral.com/free-content/korea-business-interviews/linda-myers-working-at-the-top-in-sk-group-an-insiders-story/">an example of Dr. Linda Myers</a> , who was hired on the top position in the SK Group to promote globalization.  Hired, but could not be used with benefit. <br><br><h2>  Haste, timing and suffering </h2><br>  Koreans are very hasty.  Their whole life is a continuous ‚Äúpalle-pallee‚Äù (Îπ®Î¶¨ - Îπ®Î¶¨, quickly, quickly).  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to lose a day, then fly five minutes later‚Äù, ‚Äúyou go slower - you will continue‚Äù - this is not about them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2c1/4e5/5be/2c14e55bef194c0c9564be5e06f12122.jpg"><br><br>  There was a task - we need to start doing things faster, there is no time to think about efficiency.  All this is ‚Äúask a specialist to estimate the time needed to solve the problem, and then multiply by two‚Äù - forget it.  If the Korean boss said that you need to endure and have a baby in a month, and for some reason you refuse, you may be considered irresponsible.  And if he also managed to promise his boss ... What to do?  And nothing.  Koreans are used to failing deadlines, but they are trying very hard (or by all appearances show that they are trying) to meet.  If the Korean tried very hard to meet the deadline, but for some reason he could not, he is still a good, responsible employee.  This is due to another feature of the Korean mentality, which is described by the capacious word "Kosen" (Í≥†ÏÉù, suffering and adversity).  To flaunt their success with them is not accepted, and the hardships and difficulties - please (Confucian modesty).  Suffering is almost identical to effort, therefore worthy of respect.  So, it‚Äôs more important not what result you achieved, but how much you suffered while doing so.  And the hasty authorities will most likely decide in a month that they do not need the child so quickly, still the nursery is not ready yet, and in general. <br><br><h2>  A little about the language </h2><br>  I will not urge to teach Korean to anyone who has encountered Koreans at work.  Still, this is not the most vital skill.  But!  Be prepared for the fact that Koreans, even in international IT companies, do not always know English well.  In our Korean development center, for example, twist videos calling for learning English.  They show sad foreigners pulling hair out of their beards every time they received a letter from a Korean.  Unfortunately, this does not always help.  It was necessary to read Korean documentation and decipher konglish phrases, and use the ‚Äúinterface‚Äù in the form of an English-speaking Korean, when you need something from those who do not know English (maybe that spoiled phone). <br><br>  In Korean life with English is even worse.  When I first went on a business trip, the first thing I did was get off the bus not there and get lost.  Duck here, only about the fifth in a row the taxi driver tried to understand the girl who was stunned by fear and heat, who spoke something in English to him.  Or you wake up at 7 am in a hotel from a certain sound message, and you do not understand where to run and what they want from you.  And of course it is very nice to be able to read the menu in Korean, order coffee and ask not to put ice in the juice.  In addition, Koreans are very happy when someone can say just a little Korean.  I think it has, and even a little helps to get through the guarded attitude towards the alien.  In general, I still consider Korean courses as one of the most delicious buns in the social package. <br><br><h2>  Instead of output </h2><br>  Perhaps, after reading the article, you do not understand how you can work with these people in general.  In fact, everything is not so bad.  A little habit, a little trick - and it will even be fun.  And Korea, moreover, is a very beautiful, interesting and tasty country, where everything is for people.  Why not? <br><br><h2>  Essentials for Survival in Korea </h2><br><ul><li>  Do not eat red! </li><li>  If the Korean says that it is not spicy, or, even more so, a little spicy - do not believe it! </li><li>  Watch out for icy noodles. </li><li>  Going to Korea, write down what will be in Korean "Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt; Language -&gt; English -&gt; Save." </li><li>  If possible, learn the Korean alphabet.  It can be a great help. </li><li>  Do not try to read aloud Romanized Korean inscriptions.  Not only will you break the language, it‚Äôs also sooooo far from the sound of the original. </li><li>  Never ask the road for a Korean. </li><li>  If it is very difficult, in Seoul there is a <a href="http://puerrtto.livejournal.com/919732.html">Russian region</a> .  But I didn't really like it there. </li></ul><br><h2>  Useless facts </h2><br><ul><li>  Judging by the official name, the ‚ÄúCountry of Morning Freshness‚Äù is in fact the DPRK. </li><li>  There are no other browsers in Korea except for Internet Explorer.  In addition, for some reason, Korean sites are simply unimaginably terrible. </li><li>  "Perfect Code" by Steve McConnell was not published in Korean. </li><li>  In general, Koreans have a convenient phonetic alphabet, but they also sometimes use hieroglyphs.  <a href="http://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do%3Fnews_id%3DN1004214771%26plink%3DSPECIAL%26cooper%3DSBSNEWSMAIN">Here is the hieroglyph "north" right in the title</a> . </li><li>  For some reason, the old Pepsi logo is very similar to the Korean symbol Yin-Yang. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e02/acd/834/e02acd834241446aa4224ff590fe7e7c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/91d/130/a86/91d130a868aa4f87a88c38739905f4d7.png"><br><br></li><li>  <b>UPD:</b> Yes, dogs eat there, this tradition still exists.  But, due to the fact that she is very cruel (dogs are slaughtered with sticks), she has almost disappeared, and there are very few dog lovers among modern Koreans.  True, dog meat is considered ‚Äúhealthy for men‚Äù, so you understand.  Dog dishes are very expensive and they don‚Äôt write them in the menu: in order to try it, you need to know what to order and where. </li></ul><br><h2>  Literature and links for interested </h2><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Doing-Business-Koreans-Seoil-Chaiy/dp/8993952426/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1495795564%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3DDoing%2BBusiness%2Bwith%2BKoreans">Doing Business with Koreans</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/32901762/">Korea without lies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/20887271/">Korea and Koreans.</a>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/20887271/">What guides are silent about</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://makkawity.livejournal.com/">Konstantin Asmolov blog</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://olegkir2002.livejournal.com/">Oleg Kiryanov blog</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329214/</a></p>
