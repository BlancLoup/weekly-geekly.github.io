This allows developers to combine two categories of systems in a single hybrid cloud environment: traditional corporate systems (system of records), for example, key banking and financial systems, and interactive systems of engagement, that is, mobile, situational and social services. <br><br>  Bluemix works on the PaaS model and offers DevOps cloud services that allow developers to work together quickly and efficiently on projects.

(FIMC) to quickly create a mobile application and increase the number of renewed contracts by 30 percent </li><li>  Startups MyMenu and aPersona to quickly scale key business applications </li></ul><br>  <i>‚ÄúAlthough Bluemix was launched just three months ago, we are seeing a rapid growth in the number of IBM services and third-party companies for developers who want to use DevOps in the cloud when building enterprise-level applications,‚Äù said Steve Robinson, General Manager, IBM Cloud Platform Services .</i>  <i>‚ÄúWe also expect to see significant growth as more and more professionals from 18 million developers around the world transfer their work to the cloud.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>New customers using Bluemix and DevOps services</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">BART Launches Hybrid Cloud and DevOps to Make Critical Data Available to Mobile Employees</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a public transport organization serving the San Francisco Bay Area.  Working with the IBM Synchrony Systems business partner, BART will manage the data arrays collected from the infrastructure of 44 stations, 104 miles of railway tracks, sensors, maintenance systems, trains, etc. The company plans to use this data to create and launch a mobile application that allows employees track train data with real-time updates.  Using the power of DevOps in conjunction with Bluemix, which offers reliable data backup, BART can launch its application much faster. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúBART has a huge amount of incredibly valuable information extracted from the railway infrastructure: from trains and rails to maintenance reports,‚Äù comments Slavik Zorin, general director of Synchrony Systems.</i>  <i>‚ÄúBluemix DevOps will provide us with the tools we need to use this important data in a new, interactive mobile platform for BART mobile workers, and ultimately improve maintenance and service.‚Äù</i> </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">GE Capital accelerates software delivery via cloud-based DevOps</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  GE Capital is a structure within General Electric that provides financial services.  Recently, the company has set a goal to accelerate software delivery and more efficiently use the resources of the best developers, allowing them to create new projects, such as, for example, Fleet Optimizer, an analytical application for optimizing fleet operations.  The company built the DevOps platform and deployed the cloud environments available to teams around the world, providing the opportunity for visual monitoring and feedback, as well as speeding up the process of launching applications for predictive analytics, websites and various software. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe developed software and applications, such as our online bank GECapitalBank.com, for several weeks or months instead of months and years,‚Äù says Snehal Antani, director of information technology for Enterprise Architecture, GE Capital Americas.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhen using a strong IT platform based on DevOps, our work is faster and more flexible, like a small startup, but we also have the resources of a large corporation.‚Äù</i> </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">FIMC uses DevOps to create a mobile application for customers.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  FIMC is an insurance provider offering individualized membership programs.  The company needed a high-quality mobile application to increase customer engagement and improve services.  PointSource, an IBM Business Partner, used DevOps on Bluemix and developed a mobile interface for FIMC.  It gives customers access to key applications ‚Äî emergency assistance in case of breakdowns on the road, promotional offers, filing applications and managing deductions, as well as the ability to communicate with FIMC via social networks. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúBefore we introduced the mobile platform, our customers did not realize that some of the most important services for them, such as roadside assistance or discounts, had already expired.</i>  <i>We wanted to simplify the process of extending services for the convenience of users - comments Scott Liberatore (Scott Liberatore), CEO of FIMC.</i>  <i>‚ÄúNow we have a direct model of communication with the client, thanks to which the number of extended contracts has increased by 30 percent.‚Äù</i> </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Internet startup MyMenu uses cloud-based DevOps and analytics to collect customer feedback on restaurants</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  MyMenu is a food ordering company located in Austin, Texas.  Their mobile application allows users to search for restaurants, dishes from a menu or ingredients, order food and leave reviews.  As one of the beta testers of the Bluemix platform, the company accelerated the process of launching its application by allowing developers to quickly make changes to the cloud environment, as well as manage restaurant data using mobile testing, big data and analytical services. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAlthough our users are completely different people, both in age and profession, each feedback is important for us to improve the application,‚Äù comments Mike Little (Mike Little), general director of MyMenu.</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhen using Bluemix mobile and analytical tools, users can simply shake their phone when they notice a problem ‚Äî it automatically sends a report to the Bluemix cloud.</i>  <i>For us, this makes it easier to bring updates to the market. ‚Äù</i> </div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">aPersona transfers the security application to the Bluemix platform for easy scaling</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  As web and mobile applications become more and more advanced, the level of security should also improve.  Regular logins and passwords are no longer sufficient for modern applications.  aPersona is a start-up that deals with application security using multifactor authentication for websites, online stores, cloud portals, utility networks, etc.  In just two days, by deploying their products on the Bluemix platform, aPersona developers were able to quickly create multiple development and test environments, as well as build invisible hidden authentication solutions that scale and support applications of all sizes. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúMalefactors use security gaps in e-commerce,‚Äù explains Kelly Sparks, CEO of aPersona.</i>  <i>‚ÄúBy combining our customizable multi-factor solution with an open development environment and Bluemix security services, we are able to offer extremely secure authentication that is accessible to everyone from a startup to a large corporation</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> </div></div><br><br>  <b>DevOps Services for New Hybrid Clouds</b> <br><br>  IBM also introduces new DevOps services used for hybrid clouds behind the firewalls of organizations.  By combining data from storage systems with new applications and dynamic processes, users can improve the delivery and feedback cycle, book value, security, and quality while rapidly deploying applications.  New tools include: <br><br><ul><li>  Continuous testing, release and deployment services that use advanced analytics to collect user feedback on the application and measure quality, and also allow you to deploy and manage a mobile application simultaneously on multiple platforms (for example, iOS, Android) </li><li>  Services for continuous business planning and collaborative development.  For example, Rational System Architect for open communication and analytics between work teams to speed up business processes, Collaborative Lifecycle Management to improve reporting services tenfold, Rational DOORS to increase transparency and easy tracking of requirements. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúToday, organizations are starting to realize that they need to start using mobile, social and cloud applications in order to stand out among their competitors.</i>  <i>But the best applications often need to use arrays of data that are stored behind the firewalls of the organizations' IT infrastructures, comments Kristof Kloeckner, general manager of IBM Rational Software.</i>  <i>‚ÄúUsing IBM DevOps helps development teams use this information to create better interactive systems.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  <b>New Bluemix services</b> <br><br>  The new services rely on IBM's big data expertise, analytics and open standards, and include: <br><br><ul><li>  AppScan for security with fast testing in multiple environments; </li><li>  Built-in reporting services to create advanced analytics in the application since its launch.  They allow you to make valuable conclusions from big data arrays; </li><li>  Business analysis services for managing cloud services; </li><li>  Continuous launch services that allow organizations to simultaneously release multiple applications. </li></ul><br><br>  With programs like the Bluemix Garage initiative and participation in the Cloud Foundry Foundation, IBM has expanded its work with developers around the world.  According to forecasts, the number of professionals in this field will exceed 26 million in 2016.  Bluemix developer meetings were held in Asia, Latin America, Europe, India, Africa, North America and other regions.  IBM has also become a partner at Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya, to expand cloud-based educational programs for developers in the fast-growing African IT market. <br><br>  Learn <a href="https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/">more</a> about IBM DevOps and the BlueMix platform. <br><br>  As part of the IBM global initiative ‚Äú200 Days of Bluemix‚Äù, training events, workshops for developers and workshops are held around the world.  The nearest event in Russia will be held in Moscow on June 18.
