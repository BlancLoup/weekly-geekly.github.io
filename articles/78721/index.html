And not from one. <br><br>  When in Volgograd we began to cheaply pull a twisted pair cable into each apartment, I connected to as many as 3 providers and I had 3 wires.  The Internet was expensive then, but local traffic was free or cheap.  So I connected to everyone to somehow find the movie I need, software, music.  I connected to cable TV on 2 apartments.  Half a year even used all of this. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Then I had to move several times and also connect the Internet and television to new places of residence.  Now I am calmly using the services of a single provider, which provides both TV and Internet for a single monthly fee.

      At the moment I receive SMS from ‚Äúold‚Äù providers every month.  In these sms I am informed about the need to repay the ever-growing debt.  Well, in the amount of debt there for a couple of thousand, and from some I already bought off and terminated the contract. <br><br>  But that's not the point.  I do not think that only I have such a relationship with providers.  We are moving, moving to more favorable terms to other companies, and the old contracts should be terminated by arriving at an office on Tumannaya Street, somewhere behind the Komsomolets cinema, in short, not where the connection agreement was made.  And he concluded in my apartment, the manager came, smiled, wished good luck.  I only needed to sign. <br><br>  The situation is simple: <b>I am too lazy to go to their offices</b> . <br><br>  I somehow tried to solve the shutdown problem remotely, without arriving at the office.  Called: <br>  - <b><a href="http://citydom.ru/">Er-Telecom</a></b> Company (Internet DOM.ru, and the TV "Divan-TV". I have 3 debts to them).  Answered that you need to go to a certain street with a passport.  He asked why they came to me at the conclusion, and there was no answer to their termination.  Remotely suspend the increase in debt can not.  Debt is constantly growing.  The wire is cut off at the entrance. <br>  - <b><a href="http://avtlg.ru/">UTK</a></b> (the giant telecom is in the south. I have one contract with them.) They also refused to somehow turn off the ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù me and offered to go.  Debt is constantly growing. <br>  - <b><a href="http://multinex.ru/">Multinex</a></b> (we have known as the ISS).  Call themselves and offer to come to the office.  Not a word about duty.  Just for reporting you need to disconnect.  The wire is cut off at the entrance. <br>  - <a href="http://www.eros-tv.ru/">EROS</a> Television (no, this is not porn. This is Electronic Radio Optical Systems) Debt is growing.  Offer to come.  The wire is cut off at the entrance. <br>  - <b><a href="http://vistcom.ru/">Whist-on-line</a></b> (the contract has already been broken).  Spent the internet to our office.  Then the company moved, the debt in the amount of 2400 rubles.  per month increased 3 months with the cut wire.  Send them a notice of termination forgotten.  Spoke to their lawyer.  He assured me that I was not the first to break, and I shouldn‚Äôt download the rights, they charge a fee for renting a channel. <br><br>  Perhaps Moscow operators are less bloodthirsty and make it easy for subscribers to get away from them, but in our case in Volgograd.  By the way, in terms of the company's reputation, it‚Äôs terrible to charge money from your former subscribers.  After all, they can return, or they can bring such a provider to their personal blacklist. <br><br>  Of course, I‚Äôll get together and go around wherever I go, pay off debts.  But surely, many users of communication services probably have similar problems.  With a negative balance, we are not disconnected, do not cut the cable, do not block accounts.  We continue to write off the monthly fee. <br><br>  In fact, in all cases I am guilty.  I entered into a contract, services were provided to me, I did not terminate the contract, which means there is no reason for me to turn off or turn off billing.  This refers to the honesty of the company: well, the subscriber has a debt, no need to artificially increase it, especially if he really did not use the services.  In this regard, I know examples of companies that behave normally.  In my opinion, such issues can only be resolved by additional regulation by the state.  And now the mobile operators will start to take money for non-use of old SIMs (there was already news, I hope this is a duck).  How many old sim cards do you have?  Are there 5 pieces? .. <br><br>  Variants of legislative solution of the problem: <br>  - Oblige providers to <b>provide an equal level of service when connecting and disconnecting a subscriber</b> .  If you come to enter into a contract, then you can terminate it by calling the house manager. <br>  - Oblige providers to <b>stop charging fees for services with a negative balance and their non-use by the subscriber</b> .  This does not mean that you will be disconnected with a negative balance, this means that you will no longer be taken from the money, driving into debt. <br>  - Oblige providers to provide the subscriber with the <b>opportunity to disconnect himself through a personal account</b> on the provider's website, or suspend the provision of services and charging. <br><br>  Based on this topic I will write a <a href="http://letters.kremlin.ru/send">letter to the president</a> .  I ask everyone who also does not like this state of affairs to do the same.  Now, judging by the news, FAS has taken on the providers, maybe they will pay attention to our problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78721/</a></p>
