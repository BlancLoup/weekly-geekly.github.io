The specific cost of one installed version of this OS is now less than 1.5 thousand rubles, said FSSP Deputy Director Tatyana Ignatieva in the Presidential Administration at a working meeting on import substitution. <br><br>  GosLinux is a standard Linux distribution kit specially created according to the requirements of the FSSP with built-in information protection tools.  Its development was carried out during 2013 on the basis of the CentOS 6.4 distribution, which, in turn, is based on the commercial distribution of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> .  The developer of the distribution was Red Soft, which won in March 2013 in the competition for the revision, implementation and maintenance of AIS FSSP subsystems.  The amount of the state contract amounted to 118.15 million rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúAt the moment GosLinux is installed on 16 thousand workplaces and on 660 service servers.  By the end of the year due to the fact that we set ourselves the task not only in the form of declarations and goals, but also fixed the decision at our annual board, we are going to bring the implementation rate to 50%, thereby reducing the unit cost of one version to about 800 rubles ‚Äú, Notes Ignatieff. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAccording to the official partners of Microsoft, for us it was 794 million rubles.  Seeing the corresponding difference, we will continue to pursue a policy of not only import substitution, but also the use of software products in this vein, ‚Äùadds the deputy director of the FBS. <br><br>  According to Ignatieva, the main difference between GosLinux OS and other domestic distributions is the fact that its holder is the Russian Federation represented by the FSSP, and not a commercial organization.  And the distribution of GosLinux in state authorities is free. <br><br>  The distribution kit has already been transferred for operation to representatives of the Nizhny Novgorod, Volgograd and Yaroslavl regions.  It is also planned to launch in Pereyaslavl, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/2016-04-29_skolko_stoit_rossijskij_distributiv_sudebnye">reports</a> CNews with reference to the deputy director of the FSSP. <br><br>  The Federal Bailiff Service (FSSP) of Russia can be considered a veteran in the application of free software (OSS), since it was still in 2013, when there was no question of import substitution, started creating its own information system based on Open Source AIS FSSP of Russia , the development of which was performed by an external contractor. <br><br>  Yegor Vasilyev, deputy head of the ITM on information security issues, explained that interest in Open Source was primarily due to economic considerations: ‚ÄúOur service was previously allocated much less funds than other agencies, and last year the IT budget was significantly reduced compared to 2014 ". <br><br>  According to Yegor Vasilyev, back in 2013, it was decided to use a free OS for all bailiffs and management personnel in order not to pay for installing software for 40 thousand workplaces and 2.5 thousand servers.  Now the third year of GosLinux implementation is in progress, and 20‚Äì25% of the equipment has been transferred to it across all territorial bodies and facilities of the FSSP.  By the end of the year it is planned to provide 50% coverage. <br><br>  Ruben Enfiadjian, Head of Infrastructure Management of the Automated Information System of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation (RPF), noted that the use of Open Source can help optimize the cost of ownership of the product due to its development and support on its own.  This can provide significant savings, since it is no secret that the cost of support from the manufacturer of a commercial product is often substantial, and according to the policies of many manufacturers, such technical support is one of the requirements when purchasing a solution. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300506/</a></p>
