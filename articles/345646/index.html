No names will be called here, no one will be shown with a finger. </p><br><p>  We will try to draw attention to what we consider to be a problem of the modern Russian market of information security services. <br></p><br><h1>  <font color="#4378BE">Introduction</font> </h1><br><p>  To make the context understandable to the readers, we decided to start from the background.  The article was written by an information security analyst (me) and a penetration tester (by my colleague <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/infinitesuns/" class="user_link">InfiniteSuns</a> ). </p><br><p>  Working with customers, we are systematically confronted with a lack of understanding of the essence of the services we provide.  Often this misunderstanding is due to the fact that it was transferred to the customer from the company that provided these services.  Once during the course of conducting an internal pentest, the elevation of privileges and the elimination of the means of protection on the office machine provided by the customer puzzled the head of the information security service. </p><br><p>  Further, in the course of the discussion, it turned out that before that, under the name ‚ÄúPentest‚Äù, the customer was sold a scan of the internal network using <i>‚Äúnmap‚Äù</i> with the parameter <i>‚Äú--script vuln‚Äù</i> .  Naturally, once again the customer expected similar behavior from the pensters and was genuinely surprised when they started capturing his domain controller. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  Sometimes it happens that during the work a separate stage allocates control over the elimination of vulnerabilities identified in the previous study.  It also happens that for this the customer provides a report on this very previous study.  Looking at such a report, sometimes you wonder at the ingenuity of your colleagues in the market. </p><br><p>  Automated scanning of vulnerabilities is sometimes sold at least as pentest, at least as a security analysis.  In such conditions it is not surprising that we have to hear from customers something like ‚ÄúHack us so that it is beautiful.‚Äù  At some point we realized that we were not the first to notice this: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/xp/db/oyxpdb2ymb9dsmqwqpciivc64tk.png"><br><br><p>  We leave the reader to think about the question - why there is no clear understanding of the ordered services and their results?  Due to the incompetence of information market participants?  Or do they intentionally drive customers by the nose, selling simpler services under the guise of complex and expensive ones? </p><br><p>  Since we are not happy with any of the two options, we felt the desire to share our own vision and formed a small CheatSheet for practical information security services. </p><br><h1>  <font color="#4378BE">CheatSheet</font> </h1><br><h2>  <font color="#4378BE">Types of jobs</font> </h2><br>  <strong>Let's look at five different jobs:</strong>
