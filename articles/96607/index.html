  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What are they afraid of in cloud computing?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently there was a <a href="http://annamitos.habrahabr.ru/blog/96525/">post</a> about what is bad in cloud computing.  The post was not very good, but the unspoken sounded there. <br><br>  So it would be better to talk, what <em>are</em> they <em>afraid of</em> in cloud computing? <br><br><h1>  Staff reduction </h1><br>  Now for the maintenance of the IT infrastructure of the enterprise, significant resources are being spent.  35-40 thousand per month - this is the minimum.  Usually, amounts from 60 to 100+ thousand.  This is not only communication services, electricity, but staff salaries.  (Of course, the size of companies is different, and someone may have expenses in the millions).  The staff objectively feels that if tomorrow everyone moves to chromos / ipad (or their heirs) and works in Gugldox, then for what will they pay money?  This is a latent sensation that slightly bites any sysadmin.  Skype cannibalizes not only voip, but also the skills of asterisk / office PBX specialists.  Gugldoks look scary for now, but they are striving for a more decent state.  The Internet is becoming more accessible, less and less I want to wrap up through a proxy, access control systems, traffic accounting systems and all other signs of the corporate network.  A company for 20 people will be served perfectly by a SOHO piece of iron, and perhaps just a WiFi access point with laptops around.  All in all, IT is one printer stuck in the network port of the same WiFi.  On computers, Skype, Gugldoki and webmail. ... Do you really think that you need a sysadmin?

      Fearfully.  The seemingly complex and demanding High Knowledge technologies are reduced to the level of an ordinary home user ... and work.  Active Directory, Exchange, sharepoint, offices on local machines, ISA, WSUS server, squd, own DNS server, MXs, group policies ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suddenly it turns out that all this does not solve the tasks that IT users set for them.  Very Important servers (at least two) with domain controllers are completely unnecessary in order to log in to Google ... Deploying tools for consolidating and virtualizing servers is useless in the absence of servers in the company. <br><br>  Of course, I did not say about the second component of most companies - this is the accounting system.  1C in accounting and sales managers, some specific to the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe company's software.  ERP, CRM, strange hybrids that were made ten years ago ... And they instinctively clutch for it - you can't take the accounting base to other servers, there are too many important things ... <br><br>  However, this is slightly lower.  If the office looks quite good in the clouds and the web, then with the accounting department everything is much worse. <br><br><h1>  Foreign servers for our database </h1><br>  The main concern of any company is disclosure.  Most often they are afraid of trivial things: disclosing not very good GTEs, floating out flies with VAT.  May fear withdrawal of the customer base or some other information, which is really a commercial secret. <br><br>  This fear is already managers, not sysadmins. <br><br>  Fears can be divided into: <br><br>  1) Psychological rejection (I'm here, and the data are there, it is not known where) <br>  2) Fear of bad faith on the part of employees of an outside organization <br>  3) Fear of bad faith of the organization (these are different things) <br>  4) A sense of greater data availability for all kinds of departments. <br>  5) Question: they will go bankrupt there, and what shall we do? <br><br>  The first and second points are more likely remnants (the dishonesty of an employee of a foreign organization with an agreement with this organization has economic compensation), but the other concerns are completely objective. <br><br><h1>  And the whole life of the office depends on the accuracy of the excavator ... </h1><br>  Between the company's office and servers are networks of several organizations, kilometers of wires and equipment of unknown quality, which is in unknown conditions.  And of course, the storm of all wired networks is an excavator.  One awkward movement - and installers for a week of entertainment. <br><br>  The danger is quite serious: if the main channels have adequate redundancy, then the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù is usually the most vulnerable spot.  In part, this can be compensated by reserving Internet channels (for example, via an overhead line or alternative input), but in fact it may well turn out that both services will not work.  And the office stops completely.  Totally.  Neither see the archive of the mail, nor type the document.  Worse, it can only be a blackout of the building. <br><br><h1>  And on the carpet who cause? </h1><br>  Another serious concern of the head: no one to shift the responsibility.  The absence of a person with salary and head responsible for the work of the infrastructure is very embarrassing.  "His" he is still "his", and not someone else's uncle.  Perhaps it is this, and not all of the above, the main obstacle in the development of an ‚Äúoffice without an administrator‚Äù.  The driver usually has the worst knowledge in the field than the specialist, and he needs to have a specialist to solve sudden and hard-to-predict questions. <br><br>  In the presence of a person (with a salary) it is no longer very clear why there are clouds.  Anyway, more than half of the IT costs are salaries, so everything else is small-scale, a variation that fits into ‚Äúasked for an increase for the new year or not.‚Äù <br><br><h1>  The legacy of ancestors </h1><br>  Another (sometimes, the main) reason for refusing to even consider other options is the availability of its software, uniquely tailored for a certain infrastructure.  Reinforced concrete argument: "work, do not touch."  An even more serious argument: reworking is more expensive than containing. <br><br><h1>  Pay us not once, but all the time </h1><br>  And if the total consumption of resources will be more expensive than its sysadmin and its own server?  And how can I predict this?  And if it turns out suddenly, in the middle of the working process, at the time of the company's development?  And if we get a big money post factum? <br><br>  SaS is still worse.  Angry bourgeois want to take money from us more than once, but constantly.  The long-cherished dream of any software company is to sell software every time it is used.  The long-cherished dream of any software company is to sell software, but not even give away a binary code, so that they cannot be deleted. <br><br>  In addition to general concerns, there is a specific question: how can we predict the resource consumption of our servers? <br><br><h1>  Legislation </h1><br>  How legitimate is it to store IP data in foreign clouds (see FL-152)?  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/slonoed/" class="user_link">Slonoed</a> ) <br><br><h1>  Answers on questions </h1><br>  Probably, all this has only one answer: time will tell.  In some places, the development of online services will respond to some concerns, in some it will be clear "otherwise it can not."  In some companies that adhere to the policy of ‚Äúworking - do not touch‚Äù, they simply lose their competitiveness due to the large overhead costs of maintaining the infrastructure. <br><br><h1>  Will the clouds win? </h1><br>  Probably, it is correct to speak, even, not about the clouds, but about the transfer of infrastructure from the self-made, to the provided by commercial companies.  Perhaps even for free.  (How many business emails are on mail?) <br><br>  Will online win?  I do not know.  I see certain trends, in some places it is already winning.  In some places I see people who started a business without seeing the entire complex and cumbersome infrastructure, the heir to the 90s.  On the other hand, I see companies in which ‚Äúeverything is fine‚Äù ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96607/</a></p>
