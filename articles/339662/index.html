It is even said that the fear of public speaking is the strongest human fear.  They probably never tried to dismiss a person.  For any novice leader, and for many experienced ones, this is still a test. <br><br>  Let's understand why sometimes you have to part with employees and how to carry out this separation as smooth as possible for both parties. <br><br>  I have to say right away that the dismissal of an employee is almost always not the fault of the employee, and often a confluence of circumstances: not the project, not the colleagues, not the manager who fits the employee.  Of course, it also happens that the employee himself is to blame, but, fortunately, I have never met anyone like that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reasons for having to part with employees </h3><br>  <b>The man did not fit the project and did not pass the trial period</b>

      Someone may say that this is a problem of adaptation of the employee in the company and the company failed it.  Perhaps, but we will not draw fast conclusions. <br><br>  There was a single case in my experience when a developer showed himself well at an interview, but completely failed in his work.  We expected that a person with experience and knowledge (we did not doubt them) would be able to independently figure out the features of the average level of complexity.  But we could not imagine that every difficulty an employee encounters in the development process puzzles him, he hangs, does not tell anyone about it, and the deadlines fail. <br><br>  <b>The growth of a junior developer does not meet expectations</b> <br><br>  When hiring a junior developer, you expect him to grow rapidly and increase efficiency.  However, this growth does not occur.  A year goes by, another one, perhaps more.  A person is regularly given feedback, goals are set.  However, the reporting period comes and it is clear that the goals have not been achieved.  This situation is repeated for a long time. <br><br>  Here the fault does not lie solely with the employee, the problem is mutual.  After all, an employee may not be approached by a specific team, where he got, the project and the technologies used, the management process, the personality of the manager, setting and monitoring goals.  Such reasons can be very, very much. <br><br>  The consequence of this set of circumstances is the slow growth of the salary of this employee or the lack of it at all.  Both sides suffer: <br><br><ul><li>  team due to the lack of result of a specific employee </li><li>  employee due to insufficient compensation of his labor </li></ul><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> suggest an employee to look for a new place of work. <br><br>  As an example from his own experience, a person has worked with us for almost 2 years.  Regularly received feedback.  At some point, we decided with his manager that we need to part with the employee.  From the moment of the conversation, in 1 month he found a job with a salary 1.5 times more.  After that, I talked to him, and he was pleased with the transition to another company, because  the rhythm of development there was much lower than ours and, naturally, he was pleased with the pay rise.  He has been working in that company for 2 years now, he is not going to leave.  We were able to take a promising junior programmer in his place and grow it (successfully). <br><br>  <b>Reorganization of departments within the company and minimization of projects</b> <br><br>  Imagine that within the company there are several departments, they work according to the tasks set, they fulfill their goals.  The management decides on a change in development strategy and at the same time reorganizes the structure of departments for this. <br><br>  Once, so to me in the unit were two excellent employees who were taken under research in the field of linguistics.  Very strong guys who are burning promising developments in the field of texts.  However, in the new development strategy there was no place for linguistic research and these employees had to be engaged in development. <br><br>  Naturally, the results fall, because  they are no longer as motivated as they used to be.  In this case, all other conditions in the company are satisfied with them and they do not want to leave. <br><br>  Over time, the results of work fall even more, the head is difficult to motivate them to do what they are not interested. <br><br>  <b>Man - gouging and not doing his job</b> <br><br>  Fortunately, I had no such employees.  However, in the next section there was a similar character.  The man got a job, while at night doing freelancing and, coming to work, slept on the couch.  And when I didn‚Äôt sleep, I solved the questions of my personal project.  Naturally, he did not have time to do his job duties.  In general, he was fired, he did not work even 2 months. <br><br><h3>  How to part </h3><br>  So, you see that some of your employees do not cope with their duties.  First of all, talk to him.  Find out how he's doing, maybe some conflicts or problems in his personal life.  Find out his view on current work, what he doesn‚Äôt like, what would he change.  One-on-one conversations are very important, even when everything is fine.  Such meetings help to solve many problems, not bringing them to hidden conflicts.  Finally, meeting one on one with a person, you simply let the person know that he is important to you. <br><br>  I am a supporter of the fact that there are no wrong people, there are wrong conditions.  You can eliminate distractions, help an employee, give an interesting project or feature, transfer to another department if possible, motivate with any available method.  Often people change a lot and sometimes become almost the best employees.  I have such examples (one even sits next to me).  However, there are such cases that try, do not try - nothing happens, their effectiveness does not change and they do not fulfill their goals.  As they say, the project and the employee were incompatible.  It is better to let such employees go. <br><br>  For parting with employees, I use the tool: "3 yellow cards": <br><br><ol><li>  Give the employee constructive feedback, inform openly that he is not fulfilling his duties, listen to his point of view on this, agree on the implementation of certain agreements in the future. </li><li>  If after receiving the first "card" nothing has changed, then hold after a while the second meeting and again give the employee feedback using the algorithm of claim 1.  At this stage it is important: the person must understand that you will fire him if he does not improve. </li><li>  If now the employee violates the agreement, does not fulfill his duties, then make a decision about parting with such an employee.  Talk to him directly, communicate your decision, give sufficient time to search for a new job.  I offer 3 months, during this time everyone could find a new job.  I also usually offer job search assistance if such help is needed.  If it turns out that the employee for some reason could not find a new job for the agreed time, extend the period for a reasonable time. </li></ol><br>  Need to part in good relations, because no one knows how it can turn in the future: <br><br><ul><li>  The employee is pumped into the lead and can return to the company; </li><li>  You yourself can go to another company and find a previously retired employee in a management position (he may even be your boss). </li></ul><br>  In relation to other subordinates, you need to be predictable and consistent, so explain why you had to part with the person.  This must be done so that your employees clearly understand what is expected of them and that there are no unnecessary conversations behind their backs.  Try to make all your decisions as open as possible, try to explain your actions. <br><br>  In the comments to the article, please share personal experience, how and for what you can dismiss a person. <br><br>  Did you fire a person?  Did you get fired? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339662/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339662/</a></p>
