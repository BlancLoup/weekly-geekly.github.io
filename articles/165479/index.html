  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LinkedIn is a difficult but effective network to promote. Basic principles and pitfalls</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  LinkedIn is often forgotten when thinking about promoting a company on the Internet.  And it is in vain!  The network is suitable for its own promotion, to promote its company, to search for employees and partners. <br><br>  Professionals create their own profiles, enter into thematic groups, communicate with interesting people on interesting topics.  And it does not compare with communication in other venues.  LinkedIn is a platform for serious people to talk about serious topics. <br>  If you are promoting a company whose clients are top managers, HR specialists, marketers, foreign specialists, then LinkedIn is necessary.  From my own experience, I can say that the traffic to your website from LinkedIn can be the most significant, comparing with all other social sites.  This is to talk about the need to choose the right sites for promotion.  For example, promoting such companies as the International Forum ‚ÄúLife Science Invest‚Äù, RESTEC EVENTS, St. Petersburg International Trade Center, I use LinkedIn as the main platform. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbf/897/7b9/fbf8977b9198b4a0f121cad3d45395c9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Main principles of promotion:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ We write current statuses - interesting professional posts, links to third-party resources and to own articles <br>  ‚Ä¢ We make mailings on our own contacts and groups <br>  ‚Ä¢ Click "I like" and leave comments to posts <br>  ‚Ä¢ We establish new contacts, we enter new groups <br>  ‚Ä¢ Install your own applications (for example, SlideShare, broadcast your own blog, twitter, etc.)

      <b>Underwater rocks</b> <br>  Not everything is as simple as it seems.  LinkedIn is primarily a network of professional contacts.  Therefore, there are a number of restrictions that you need to know: <br><br>  1. There is a limit on the number of applications sent to friends - 3000 applications.  After that, they offer to contact customer support and ask them to increase this number.  If you have been registered for less than a year and you have already received complaints about spamming, you will be denied indefinitely. <br><br>  2. If it is very active to ‚Äúestablish contacts‚Äù, then this opportunity may be blocked.  The first time you can defrost your account yourself, then you have to contact support.  Your account will be unfrozen, reminded that you need to "make contact" only with people you know.  The main advice is to provide your friend request with brief comments.  But even if you write who you are and why you want to make contact, people still click the "I do not know this person" button.  And you can be blocked. <br><br>  3. When you are blocked a second time, the avatar is deleted from the account.  You can return it yourself.  But if the profile picture was deleted a third time, then you will not be able to put it anymore.  Here is such a punishment for reckless behavior. <br><br>  4. Inconvenient invitations to the group.  Sending invitations, you do not see to whom it has already been sent, and who does not.  It turns out that when doing a newsletter on your network of contacts, you can send the same message several times. <br><br>  5. There is a limit on the number of groups in which you can be up to 50. Choose groups carefully, join those with the maximum number of participants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165479/</a></p>
