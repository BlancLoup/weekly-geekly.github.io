Weakly swarming alongside the tables where the salads were steaming.  Despite the decaying atmosphere of holidays, a review to be!  Well, am I a hero? <br><br>  Of course, everyone summed up.  Reduced debit with a loan for the year.  They handed out elephants and congratulated those who can read.  Some results will be interesting to us.

      My favorite blog about advertising in one post gathered all the topics for the year that were actively discussed or generated a certain interest.  <a href="http://mastertext.spb.ru/blog/2005/12/29">Twenty themes</a> that shook the world. <br><br>  <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/">Cssing</a> congratulates everyone on the upcoming holidays and also publishes a <a href="http://cssing.org.ua/2005/12/27">list of the twenty</a> most popular blog topics.  Most reports of various fun ways to apply CSS. <br><br>  The " <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/">Details</a> " blog collected as many as <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/2005-12-27/383.html">24 interesting</a> , according to the author, messages for the year and gives them out on one page. <br><br>  Even the blog of a well-known Russian search engine in the person of the project director <a href="">sums up</a> .  The results are joyfully enthusiastic about the fact that the director works for this company.  Among the results, the phrase ‚Äúwork by myself‚Äù, which I really liked, skips. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInternet business today‚Äù talks about a very convenient plug-in for the FireFox browser (and what, there are other browsers?) - it allows bloggers to make their publications from any web page opened in the browser.  I have already tried this plugin and find it useful and vital.  And continuing the plugin theme for Firefox, the <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/">intruder's register</a> blog talks about an even more useful addition - <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2005/12/29/blogging-i-veb-servisyi">Blogger Web Comments</a> .  The essence of the plug-in: in the process of your surfing the web, when you go to the next page, it searches for the address of this page in Google blogs search and thus gives you all the links to blog entries where the page you visited is discussed.  The results are neatly displayed in the window in the lower right corner of the browser.  It is strictly necessary to install everything! <br><br>  In the same intruder's register note on the need to <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2005/12/30">update old messages</a> , so that people who go to the record from search engines, always get the latest information.  Customer care. <br><br>  In the " <a href="http://razuma.net.ru/">Arrow Lab</a> " again can not get along with the recruiting <a href="http://razuma.net.ru/2005/12/28">office</a> .  For the author came the police with two submachine gunners and the sleepy was taken to the police station in a police bobby.  Quite recently, I myself had fun at our military office, it turns out that in Russia it is just as fun.  With stories about visiting this hot spot, you can speak at the Palace of the Republic and hurt a lot of money.  Although I, like the author, feel sorry for the time spent on communication with the military.  No war!  In the same blog, the following message will be useful for those who like to download software from the Internet, an <a href="http://razuma.net.ru/2005/12/29">overview of the runet-storage sites</a> . <br><br>  The author of " <a href="http://shulenin.info/weblog/">Weblog</a> " scoffs at the <a href="http://shulenin.info/weblog/ne_po_rabote/ocherednye_prichudy_vorda.htm">poor Word'om</a> , forcing him to blush and memorize various swear words.  In the process of fun it turns out that "Word" knows all these words, but at first it was just too shy to admit it. <br><br>  Many have already managed to write that the search for Mail.ru now works on the Yandex engine, although it previously produced results from Google.  Interestingly, both companies have not yet commented on this, but bloggers are busy commenting, for example, ‚ÄúA <a href="http://web-blog.ru/2005/12/30/mail-and-yandex">blog about Internet marketing</a> ‚Äù (there I read this news earlier than others). <br><br>  <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/">ZOO Magazine</a> " <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2005/12/blog-post_31.html">tamps grandmother</a> ", that is, summarizes the knowledge gained over the past year.  Moreover, these generalizations are on the topic "Why do we need blogs?"  It turns out that they are still needed for some reason. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.searchengines.ru/blog/">BlogNews</a> justifies why <a href="http://www.searchengines.ru/blog/archives/006727.html">it does not write</a> about Yandex, although the author works there.  In the process, we still learn something interesting about the monster of the Russian search.  For example, the company has a constant shortage of coffee cups! <br><br>  In connection with the New Year holidays, <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/">Kolesnik has</a> become Santa Claus and we offer everyone a gift - he will write in his blog <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2006/01/01">about your project</a> , if you, of course, ask him about it. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://felixm.blogspot.com/">fmm</a> blog <a href="http://felixm.blogspot.com/">, a</a> small <a href="http://felixm.blogspot.com/2005/12/blog-post_29.html">summing up</a> based on recent events in the cramped world of the Internet.  It got as three whales ("Google", "Yahu" and "Microsoft"), and some Russian projects.  Belarus does not seem to exist. <br><br>  <a href="http://hvost.org/">HvosT</a> with another article that will be of interest to all <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D161">owners of Palm</a> .  Overlooked benchmarks and tests. <br><br>  The blog " <a href="http://getnew.biz/">New Business</a> " is an interesting article about effective <a href="http://getnew.biz/2005/12/17">teamwork</a> .  I‚Äôd better quote: "A person naively believes that if he knows, then others know. This is akin to the infant state, when everyone should be worn around him with diapers and diapers. In fact, not at all. Nobody should." <br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.sitengine.ru/">MadDog's Blog</a> talks about the release of the third issue of the magazine " <a href="http://blogs.sitengine.ru/archives/259.html">Open Source</a> ".  Browse interesting articles. <br><br>  Traditionally, we focus our attention on LiveJournal. <br><br>  Igor Ponochevny <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/ponochevnyy/42615.html">tells a story</a> from his childhood.  "When I was little, I sometimes saw the space pilot Gagarin, who, while traveling in Leningrad, often went to visit my uncle - Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kovalsky, in his communal apartment at Pryazhka.". <br><br>  Sherlock Sebastian introduces us to <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/sh_sebastian/20167.html">35 facts</a> about the filming of a film about Sherlock Holmes, and about the character itself.  For example, such a fact: "Porridge, which was specially prepared for the movie by an assistant in props, was so tasty that at the end of the shooting day they brought another saucepan to the pavilion, but much more for the entire film crew." <br><br>  The Governor of Carlson On Earth publishes a <a href="http://livejournal.com/users/elcour/12620.html">small correspondence</a> from the 12th century.  The meaning of the message is reduced to the fact that modern curses have faded somewhat, compared with the old Slavonic.  I tend to agree. <br><br>  Moscowtalk shares <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/overheardmsk/157039.html">overheard dialogue</a> between a guy and a girl. <br><br>  In the izdato community there is a discussion about writing a book in <a href="http://livejournal.com/community/izdato/304682.html">co-authorship</a> .  How productive is this job?  Notable cases of co-authorship, and how responsibilities and fees were distributed. <br><br>  Well, I will advise the entire blog entirely - <a href="http://plazmatronic.livejournal.com/">plazmatronic</a> .  The guy on the air talks about his experiences in the field of pickup.  No, it's not about cars. <br><br>  Now in each review you can read the opinion of one of the bloggers on the events of the past week.  This is done in order to present the opinion of those who are on the other side of the barricades.  After all, I view all blog entries from the point of view of the reader.  So, first of all, <a href="http://merkurov.ru/blog">Anton Merkurov</a> , whose blog has repeatedly visited the pages of the newspaper, will be noted.  Thanks Anton for responding to my request.  Here is the opinion of the blogger: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIn the last week of the past year, most bloggers wrote holiday greetings and went on a well-deserved New Year's holiday. They discussed the release of Wordpress 2.0 (wordpress.org/download), which is certainly a major event in the‚Äú technical ‚Äùpart of the blogosphere, as well as the release of an updated skin. K2 (http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2), which is deservedly considered the most popular Wordpress theme. So, those who have moved smoothly behind the computer because of the New Year's table can start updating. And in Wordpress, and K2 has many interesting features, so I advise you  It‚Äôs recommended to go to the premiere of ‚ÄúDay Watch.‚Äù At this place, according to the laws of the genre, you should put a link to the review ‚ÄúWatch‚Äù from some blogger. But no There will be no link. Blog reviews are good (search for the phrase "Day Watch" on blogs - blogs.yandex.ru). And there is no point in reading the reviews. Go - at least, you will not regret.  And most importantly: I congratulate everyone on the New Year that has already come.  All the best, happiness, success and other joys.
