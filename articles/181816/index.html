      <b>Apple mobile devices in the corporate sector.</b>  <b>Configuration profiles</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvpn/blog/181223/">Rus</a> <br>  The vast majority believes that the MacBook is very far from corporate standards, and is only suitable for designers, indie developers and advanced housewives.  The iPhone is considered to be a stylish gadget for writing tweets and photographing ‚Äúbows‚Äù for fashionable Instagram.  Now I will try to dispel such stereotypes and tell what mobile devices of the famous company from Cupertino are capable of. <br><br>  <b>Simple JSON Schema validator for Objective-C</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180923/">Rus</a> <br>  Probably many developers are faced with a situation where a mobile application is developed in parallel with the backend.  In this case, often the data structures that come in response to a request from the server may change.  For example, on the side of the backend they decide to change the naming of one of the JSON keys, forgetting to warn the mobile team about this.  I'm not talking about the situation when CamelCase decided to ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù change the notation to underscore or vice versa. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Galaxy S3: a radical reduction in energy consumption by the mediaserver</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/180985/">Rus</a> <br>  Many owners of Android devices occasionally face the problem of increased energy consumption by the Media Storage service (the same mediaserver).  This post on how this problem can be solved in a radical way for devices with shared internal memory card and partition / data, (Galaxy S3, Nexus 4, and many others), as well as a little about the device and organization of the internal memory of such devices, and how the internal memory card can be accelerated and optimized on Android 4.1. <br><br>  <b>We write the client for your favorite site on phoneGap</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181610/">Rus</a> <br>  It happens that there is a site, but using it from a mobile phone is not very convenient and it would be great to have a separate application for it.  Fans of web development can easily do this using phoneGap.  The article will discuss the mail tracking service, which I often use and a demo client written for it with basic functionality: authorization, getting a list of tracks and descriptions for them and the ability to add a new track. <br><br>  <b>Adding animation to the ListView</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181338/">Rus</a> <br>  I wanted to make the new elements not just appear at the bottom, but float up below and a little to the right.  Later, I looked at the report of Roman Guy and Chet Haas on Google IO 2013 and got an idea to add distortion to add realism.  This required a slightly different approach, but, in general, the concept remained the same. <br><br>  <b>The story of a bad start on Google Play</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181273/">Rus</a> <br>  In the spring of 2012, looking at the arcade "motorcycles" of his friend, who occupied the top places in the Google Play rating, he also caught fire to do something similar.  The choice fell on the zombies, there are a lot of such games, but I thought to stand out with full-fledged 3d graphics, a garage with the ability to pump technology.  The experience of creating games on the Unity3d engine was already there, but for the first time I did it for mobile devices.  Of course, he did not do it himself, but with the artist, in his free time. <br><br>  <b>Crashlytics for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/crashlytics-android.html">Rus</a> <br>  As promised during the startup acquisition by Twitter, the Crashlytics application error reporting tool has not stopped its development.  In February, he made all his corporate functions free, and today the company released the long-awaited solution for Android applications by running the Android SDK. <br><br>  <b>Distimo: Android is growing, but iOS still leads by a wide margin</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/distimo-android-rastet-ios-lidiruet.html">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b73/bbd/72e/b73bbd72e23b854a73e8f0c4f39df1b8.png"><br>  When it comes to profits from mobile applications, the general opinion is that the App Store rules the world.  Last month, for example, App Annie reported that the App Store for the quarter earned 2.6 times more money than Google Play.  Today, Distimo speaks about the same figures, but also notes steady growth and success of development on Android. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>OPF offers an open description format for Android applications.</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.onepf.org/">Angl</a> <br>  The OpenSource Foundation Platform Foundation (OPF) project, created with the participation of Yandex developers, announces AppDF, a single format for describing Android applications that will facilitate the process of placing them in stores. <br><br>  <b>Authorization in PhoneGap application through Facebook, Vkontakte and Habrahabr</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181007/">Rus</a> <br>  In a day of unhurried coding, authorization plug-ins for Facebook, Vkontakte and Habr turned out (most of the time was spent on Google and reading API documentation). <br><br>  <b>Django: Using QR codes to quickly enter the site from mobile devices</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181093/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f10/0c9/fd3/f100c9fd39a545ad4e8c856f6a842e12.png" alt="image"><br>  If you have a website that is often used from mobile devices (such as phones and tablet PCs), then you may have wondered how to implement quick login - so that the user does not need to enter either the website address, or the login and password ( or E-mail and password). <br><br>  <b>How to beat Candy Crush Saga</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/181332/">Rus</a> <br>  King's Candy Crush Saga is at the top of the chart of the most profitable apps thanks to several key features.  The game is extremely accessible, since you can play the game both online and offline.  She has a low entry barrier and the game to the fullest uses virality.  The graphics and sound in the game are beautiful and extremely attractive.  It is also impossible not to mention the progress on the basis of the card, which provides players with the relevance of the game even if they play it once a year.  So how can you beat this game? <br><br>  <b>Mobile art trends on the example of top-grossing games</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181502/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf3/c03/b17/bf3c03b17a71078df0d4df1fda2854ad.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A place in the top ten grossing is almost the ultimate dream of every developer.  What can an artist do to promote the game in this direction?  First, you need to look at those who are already in the top, study and draw conclusions, catch general trends, development vector - since there is no sense in repeating what has already been done, it is important to be able to create something that will be popular tomorrow. <br><br>  <b>Amazon has opened its authentication</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/login-with-amazon.html">Rus</a> <br>  It will allow 200 million Amazon users to safely access applications, games, websites and other services using existing registration data. <br><br>  <b>Google will stop paying developers to Argentina</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-prekratit-vyiplatyi-argentinyi.html">Rus</a> <br>  From the end of June, Android application developers from Argentina will stop receiving all payments from Google.  This applies to both the purchase of applications and the payment of purchases within applications - the American company will cease all monetary relations with developers from the country. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>Playnomics: 0.0077% of players give 33% of money to F2P games</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.playnomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Playnomics-Q1-Engagement-Report.pdf">English (PDF)</a> <br>  Playnomics has published a quarterly study on the involvement of players in games.  The company's data is based on "50 million social, casual and mobile players in the Playnomics gaming network," they were collected in Q1 2013. <br><br><h4>  Devices </h4><br><br>  <b>Smartphones on Atom.</b>  <b>Achievements and prospects</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/181117/">Rus</a> <br>  It has been about a year since the ‚Äúsecond coming‚Äù of Intel to the mobile processor market - this period is not enough to formulate far-reaching conclusions, but something can already be understood. <br><br>  <b>ARM as the basis for new supercomputers</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181011/">Rus</a> <br>  The Spanish BRC Center (Barcelona Supercomputing Center) conducted a study, according to which in the future ARM chips, similar to those used in modern smartphones, will be able to replace more expensive and energy-intensive x86 architecture processors in supercomputers and servers.  The results of the study were presented in the article ‚ÄúAre mobile processors ready for HPC?‚Äù Presented to the public at EDAworkshop13, held this month in Dresden. <br><br>  <b>Smartphone with Full HD screen for $ 200?</b>  <b>Easy!</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/180179/">Rus</a> <br>  Meet  iOcean X7 is a 5 inch smartphone with a screen resolution of 1920x1080 pixels.  4 Cortex-A7 cores, 2 SIM cards, a good 8 megapixel camera and all this at a price of just over $ 200. <br><br>  <b>Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 - one in the field is still a warrior!</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/181424/">Rus</a> <br>  I managed to use both the iPad mini and Galaxy Note 8.0.  But I chose the last one.  Because I do not like iOS and that's it!  I will tell you about my experience of communicating with Note 8.0 in the article. <br><br>  <b>Overview of the smartphone on Android, which works for a week!</b>  <b>Highscreen boost</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181496/">Rus</a> <br>  What is more important in your smartphone?  Maybe its large user-friendly display?  And perhaps its fast internet?  Perhaps his chips and camera type frills?  Surely, a lot of applications for work and entertainment, which are always in your pocket?  But surely this is all for nothing when your smartphone shines with a red diode and writes ‚Äúconnect the charger‚Äù! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181816/</a></p>
