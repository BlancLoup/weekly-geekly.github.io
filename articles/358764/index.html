  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fintech-digest: blockchain-smartphone from HTC, determination of solvency by phone brand and regulation of ICO in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://habr.com/company/alfa/blog/358764/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cm/6d/tj/cm6dtj-f1nhkikevjgrn5p7epl4.jpeg"><br></a> <br>  As always after protracted holidays, the recovery of the activity of most companies is not proceeding at such a rapid pace.  Nevertheless, by the end of this week, everything gradually returned to normal and the news became more.  Digest let's start with the news about the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/htc_exodus_is_a_blockchain_smartphone_arriving_in_october-news-31079.php">blockchain smartphone from HTC</a> . <br><br>  The Taiwanese company was the first to decide to introduce a smartphone, which is both a communications center and a mobile wallet that allows you to simultaneously store several types of cryptocurrencies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The advantage is that all the phones of this model will be combined into a single blockchain network, which will allow Exodus owners to carry out operations with each other without any problems.  The device, according to plan, supports most important protocols, including Bitcoin, Ethereum or Lightning Network.  Every phone on the network is a node.  According to the developers, the smartphone performs the role of a node, which is similar to the role of a PC at the dawn of the spread of the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_w/7e/on/_w7eoniftq7edqx7abevzkcj9t4.jpeg">
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      Another aspect is that Exodus will support the work of blockchain-based applications.  Presented by the phone developer HTC Vive Phil Chen.  According to him, it will be possible to buy a phone for bitcoins or broadcast.  Unfortunately, the characteristics of the smartphone are not disclosed, which is somewhat distressing.  Soon, HTC pledged to provide more data. <br><br>  And representatives of the US National Bureau of Economic Research <a href="https://rb.ru/story/telefon-i-credit/">published the results of an</a> analysis of 270 thousand purchases that were made from October 2015 to December 2016 in the German online store. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/ew/uh/mxewuhqk2sdjgs-vrmbs6d813yq.png"><br><br>  This resource went to meet the researchers and made it possible to study the features of the digital footprint that buyers left in this store.  In total, scientists have learned to distinguish 10 different types of information that constitute the ‚Äúdigital tail‚Äù.  First of all, this is the type of device, then - OS, attitude to advertising, shopping, using e-mail and other things. <br><br>  As it turned out, all these parameters can be used to assess the solvency of the user.  The easiest way to do this is by phone model - as it turned out, iPhone owners are more reliable as borrowers.  If a person leaves an order from the phone, not the PC, he has a higher chance of giving up credit obligations (delays, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mp/bn/yc/mpbnycxh-3qxv_63bcfoejldp3e.jpeg"><br><br>  Another negative factor is the use of outdated mail resources.  An interesting conclusion was that users who indicate their own name in an email address are 30% more reliable than those who write something ‚Äúkotiklove2014‚Äù.  According to the scientists who carried out the project, the same digital footprint, which was mentioned above, allows us to conclude that the client‚Äôs solvency is no worse than the history of his credit. <br><br>  Speaking of loans.  German online bank <a href="https://www.bitbond.com/resources/cryptocurrency-small-business-need-know/">Bitbond announced</a> that it will soon begin to provide loans to its users in Bitcoin and Altcoin.  According to the management of the bank that outlined such a move, the organization will be able to bypass the SWIFT system, which will make it possible to provide funds to borrowers within a couple of minutes or even seconds.  After receiving the cryptocurrency, it will be automatically exchanged for the host currency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/b6/2n/ljb62nk_zcwhtfnsq3jardvomri.jpeg"><br><br>  And finally, the news about the <a href="https://forklog.com/pravitelstvo-rossii-uprostit-zakonoproekty-reguliruyushhie-blokchejn-i-ico/">regulation of ICO in Russia</a> .  According to some analysts, the bill can be passed already in the first reading.  The document, developed by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank, contains definitions for such concepts as "cryptocurrency", mining "token".  In addition, it sets out the general rules for regulating the ICO-market.  On this occasion, Dmitry Medvedev has already managed to state that ‚Äúthe development of digital technologies in the financial sector has reached a new stage‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358764/</a></p>
