It seemed a bit unfair to me, it was all too easy.  (My answer to the question why this happened is at the end of the article.)

      In fact, among the total number of things that surround us, there are very few of those that we have learned to do with ease.  More often, everything new passes through our initial rejection and resistance.  I work in the field of information technology and have repeatedly seen that CRM, ERP, document management, corporate portal - so that you do not implement new, you will always meet resistance. <br><br>  How to help people adopt innovation and change the way they work?  To answer this question, I appeal to <a href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html">Dr. BJ Fogg</a> 's <a href="http://www.behaviormodel.org/index.html">behavioral model</a> . <br><br>  For a change in behavior to occur, it is necessary that three elements coincide at the same time: <b>Motivation</b> , <b>Ability,</b> and <b>Trigger</b> .  If the habit does not change, it means that at least one of these three components is missing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="700" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/39b/9cd/146/39b9cd146c67baa5941fb21376dcc6ba.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>Motivation</b> models are different.  For example, <a href="http://www.pryaniky.com/ru/Home">Gingerbread</a> or whip.  Or two carrots ( <a href="http://slobodin.livejournal.com/129666.html">they say</a> , they work equally effectively in both horizontal and vertical directions).  In our work we use our own model of motivation, which I will discuss later.  In general, motivators can be divided into internal and external.  Internal can include curiosity, comfort, competitiveness, recognition and a number of other factors not related to external circumstances.  Intrinsic motivators are difficult to change, they must be realized and tried to be used. <br><br>  External motivators are financial rewards, public recognition, promotion, or threat of dismissal.  External motivators can be artificially created, but they work in a shorter term than internal ones. <br><br>  <b>Ability</b> (it can also be called Ability or Simplicity) is how easy it is for you to make a behavior change.  Do you need any skills that you have not yet mastered?  Or maybe additional time or additional mental / physical effort is required?  Interestingly, ability is not a property of a product, it is a property of a user.  I find it difficult to lift a lot of weight, but the weightlifter does not.  At the same time, I suppose that it is more difficult for him to write an article in a blog than for me. <br><br>  To increase skills, you need to teach people.  Here are relevant trainings, books, educational videos, technical support, etc. <br><br>  <b>A trigger</b> is an event that forces us to change our behavior.  For example, a reminder, message, personal request, to-do list, phrase heard or image seen.  With different levels of motivation and skills, different types of triggers are used: <br><br><ul><li>  If the motivation and abilities are high, then a ‚Äúsignal‚Äù trigger is needed, for example, ‚Äúlet's go and buy iPhones in the States‚Äù <br></li><li>  If the motivation is high, and there are not enough skills, you need an ‚Äúinstruction‚Äù trigger, such as ‚Äúdo it once, do two, do three‚Äù. <br></li><li>  If the motivation is low, and there are enough abilities, a ‚Äúinsight‚Äù trigger is needed.  This is <a href="http://supereon.ru/blog/esn_oilgas/">how</a> I felt such a love for corporate social networks that I even write a blog about it. <br></li></ul><br>  What to do if you lack both motivation and abilities?  First of all, raise motivation, and then use it to learn new skills. <br><br>  <b>Practical example number 1.</b>  Let's say we implement CRM.  To be honest, spending one hour a week and entering data into the system is easy.  But a great demotivator works - I really do not want to share the contacts of my clients with the company.  So you need to raise motivation.  You can encourage (or force) sales in an external material way - reward or threat of dismissal, as well as in an external non-material way - a honor roll, a reprimand from the manager, protection of the transaction to the first person to enter information about it into the CRM system.  A friend of mine specializes in implementing sales management systems.  He says that after two or three sales cycles carried out in the CRM system, sellers have an insight.  They themselves begin to see how organizing their data helps them sell better.  This, of course, does not work at all, because there are different types of sellers.  But it works for the main part. <br><br>  <b>Practical example number 2.</b>  Suppose we want our corporate portal to be not only beautiful, but also a visited place.  The first step towards employee engagement is that employees post their photos in a user profile.  To do this, you can organize a competition for the best profile.  In light of the above model, it is necessary to assemble three components: motivation, skills / simplicity, and triggers. <br><br><ul><li>  The motivators can be the recognition of colleagues, the desire to look beautiful, competitiveness, maybe even social pressure from your colleagues. <br></li><li>  To make it easy for people to fill out a profile, you should publish a video about creating your profile, assign different nominations, invite a professional photographer (girls will appreciate it), arrange a vote. <br></li><li>  Triggers can be a letter with the announcement of the event, the date of arrival of the photographer in your office, the date of completion of the competition, announcements with examples of photos of your colleagues. <br></li></ul><br>  Here you have a plan of action. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  Promised thought about Apple.  I received the answer to my question after reading the well-known <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/7363365/">book</a> about the life of Steve Jobs.  From it I revealed two thoughts.  First, Steve Jobs created his product, almost two decades building up a concept, and then an image of a new product, bit by bit.  This is a colossal work, multiplied by the genius of the creator.  Second, within the structures subordinate to Steve Jobs, he was the sole ruler and allowed himself all sorts of methods of motivation. <br><br>  And yet successfully implemented the changes. <br><br>  <b>Vladimir Ivanitsa</b> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ivanitsa"><u>Facebook</u></a> |  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivanitsa"><u>LinkedIn</u></a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299752/</a></p>
