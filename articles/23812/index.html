Pupkin, 2008</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Another little thing that is not harmful to pay attention - registration of the copyright protection mark (which is often illiterately called "copyright").  Unfortunately, on websites, this element of the basement of the page is often put ‚Äúto be‚Äù, and they make out who in that much.  However, in this regard there are not just established rules, but the whole <a href="http://www.ifap.ru/library/gost/7012003.pdf">GOST R 7.0.1‚Äî2003</a> (PDF, 652 KB). <br><br>  There is nothing difficult in the design of the copyright protection mark, you just need to know certain rules. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  So, copyright itself arises by the very fact of the creation of an intellectual work.  For the emergence and exercise of copyright does not require registration of the work or compliance with any formalities.  Accordingly, the publisher of the work (and in the case of the site, the owner of this site) forms the mark independently in accordance with the existing legislation and the agreement with the copyright holder of the published work.

      The copyright notice <em>must necessarily</em> include the following elements. <ul><li>  The symbol of copyright protection is the Latin letter ‚ÄúC‚Äù in a circle, ¬©.  Please note that it is not good to use a relic of the typewriter era ‚Äú¬©‚Äù.  The ¬© symbol has a decimal code of 169 in Unicode, hexadecimal - 00A9.  Accordingly, you can use any of the mnemonics &amp; # 169 ;, &amp; xa9 ;, &amp; copy ;.  Also in Windows, it can be entered using the numeric keypad by typing on it while holding down the Alt key a sequence of numbers 0, 1, 6, 9. </li><li>  The name of the natural person or the name of the legal entity that owns the copyright.  The name of an individual is usually indicated in the form of a surname and initials, and the name of a legal person is in the form established during its registration (the form of ownership is indicated in the form of an abbreviation: LLC, OJSC, CJSC, etc.). </li><li>  In the event that the right is not protected on the main text, but only on the design, translation of text, accompanying text, etc., then the object of the protection of the right is indicated.  If the rights to the main text are protected, the object of protection of the right can be omitted. </li><li>  Year of first publication of the work.  At the same time, adding the date with the word ‚Äúyear‚Äù or the abbreviation ‚Äúg.‚Äù Is not required. </li></ul>  Putting a dot at the end of the copyright sign is not necessary. <br><br>  The rules on the websites remain the same.  However, since materials can be published on the site at different times and in different years (and usually it happens), you can use a date range, for example, ‚Äú1998‚Äì2008‚Äù (do not forget that the range uses a dash &amp; mdash ;, but not hyphen, and it does not beat off with spaces from numbers).  GOST does not imply such use, but it corresponds to both the meaning and spirit of GOST and the established tradition. <br><br>  A copyright sign set without a copyright holder, as I believe, does not make much sense (this was done, for example, in Habr√© in the basement of pages), since it carries unclear meaning and has no legal force.  Therefore, in the case of social networks or collective blogs, one should either issue a copyright notice at the end of each entry, or put a mark in the basement and, however, indicate in it the object of the protection of the right (for example, ‚Äúwebsite design‚Äù).  Specifying a nickname as the owner also does not make much sense, since it does not identify the right holder. <br><br><h2>  Design examples on websites </h2><br><h3>  Right </h3><ul><li>  ¬© V.I. Pupkin, 2000 </li><li>  ¬© Pupkin V.I., 2000‚Äî2005 </li><li>  ¬© Horns and Hooves, 2000‚Äî2005 </li><li>  ¬© Site Design.  Horns and Hoofs LLC, 2002 </li><li>  ¬© Ivanov I.I., translation into Russian, 2006 </li></ul><h3>  Wrong </h3><ul><li>  ¬© 2005 </li><li>  ¬© V.I. Pupkin, 2000 </li><li>  2008 ¬© V.I. Pupkin </li><li>  (c) Pupkin V.I., 2000‚Äî2005 </li><li>  ¬© Pupkin V.I., 2000-2005 </li><li>  ¬© 2006, Pupkin V.I. </li><li>  ¬© Horns and Hoofs, 2000‚Äî2005. </li><li>  Copyright ¬© 1997‚Äî2008 Yandex </li><li>  ¬© Futurico 2000‚Äî2005 </li><li>  ¬© - = MeGaPiHaR = - </li></ul><h2>  Addition: the need to use the mark </h2><br>  The question also arises, is it necessary to use the copyright protection sign?  There are a number of <a href="http://www.spbpravo.ru/comm.php%3Fstate%3D33137">articles</a> on this topic on the Internet. <br><br>  In short, the answer is: it is not necessary to use a sign, and it is better not to use any more than a crookedly designed one.  :) <br><br>  According to Russian norms, as well as in accordance with the Universal Copyright Convention (which Russia shares), copyright arises at the time of creation of the work and it is not required to register it additionally.  The author <em>may</em> use the copyright notice to indicate that the copyright of the work is protected.  The absence of such a mark on a copy of a work by both a Russian and a foreign author does not deprive this work of copyright protection. The legal meaning of a copyright protection mark is only indirect: it indicates that the person who affixed this sign considers himself the copyright owner and declares it .  The copyright notice alone does not create any additional rights. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23812/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23812/</a></p>
