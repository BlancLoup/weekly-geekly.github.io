  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skeleton in the closet, or a site for $ 200</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once again, rummaging through the Internet, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.legco.net/">blog</a> , to be honest, a regular blog, hundreds of which, but here‚Äôs one article really hooked me, made me think ... And may the author forgive me, but publish it here, read it and think a lot ... <br><br>  Almost every webmaster has his skeletons in the closet - sites that he does not indicate in his portfolio.  This is his shame, his pain, this is the past, and often the present - these are sites for $ 200. <br><br>  Why do we do them?  At first, because I want to add at least something to the list of 2-item works, to feel like a ‚Äúreal webmaster‚Äù.  Then - because the portfolio already seems to have, but the name does not exist, and there is no money, and you write the code to a random customer because he has today the "mood to make a website" to his stall.  Later - because a friend asked to help a friend - "he is a good guy, but there is no money at all, he will certainly pay a little ...".  Or they simply ran out of money, but a regular district graphoman is calling by announcement with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãperpetuating his talent by Friday, and certainly on a yellow background. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More than half of these creations die on their own - they were not needed by anyone at the time of creation, they turned into a burden to the owners after a couple of weeks, the customer didn‚Äôt really know - why the hell needed it, just undignified now without a website, he heard it on TV.  As a new, inexpensive and stupid toy - played, threw it out, now you can filter through your lip - ‚Äúthey said that they‚Äôve made a website for me, I‚Äôd have no use, I‚Äôd better go to the tavern‚Äù.

      And the site hangs on the hosting paid for one year in advance, with empty sections, and 3 paragraphs of ‚ÄúLorem ipsum‚Äù in the section ‚ÄúAbout the Company‚Äù, and 4 counters that the customer carefully chose - the best of the best, not every rating can be trusted to us, scary face to say - our corporation! <br><br>  The smaller part has a much heavier fate, like a boomerang toad - abandoned, after some time it returns and begins to choke. <br><br>  ‚ÄúGood guy,‚Äù the TK to which you yourself wrote from his muffled description in the handset, starts calling and complaining that ‚ÄúI presented this module somewhat differently, and it seems we agreed that there will be a catalog, and I also thought you will do it quickly, yes, that would be nice in it ... ‚Äù- how can you refuse such a pretty girl, who is he a professionally good guy?  And the site really turned out to be good, but it‚Äôs no longer worth 200, and not a thousand, and it‚Äôs a pity to leave. <br><br>  The uncle from the stall comes to his behe and long and tediously twists his fingers, unable to explain even to himself - why in two hundred he wants to demand 400% sales growth from you, but dreams, dreams, you wanted it, and then, I paid, where are the visitors? <br><br>  And a friend of acquaintances, an honored teacher to whom you drew a hamster for free, and for the third year you draw one thing or another - he is indignant and perplexed - it turns out you promised to translate his unique author's methodology into English in the spring and he should have been invited to Oxford to read lectures, "this is outrageous, young man, I have seen everything, but ...".  And you have not been young for a long time, but he got used to everything around him and everyone owes him, but he doesn‚Äôt owe anyone, and in general this is rudeness, not to fulfill his promises! <br><br>  And the day passes, evening comes, you realize that 12 hours already at the computer, the eyes are red, you did not do anything you planned, but you made 5 edits, added 2 modules, restored the base to someone, somewhere else started 2 e-mail addresses, advised a friend of a friend‚Äôs acquaintance to me for half an hour, didn‚Äôt earn a penny, and tomorrow it turns out that you will work again because you feel guilty before someone, and you owe someone, did you promise? <br><br>  The toad boomerang feels great, and the innocent souls of sites that died in infancy come to you in a dream and beg to check how their TIC and PR have changed after the update. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47478/</a></p>
