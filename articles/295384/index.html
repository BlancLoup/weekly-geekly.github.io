Westerly winds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/864/068/ab8/864068ab8d608cd837987c69c2ad02f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For more than a decade, September 20, recruiters celebrate their professional holiday, and the recruitment market itself in Russia is already more than a quarter of a century.  But among professionals, it is still customary to speak about the HR consulting market as an immature and not fully formed market.  To create a full-fledged industry, 25 years, of course, is not enough, especially in such a huge country as ours.  Even in Moscow, the capital of our country and the main business center of Russia, there are a little more than 300 agencies, whereas there are more than 15,000 in London alone, that is, FIFTY times more! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Patient is more alive than dead</b> </h5><br>  Some positive trends in the recruitment market in Russia already exist - recruitment agencies have become serious players in the consulting business, a certain professional community has been formed, candidates have ceased to fear meetings with recruiters, and corporations - and for a long time not only Western - allocate a separate budget line for paying for recruiting services. <br>  But in terms of the main indicator of the development of the recruitment market (the number of candidates employed through agencies relative to the total number of jobs), Russia is extremely far from world standards.  For example, according to the international study of the social network LinkedIn for 2015 (according to surveys of more than 4,000 professionals responsible for internal selection in various corporations), in the UK more than half of employment in the company takes place through professional agencies.  This is one of the highest rates in the world; in the USA, by the way, the figure is noticeably lower - only 28%.  Of course, this statistics should be approached with caution, but for Russia even such data cannot be found. <br>  Source: <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-tips/global-recruiting-trends-home">https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/resources/recruiting-tips/global-recruiting-trends-home</a> <br><br>  Where does such a high percentage of penetration of recruitment services in Western countries come from?  On the one hand, of course, this is the general tendency to outsource non-core functions for a company, that is, to specialized partners and contractors.  In a highly competitive environment, where there is a constant struggle for quality, companies prefer to pay and save time in order to concentrate on their core business. <br>  If we hope that the Russian business will develop very slowly, but still follow the Western model, then with some caution we can assume that in the field of recruitment services market in our country it will be possible to trace the tendencies characteristic of highly developed countries.

    <h5>  <b>Trends - 2015</b> </h5><br><h6>  <b>1. The increase in the amount of information processed when searching for candidates.</b> </h6><br>  The Internet and social media have a huge impact on the methods and mechanisms of both job search and attracting candidates.  A few years ago, collecting recommendations by telephone was almost the only way to collect information about a candidate, but today for both the recruiter and the employer there are new sources: pages on social networks, profiles on forums and blogs, comments in professional communities. <br>  Similarly, social networks are becoming the most important communication channel for employers and the strongest tool for promoting their own brand.  The position of Digital Officer - that is, the employee responsible for communication via the online platform - is gradually appearing in the Russian job list. <br>  New channels of communication with candidates increase the reach of the audience: on the one hand, recruiters have a choice and an opportunity to convey information to a large number of potential candidates in the "one click".  But there is also a downside to the medal: a sharply increasing number of applications, appeals and summaries that need to be reviewed, sorted and answered. <br><br><h6>  <b>2.Rost number of specialized agencies</b> </h6><br>  Of the 15,000 mentioned London recruitment companies, the majority are highly specialized agencies.  Specialization can be different, and may depend on the business area for which the agency works - for example, the chemical industry, and may be based on the profile of the provided specialists - for example, the agency selects only accountants. <br>  In Russia, this trend began to be traced relatively recently and at first manifested itself in the fact that large personnel companies began to create narrow divisions within the general departments for the selection.  But some specialized recruitment agencies (except for the search for domestic staff ‚Äî nannies and housekeepers) were the first to appear in the leading segment of our economy - in the field of IT. <br>  However, even the most advanced Russian IT recruitment agency still does not have such an approach, which is characteristic of the American market. <br>  <i>Recently, employees of the St. Petersburg agency <a href="http://ichar.ru/">ihar</a> selected Data Scientists candidates for an international outsourcing IT company.</i>  <i>This sphere is only developing in Russia, and so far there are few specialists.</i>  <i>The customer, who is in the USA himself, was anxious at the start of work and was surprised when a suitable specialist was found.</i>  <i>Why?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It turned out that it was unusual for a customer to give such an order ‚Äúonly‚Äù to a specialized IT agency even by American standards: IT recruiters in the US rarely get such vacancies to work, because</i>  <i>In this segment, individual Data Scientist recruiters specialize, who know the subject area so well that they have been friends with representatives of the profession for years, know who works where and ... Such a recruiter does not need to look for a candidate and the candidate‚Äôs representation is equivalent to the recommendation from the employer. and trust the opinion of a highly specialized recruiter customers.</i> <br><br><h6>  <b>3. Outside the office: winning mobile technology</b> </h6><br>  All over the world, professionals note that people are more and more often solving problems with the help of mobile phones.  If ten years ago, the absence of an office ‚Äúcity‚Äù telephone number put the company's reputation in question, today it has become customary to indicate on Skype a business card. <br>  Negotiations, meetings, seminars - everything can be done without turning on the computer and not wasting time on the road.  With the development of mobile technologies, more and more workflows can be conducted outside the office, and job search is no exception. <br>  The portal of job search without own application is doomed to be on the sidelines even in Russia.  As in all developing countries, even in the remote villages of our vast Motherland, you can meet the unemployed with the latest generation smartphone ... <br><br><h6>  <b>4. Video revolution: change the format of resumes and vacancy announcements</b> . </h6><br>  Employees of recruitment agencies in Russia have been practicing video interviews on Skype for quite a long time, but only relatively recently did the HR people themselves treat this method with confidence.  As always, the pioneers were IT companies, primarily American ones, for whom this type of communication has long been familiar. <br>  However, the global trend goes further - today, instead of dry vacancy announcements, companies are increasingly publishing video appeals to future candidates.  Advanced users are already beginning to create their resume in the format of video presentations: it is quick, easy and well remembered. <br>  Want to know the future - ask an IT specialist <br><br>  Not only in Russia, but throughout the world, IT business is ahead of other sectors of the economy in terms of "advanced" and the level of penetration of modern technologies.  Many global trends in the field of staff recruitment originated in IT companies, from where they spread to other business segments. <br>  However, paradoxically, no matter how recently it has been said that soon the entire staffing will be automated and go online, and recruiting agencies will become unnecessary to anyone, in fact it turns out to be exactly the opposite: today, the help of professionals is needed even more, and the staff of 15,000 London recruitment companies do not sit without work. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.talentculture.com/talent-management/5-key-recruitment-trends-for-2015/">http://www.talentculture.com/talent-management/5-key-recruitment-trends-for-2015/</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.standbytalent.com/10-digital-recruiting-trends-2015/">http://www.standbytalent.com/10-digital-recruiting-trends-2015/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295384/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295384/</a></p>
