Results of the past year and plans for 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  To set the right goals for a new working year, it is important to understand what trends have emerged in the past year.  This is what we are going to do today. <br><br>  <b>Programming language number 1 in the world</b> <br><br>  2016 has passed under the banner of <b>JavaScript</b> .  Today this programming language is the most popular in the world.  Its latest version, <b>JavaScript / ECMAScript6,</b> is already compatible with all key browsers and Node.js.  Of course, there are still companies that have not made the transition and are working with older versions of JavaScript, but this is a matter of time.

      <br>
      The transition from previous versions of JavaScript to a new one naturally affected the relevance and income of programmers in this area. <br><br>  It should be noted that the steady growth of income programmers JavaScript is observed all the past five years.  Their salaries are the envy of specialists in many industries.  A beginner has the right to expect a salary of at least 45-60t.r.  and experts grow up to earn 400 000 r.  per month.  <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/professions/web_developer%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_27.01.17%26utm_content%3Dweb_developer">This is what you need to learn!</a> <br><br>  True, if we talk about love, and not about calculation, many programmers (according to polls) feel sympathy for Rust, Shift and F #.  Let's see what will be the alignment of forces this year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>From each according to his capabilities, to each according to his needs</b> <br><br>  Another steady trend of the past year was the division of labor.  It's about using third-party resources for storing data and borrowing ready-made items for their larger projects.  And it is right.  Much more comfortable when the Back-end is a quality service, not a headache.  At this time, Front-end programmers can safely do their work. <br><br>  By the way, the demand for Front-end programmers, who are often web designers at the same time, is growing steadily. <br><br>  The past year has given web designers a good pay increase: in 2015, the maximum patch in Moscow was 130,000 rubles, and in 2016 it reached 170,000 rubles.  A web designer at the Junior level can claim to be 45-83 thousand rubles, which is also higher than in 2015. <br>  Good news: you can learn the basics of <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/webdesign_basics%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_27.01.17%26utm_content%3Dwebdesign_basics">web design</a> for free!  And then ... then everything depends only on your commitment. <br><br>  <b>Container systems for maximum convenience</b> <br><br>  Optimization has affected other processes: the popularity of services such as Docker and Packer has grown.  Now you can upload and test applications much faster.  This is possible thanks to the lightweight container virtualization platform. <br><br>  From now on, work with container systems is an integral part of the standard set of developer tools. <br><br>  <b>New view on functional programming languages</b> <br><br>  The rapid growth in the number of smartphones and other gadgets, as well as high demands on the speed of their work, require new solutions.  As a consequence - the increasing popularity of functional programming languages, such as Haskell, Clojure and Scala. <br><br>  Functional programming makes it easier and more comfortable to work in parallel with various software elements, which gives it a significant advantage over object-oriented programming. <br><br>  <b>And programming has its own mod</b> <br><br>  Material design, developed by Google, in the past year has become widespread.  It is used in Android, Google Play Music, YouTube, Chrome, ChromeOS, AdSense, Drive and more. <br><br>  Those, however, many platforms continue to create their own design, not using the approach of Google.  More interesting to observe and compare the results! <br><br>  <b>Interesting data can be peeped in a large-scale study "Stack Overflow"</b> <br><br>  It turned out that the <b>typical developer-2016</b> is a 29 year old man.  He actively uses JavaScript and has <b>6.5 years of experience</b> . <br><br>  The absolute majority of programmers have a permanent job.  Only 7.1% of freelancers are even less than students! <br><br>  A curious fact: the majority of respondents stated that they <b>got a job thanks to the recommendation of a friend</b> .  And we are not surprised - at the <a href="https://geekbrains.ru/%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_campaign%3Dpost_27.01.17%26utm_content%3Dmain">GeekBrains</a> courses communication has always been given a big role. <br><br>  <b>69% of developers are self-taught</b> !  43% are bachelors in computer science or related fields.  And only 2% of developers have a doctorate. <br><br>  What was required to prove: a diploma is not a diagnosis, and the absence of a specialized education is not a sentence.  If you wish, you can always learn a new profession and build a successful career. <br><br>  What do you remember the past year for you, and what peaks do you intend to conquer this year? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320604/</a></p>
