After the autumn software update, it also became available to Xperia XZ Premium owners.  The peculiarity of the software is that only the main camera of the smartphone and software algorithms are used, that is, no additional accessories or special backgrounds are needed to separate the scan object.  In using the function, you can figure it out yourself (it is not difficult) or use our <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/296407/">instructions</a> .  We advise you to try if you have one of the compatible smartphones on hand, otherwise, look at what Sony Xperia XZ1 and Xperia XZ1 Compact smartphones are capable of, and how they can diversify social networking. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/4s/es/zg4sesamrtekx_hhubfnu52lbsg.jpeg"><br><br>  The created models can be printed on a 3D printer, set as wallpaper or game avatar, send to friends.  But there is another usage scenario - the creation of gifs with a scanned face in Shadow Avatar.  The application is available on Google Play for any smartphones and allows you to work with ready-made collections of animated images, and the most interesting functionality ‚Äî adding a face from the library of scanned models to the gifs ‚Äî has become exclusive to the Sony Xperia flagships.  These smartphones provide an opportunity to take a high-quality and realistic model as a basis, and the Shadow Avatar neural network technologies provide precise segmentation of the model and the integration of the user's face into GIF-animation or video.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2s/1i/mf/2s1imfzrw1dqsjbb7r0fn7y20jw.jpeg"><br><br>  Immediately after launch, Shadow Avatar asks a question: use your 3D model or one of the five heroes of the demonstration catalog.  The most interesting is the first option, so we will tell and show everything using the example of a real person.  First of all, you can make small adjustments to the appearance: choose the appropriate shape of the head, body type and skin color.  Then you need to decide on clothing from a pre-prepared list: themed outfits (now the Super Bowl), casual kits, classics, and cool options such as a firefighter or policeman costume. <br><br>  After the appearance go to the location.  At the moment, you can choose from 13 backgrounds, both fictional type "Anime", and actually existing, such as "London".  We decided to send our hero to Bollywood - not because we love Indian cinema, but simply because we can. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m8/wh/uq/m8whuq8qldr82mcihpqp9krpdfq.jpeg"><br><br>  There remains the final stage of creating a basic personalized video, this is the movement of a virtual person.  There are three categories available: funny, dance and sport.  After all these actions, the resulting ‚Äúavatar‚Äù is dancing non-stop on the screen.  On the one hand, this is part of your Shadow Avatar profile, on the other, a template that can now be used to create three types of content: Music video, GIF, and Hollywood. <br><br>  <b>What is a music video?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ei/4u/eq/ei4ueqkjgvvye3dkpb31sfzi4dc.jpeg"><br><br>  This mode in Shadow Avatar partly repeats the process of creating the avatar itself.  First, the user is prompted to select animation and music, then background and outfit, specify the trajectory of the camera, optionally add an inscription and start recording. <br><br>  After clicking on the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button, the video recording starts, which can be stopped at any time and get the finished video with the ability to save to the device gallery or send to instant messengers and social networks. <br><br>  <b>What is GIF</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/93/ee/j4/93eej4jdyatroqej5o1pcjlj76a.jpeg"><br><br>  This section is a hit Shadow Avatar.  If a dancing 3D model with your face can quickly get bored, then the gif section will ‚Äúcatch‚Äù for a long time.  In this mode, it is proposed to take GIF with popular memes or famous characters as a basis (the list is updated regularly) and add your face to them.  Such animation, added to the dialogue in time, will be brighter and more effective than any of the coolest stickers. <br><br>  Advice: so that before sending a gif there is not too long a dramatic pause in the dialogue and you do not miss a good moment, it is better to make a reserve in advance for different situations.  Save in the memory of the smartphone 10-15 different animations, but at the same time, you should not abuse the content from Shadow Avatar.  The value of personalized GIF and video is to use at any opportunity (for example, instead of the usual smiley), and fall into the most successful moments. <br><br>  <b>What is "Hollywood"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zy/jn/ir/zyjnirjyum9_vmx2hwrogasv0rc.jpeg"><br><br>  The third mode of using Shadow Avatar is scenes of famous films in which you can put yourself.  Developers use three-dimensional graphics (so that the face model is not out of the general style), and the issue of copyright is decided by free retelling of the general style of the films instead of literal citation.  For example, Game of Crowns refers us to the heroes of Westeros, Bullet Time beats the Matrix, and Star Knight fights the Jedi. <br><br>  Tip: If creating a personalized video and GIF requires a 3D model scanned for Sony Xperia XZ1, Xperia XZ1 Compact or Xperia XZ Premium, then the content exported from Shadow Avatar has no restrictions for distribution on social networks and instant messengers, as well as viewing on devices from other manufacturers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374233/</a></p>
