And of course, I could not resist the temptation to take a picture of her and write a detailed review, especially since this camera will soon begin to be sold in Russia and my impressions will help someone to make a choice.  So, we read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edb/e75/179/edbe751796ebb0f6637f01849970523d.jpg">

      According to one good tradition, all modern devices are packed in rectangular cardboard boxes.  This Kodak camera was also hidden in this package: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfd/bbd/42b/cfdbbd42bb5de719918314db356bcec8.jpg"><br><br>  Just opening the lid you can already see the camera, and looking deeper to discover some more interesting accessories. <br><br>  Kit in box: <br>  Kodak PlaySport¬Æ Camera <br>  -USB cable for computer connection and charging <br>  - USB adapter for ~ 220V network <br>  - HDMI cable <br>  - Cable for TV (AV) <br>  -Adapter for American outlets <br>  -Cord on hand <br>  - Instruction and warranty <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3c/2e3/7c2/d3c2e37c2d947665a3fea0973e362a5d.jpg"><br><br>  And the technical characteristics of the device are as follows: <br><br><img src="http://img532.imageshack.us/img532/7697/89025143.png"><br><br><h4>  Detailed inspection </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/399/1b4/c8e/3991b4c8efb47192ee55baa65013e45a.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the device is very nice.  The back cover is matte, which allows the device not to slip out of your hands.  On the back is a camera lens (F2.8 / f = 5.54mm).  On the front panel of white color there are 5 buttons: joystick + select button, shooting, viewing, deleting, settings.  And of course, the screen with which you will interact. <br><br><img src="http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/783/5201920.jpg"><br><br>  On the right panel is a compartment with connectors for USB, TV / AV and HDMI.  All this is closed by a waterproof cover. <br>  On the left panel - exactly the same compartment, but for the battery and SD-card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bd/621/a97/5bd621a9763cd7a620f24fdcda772e1d.jpg"><br><br>  Below there is a hole for the rope to put the device on the hand in the water, so as not to lose, because  the camera is not floating (rope attached).  And also there is a screw connector for a standard tripod.  By the way, if you think about the possibility of removing from a tripod, the timer is a bit lacking, but on the other hand, this is a video and you can always trim something. <br><br>  In the hands lies like a mobile phone, that is very convenient.  It starts shooting quickly, the delay is less than a second. <br>  Connecting to a computer is very simple - like a flash drive.  If you wish, you can install the program from the camera itself, which will allow you to immediately download videos and photos from the camera for YouTube, Facebook or Twitter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14b/942/180/14b942180c8dfbe48bdcc253c8cf2d46.jpg"><br><br>  Impressions of the camera are very bright, because it is also a replacement for a large video camera and even a replacement for a camera on the phone. <br>  Photos Kodak PlaySport shoots with a resolution of 5mpx, this, of course, is not enough compared to cameras, but to capture a frame, I think, that's enough. <br><br>  There are a lot of modes available in the settings: adjust the time, brightness, sound, recording mode (NTSC, PAL), microphone volume, underwater shooting mode, EIS, face recognition mode. <br><br>  The camera can shoot in 4 resolutions presented: WVGA, HD 720p, HD 720p [60], HD 1080p. <br>  To better demonstrate the capabilities of the camera - shot a test video of average quality. <br>  Just a video of the road on which cars are driving, do not look for a plot or a creative intention. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WRZLgVZSyXA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-WHdsh3V8O4vfLNGXIDvBaChhqw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Crash tests </h4><br><br><img src="http://img143.imageshack.us/img143/2994/5201919.jpg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the camera can safely work in water at a depth of 3 meters.  I would not be me if I had not checked.  It was not! <br>  At first I put the camera down in the sink and followed the advice ‚ÄúJust add water!‚Äù <br>  This is what came of it.  The camera lay at the bottom and played the video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a2/f1f/f77/3a2f1ff779eb7eef16cd46d5076bca3b.jpg"><br><br>  And then I went outside and, since there was no Niagara Falls nearby, I lowered the camera into the pool with a fountain.  And even shot her a video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3o3-bcoO0c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhitELVTnIsH9H77lTy37PWJWXsyRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Price </h4><br>  In Russia, the device is not yet sold, so consider the first-hand review.  Preliminary price - 6990 r.  on pre-order information on <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/4956604/">Ozon.ru.</a>  Although in America it costs about $ 180. <br><br>  I believe that the price for a device of this class is more than adequate.  Now the cheapest soap dish, capable of taking at least some normal photos in this area, and here - a sports video camera! <br><br><h4>  The overall result </h4><br>  Kodak PlaySport is undoubtedly a camera for active people, and not for avid video enthusiasts who shoot high-quality video, exposing lights and scenery for a long time.  The camera should be used according to the principle ‚ÄúGrabbed-clicked-removed‚Äù, good, it allows it, so you manage to capture any cool moments. <br><br>  She really does not miss the water (Kuuuzya proved), she withstood several drops from which she did not suffer at all, both externally and internally.  In the hand is great, various goodies only help (hole for a tripod, rope, etc.) <br><br>  In general, this device is useful for anyone who is somehow connected with sports (by the way, you can attach the camera to a special headgear and remove the trick from the first person).  And also it is useful to those who are constantly in the center of events and should quickly shoot interesting videos, for example, to journalists. <br><br>  By the way, just for fun, this thing can be used by fishermen, putting a camera on a fishing pole and plunging it into a river, taking pictures of how their fish is caught.  (Joke) <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br>  pros <br>  + Water resistant <br>  + Comfort <br>  + Mobility <br>  + Ability to shoot HD <br>  + Secure mount for string + hole for tripod <br>  + HDMI <br>  + Holds the battery for a long time (about 2-4 hours of shooting) <br>  + Adequate price <br><br>  Minuses <br>  - You can not increase the photo view mode <br>  - No connectors for external microphone and headphones <br><br>  Overall rating: 5. The disadvantages are so insignificant for a waterproof small quality video camera that they can be neglected. <br><br><h4>  P.S </h4><br>  These cameras are presented in different color form factors.  Who likes which one more?  (I just liked purple) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6a/34f/44b/e6a34f44b9e45497e56916710eb7b380.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, besides those shown in the picture there is also a black and white version (but it is not known which colors will be available in Russia). <br><br>  And <a href="">here</a> you can rotate the camera 360 degrees and get a better look at everything. <br><br>  I hope you enjoyed it.  Your Kuuuzya. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94270/</a></p>
