An expert on Kubernetes answers. </p><br><blockquote>  Today‚Äôs expert is Daniel Polencic.  Daniel is an instructor and software developer at <a href="https://learnk8s.io/">Learnk8s</a> . </blockquote><p>  If you want to get an answer to your question in the next post, <a href="http://hello%40learnk8s.io/">please contact us by email</a> or on <a href="https://twitter.com/learnk8s">Twitter: @ learnk8s</a> . </p><br><p>  Missed previous posts?  <a href="https://learnk8s.io/visualise-dependencies-kubernetes">Look for them here</a> . </p><br><h3 id="kak-soedinit-klastery-kubernetes-v-raznyh-data-centrah">  How to connect Kubernetes clusters in different data centers? </h3><br><blockquote>  <strong>Briefly</strong> : <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2">Kubefed v2 is coming out soon</a> , and I also advise you to read about <a href="https://github.com/bookingcom/shipper">Shipper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-scheduler">the multi-cluster-scheduler project</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Quite often, infrastructure is replicated and distributed across different regions, especially in controlled environments. </blockquote><p>  <strong>If one region is unavailable, traffic is redirected to another to avoid interruptions.</strong> </p><br><p>  With Kubernetes, you can use a similar strategy and distribute workloads across different regions. </p><br><p>  You can have one or more clusters per team, region, environment, or combination of these elements. </p><br><p>  Your clusters can be located in different clouds and in a local environment. </p><br><p>  <em>But how to plan the infrastructure for such a geographical spread?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Need to create one large cluster across multiple cloud environments across a single network?</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Or start a lot of small clusters and find a way to control and synchronize them?</em> </p><br><h3 id="odin-rukovodyaschiy-klaster">  One management cluster </h3><br><p>  <em>Creating a single cluster across a single network is not so easy.</em> </p><br><p>  Imagine you have a crash, lost connectivity between cluster segments. </p><br><p>  If you have one master server, half the resources will not be able to receive new commands, because they will not be able to contact the master. </p><br><p> And with this you have old routing tables ( <code>kube-proxy</code> cannot load new ones) and no additional pods (kubelet cannot request updates). </p><br><p>  Worse, if Kubernetes does not see the node, it marks it as lost and distributes the missing pods to the existing nodes. </p><br><p>  <strong>As a result, you have twice as many pods.</strong> </p><br><p>  If you make one master server per region, there will be problems with the consensus algorithm in the etcd database.  ( <em>Editor's note. - In fact, the etcd database does not necessarily have to be located on the master servers. It can be run on a separate server group in the same region. However, having received the cluster failure point. But quickly.</em> ) </p><br><p>  etcd uses <a href="http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/">the raft algorithm</a> to match the value before writing it to disk. <br>  That is, most instances must reach consensus before the state can be written to etcd. </p><br><p>  If the delay between etcd instances dramatically increases, as is the case with three etcd instances in different regions, it takes a long time to reconcile the value and write it to disk. <br>  This is reflected in the controllers Kubernetes. </p><br><p>  The controller manager needs more time to learn about the change and write the response to the database. </p><br><p>  And once the controller is not one, but several, it <strong>turns out a chain reaction, and the entire cluster starts working very slowly</strong> . </p><br><p>  etcd is so sensitive to latency that <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/faq.html">the official documentation recommends using an SSD instead of regular hard drives</a> . </p><br><p>  <strong>Now there are no good examples of a large network for one cluster.</strong> </p><br><p>  Basically, the developer community and the SIG-cluster team are trying to figure out how to orchestrate clusters in the same way that Kubernetes orchestrates containers. </p><br><h3 id="variant-1-federaciya-klasterov-s-kubefed">  Option 1: federate clusters with kubefed </h3><br><p>  The official response from SIG-cluster is <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2">kubefed2, a new version of the original client and the kube federation operator</a> . </p><br><p>  For the first time, we managed to manage the collection of clusters as a single object using the kube federation tool. </p><br><p>  The start was good, but in the end, the kube federation did not become popular because it did not support all the resources. </p><br><p>  He supported integrated deliveries and services, but, for example, not StatefulSets. <br>  And the configuration of the federation was transmitted in the form of annotations and did not differ in flexibility. </p><br><p>  <em>Imagine how you can describe the separation of replicas for each cluster in the federation using only annotations.</em> </p><br><p>  <strong>It turned out a complete mess.</strong> </p><br><p>  SIG-cluster did a great job after kubefed v1 and decided to approach the problem from the other side. </p><br><p>  <strong>Instead of annotations, they decided to release a controller that is installed on clusters.</strong>  <strong>It can be customized using Custom Resource Definition (CRD).</strong> </p><br><p>  For each resource that will be included in the federation, you have a custom CRD definition of three sections: </p><br><ul><li>  standard definition of a resource, for example deploy; </li><li>  the <code>placement</code> section, where you determine how the resource will be distributed in the federation; </li><li>  <code>override</code> section, where for a specific resource, you can override the weight and parameters from the placement. </li></ul><br><p>  Here is an example of a combined delivery with placement and override sections. </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">apiVersion: types.federation.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: FederatedDeployment metadata: name: test-deployment namespace: test-namespace spec: template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: replicas: 3 selector: matchLabels: app: nginx template: metadata: labels: app: nginx spec: containers: - image: nginx name: nginx placement: clusterNames: - cluster2 - cluster1 overrides: - clusterName: cluster2 clusterOverrides: - path: spec.replicas value: 5</code> </pre> <br><p>  As you can see, the delivery is distributed over two clusters: <code>cluster1</code> and <code>cluster2</code> . </p><br><p>  The first cluster supplies three replicas, and the second has the value 5. </p><br><p>  If you need more control over the number of replicas, kubefed2 provides a new ReplicaSchedulingPreference object, where replicas can be distributed by weight: </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">apiVersion: scheduling.federation.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: ReplicaSchedulingPreference metadata: name: test-deployment namespace: test-ns spec: targetKind: FederatedDeployment totalReplicas: 9 clusters: A: weight: 1 B: weight: 2</code> </pre> <br><p>  The structure of CRD and API is not yet fully prepared, and active work is underway in the official project repository. </p><br><p>  <strong>Watch for kubefed2, but remember that it is not suitable for a working environment yet.</strong> </p><br><p>  Learn more about kubefed2 from the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/12/12/kubernetes-federation-evolution/">official article about kubefed2</a> in the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/12/12/kubernetes-federation-evolution/">Kubernetes</a> blog and in the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/federation-v2">official repository of the kubefed project</a> . </p><br><h3 id="variant-2-obedinenie-klasterov-v-stile-bookingcom">  Option 2: combine clusters in the style of Booking.com </h3><br><p>  The developers of Booking.com did not deal with kubefed v2, but they invented Shipper, the operator for delivery on several clusters, in several regions and in several clouds. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://github.com/bookingcom/shipper">Shipper is</a> somewhat similar to kubefed2. </p><br><p>  Both tools allow you to customize your deployment strategy across multiple clusters (which clusters are used and how many replicas they have). </p><br><p>  But the <strong>task of Shipper is to reduce the risk of delivery errors.</strong> </p><br><p>  In Shipper, you can define a series of steps that describe the division of replicas between the previous and current deploy and the amount of incoming traffic. </p><br><p>  When you send a resource to a cluster, the Shipper controller expands this change step by step across all the merged clusters. </p><br><p>  <em>And Shipper is very limited.</em> </p><br><p>  For example, <strong>it accepts Helm charts as input</strong> and does not support vanilla resources. <br>  In general terms, Shipper works as follows. </p><br><p>  Instead of the standard delivery, you need to create an application resource that includes the Helm-chart: </p><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">apiVersion: shipper.booking.com/v1alpha1 kind: Application metadata: name: super-server spec: revisionHistoryLimit: 3 template: chart: name: nginx repoUrl: https://storage.googleapis.com/shipper-demo version: 0.0.1 clusterRequirements: regions: -

However, it is quite risky, because here everything rests on magic. </p><br><p>  But if Shipper tries, in the main, to mitigate the effects of supply, multi-cluster-scheduler performs more general tasks and is probably better suited for batch jobs. </p><br><p>  It does not have an advanced incremental delivery mechanism. </p><br><p>  More about multi-cluster-scheduler can be found on <a href="https://learnk8s.io/bite-sized/connecting-multiple-kubernetes-clusters/multi-cluster-scheduler">the official repository page</a> . </p><br><p>  If you want to read about multi-cluster-scheduler in action, Admiralty has an <a href="https://admiralty.io/blog/running-argo-workflows-across-multiple-kubernetes-clusters/">interesting case of use with Argo</a> - workflows, events, CI and CD Kubernetes. </p><br><h3 id="drugie-instrumenty-i-resheniya">  Other tools and solutions </h3><br><p>  Connecting multiple clusters and managing them is a difficult task, there is no universal solution. </p><br><p>  If you want to learn more about this topic, here are some resources: </p><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://submariner.io/">Rancher Submariner</a> is a tool that connects overlay networks of different Kubernetes clusters. </li><li>  The retail network Target uses <a href="https://tech.target.com/infrastructure/2018/06/20/enter-unimatrix.html">Unimatrix in combination with Spinnaker to orchestrate it on several clusters</a> . </li><li>  Try using IPV6 and a <a href="https://itnext.io/kubernetes-multi-cluster-networking-made-simple-c8f26827813">single network in several regions</a> . </li><li>  You can use a service mesh, such as <a href="https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/multicluster/">Istio, to connect multiple clusters</a> . </li><li>  Cilium, a container network interface plugin, offers <a href="https://cilium.io/blog/2019/03/12/clustermesh/">a cluster mesh feature</a> that allows multiple clusters to be combined. </li></ul><br><h3 id="vot-i-vse-na-segodnya">  That's all for today </h3><br><p>  <em>Thank you for reading to the end!</em> </p><br><p>  If you know how to more effectively connect several clusters, <a href="http://hello%40learnk8s.io/">tell us</a> . </p><br><p>  We will add your way to the links. </p><br><p>  Special thanks to Chris Nesbitt-Smith ( <a href="https://github.com/chrisns">Chris Nesbitt-Smith</a> ) and Vincent de <a href="https://github.com/so0k">Smet</a> (reliability engineer at <a href="https://swatmobile.io/">swatmobile.io</a> ) for reading the article and sharing useful information about how the federation works. </p></div>
