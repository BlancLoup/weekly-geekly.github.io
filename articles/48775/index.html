    <br><br><h4>  <strong>Apple iTunes</strong> </h4><br>  This case applies only to 64-bit editions of Windows 7. <br><br>  When you try to download and install Apple iTunes, the 32-bit version of the application will be installed instead of the 64-bit one.  This will prevent the ability to sync with the iPhone. <br><br>  To avoid this, install the 64-bit version, which is located at the following address: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D139389">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=139389</a> . <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Backup</strong> </h4><ul><li>  If you try to restore files that were backed up on a computer running Windows 7, on a computer running Windows Vista¬Æ, using the last Restore wizard, the recovery will fail. <br><br>  To work around this, in the directory where the backup file is located, place the Mediaid.bin file, which is located in a directory with the same name as the computer.  Move the Mediaid.bin file to a higher level so that it is at the same level as the directory whose name matches the computer name, and not inside it. <br></li><li>  If you try to use a system image backup as a restore point, System Restore will no longer respond to user actions. <br><br>  To avoid this, do not select a backup of the system image as a restore point.  To make sure that you are not using a backup of the system image, check the ‚Äú <strong>Type</strong> ‚Äù column in the System Restore wizard and make sure that the type of backup is different from ‚Äú <strong>Backup</strong> ‚Äù. <br><br>  If this has already happened, restart System Restore and try to restore from another restore point that is not a system backup. <br></li><li>  If you back up a system image using the Windows Backup wizard, you will not be able to use this backup to restore to other hardware.  Similarly, if you change the disk layout after creating a backup, you will also not be able to restore the system from the backup image. <br><br>  To avoid this, use the ‚ÄúBackup and Restore‚Äù control panel‚Äôs ‚Äú <strong>Create a system image</strong> ‚Äù (if available in your Windows edition) to create a backup of the system image instead of the Windows Backup wizard. <br>  If this has already happened, there is no other way than to mount the virtual hard disk for the latest backup and try to get user data with it. </li></ul><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Disk Encryption (BitLocker Drive Encryption)</strong> </h4><br>  BitLocker Drive Encryption is not supported for drives using the exFAT (extended file allocation table) file system.  Instead, you can use BitLocker Drive Encryption with FAT and FAT32 drives. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Directaccess</strong> </h4><br>  In some editions of Windows 7, setting the Name Resolution Policy Table for DirectAccess may result in a lack of reaction from the computer to user actions and a repeated restart. <br><br>  If this has already happened, the user can restore the system by restarting the computer in the ‚ÄúSafe Mode without Networking‚Äù mode and running Regedit.exe to delete the Name Resolution Policy table in the specified registry key: <br><br>  <strong>HKLM \ SOFTWARE \ Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows NT \ DNSClient \ DnsPolicyConfig</strong> <br><br>  After that, system administrators must make the necessary changes to the Group Policy to prevent the system settings from competing with changes made by the user. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Internet Explorer 8</strong> </h4><ul><li>  If you try to print a PDF document directly from the browser using the Adobe¬Æ Reader¬Æ add-in, the operation will fail. <br><br>  To avoid this, save the PDF document to disk, and then open and print it using Adobe Reader, Adobe Acrobat, or any other viewable or printable PDF file. <br></li><li>  News feeds (like RSS or Atom) cannot be correctly updated in the background. <br><br>  To fix, open a command prompt and run the following commands: <br><br>  <strong>msfeedssync disable</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>for / f "tokens = 3"% i in ('reg query hkcu \ software \ microsoft \ feeds / v synctask') do schtasks / delete / tn "% i"</strong> (If you get an error, you can safely ignore it and continue execution of the following commands). <br><br>  <strong>reg delete hkcu \ software \ microsoft \ feeds / v synctask</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>msfeedssync enable</strong> <br><br>  After that you can confirm that the problem has been fixed by running the following command: <br><br>  <strong>for / f "tokens = 3"% i in ('reg query hkcu \ software \ microsoft \ feeds / v synctask') do schtasks / run / tn "% i"</strong> </li></ul><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Language packs</strong> </h4><br>  In some editions of this beta release, Windows Update will not show language packs as available for download. <br><br>  If your editorial staff has such a feature, it is not currently possible to change this. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Mobile Broadband Software</strong> </h4><br>  Not all software for mobile devices is currently installed correctly, some devices may not be detected or connected to the Internet. <br><br>  You can view the current list of supported devices for which Internet connectivity has been tested using this beta release, as well as ways to solve known problems for other devices and software, at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D139390">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink /? LinkID = 139390</a> . <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>MP3 files</strong> </h4><br>  When adding MP3 files (manually or automatically) to the Windows Media Player library or the Windows Media Center library, or if the metadata of these files is modified using Windows Explorer, a few seconds of audio data can be deleted from the beginning of the file.  This problem occurs when files contain thumbnails or other metadata that occupy a significant place before they are imported or modified. <br><br>  To avoid this, follow these steps: <br><br>  <strong>To protect your MP3s</strong> <ol><li>  Before installing this beta release, back up all MP3 files that the operating system can access, including removable media or shared network resources. </li><li>  Make sure that all MP3 files have the read-only attribute set.  To provide this through Windows Explorer, find the files and in their properties, called up by right-clicking, on the <strong>General</strong> tab, check the box <strong>Read-only</strong> . </li><li>  Next, install this beta release of Windows 7. </li><li>  Read the article and install the update available at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D139391">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=139391</a> . </li><li>  After installing the update, you can safely change the settings for writing and reading your MP3 files to your favorite ones. </li></ol>  If you do not want to install the update, you can avoid such problems by installing the read-only attribute for all MP3 files that the operating system can access, as described in clause 2. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Power Options</strong> </h4><br>  In some editions of Windows 7, the computer may not be configured by default to prompt for a password when exiting sleep mode. <br><br>  To fix this, use the <strong>Prompt for Password on Resume</strong> setting in the Power Options control panel. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Routing and remote access</strong> </h4><ul><li>  Only 64-bit profiles in Connection Manager are supported;  These profiles will not work with 32-bit operating systems.  To create a 32-bit profile on a 32-th client computer, use the Connection Manager Administration Kit. <br></li><li>  Users connected via VPN (Virtual Private Network) using the Internet Key Exchange of the second version will not be able to simply switch the VPN connection from one network to another when the computer is restarted.  To fix this, the user must manually start the Routing and Remote Access (RRAS) Mobility Manager task before attempting to switch networks. <br></li><li>  The status of dialup multilink VPN connections displayed in the <strong>View All Networks</strong> window is not accurate.  To check this status, use the Network Connections Control Panel (ncpa.cpl) instead of the specified window. <br></li><li> If you use national alpha characters for <strong>username</strong> authentication <strong>credentials</strong> for Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol Version 2 (MS-CHAPv2), then Network Policy Server (NPS) for Windows Server¬Æ 2008 R2 will not be able to certify a certificate.  To avoid this, do not use the characters of the national alphabets <strong>in the user name</strong> for PAP, CHAP and MS-CHAPv2.  (Authentication works if you use NPS for Windows Server 2008 R2). </li></ul><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Storage devices</strong> </h4><br>  If you upgrade to this beta release, any target ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù iSCSI connections will not be saved and the configuration information will not be saved, so disks attached to iSCSI will no longer be available. <br><br>  To avoid this, write down the configuration of the iSCSI-attached drives before upgrading to this beta release and add them again after the upgrade process is complete.  If you are using CHAP-security (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol) connections, write down these settings, including the CHAP key. <br><br>  If this happens, reconnect to the target iSCSI and mark them as ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù connections. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>System partition</strong> </h4><br>  The system does not prevent the formatting of the system partition.  You will receive an error indicating that the system partition cannot be formatted, but the operation will continue, resulting in data loss and the inability to boot the computer. <br><br>  While working with the system, make sure that you do not take actions to format the system partition.  If this happens, use the Windows Recovery Environment. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Video drivers</strong> </h4><br>  Systems using XDDM drivers may in some cases completely stop responding to user actions.  The computer will not respond to CTRL + ALT + DELETE and you will be forced to turn off the power to restart it, which may cause a risk of losing unsaved data. <br><br>  Cases that may cause this error include the following, but are not limited to: <br><ul><li>  Using Winsat.exe or using a computer <strong>rating and performance</strong> tool </li><li>  Multi-monitor configuration change </li><li>  Playing a DVD or other video content </li></ul>  To avoid this, do not use XDDM drivers, but find the appropriate WDDM driver.  If your video chipset does not have a WDDM driver (such as, for example, Intel 915), use a standard VGA driver or a video card driver that supports WDDM drivers. <br><br>  If a problem occurs during the installation, avoid using an unattended installation or uninstall the XDDM driver and use the VGA driver until the installation is complete. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Windows Media Center</strong> </h4><ul><li>  Windows Media Center does not recognize some ISDB-T and ISDB-S tuners due to the fact that they do not find the PBDA (Protected Broadcast Driver Architecture) driver. <br><br>  Use only Windows Media Center compatible tuners supplied with the computer by the original equipment manufacturer. <br></li><li>  ISDB (Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting) content does not play on Windows Media Extender devices. <br><br>  There is currently no workaround for this error. <br></li><li>  If you start a Windows Media Center session and do not press any keys, the screensaver will not start. <br><br>  To avoid this, select any item on the start screen. <br></li><li>  If you have scheduled recordings, and Windows Media Center re-enters sleep mode, you may encounter some problems, such as video overlay error while trying to watch live TV, lack of available disk space when trying to save files and deleting recordings due to insufficient disk space. <br><br>  To avoid this, use Power Options to disable the sleep feature on your computer while Windows Media Center is running or recording is scheduled. <br><br>  If this is the case, restart your computer and start live TV in Windows Media Center. <br></li><li>  If you upgraded from Windows Vista to Windows 7, you will not be able to burn DVDs from Windows Media Center. <br><br>  To remedy the situation, use Regedit.exe to add the following key to the registry: <br><br>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Media Center \ Extensibility \ Entry Points \ {1beb699f-dc1e-41a7-a31a-d4b339d21f42} "AddIn" = "SonicMCEPlug.SonicDiscWriter, <br>  SonicMCEBurnEngine, Culture = Neutral, Version = 6.1.0.0, PublicKeyToken = 31bf3856ad364e35 " <br></li><li>  If you upgraded your computer with Windows Media Center TV Pack 2008 or a computer with an early release of Windows 7 to this beta release, using the Guide Search in Windows Media Center to search for Title, Keyword, Actor, or Director will not return any results. <br><br>  To correct the situation, reconfigure Task Scheduler. <br><br>  <strong>To reconfigure Task Scheduler:</strong> <br><ol><li>  Close Windows Media Center and launch Task Scheduler ( <strong>Start - Administrative Tools - Task Scheduler</strong> ). </li><li>  In Task Scheduler Library go to <strong>Microsoft - Windows - Media Center</strong> . </li><li>  In the middle pane, scroll through the Windows Media Center task list and locate <strong>RegisterSearch</strong> . </li><li>  In the right-click menu on <strong>RegisterSearch,</strong> select <strong>Run</strong> . </li><li>  Close Task Scheduler and wait a few minutes before using Guide Search. </li></ol></li><li>  If you try to use Windows Media Center right after installing this beta release, you may encounter installation errors, inability to play, or Windows Media Center may stop responding to your actions. <br><br>  To avoid this, install the specified update (either using Windows Update, or directly via the links provided) before using Windows Media Center. <br><br>  For 32-bit editions of Windows 7: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkID%3D139392">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=139392</a> <br><br>  For 64-bit editions of Windows 7: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/%3FLinkId%3D139393">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=139393</a> </li></ul><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Windows Media Services 2008</strong> </h4><br>  Media Services streaming technologies are not available in this beta release.  They include Remote Server Administration tools for Windows Media Services. <br><br>  You should not update the operating system on a computer with Windows Vista, if these technologies are a significant component of your network infrastructure. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Indexing Windows Search</strong> </h4><br>  If you are using a computer that is running Windows Search (Windows 7, Windows Vista or Windows XP with Windows Search installed) and have chosen a particular index location with a path longer than 128 characters, indexing will not start after you upgrade the operating system to this beta. release  This will affect the functioning of the search and the appearance of some libraries. <br><br>  To avoid this, move the index to a different location with a path length of less than 128 characters before you install this beta release as an update to the current operating system. <br><br>  If the installation is already done, use the <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> button in the <strong>Advanced Options of</strong> the ‚ÄúIndexing Options‚Äù control panel to reset the settings and restart the indexing tool. <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Wireless network connection</strong> </h4><br>  For some adapters and platforms, the wireless adapter may be disconnected, and the connections themselves are invisible in the following cases: <br><ul><li>  When the computer continues to work after the ‚Äúhibernate‚Äù and ‚Äúsleep‚Äù modes </li><li>  When a computer works with multiple video streams simultaneously via a wireless connection </li><li>  The computer is running Microsoft Virtual PC </li></ul>  If you have Microsoft Virtual PC installed on your computer, you can avoid such an incident by removing this package.  In addition, in all cases when this happens, restart the computer. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48775/</a></p>
