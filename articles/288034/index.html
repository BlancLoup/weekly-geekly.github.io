  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 11</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/165781.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/165781.html</a> <br><br>  Colds drove all people and hamsters into their minks and do not let them walk for a walk in the fresh, frosty air.  Perhaps this explains the large number of interesting blog posts.  It is noteworthy that they wrote not only about crazy thermometers and the arctic summer.  With optimism inherent in us, we find warming lines in the cold. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all I want to share with you the <a href="http://oleg-kozyrev.livejournal.com/">diary of a freezing Muscovite</a> .  Its author, Oleg Kozyrev, has been keeping a cool diary for seven days.  And over the week, the popularity of this blog has increased so much that soon there will be comics on this subject and, possibly, a humorous television series.  And you say blogs are bullshit.  Bullshit is when enviable. <br><br>  And immediately, in order to present the other side of the medal, Ivan Golota publishes a list of <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_lj_review/83738.html">blogging dangers</a> in the community ru_lj_review.  I liked most of all the appeal at the end of the article, to which I am in a hurry to join: "If you remember that LJ is not a communication end in itself, but mostly a means to establish and maintain completely real connections and relationships, then nothing terrible will happen to you."

      <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/">Manic Weblog</a> shares with us its serious knowledge in the field of CSS.  In detail, with explanations and in Russian, it describes the differences between the attributes of HTML elements <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2006/01/22">‚Äúid‚Äù and ‚Äúclass‚Äù</a> .  I, a man tormented by frontpages and other visual editors, learned a lot of valuable things from this article.  And most importantly - html-coder I will not be. <br><br>  Another article on the <a href="http://umade.ru/log/2005/09/110.html">CSS modification</a> blog <a href="http://umade.ru/log/">Umade.ru</a> .  In this case, we consider ways to change the CSS code, which allow the user to know that he has already visited the page where a certain link to the site leads.  There are several variants of code from various well-known programmers. <br><br>  You know, I like futurists the most among poets.  Kruchenykh, Mayakovsky, Northerner, Burliuk ... I think everyone went through the school program a wonderful verse "And you could?", This is where about the nocturne on the flute of drainpipes.  You can appreciate my delight when, on LJ, I came across a <a href="http://imja.livejournal.com/538450.html">picture of a house</a> whose drainpipes look like flutes!  And the house itself, as if from the Twisted poem. <br><br>  <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/">Kolesnik</a> talks about the new unit of measurement of working time and project planning - <a href="http://kolesnik.ru/2006/time">Modulora Time</a> .  Another view from a new angle on planning your own life.  It is proposed to divide your day into halves of 40-45 minutes (like school lessons) and after each half, take a break to rest.  With horror, I present my creative process in this mode - just sit down and think about a rough plan for a future article, already a break. <br><br>  Immediately I warn you that it is better not to go to people who are impressionable and have a weak stomach.  Pavel Protasov in detail, with photos, talks <a href="http://pvphome.livejournal.com/24042.html">about the autopsy of a person</a> .  A typical autopsy in the provincial morgue, in which there is not even a refrigerator.  Once I wanted to become a surgeon and even attended an autopsy, but it was also scary for me to read this note. <br><br>  It's nice that <a href="http://hvost.org/">HvosT has</a> become a regular reader of HF precisely because of blog reviews.  But the note in his blog is unpleasant, to which I <a href="http://hvost.org/%3Fp%3D175">give the link</a> .  The title is ‚ÄúPlagiarism in Computer News‚Äù.  Of course, I am not at all happy that such an unscrupulous author, referred to in the HvosT blog, decided to substitute ‚ÄúKV‚Äù.  But, the Internet is not a place where you can quietly steal text and feel impunity.  Thanks to the readers, who read the newspaper from cover to cover and point the finger at such plagiarists. <br><br>  brings to public the <a href="http://bocharoff.livejournal.com/54330.html">editorial life of the</a> men's magazine MAXIM.  Not all, of course, but only one editor, who came straight from sunny Switzerland into Russian social reality.  Almost O'Henry. <br><br>  An interesting blog in which I find it difficult to highlight any article for the week separately - <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/">Marketing In a Small Town</a> .  Having opened this blog, you start reading from the first article and go down in the text lower and lower, to the second article, to the third ... What the blog is about is clear from the title.  But it is written in a living language, with funny stories and examples from life.  For example, the statement that Pavlov discovered not conditioned reflexes, but branding.  Or a story about a business model in which doing nothing is a success factor.  Don't you read yet? <br><br>  Roman Romanov suddenly decided to re-read The Three Musketeers and found that the <a href="http://rromanov.livejournal.com/745601.html">book is very harmful</a> for young people.  In addition, the Soviet cinema of the same name has little to do with the novel by Comrade Dumas.  The result of the whole article: the patriots should hate the novel, but the Nazis would like it very much.  Pretty controversial, is not it? <br><br>  A blog with the English name <a href="http://softreview.com.ua/">Software Review</a> , but with Russian texts, talks <a href="http://softreview.com.ua/2006/01/17">about the Google service</a> , which allows you to browse using PDAs and PDA-sites that do not have the Wap version. <br><br>  Igor Bely (not a relative) shows and teaches us a very entertaining physical <a href="http://bujhm.livejournal.com/176222.html">trick-joke</a> .  It turns out that some colors do not turn over in the lenses!  For example, red rays have a different refractive index, which differs sharply from the generally accepted one. <br><br>  <a href="http://blog.prtool.ru/">The PR tool</a> tries to teach us how to <a href="http://blog.prtool.ru/2006/01/10">write press releases</a> so that as many sites as possible publish them.  Moreover, there are tips on distributing press releases so that you do not have to manually send a letter to each media.  I remember once I sent out a press release in which I composed a story about janitor Ilya Kuzmich from Alibegov Street.  Despite the slight craziness of the text, some sites did publish it.  But even more letters came to me in which it was strongly recommended to stop the foolishness and write sane texts.  It seems that I do not succeed so far. <br><br>  Oh, love and know how to have fun on the promised land.  isr_max talks about how in the early nineties, Israeli journalists made fun of their own parliament.  Of course, in the joke there was only a fraction of the joke.  In fact, people's choices, thus, passed the test of mercantile spirit and parasitism.  Most of it did not pass. <br><br>  <a href="http://shtyr.ru/">Pin</a> tells us <a href="http://shtyr.ru/archives/72">about the dawn of cyberporn</a> .  Let your palms do not sweat, the link is nothing naughty.  Almost encyclopedic information about how to get erotica, when there were no dedicated lines, and the fastest modems were 2400 baud.  Can you imagine, then there was no jpeg either ?!  Everything forbidden lay in small groups on the BBS, and some system administrators traded in disks for $ 100 apiece.  Wild time. <br><br>  Macide Magazine is a <a href="http://macide.livejournal.com/419312.html">great game</a> .  Its meaning is to take a whole literary work and shove it into one single sms.  For example, like this: "Evil you, I will leave you. Chatsky."  At the moment, more than 20 pages with comments! <br><br>  <a href="http://maulnet.net/">Stop Me If You Think ...</a> shares with us the dystopia <a href="http://maulnet.net/%3Fp%3D110">about buying a book in 2018</a> .  Quote: "Have you not heard that already five years, as the copyright on all books are forever transferred to the American Book Publishers Association. Or do you want me, as a member of the sect of Dmitry Sklyarov, imprisoned for life?" <br><br>  A sad story about what life does to people.  After all, many already do not remember why and when they got the first two.  My behavior was always not so good.  And there were a number of people finishing school with a gold medal, an institute with a red diploma.  What for?  Have they got their way?  What became of them?  Maybe everything is the same as <a href="http://eiri.livejournal.com/160570.html">the girl Lida</a> from the diary? <br><br>  Svaja treats us with a great story <a href="http://svaja1.livejournal.com/68109.html">about Hungarian Medeus</a> - her former lover and building relationships with him.  A rather unusual position for a girl, possibly peculiar to the current generation of young people: ‚ÄúWhy should a girl experience unearthly delight, seeing all these bouquets of candy-sonnets? But I see that this does not give you any pleasure, but simply‚Äú so that the girl gave herself. " <br><br>  And the last number of our program is <a href="http://vozzboohditel.livejournal.com/194440.html">autobags</a> . <br><br>  <b>Your personal aggregator Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006040601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 4, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288034/</a></p>
