  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Health warns: 3d-films are harmful to health</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, cheers comrades.  What has been waiting for so long has happened, now you can be a direct participant in the film‚Äôs action, you can get into the thick of it, the very atmosphere of the film ‚Äî now more and more tapes are being filmed in 3D.  People like it, engineers have a job, companies are dripping $.  It seems everyone is happy.  But few people think about the 3d effect that is achieved and that it can actually harm health. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6b/c8/6bc8afcf29f6b3155b0b84757976e819.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the cut-a simple Russian explanation of what is a harmless three-dimensional picture can harm a simple man in the street. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More recently, in the film industry there has been a boom in 3d.  Everyone goes to the cinema only for volume, watching flat films seems to be no longer cool.  Companies that produce monitors, televisions and video cards are organizing a mass production of home equipment for viewing the volume.  But no one thinks about the possibility of harm.  I understand that in our world it is quite difficult to talk about something harmless, in megacities even breathing air is harmful, not to mention any devices, like a mobile phone.  I am writing this article because, firstly, I think that the harm should be minimized, and secondly, because very few people think about it.  Everyone thought about the dangers of a mobile phone or computer at least once, but about 3d ... <br>  So, let's fast forward to a wonderful cinema where in 3d format <s>Avatar is</s> showing another regular masterpiece. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a8/d1/a8d1212942205093e5dff0fa63f0570d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  We buy tickets, we check them at the entrance to the hall and give out <u>POINTS</u> .  We happily take them and occupy seats in the hall according to the purchased tickets, put on glasses.  And here begins the long-awaited movie.  It looks like this <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fd/74/fd742330dc635309aec1fa551ad13dd8.jpg" alt="image">

      And now let's see what happens to our eyes while viewing a three-dimensional image through such glasses.  A small lecture on the device of our eyes.  I apologize if she will be a bit tedious. <br>  The lens in our eye is a rather important part of the light-refracting apparatus, is a kind of lens.  There is also a ciliary muscle in the eye. <br>  more details: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e7/8e/e78e3b9982dfcc7cf6e88789283c5b8a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  1 - cornea <br>  2 - lens <br>  3 - retina <br>  4 - ciliary muscle <br>  5 - Zinn bundles <br><br>  The ciliary muscle serves to stretch and shrink the lens, so it plays the role of autofocus along with the lens.  When we look at an object, it stretches and shrinks (plays with settings) and eventually adjusts to the best focus.  This process is called accommodation.  In addition to it, there is a range finder in our eye, it works due to the fact that we have 2 eyes, and more or less soberly estimates the distance to objects.  Also, the brain without consciousness can estimate information about the distance to the object from side sources. <br><br>  <b><u>Now the most interesting thing is how all this stuff works with 3D.</u></b> <br>  The principle of the volume cinema is that with technical means to deceive the rangefinder - to give different eyes to different eyes. So, the rangefinder is deceived.  But what to do with accommodation?  It should leave the screen flat!  But here begins an even more interesting process of over-pulling the lens.  Autofocus says that the object is in the plane of the screen.  The range finder says that the object is somewhere far away.  Consciousness believes parallax (it, like the visual analyzer, is located in the cerebral cortex) and says that the object is far away.  The vegetative system receives conflicting instructions and begins to go crazy.  It ends with the fact that the system either just gets up in a stupor (disorientation), or starts to feverishly jib (exit from normal mode and, as a result, overwork). <br>  As a result, during prolonged viewing of 3D, the ciliary muscle very quickly (characteristic pain in the eyes, headache) gets tired.  But the worst thing is not this, but the fact that the long-lasting friendship between the control mechanisms, which until now has always only helped each other, is destroyed.  I do not know what this leads to, but I hope that in the near future, doctors will learn how to treat this thing. <br><br>  By the way, all that is described above occurs only when viewing 3d close up.  If the distance to the screen is 10-20 meters.  In this case, the lens has the correct position and there are no problems with accommodation. <br>  <u><b>THEREFORE SEE THE STEREOKINO IS RECOMMENDED FROM THE LATEST RANKS OF THE CINEMA!</b></u>  <u><b>FOR THE FIRST SERIES, DO NOT SIT ANYONE!</b></u> <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90182/</a></p>
