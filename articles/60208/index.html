Therefore, it was decided to start prevention immediately. <br><br>  I started my acquaintance with gyro-trainers from the site <a href="http://powerball.ru/">powerball.ru</a> , where all the models from NSD are given, and there are customer reviews about each of them.  After a visual introduction to the models of clarity, it was not added which model to take and what the differences would be noticeable except for the wallet. <br>  So I had to read the forums and talk to people who already had these devices.

    <h1>  What it is and how it works </h1><br>  Each powerball consists of a housing, a rotor and a groove. <br><img src="http://nsdpowerballs.com/skinimages/sideimage.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/thumb/3/35/%D0%92%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg/180px-%D0%92%D0%BD%D1%83%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5_%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0.jpg" align="left"><br>  <em>The main components of the gyro.</em>  <em>A pale blue color indicates a translucent body, a light purple circular groove, black - the axis of the gyroscope, yellow - a rotor.</em> <br>  From the name of the <em>gyroscopic simulator</em> it becomes clear that the powerball is essentially a <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fru.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252F%2525D0%252593%2525D0%2525B8%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252581%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525BE%2525D0%2525BF%26ei%3DXkIWSo7eJYilsAaoouSQAg%26usg%3DAFQjCNEKRvaUVuRSGWElLw6WpMwRcy0jUA%26sig2%3DxtTgwvskoVVCZlNJba6eUA">gyroscope</a> . <br>  All the specifics of the work of powerball is perfectly described in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D1%2591%25D1%2580">article on the wiki</a> , but if you say in human language about what happens during training, then it can be described as: <br>  When spinning the rotor and making rotational movements with a brush, the speed of spin of the rotor increases (how, by how much and by what physical laws, again, described in the above wiki article).  As a result of the rotor spinning, forces are created, which are manifested in the fact that the powerball is pulled out of the brush, and you have to apply the efforts of the hand and forearm in order to hold the ball in your hand and maintain rotation.  As a result of the hand rotations, as I understand it, the desired effect on the joints occurs, which is the ultimate goal in the prevention of diseases of the hand. <br><br><h1>  Models </h1><br>  Let's take a quick look at the available models. <br>  As can be seen from the official Russian branch of NSD Powerballs, we are offered a choice of 5 models of powerballs (+1 350hz Hi speed, but it does not count for now). <br>  You can read about what they write about each model on <a href="http://www.powerball.ru/archives/category/models/">the store page</a> . <br><br>  I'll tell you very briefly for each of the models, but first I will note that there are models with and without a counter.  On the counter, you can see your maximum RPM and current RPM, which is undoubtedly very valuable for monitoring progress. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td width="10"><img src="http://www.nsdpowerballs.com/images/products/thumb/64032-NSD-Powerball-250-Hz-Regular.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></td><td>  <b>Powerball 250Hz</b> - The simplest model, plastic case, plastic rotor, low price and adequate reliability.  However, the price is pleasing to the eye.  It would seem that it could break in the device of 3 parts?  It turns out that the groove is being erased (it‚Äôs also the ring, on which the rotor axis runs), moreover, as the engineers assure, they improved the balancing of the rotor from model to model.  This characteristic is certainly important, but here the rings are erased more often and need to be replaced, it becomes noticeable when, when spinning, the powerball starts to make an unhealthy noise and click. </td></tr><tr><td width="10"><img src="http://www.nsdpowerballs.com/images/products/thumb/55866-NSD-Powerball-Neon-Pro.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></td><td>  <b>Powerball 250hz neon (techno)</b> <strike>Same eggs</strike> Same POWERBALL 250Hz, only with diodes (creeping line for the TECHNO model), which glow brighter, the higher the rotor speed.  Model popular because of the wow-effect.  For some reason it breaks more often than a simple 250hz. <br></td></tr><tr><td width="10"><img src="http://www.nsdpowerballs.com/images/products/thumb/15087-NSD-Powerball-350-Hz-Metal.jpg" alt="image" align="left"></td><td>  <b>Powerball metal 350hz The</b> main difference between this model and the rest is the <strong>weight and rotor</strong> .  Since the sphere and rotor are made of metal, the weight of this device is 500 g. And I bought this model for myself. <br>  Why the choice stopped on this model?  Just because this device can be used as a power simulator, and not just a warm-up.  Those.  Plastic balls will of course be wiped out as necessary, and more is not required for the prevention, but here you will be able to strengthen the hand and forearm with this model.  Among other things, as the NSD engineers say, the rotor in this model is especially accurately calibrated) </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h1>  Impressions </h1><br><br>  It should be noted that I bought the powerball on ebay, because  there, even with delivery, it went 1.5k cheaper. <br>  After receiving it in the mail immediately tried it in.  I must say that the effect is clearly superior to the one that you expect from a metal barrel with a smaller barrel inside. <br>  After 30 seconds of work at a speed of 5,000‚Äì6,000 RPM, you realize that the brush is loading just fine, the muscles of the forearm work as well, and the fingers feel especially hard. <br>  Initially, the product was created for tennis players, golfers and other players who need strength in the hand.  However, by changing the position of the arm, it is possible to achieve the work of both the hand and the triceps, the shoulder and the biceps. <br>  After yesterday‚Äôs classes, today‚Äôs hands are crammed to capacity, despite the fact that the powerball was not spinning fast when watching a movie, so I felt the effect right on myself. <br><br>  I note that I did not try the plastic powerball, so there is nothing to say about the degree of efficiency of the load, but I heard that the difference compared to the metal one is striking. <br>  The only conclusion I read somewhere is that it is quite enough to warm up the brush with a plastic powerball. <br>  Finally, you can see how the current one works. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results%3Fsearch_type%3D%26search_query%3Dakis%2Bpowerball%26aq%3Df">"Champion" Akis</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60208/</a></p>
