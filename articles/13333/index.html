Jeff refers to people in whose heads unique and ingenious ideas are born.  Moreover, this person is able to realize their ideas, which causes great respect. <br><br>  By nature, Jeff is a very observant person.  One day he got into conversation with his younger sister Katherine and brother Dave (which are also incidental, like everyone in the Jeff family are very smart people) and a brilliant idea came to his head - what if for people like them to create a social network?  It is for this age category!  Jeff inspired Katherine with his idea and Dave met their friends, began to communicate with them on equal terms (since Jeff is an excellent psychologist, he did it without any problems) and find out what they lack, what they could get for themselves in Jeff's project.

      Having collected the necessary data for his new startup, Jeff set to work.  It should be noted that before that he already had a startup, and a successful one - he earned more than 250 thousand dollars on it.  This money was enough to put together a development team and launch a project. <br><br>  So the day came when the project was launched.  Due to the fact that Jeff already had a successful experience, the project gained strength and even began to compete with such giants as Myspace and Facebook. <br><br>  But Jeff is not the kind of person who stops there.  His goal was to reach the first place among youth portals, first in the United States and then, perhaps, all over the world. <br><br>  He looked thoughtfully at his sister Catherine and thought about the contribution she made to the project.  Perhaps, if it were not for her with Dave, then his startup would never have become so popular.  Only a teenager can create a social network for teenagers.  Suddenly, during these thoughts, Jeff sprang up and ran to his laptop to write an advertising article, which he called " <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/23359.html">Even the girls learned to make millions on Internet startups</a> ." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/13333/">https://habr.com/ru/post/13333/</a></p>
