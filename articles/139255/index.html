It‚Äôs lazy to put it in your wallet every time, so it accumulates in your pockets, there it also interferes, and therefore it is laid out in the hallway, where it accumulates until it begins to interfere there as well.  Then it is completely incomprehensible where to put it.  Throwing out money is bad; paying off in trifles is inconvenient. <br><br>  Let's think about how this problem can be solved with the help of design services and modern technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Monetomat </h4><br>  As you have already guessed from the picture illustrating the post, the first solution to the problem is to install small items in crowded places.  For example, at subway stations and shops. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      Devices with coin acceptors already exist, but it is proposed to load the coins one by one through the slot.  This is a long, dreary and only those people who will have nothing special to do will use this device.  But even with such an inconvenient method of loading coins, the kiosk's revenue, according to the advertisement of the equipment supplier, is increased by a quarter compared to the devices without coin acceptors. <br><br>  In order to make it convenient to use the monetomists, you need to load the coins in them in a natural way - you pour the coins into a convenient large hole, the kiosk recounts them and you just have to choose how to use this money. <br><br>  I would even suggest to make the monetams separate devices.  Then it would be possible to greatly simplify their interface, increase the volume of coins and increase their throughput. <br><br>  Then the typical scenario of using them would look like this: you walk past the coin unit, you remember that there is a trifle in your pocket, rake it, in a few seconds you put it on the phone and with a sense of free pockets you go further. <br><br>  Even if a commission is raised in the monetomat, they will still be used, since there is simply nowhere else to do a trifle.  And in a month the little things accumulate rubles for 300, so this would be a good additional turnover for payment systems. <br><br>  In addition, such devices would stimulate people to start various kiwi wallets, etc., which is also useful for operators. <br><br><h4>  Loyalty cards </h4><br>  The second way to get rid of the little things - to prevent its occurrence. <br><br>  For example, having started a loyalty card in a store, you can indicate that the change is less than 10 or 100 rubles, you need to automatically transfer to this card.  Then any maps of Crossroads, Auchan, etc. will become more useful and they will often get. <br><br>  You can also specify that the change is not accumulated on the card, and immediately went to the phone, charity or other types of payments. <br><br>  It is beneficial for the store not only because it increases turnover (not much, but still), but also because people will more often get loyalty cards.  In addition, less will need to mess with delivery, maintenance will be faster, it will increase the throughput of cash registers and, as a result, will additionally raise revenue. <br><br><h4>  Children </h4><br>  No, not in the sense that you need to use child labor in order to destroy trifles.  And in the sense that you can think of how children would love to spend it. <br><br>  For example, in places of large concentrations of children with parents (for example, in the departments of shops where adults go shopping for themselves, but they are forced to take children with them), it is possible to put amusement kiosks, the only task of which is to sell virtual delicacies to virtual pets.  Moreover, the cost of such a delicacy can be from 10 kopeks to 10 rubles. <br><br>  The beauty of this method is that virtual content is sold for real money (of course, there is the cost of a kiosk, pet development, electricity, etc.). <br><br>  Children are known for their ability to pull out money from their parents for everything that comes into view from the field, and here you can buy them off with a handful of little things.  In addition, it will allow to take their attention for a long time, while you, for example, choose a new laptop. <br><br><h4>  Litter Bins </h4><br>  And finally, another way.  You can just make special bins for trivia and put them also in crowded places.  The similarity of such ballot boxes is now, but they have the same mistake as in the existing coin acceptors - the money in them must be put through a narrow inconvenient slit. <br><br>  The situation is further complicated by the fact that such bins are specially ‚Äúsprinkled‚Äù with several large bills in the hope that people will put the same one there.  But as a result, it becomes just uncomfortable for people to pour small change in there, but they are also in no hurry to put large bills. <br><br>  In normal bins, change should be easy to pour.  The hole should be large enough to make it possible on the go. <br><br>  In addition, you do not need to glue photos of unhappy children and animals onto these bins - people already have the need to get rid of the little things, and depressing photos can only scare them away in this case. <br><br>  The collected money from these boxes can be sent to good things. <br><br><br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  I have a suggestion.  Let's try to do this: before describing a problem in the comments because of which something cannot be done, think about how you would solve this very problem if you were approached by the customer. <br><br>  For example, there is a problem: <br><blockquote>  but there will always be people who will pour in there not only coins </blockquote>  It immediately suggests a solution - to make the receiving opening so that it sifted out unformatted objects.  For example, in order for bulk materials to wake up through the net right into the trash can, too light ones are blown away by the air flow from the cooler (which will still be in the box), etc. <br><br>  Try to focus not on the problem, but on how to solve it.  This is a good exercise not only in relation to this article, but in life in general. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139255/</a></p>
