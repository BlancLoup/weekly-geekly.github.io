      <i>This post will be interesting to people who do not follow the emergence of new decentralized services in the network, you can briefly read about each of them.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some of the important principles used in decentralized projects are things like <b>Zero-config</b> and <b>zero trust</b> . <br><br>  In other words, the service can be considered <b>completely</b> decentralized, if to launch it, it is enough just to start the application without further entering any data for connection.  Zero trust means that an attack of the MITM type should in principle not be feasible due to the implementation of the protocol.  <i>(The network will automatically reject the malicious node - DHT, the network can function even if all the nodes except you and the person to whom you transfer are captured - I2P, you can put the SORM on which the porridge is in place of the data, although it is physically connected to you directly to the channel break (CJDNS)</i> <br><br><h4>  What requirements should the services meet that would be believed and used as completely decentralized? </h4><br>  - OpenSource <br>  - Zero-Config <br>  - MITM protection at the protocol level <br>  - Low entry threshold <i>(how to use and why it is needed - it is understandable for a simple user and you can describe it in one sentence)</i> <br>  - Fully decentralized operation algorithm (except for the first bootstrap) <br><br><h4>  What we have? </h4><br><h5>  Network protocols </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181862/">CJDNS</a> <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/165/4f0/ecf/1654f0ecf67fc1582030625d59530a44.png" alt="image"><br>  Cjdns is a network protocol and its implementation with which you can create a scalable, secure, and easy to configure network.  The network can work both over the Internet connection and directly between routers. <br><br>  Hyperboria network is private - your traffic can not be decrypted by anyone except the node to which it should be delivered.  The network is not anonymous - the purpose of its creation was not to make a clone I2P / Tor, but to make a new Internet.  Thus, using tracing, you can find out the chain of nodes and find out your IPv4 address;  Obviously, when the router-router type is connected, this problem will disappear and the network will also become anonymous. <br></div></div></li></ul><br><h5>  Overlay nets </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/97827/">I2p</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca7/812/9f3/ca78129f3e0039c432f9286d09e264cc.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I2P is an anonymous, self-organizing distributed network that uses a modified DHT Kademlia, but differs in that it stores the hash addresses of network nodes, AES encrypted IP addresses, as well as public encryption keys, and the Network database connections are also encrypted.  The network provides applications with a simple transport mechanism for anonymously and securely forwarding messages to each other. <br><br>  Although the I2P network is strictly focused on determining the packet transmission path, thanks to the Streaming lib library, their delivery is also implemented in the originally specified sequence without errors, losses and duplication, which makes it possible to use IP-telephony, Internet radio, IP-TV, I2P video conferencing and other streaming protocols and services. <br><br>  Inside the I2P network runs its own directory of sites, electronic libraries, as well as torrent trackers.  In addition, there are gates for accessing the I2P network directly from the Internet, created specifically for users who, for various reasons, cannot install the ‚ÄúInvisible Internet Project‚Äù software on a computer. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/204266/">TOR</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Tor-logo-2011-flat.svg?uselang=ru" alt="image"><br>  Tor (abbr. From the English. The Onion Router) - free software for the implementation of the second generation of the so-called "onion routing".  This is a proxy server system that allows you to establish an anonymous network connection, protected from listening.  Considered as an anonymous network of virtual tunnels, providing data transmission in an encrypted form.  Written primarily in the C, C ++ and Python programming languages.  As of the beginning of 2014, it has more than 324,000 lines of program code, not counting comments. <br><br>  With Tor, users can remain anonymous online when they visit websites, publish materials, send messages, and work with other applications that use the TCP protocol.  Anonymization of traffic is provided through the use of a distributed network of servers (nodes - "nodes"), called multi-layer routers.  Tor also provides protection against traffic analysis mechanisms that threaten not only the user's online anonymity, but also the confidentiality of commercial secrets, business contacts, etc. Tor operates on-line routers with network levels, allowing for anonymous outgoing connections and hidden anonymous services] . <br></div></div><br></li></ul><h5>  Social networks </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/208472/">Twister</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/688/0ff/841/6880ff8417d3e9a2bde33650e16d17de.png" alt="image"><br>  Twister is a decentralized analogue of Twitter (microblogging service) which is built on the principle of P2P and uses all the best from Bittorrent and Bitcoin.

The launch of the first version took place on July 2, 2001. <br>  There are many other client programs for exchanging files using the BitTorrent protocol. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/187470/">eMule</a> (KAD Network) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e6/bf8/129/6e6bf8129c5a8c2ef2cebb88e7a672a0.png" alt="image"><br>  Kad Network is a decentralized serverless file sharing network that uses the Kademlia overlay network protocol.

The Bitmessage network is similar to the Bitcoin network, in that it relies on cryptography and sacrifices some convenience for the sake of security and decentralization, but it is intended for the task of sending messages, and not monetary transactions.  The network received a sharp surge in popularity [1] after Edward Snowden's disclosures about the secret tracking system for Internet users PRISM. <br>  Currently, the Bitmessage network processes several thousand private messages per day. <br></div></div></li></ul><br><h5>  Financial calculations </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/114642/">Bitcoin</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Bitcoin_logo.svg" alt="image"><br>  Bitcoin (from the English. Bit - information unit "bit", English coin - "coin") is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that uses the same digital currency, which is often called "cryptocurrency" or virtual currency.  The network is completely decentralized, does not have a central administrator or any equivalent. <br>  Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods or services from sellers willing to accept them.  It is possible to exchange for ordinary money through specialized trading sites or exchangers. <br><br>  One of the features is the issue of new bitcoin.  It is decentralized, limited in volume and time, distributed relatively randomly among those who wish, who use the computing power of their equipment to protect the payment system using the proof-of-work method from re-spending.  The system maintenance activities with the opportunity to receive remuneration in the form of bitcoin emitted and commission fees were called ‚Äúmining‚Äù (from English mining - mining). <br><br>  The basic element of this payment system is an open source client program.  Using the network protocol of the application layer, clients running on multiple computers are interconnected into a peer-to-peer network. <br>  To ensure the functioning and protection of the system, cryptographic methods are used. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  Litecoin <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/424/180/b32/424180b320465a4b97cdb09037da665f.png" alt="image"><br>  Litecoin (from English. Lite - ‚Äúeasy‚Äù, English. Coin - ‚Äúcoin‚Äù) - fork Bitcoin, peer-to-peer electronic payment system that uses the same cryptocurrency. <br><br>  Litecoin creation and transfer is based on a protocol without centralized administration based on Bitcoin technology.  The program is open source. <br><br>  Litecoin was conceived by developers as an evolution of Bitcoin and has a number of differences from it.  As of December 11, 2013, 1 LTC costs approximately $ 33 on the BTC-E exchange.  Litecoin is the second largest cryptocurrency in the world with a market capitalization of about 595 million US dollars. <br><br>  Litecoin can be used for exchanging for bitcoin or ordinary money in exchange offices, as well as for electronic payment for goods / services from sellers who are ready to accept them. <br>  To ensure the functioning and protection of the system, cryptographic methods are used. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  <s>Dogecoin</s> </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Search engines </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/212407/">Yacy</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/2ab/463/b012ab4636013b201983bab91694870b.png" alt="image"><br>  aCy (from the English. Yet another Cyberspace, Another Cyberspace; in tune with the English. Ya see) is a freely distributed decentralized search engine built on the principle of peer-to-peer networks (P2P).  There are versions for Windows, Linux, MacOSX.  The main program module, written in Java, operates on several thousand computers (as of 2011) of YaCy network members. <br><br>  Each project participant independently explores the Internet, analyzing and indexing the pages found, and adds the index results to a common database (the so-called index), which is shared by all YaCy users on the P2P principle. <br><br>  Unlike partially distributed search engines, the YaCy network is characterized by a decentralized architecture.  All nodes are equivalent and there is no central server.  The program can work in the mode of a search robot or as a local proxy server, indexing the pages visited by the user (this ignores pages with signs of personal data ‚Äî cookies, etc.). <br><br>  Access to search functions is provided by a locally running web server, which generates a search page with a field for entering search queries and returns search results in the same format as other popular search engines. <br></div></div></li></ul><br><br><h5>  System name resolution to IP (DNS) </h5><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/120015/">Namecoin</a> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Read more</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec3/5b5/6df/ec35b56df73e5827e7d2f6a67b0e9b94.png" alt="image"><br>  Namecoin (English name - ‚Äúname‚Äù, English coin - ‚Äúcoin‚Äù) is a Bitcoin-based system for storing arbitrary combinations of the ‚Äúname-value‚Äù type, the most well-known application of which is the system of alternative root DNS servers.  Namecoins are not managed by any one organization.  Each node of the Namecoin network has a complete copy of the distributed database. <br><br>  The peer-to-peer principle and the absence of an administrative center make the removal of the name impossible.  To calculate the blocks, standard Bitcoin mining software is used, redirected to the server and port where Namecoind works.  Simultaneous mining of Namecoin and Bitcoin is possible without reducing the efficiency of mining Bitcoin through the use of technology "Merged Mining".  It is also possible to purchase a domain for Bitcoin cryptocurrency through an intermediary.  The term for registering a name is considered to have expired after calculating 36,000 new blocks. <br><br>  Now in Namecoin domains are registered only in the zone .bit, for which the namespace "d /" is used (for example, the record of the domain "bitcointalk.bit" uses the name "d / bitcointalk").  The power of a distributed computer network ensures that two identical names do not appear and that your name-value correspondence (domain-address in a particular case) cannot be assigned and changed by any unauthorized person. <br>  To gain access to domains located in the domain zone .bit, you can use a proxy server or DNS servers listed in the project wiki [7]. <br></div></div><br></li><li>  RainFly DNS - in development, from the creators of CJDNS </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What are we missing? </h4><br>  - A full social network - a clone of Facebook / vk but with a decentralized component, perhaps the basis for such a service will be Twister. <br>  - Torrent tracker <br>  - The system of decentralized forums - replacing the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168429/">deceased</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168537/">Osiris</a> <br><br>  <b>Is there something missing here?</b>  <b>- Write - we will make the list together.</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Survey results for decentralized services</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07c/925/3f2/07c9253f2d9b0006c31d6f624e549296.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/653/1a9/a82/6531a9a82c271cede65d56da1abc0e91.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1c/6b0/460/b1c6b046064303f49dfdf5f6e3fe0eb7.png"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212653/</a></p>
