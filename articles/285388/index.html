  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Many companies are good and different</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> For your 9 years of work experience, your humble servant has had a chance to work in various firms, companies, companies and even corporations have not yet found one that suits me completely in all respects. <br>  And then one day the thought occurred to me, and not to share with me my observations on how employees live in companies of different size and structure, their motivation and possible demotivators inside them. <a name="habracut"></a>  Perhaps I'll start with a small conditional classification: <br>  - large corporations or factories (number of employees from 1000 for the first and from 100 for the second); <br>  - well-established small firms, which, however, occupy a solid niche and have a stable income (the number of employees is from 20 to 100); <br>  - newly opened companies trying to occupy a small niche or wanting to have their own piece of cake (number of employees from 4 to 20) <br><br>  The classification is absolutely conditional and, of course, does not claim to be accurate.  So, imagine that you are a young man (or girl) who wants to get a well-paid job, have the opportunity for career growth and maximum freedom for self-realization and it‚Äôs difficult for you to dwell on one thing for a long time. <br>  What can you expect when the device in a particular type of company? <br><br>  The old good-quality plant in Russia of the 21st century (in any case, it was during my work there, much could have changed) - this is the ‚Äúscoop‚Äù collected on the territory of several dozen hectares.  In spite of any modern managerial innovations, invented and adopted long ago in the ‚ÄúBig World‚Äù, management principles laid down in the 50s of the last century rule here.  The most important thing that the first is striking is the dominance of the "old fleshy men" in all the main leadership posts.  I would like to be tougher, but censorship will not allow.  Moreover, all of them, as on selection, are conservative to such an extreme that they probably did not even dream of the English (known for their extreme traditionality) in nightmarish dreams.  I remember a case when the implementation of the Spektr automated control system was being carried out and the implementers (young, good guys from Rybinsk) had to sign 4 documents with 3 people.  Poor fellows spent two days at the reception, before they were able to complete the task.  The reason for this (and this applies to everything that happens there) is a complete misunderstanding and not a desire to "rule" accept and understand something new and take on some kind of responsibility, because it‚Äôs much easier to sit with an important look and drive like a pin-pong ball-man back and forth. <br>  As for the team, there are very few young people here, and the one that is either ‚Äúfor seniority‚Äù, or from not being able to get to another, more pleasant job because of its specifics, and only a few get the buzz from it all.  By the way, the work as such for it-person is very small.  Those.  Of course, it is there, but you will most likely not see any development or knowledge of new things here, but if you do not perform difficult duties well, then in 10-15 years you can count on a high place when your boss retires.  In this regard, machine operators certainly much better.

      Corporation.  It would seem that such a major company as JSC ‚Äú**** Lekom‚Äù should be the ideal of the dreams of a young engineer, but it was not there.  The beautiful spacious offices, a rather young team, at the interview were not happy to see my 2 year experience in the field of telecommunications, they promised to send and pay for Cisco courses ... but ... after being hired, everything was immediately forgotten.  I will say that for the year of work in this organization, I was never provided with either a workplace or a computer - in general, nothing.  I did not understand why they needed me. <br>  Active (key word) young techies in such a company do not anything because of the terrible bureaucracy, which by the way hinders its development.  It looks like this: the company announces the entry of small legal entities into the market.  and nat.  individuals.  A customer calls the sales department, and he says - I want this and that.  And here it begins ... so that it would be trite to plug the client's plug into the switch port, you need to write a bunch of letters, go through a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãapprovals and other red tape ... during this time the client loses patience and by the time of a positive decision bought a similar service from a smaller competitor a long time ago.  That's all love :-) <br>  It is not for nothing that I emphasized the phrase ‚Äúactive techies‚Äù above, the fact is that it is quite possible to work and develop comfortably in other positions, especially for managers in the fight ... ugh ... for working with clients.  Because for them the result is not the main thing, they reported to the management about the receipt of a heap of applications, received awards, but the fact that none of this did not work, so the guilt of slow techies :-) <br><br>  Finally, let us move from high and solid to small and soft ... In this area, as they say, there is a place where an inexperienced specialist, young flaming soul, can roam.  It‚Äôs not so easy to choose here and there are a lot of pitfalls.  I will share here and life experience.  As an example of a well-established company, I will cite a regional Internet provider, in close symbiosis with which I stayed for three years.  Such a company for a techie is an earthly paradise and this is why: all the main business processes are already established, departments clearly interact, management is here, sitting behind the wall, come up and solve operational issues.  Opportunities to show yourself are also the sea, but the main thing is to know when to stop, otherwise they may sit on the neck and it will be like in that joke about ‚Äúcan you not die like that cow?‚Äù.  With good productivity, you can work in such a company happily, gaining experience and getting a decent money.  However, despite all the gloss above, there may be a number of problems.  So if you openly climb on the rampage, or stand out sharply from the masses, the employees will hardly be satisfied with this and may start adjusting your tricks or transfer unfounded arrows in failed cases, for the same reason (at least I watched it in my case) ) The company may have a large turnover on the lower tiers of the service ladder, which also does not give a healthy atmosphere.  Career growth in the case of your competence in such a company is quite logical, and an increase to the level of your boss is possible after 2 - 3 years of work. <br><br>  And finally, let's talk about young, ambitious IT-companies that have recently opened and announced the recruitment of employees.  One of the big advantages of such a company is that the front and the line of business are not clearly delineated, and if you are an energetic and broad-minded person, then you have every chance to participate in the process of becoming a company, because  the management at this stage with pleasure and interest will listen to all your "mega ideas" and perhaps even give the green light to their realization, thus, if successful, you can quickly fly up the ladder and get sincere respect from your colleagues and superiors.  It is also possible to attribute to big pluses the fact that all employees as a rule were recruited recently, which means the absence of inter-orderly orders, thereby putting everyone in one row and letting decent ones get ahead.  But as always, and here there is a downside, young firms are usually not very stable, and therefore, if you have a wife, a child, and a beloved mother-in-law, then you are taking a risk here to a certain extent.  Is the game worth the candle - you decide. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285388/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285388/</a></p>
