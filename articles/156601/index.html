  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why you shouldn‚Äôt part with your ‚Äúold‚Äù iPad</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you own a third-generation iPad, you must be feeling a little ‚Äúheated‚Äù by Apple.  But you are calm about the announced iPad Mini.  The fourth generation iPad bothers you, right?  But only 6 months ago you purchased the <s>latest</s> latest and greatest new iPad?  Already not cool.  You are not the only one carrying an iPad that does not have the fastest mobile processor from Apple, and with a simple 30-pin connector, which has now become an ugly scar compared to the small ‚ÄúLighting Connector‚Äù connector of the fourth iPad.  Oh yeah, the new iPad is also more powerful graphics processor and the camera is also better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Good news: You can ignore your buyer's remorse.  Your 3rd iPad is awesome.  Hell, even the 2nd iPad (which Apple still sells by the way) is still good.  So if you feel your third generation iPad is disappointed, stop it.  And if you are thinking about getting rid of him for the fourth model, don't do it. <br><br>  At least because iOS updates are traditionally supported for at least two older generations of devices.  For example, iOS 6, which was released in September, runs not only on the new iPhone 5 but also on the iPhone 4S, 4 and even on the 3GS.  Yes, the first-generation iPad, now already has a little more than 2 and a half years old, and is stuck with iOS 5. But the fact that the iPad Mini runs on an A5 processor, which was also the second iPad (now this is two generations ago) good sign.  Apple will not leave Mini users without software updates for at least a few more years.  And so your third iPad, which has a newer hardware, is even further away from obsolescence than the first Mini. <br><br>  Another reason to miss the next new iPad is the Apple announcement schedule.  Earlier this week, Apple has always launched its new iPad in the spring.  The first went on sale in April 2010, the second in March 2011 and the third in March 2012. If Apple follows the tradition of launching iPads in spring, this could mean that the fifth generation can be expected early next year, which would leave the owners of the fourth model The iPad is exactly in the same position that you are now in, contemplating the ‚Äúupdate game,‚Äù six months after the purchase.  And what if Apple will wait until next fall with the update line of tablets?  Then your third will be no more than a year and a half older.  You would still have, at least a year, the tablet remaining relevant if Apple supports the shelf life as well as for the first model.  Even owners of a second iPad are probably better off skipping the update to the 4th model and waiting for what comes next.

      I hope now you are convinced.  If you don‚Äôt have your first iPad, or you don‚Äôt have an Apple tablet, you can skip this one.  But if you are absolutely determined to get rid of your third iPad for the latest model, here are a few suggestions on how to deal with it. <br><br>  If the cost is nothing for you and has never been a problem, you can take your old new iPad to the Apple Store and donate it to the Teach for America's Academic iPads program.  Local school districts can also have their own launched iPad tablet donation programs, such as the Lighthouse in the Community iPad Appeal, a program in Connecticut. <br><br>  If this is not for you, then you can always shove your tablet on eBay or on Craiglist, to someone who sees value in what you already neglect.  There are more options to resell your devices for example through Gazelle, NextWorth and iCracked.  But even if you resell your iPad, you will be at a loss.  Even in perfect condition, the third 16-gigabyte iPad, with the original packaging, will bring only about $ 250, against $ 500 that the new one would have cost just a few weeks ago. <br><br>  However, wait.  If you bought your third iPad within the last 30 days, you can contact your local Apple store.  Employees of the Apple store in the central part of San Francisco told that they will accept for exchange all third-generation iPads that have been sold within the last 30 days, and if they have no dents, scratches or other signs of wear.  But this departure from the usual 14-day policy does not seem to be corporate.  Other Apple stores say they make no exceptions for third-generation iPads. <br><br>  Seriously, just stay with your third iPad.  It is still one of the best tablets. <br><br>  Original author: Nathan Olivarez-Giles <br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/10/ipad-3-owners-do-not-buy-the-ipad-4/">Original article in English</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156601/</a></p>
