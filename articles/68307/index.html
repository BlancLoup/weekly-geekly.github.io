  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Discussion: The Perfect Smartphone - What would you like to see in it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends, many of us own smartphones.  Someone still uses Vinmobile, someone moved to more modern Iphone Os or Android ... <br>  Under the smarts there are already tens of thousands of programs written, but something is always missing ... Or maybe something is missing in the smarts themselves ... <br>  So I put the question: What would I like to see in the "perfect" smartphone?  What functions would I like it to perform? <br>  In many ways, these reflections are more from the realm of science fiction, but given the speed of development of technology, I think that most of my wishes, at least, are quite feasible even with the current level of technology.  I proceed from at least my preference to have 1 device that ‚Äúeverything can‚Äù, and not an army of them <br>  Under the cut my wishes, and in the comments I would be glad to hear your wishes <br>  PS: Write "brew coffee" or other more intimate desires, I think not worth it. Be realistic! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will briefly describe my schedule, which, it is suspected, will be similar to the schedule of many of you: <br>  I live at home (if not strange), at home there is high-speed Internet, he is at work. <br>  The path from home to work takes at least 20 minutes, sometimes 40. I would like to use them with benefits ... I actively use: mail, RSS, twitter, LJ ... <br><ul><li>  So wish # 1: Rss reader, twitter client, mail client with voice synthesizer and voice control, which I could read the news on the way to work.  For example, we read the headlines, and when we receive a voice command, we read the news completely. In general, the existing voice control in IMHO smarts is not very good, although apparently it is not far off. </li><li>  Wish number 2: Built-in FM transmitter.  Many of us store a lot of music on smarts (iPhones), and it would be nice to be able to listen to it in the car (and on the radio) without ultra-complicated adapters and cables + broadcast navigation commands through the car audio system (Mostly already implemented on the basis of Bluetouth) </li><li>  Wish number 3 Using smart as a USB hub for transferring to it, for example, photos from a camera or files from a USB flash drive + when connected to Wi-Fi accessibility on the network as a media server (seemingly already implemented) </li><li>  Wish number 4 (seemingly already implemented in some devices) - connect to TV to play HD video. </li><li>  Wish number 5 Again sounding books.  Recently there was a topic that on BB this has already been implemented quite at a normal level. </li><li>  Wish number 6 (again seen in concepts) Projected onto any surface full-size keyboard with the ability to enter </li><li>  Wish number 7 Built-in projector for presentations or just surfing on a larger screen </li><li>  Wish number 8 Large amounts of internal memory.  It seems that iPhones are already going with 32 gigs, they are going to release 60 gigabytes ... But we know how much a real maniac needs .... 120-160 gig as min! </li><li>  Wish # 9 Wireless connection to a Home audio system as a media source. </li><li>  Wish number 10 (arrogance of course, but you can also dream) adding support for DECT and switching to it with a smart forwarding call (mobile via mobile network, urban via urban, international via cyp), if you are within the range of the DECT network - I understand Google Voice does something similar, but unfortunately for us it is not yet available. </li></ul><br>  With respect and invitation to the discussion, <br>  Arseny <br><br>  PS I would also be grateful for the recommendations of existing programs that already implement these functions. </div>
