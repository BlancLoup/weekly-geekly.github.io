This publication is about a small integration of external service in Habr and Geektimes, which you would never know about.  There will not be a line about the blockchain, not about machine learning, or even about the analysis of the source code DOOM III.  But there will be some cats. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3ea/080/244/3ea08024425b4949980c874d928cbe5e.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this small Friday note I would like to tell you about one cool service that helps us in our daily work.  Namely - <a href="http://text.ru/">text.ru</a> is a service that allows you to check texts for uniqueness, look for errors in them, etc.  It works simply: open the site, paste text from the clipboard and press the ‚ÄúCheck for uniqueness‚Äù button.  After some time, get a visual result: what pieces of text and where are they borrowed from: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/296/d21/d05/296d21d05be948be974c3340dc939bae.png">

      ‚Üí <a href="">Enlarge image</a> |  <a href="https://text.ru/antiplagiat/5982d5b4c441e">View live check result</a> <br><br>  In case of doubt, there is a letter-by-letter comparison of each fragment of mutual understanding with the original: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9a2/923/09f/9a292309f585447da62c8702f02aa4b9.png"><br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="">Enlarge image</a> <br><br>  As you already understood, this service turned out to be very convenient for moderating the publications that users send to us in the Sandbox - after all, you need to check each one, and they send up to several dozens every day! <br><br>  Once upon a time, we simply copied random lines of publications and searched for them in Yandex or Google - if there were exact matches of several pieces, then the material was rejected as copy-paste.  Later we stumbled upon text.ru and began to check the texts through it - it‚Äôs still more convenient and reliable when the entire publication is checked, not by a man, but by a robot. <br><br>  At this stage, the first hitch appeared: even if registering with the service, it was still a ‚Äúfree account‚Äù, all materials from which stood in the ‚Äúqueue for review‚Äù of the texts sent to the service - sometimes it could take several minutes, because there were quite a lot of users.  It is easy to guess that only checking the uniqueness of a dozen ‚Äúsand‚Äù publications in such a case could easily take an hour, but they still need to correct the formatting in accordance with our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/262653/">guidelines</a> , correct mistakes, punctuation, etc. <br><br>  The solution was to buy a Pro-account, which, among other things, allows you to check texts without a queue - this is already a considerable saving of time.  The second plus of the Pro-account is the ability to check texts at a time more than 15,000 characters.  The third plus of the Pro-account is the ability to access the <a href="https://text.ru/api-check/manual">API of the service</a> , which we successfully used: in each sand publication a button appeared ‚ÄúThe result of the check on text.ru‚Äù: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e4b/9c8/762/e4b9c87628b24997b109540a0bbfbd1c.png"></a> <br><br>  The mechanics turned out to be the following: the user sent the publication to the sandbox, it was automatically checked for uniqueness in the service and a link to the page with the result of the check was inserted into the publication header so that the moderator could click on it and see the finished result without any queues (a unique link is formed for each material available only to the account owner).  It turned out a good time-saving moderation with its increased quality. <br><br>  But here we were waiting for another pitfall.  Even having a Pro-account on the service, he had a daily limit on the number of characters to be checked - 50,000. What is 50 KB of text?  Someone this will be enough for a week, but on Habr√© it is sometimes one publication, or even half.  If the daily limit was exhausted, then the publication did not appear cherished blue "plate" with the results of the test.  To expand this restriction on the service, it is proposed to buy so-called ‚Äúcharacter packages‚Äù - a package of 50,000,000 characters costs 15,000 rubles, for example.  In this case, the daily limit of 50,000 characters daily renewable on the Pro-account is spent first, and only then the purchased characters are consumed.  Fair.  But still, the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúeither pay or suffer with limits‚Äù with the Pro account already purchased was not very pleasing. <br><br>  Here it is important to make a small digression: this integration of the service was solely my initiative and make it an impatient during the New Year holidays.  Despite the possibility of paying for services by bank transfer, I didn‚Äôt want to wait for any trouble with bills and requisites, so I paid for the Pro account for a year from my own funds.  Then I didn‚Äôt understand further arithmetic of working with the service, but very soon I realized that Habre exhausts all possible limits quite quickly, especially if ‚Äúin two bows‚Äù with Geektimes. <br><br><h2>  Where are the cats ?! </h2><br>  Under the law of meanness, the daily limits of characters ended at the most inopportune moment.  And once I asked the support service to charge a few characters to check the operation of the system: <br><br><blockquote>  <b><font color="#0071c5">User # 12345 (02/09/2017 16:40:44)</font></b> <br>  Do I understand correctly that once we have a PRO account, then every day we are charged 50,000 characters for verification through the API?  And when we use them up, the articles stop being checked and return the error ‚ÄúLack of symbols on the balance sheet‚Äù? <br><br><pre><code class="hljs pgsql"><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107248</span></span>: https://<span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">text</span></span>.ru/text_check/result/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">589</span></span>c6e64432fa <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107250</span></span>: https://<span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">text</span></span>.ru/text_check/result/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">589</span></span>c6e6893129 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107252</span></span>: https://<span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">text</span></span>.ru/text_check/result/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">589</span></span>c6e6b56a26 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107256</span></span>: https://<span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">text</span></span>.ru/text_check/result/<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">589</span></span>c6e6c7d7e2 <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107260</span></span>: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Array</span></span> (   [error_code] =&gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">142</span></span>   [error_desc] =&gt;     ) <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">107302</span></span>: <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Array</span></span> (   [error_code] =&gt; <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">142</span></span>   [error_desc] =&gt;     )</code> </pre> <br>  <b><font color="#cc0000">Administration (02/09/2017 17:01:46)</font></b> <br>  Yes, you can spend this package on api-check.

Sometimes we skip such publications, knowing that they are being putted in, and in the comments they will surely appear ‚Äúhow did you get an invite for it?‚Äù.  In this case, I would like to remind one thing: ‚ÄúThe sandbox‚Äù is not a forge of gold publications, it is a kind of small entrance exam that a new user must pass in order to become a full member of the community.

And how the periodic jokes of users lifted the mood - it's just like a small island of positive in the ocean of routine and monotony.  And now I am pleased to think that the seals cause a support employee at the end of the wire to at least smile.
