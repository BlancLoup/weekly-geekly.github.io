In general, it should look wrong.  Do not let your laziness rule you.  Start the morning tomorrow with another.  We offer you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/958/dfc/ae8/958dfcae84be45ff803a52802da502d7.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">1.</font> Sleep well for 7+ hours </h4><br>  Yes, it sounds utopian, but it is really very important.  It is also important how to drink a glass of water or eat something in the morning.  Sleep can not be neglected and deplete your body too. <br><br>  In the US, there is an organization responsible for sleep issues (it exists!) And it is called The National Sleep Foundation (NSF).  So the researchers found that 40 million Americans suffer from 70 different types of sleep disorders.  In general, about 60% of adults and 69% of children have trouble sleeping at least once a week.

      Now we will try to convince you that you need to sleep and what the lack of sleep affects: <br>  - Memory deteriorates, <br>  - Your life is shortened, <br>  - You become less creative, <br>  - You can't concentrate, <br>  - Resist the stress, <br>  - Increases the risk of getting into any kind of unpleasant situations, <br>  - You are prone to depression, <br>  - Google to help you! <br><br>  Do not read further this article and do not try to introduce something else into your life until you improve your relationship with sleep.  Just stop pretending that it is not very important.  It is important.  HIGHLY. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">2. To</font> achieve harmony </h4><br>  After you slept, you need to set yourself up for a good day, positive.  Everyone does it differently.  You can, for example, meditate or ... pray. <br><br>  Cleanse yourself and your head of all horrible thoughts, tune in to the good.  Man is a magnet.  It attracts good to itself, if it radiates itself. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">3.</font> Do sports </h4><br>  Exercise is the key to well-being.  Man is a creature that requires movement, and nowadays we hardly get it.  In the morning, go for a run, turn on your yoga lesson for 30 minutes and you will feel better. <br><br>  Force yourself to move in the morning.  Move! <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">4.</font> Take 30 grams of protein </h4><br>  Professor Donald Leyman of the University of Illinois in his book "The 4-Hour Body" claims that this is the secret of his weight loss.  30 grams of protein (cottage cheese, eggs, a sandwich with butter and a piece of meat and so on). <br><br>  Protein = protein.  Protein = life.  Having consumed such amount of protein in the morning you don‚Äôt want to eat for a long time and breakfast will really become a guarantee of a successful day for you. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">5.</font> Take a cold shower </h4><br>  Accelerates blood through the body, leads to a tone, speeds up the metabolism and strengthens the immune system.  Yes, this douche can just change your life! <br><br>  Your quality of life should improve, just believe.  Yes, of course, take a cold shower in Russia in the winter - something from the category of fiction.  But in the summer it is quite possible to afford it.  Moreover, the water is turned off so on time and so on for a long time.  Stop warm basins! <br><br>  * 20 seconds will be enough to get used to the cold water. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">6.</font> Listen / read something useful </h4><br>  Ordinary people are looking for entertainment.  Unusual people with a high level of intelligence are looking for knowledge.  And constantly learn. <br><br>  Spend 15 minutes in the morning to listen, for example, a couple of videos from a course of some kind (they all take only a few minutes).  Or start reading a book. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">7.</font> Revise your goals </h4><br>  Everything must be formulated and written.  Set yourself big goals and achieve small ones.  If you do this every day, you will have a manifesto. <br><br>  Achieving the goal - the science that in life will have to comprehend.  It's just better to do it consciously.  Gnaw granite and practice simultaneously. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#ff3f5f">8.</font> Do something you put off until later </h4><br>  The worst and most unpleasant things do at the beginning of the day.  So you will have a charge and you can do everything else quickly and painlessly.  Just start.  Tomorrow you can start changing your life, stop procrastinating.  This is not even funny! <br><br>  Start a new life?  It's time to find a new job.
