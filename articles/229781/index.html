  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To help the school sysadmin</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Informatization of education, the school of the future, the federal targeted program for the development of education ... These and similar headings, used as slogans, are more and more common.  And it seems that something is even being done.  Schools supply equipment (albeit a bit), software, they are connected to the Internet.  However, all these good undertakings are faced with a catastrophic shortage of normal specialists who could solve all the problems arising in the course of informatization of schools.  Maybe for Moscow and St. Petersburg this is not so critical.  But in the regions still in many schools the duties of a sysadmin are performed by an informatics teacher (if he is at school at all).  And if there is a separate specialist, then this is either a person who comes a couple of times a week, or a student who just works as a student in parallel with his studies. <br><br>  Why all this talk?  And the fact that if schools can cope with some ordinary IT problems on their own, then solving other problems may not be too tough for them.  Take at least the requirements for the protection of students from access to <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/Traffic-Inspector/Features/blocking-sites/">unwanted information</a> .  The fact that this needs to be done is announced to all schools (and it is spelled out in the laws).  And that the prosecutor's office is closely watching this and punishing the "violators" too (and many schools have already experienced this "on their skin").  But nobody talks about HOW to do it.  In fact, schools are left to their own devices.  And they solve the problem of controlling children's access to undesirable sites as they can.  And since ‚Äúit is possible‚Äù is far from always good (see what was written above), then the prosecutor‚Äôs office constantly finds someone to ‚Äúpublicly flog‚Äù and fine. <br><br>  We offer a solution - a series of video lessons in which the process of setting up the <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/solutions/school/">Traffic Inspector</a> proxy server to protect students from unwanted information is described in as much detail as possible.  After reviewing them, you can independently perform all necessary actions and create a reliable protection system that will satisfy all current regulatory acts.

      The first deals with the process of creating black and white lists.  It shows in detail how it is possible to prohibit access to certain web projects or, on the contrary, to prohibit the download of all sites in general, except for those explicitly indicated. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Wuicsn7Z7g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQ6uMxa3DKjcPTr0IwrFMDkxnmrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The second video tutorial describes setting up blocking sites that are contained in a special state registry for educational institutions, taking into account its possible updates in the future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/haGcleBtAI8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7ME5U6WWop-VKGuYcMo4UD0clbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And finally, the third video shows the use of the NetPolice module - a special database in which the sites are divided by topics.  Thus, you can deny or allow access, simply by selecting the desired categories. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAbo-qGkKx8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhInzar9yVQujUoMqRI-H5kXuAKrw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  All three described tools to protect schoolchildren have the right to life.  Moreover, they can be combined with each other, achieving the desired result.  It is clear that, first of all, these video lessons are useful to those schools where Traffic Inspector is used as a <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/Traffic-Inspector/Features/proxy-server/">proxy server</a> .  Indeed, after viewing them, setting up a protection system is not difficult even for a person who is far from IT.  However, other interested parties will also be able to extract some useful information from the clips. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/229781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/229781/</a></p>
