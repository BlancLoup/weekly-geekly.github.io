  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mystical data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most amazing and delightful works of architecture in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚Äãthe capital of the Spanish province of Catalonia, is the grand Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family (Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Fam√≠lia).  This is one of the most famous long-term construction projects in the world, the famous project of the architect Antonio Gaudi.  Its erection has already been going on for more than 130 years with a few interruptions (since 1882).  According to the statement of the Spanish government, the church could be fully completed no earlier than 2026. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/538/d51/3ae/538d513ae93a4114912474798e1fb5e7.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A common obstacle was the banal lack of funds for the construction of this truly architectural masterpiece, as the ambitious project was built solely on donations from residents of Barcelona.  Despite the fact that it is still under construction, the captivating magic of this creation attracts more than 3 million tourists a year.

Colons go underground at a depth of 20 meters, and reach a height of 70 meters.  Each of them can withstand a seven-point earthquake and wind gusts up to 200 kilometers per hour.  It was the first in the history of the house with an underground garage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e3/029/f34/7e3029f34f5545ad8d37cd0126727c63.jpg"><br><br>  For the Sagrada Familia there was a question about the expediency of deploying a data center.  And of course, if we are talking about the deployment of a data center, the dates in the centuries here are by no means suitable.  Until recently, it was enough to have a small server room to support and maintain the <a href="http://www.sagradafamilia.org/">site</a> , as well as to monitor more than 250 surveillance cameras.  The commissioning of a small and secure data center would increase the reliability of the site, the number of visitors and users of which is constantly growing.  Also, given the introduction of additional services in the future, which would be provided through the global web of current capacity simply would not be enough. <br><br>  Since the Church of the Holy Family in 2005 was listed as a UNESCO <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320">World Heritage Site</a> , the priority is to preserve it due to its special cultural and historical value.  Therefore, the construction of a traditional data center due to the complexity of the project is unacceptable.  But the solution was found - modular modular data centers manufactured by AST Modular (Schneider Electric).  Modular solutions make it possible to deploy IT infrastructure relatively quickly, one of the advantages is also the absence of a heavy burden of high capital investments.  The project used 2 double modular data centers of the NON ISO 25 series, each of which can hold 10 racks.  Power rack 4 kW, it is also possible to increase this figure to 8 kW.  The project was recently completed, making the site itself more functional and secure, the function of acquiring digital tickets appeared for visitors, and a new access control system was introduced. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ROylzRsDSHE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Also, to ensure the safety of visitors and temple workers, an entire <a href="https://weathercloud.net/pdf/case_studies/weathercloud-ventos-sagrada-familia-case-study-rev-a.pdf">wind monitoring system</a> was developed based on solutions from Weathercloud.  The temple was equipped with an ultrasonic anemometer, the sensor of which allows receiving and transmitting data on wind speed and direction even in cases of power failure.  All indicators about the wind are collected in real time and stored on a special server ventOS, which is installed in the new modular data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d6/89b/0a4/6d689b0a42b94cbca94c938a7dfea0c8.png"><br><br>  Perhaps the temple is not the most favorable place for the development of various kinds of IT technologies, but the fact that they appear in such unusual and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBlXUMOVrWaI">mystical places</a> shows the importance of innovative solutions in our daily life.  Everything develops very quickly and even such monumental buildings need to keep up with the times. <br><br>  <b>UPD: A</b> group of students at the University of Eindhoven built the <a href="http://www.sagradafamiliainice.structuralice.com/sagrada-familia-in-ice.html">Sagrada Fam√≠lia out of ice</a> , using the so-called pikerite (a mixture of sawdust and water ice) as the material.  One dome has a height of about 30 meters, which made it the highest ice dome in the world.  Interestingly, they do not think about the fact that in such favorable cool conditions to place another data center. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkcWQflAiys" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/253823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/253823/</a></p>
