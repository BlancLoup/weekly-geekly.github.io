  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Shooting drones in the United States has become a federal crime</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At least 12 drones in the US were shot down in the air.  In Arkansas, a man shot a drone, which he thought could be recorded on video of his children playing in the backyard, identical cases occurred in Wyoming and Virginia.  In Oklahoma, a woman, confident that the drone was watching her, turned to her neighbor, who helped her with a gun. <br><br>  Under the new law, the punishment for a downed legal drone will reach 20 years in prison, and for threats to the drone operator you can get up to 5 years in prison.  These rules are contrary to some local legislation that allows police or firefighters to shoot down UAVs while interfering with their work. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/274460/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/517/89e/eba/51789eebad675736522bf48b81d5d8b3.jpg" width="600" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Hill View Heights, Wyoming, in the summer of 2015, a man shot a drone that was circling over his two daughters in a pool.  The drone flew over the houses, descended to a height of three meters, sometimes even looked under the patio, and was clearly interested in underage girls.  After the shot, the owner of the drone with three friends visited the master of the house.  The man confirmed that he had fired, and that if this man stepped into his territory, there would be a new exchange of fire - the Glock was with him.  The caring father was arrested and the drone was returned to the owner, without even removing the drive.

      In April 2016, a man in Arkansas, in the same way, <a href="http://www.ktts.com/news/man-in-trouble-foe-shooting-a-drone">defended his children from unauthorized video shooting</a> by shooting a drone above the backyard.  According to the UAV operator, the drone shot a nearby lake.  The caring father faced problems with the law, the investigation continues. <br><br>  The <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2016/04/14/faa_confirms_it_s_a_federal_crime_to_shoot_down_a_drone.html">new law deals with legal drones</a> , that is, unmanned vehicles registered by the Federal Aviation Administration.  But it is unclear how it can be determined by appearance, whether the drone is legal, conducts a scheduled survey or study, or simply spies on children. <br><br>  What should an ordinary American do if a quadrocopter flies right over his land?  Representatives of the authorities advise to collect all available information and contact the police, which will investigate the incident.  Arkansas has a video-voyeurism law that was supplemented in 2015 with a mention of drones.  If you violate the confidentiality of another person, you may be faced with charges of crimes of class A or B, which means the maximum punishment before life or death penalty, or up to 20 years in prison. <br><br>  These rules are contrary to some local legislation.  California authorities in July 2015 offered to allow firefighters to shoot down drones after the incident, in which drones filmed a fire on video and thus <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/259170/">prevented him from extinguishing</a> , and in Utah police were already <a href="http://www.popsci.com/utah-lawmakers-pave-way-for-legal-drone-shootdowns">allowed to shoot down drones</a> in emergency situations. <br><br><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="622169862094262272"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393111/</a></p>
