  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Market prospects for Russian IT startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last week, the press center of Rossiyskaya Gazeta held a round table discussion on which there was such an urgent question for market participants how good is the way of copying successful Western projects, or, if broader, to formulate what is the development path of Russia in terms of innovative development and will we ever be able to get closer to the States from the point of view of creating new, non-commodity and trade, namely IT projects. <br><br>  At our meeting, Tatyana Tsvetkova was from our company. We want to share her story about the event with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, at the meeting there were both those who upheld the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcopying - for example, Wikimart, completely repeating the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãStanford University, and those who follow their own path, and such an idea as copying is not relevant for them at all - 1C. <br><br>  The question was raised why there are so few in our country who are capable of creating their own project.  And here a lot of criticism had primarily on the training system.

      According to Alexander Galitsky, in universities, including  technical level, the level of education is sharply reduced, since there are no orders from the defense industry, which earlier allowed to raise good personnel.  In the absence of "techies" breakthroughs in terms of serious ideas, it becomes increasingly difficult to wait. <br><br>  Part of the problem is seen in education by representatives of Skolkovo, who, as you know, found their solution - to attract the Massachusetts University of Technology.  To involve Western teachers in order to keep abreast of trends - indeed, this may somewhat improve the situation. <br><br>  Our company is also fully aware of the importance of the problem, that in Russia there are not very few entrepreneurs in spirit, but in general very few professional employees who are responsible for the result, are not lazy and are ready to work with full dedication to ‚Äúraise‚Äù a startup - all these things Do not "graft" at the institute level. <br>  All new specialists have to be trained to some extent: in spite of the fact that the market of Internet specialists is large, the quality of their training is very low. <br>  Especially the problem is obvious at events with presentations of startups: there are good ideas, but there are no quality teams at all. <br><br>  Another problem is that there is no access to Western, large investments.  To get in sight of these investors, you must either be in the ‚Äúget-together‚Äù, i.e.  finish Stanford, or go directly to them with a great idea and team, which is obviously not entirely realistic. <br><br>  What to do?  Here everyone had his answer and he usually boiled down to ‚Äúwhat we do‚Äù. <br><br>  1C proposes to develop its own product and grow local business franchisors. <br><br>  It was also proposed to make Russia attractive for "minds" - so that it was interesting to come to Western specialists. <br><br>  Nobody is waiting for infrastructure support from the state (and this is not really necessary), but what is really needed is a wide coverage of success stories of Russian IT companies.  A significant event for the entire industry - IPO Mail.Ru and Yandex - was covered in the media, but the top officials of the state did not ‚Äúmeet them at the airport with flowers‚Äù, as is the case with athletes who won the competition.  There is no propaganda to the mass audience that the Internet and IT are cool, but this is really so! <br><br>  Express your opinion: what do you agree with, and what are you ready to question?  Or maybe you have your thoughts on this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121826/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121826/</a></p>
