  <section class="page js-page"><h1>English for interviews in an IT company: what do you need to start a career?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Interview in English is not easy.  But good planning and preparation of key points will make this process more enjoyable and harmless. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/9b2/e95/8cc/9b2e958cc617447a8b6a673cfa89eade.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a></p><br><p>  We will try to cheer you up a bit before moving on to the most interesting: </p><br><ul><li>  Remember that if you were called for an interview, it means that you have already passed the preliminary selection and attracted the attention of a potential employer; </li><li>  everything that preceded the interview - writing a resume, a cover letter and answering questions by phone - was done right; </li><li>  it remains only not to spoil the impression of their English. </li></ul><br><p>  By the way, we have prepared a lesson dedicated to the interview in the course of <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/courses/english-for-it/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">English for IT</a> . <br>  You can get free access to the online course for a year - take the promotional code at the end of the article. </p><br><h2 id="tell-us-about-yourself---rasskazhite-o-sebe">  Tell us about yourself - tell us about yourself </h2><br><p>  It is worth telling about yourself, describe your hobbies, interests.  To correctly answer this question, use: </p><br><ul><li>  simple time <u>Present Simple</u> ; </li><li>  words, phrases <u>like, enjoy, be keen on, be into</u> and occupation in the form of verbs with the ending <u>-ing</u> or nouns; </li><li>  time markers like <u>every day, month</u> . </li></ul><br><p>  This is quite enough to tell you in some detail about how you go to the gym every Tuesday and Thursday, or how on weekends you can go kayaking, etc .: </p><br><pre><code class="xml hljs">I am into computer games. At weekends I meet my friends and we play CS GO with other teams. //    .           CS GO   .</code> </pre> <br><p>  Try to think in advance how your answer to your hobby question characterizes you as a candidate. </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I go for a run every morning because I have a goal to win a marathon. //   ,      .</code> </pre> <br><p>  This wording describes not only your hobbies, but also shows your long-term and purposefulness, and this is important for any position. <br>  And if you need more similar words - see the dictionary " <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/skills/glossary/wordset/polozhitelnye-cherty-xaraktera/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">positive character traits</a> ." </p><br><h2 id="what-about-your-experience---rasskazhite-o-vashem-opyte">  What about your experience - tell about your experience </h2><br><p>  Here, too, do not complicate things, and therefore we will come in handy in most cases: </p><br><ul><li>  <u>Past Simple</u> and its markers of the type <u>in 2001, a year ago, last week</u> , etc .; </li><li>  correct company name, business, site and, if possible, recommendations from the previous place of work; </li><li>  job title and description of the period of work in the format <u>from 2010 to or till 2015</u> ; </li><li>  The words and phrases of <u>work, perform, my responsibilities or duties were</u> and the duties themselves in previous work. </li></ul><br><p>  Example: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I worked for RealDeal from 2010 till 2012 and my main responsibilities were monitoring the overall security of the system and investigating likely loopholes. //    RealDeal  2010  2012               .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="what-are-your-main-achievements---vashi-dostizheniya">  What are your main achievements - your achievements </h2><br><p>  This is a very important point, which is definitely worth mentioning, and the employer will ask about it. <br>  Here you can use the same words and constructions as in the story about your experience, as well as the words <u>create (create), develop (develop), introduce (introduce), implement (implement)</u> : </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">My achievement is that I implemented a new documentation system. It saved a lot of time for our team. //   -  ,      .       .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="what-are-your-main-skills---vashi-navyki">  What are your main skills - your skills </h2><br><p>  In fact, they just need to be able to enumerate using the following phrases: </p><br><p>  my main skills are (my key skills are this) or I have developed the following skills (I have developed the following skills) and then simply call reverse engineering, programming, etc. </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I have developed the following skills: networking, software engineering and working with operating systems. //    :  ,      .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="what-are-your-advantages-and-disadvantages---vashi-dostoinstva-i-nedostatki">  What are your advantages and disadvantages - your advantages and disadvantages </h2><br><p>  The following words are suitable for merit: </p><br><ul><li>  action-oriented - action oriented </li><li>  ambitious - ambitious </li><li>  autonomous - autonomous </li><li>  hard-working ‚Äî hardworking </li><li>  passionate - passionate </li><li>  detail-oriented - conscientious. </li></ul><br><p>  Of course, there are other words that are suitable for describing your positive qualities, but these words will definitely be nice for the employer to hear. </p><br><p>  But to describe the shortcomings is already more difficult, since there is a chance to bend over and say too much, or not to say a word, appearing too self-confident.  Therefore, we suggest using these phrases: <u>my weakness is (my weakness is) or I am not really good at (I do not really succeed)</u> and then describe the problem points with the obligatory amendment to but (but) and an explanation that we are already working on our own errors: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">My weakness is time management but I attend a time management course. //    ‚Äî   ,      -.</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="what-was-your-biggest-challenge---samyy-slozhnyy-vyzov-na-proshloy-rabote">  What was your biggest challenge - the most difficult challenge in past work </h2><br><p>  This is what you will hear in the continuation of the topic of flaws.  The question is asked specifically to check how conscientious and ready you are to compromise.  In this case, it is better to say something like: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">My biggest challenge was a full landing change in a short time but I completed this task. //           ,   .</code> </pre> <br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">It was difficult to work without days-off for two weeks but I agreed so that we could finish the project on time. //       ,   ,      .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="why-do-you-want-to-leave-your-current-job---pochemu-reshili-smenit-rabotu">  Why do you want to change your job? </h2><br><p>  Here it is, a tricky question that checks the personal qualities of the candidate.  It is not worth explaining that in the previous position you were not appreciated or were not given a sufficiently high salary, or, for example, the boss was too hard and his colleagues were unpleasant.  Just politely explain: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I thank that company for the experience, but I would like to have an opportunity to grow. //     ,       .</code> </pre> <br><p>  If this is not enough, you can specify that we want to acquire new skills or knowledge: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I would like to obtain managing skills. //      .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="what-are-your-plans-for-the-next-two-years---vashi-plany-na-blizhayshie-paru-let">  What are your plans for the next two years - your plans for the next couple of years </h2><br><p>  Probably many have heard this controversial question.  We all understand that this is how a long-term candidate is tested.  To convince the employer that we will not run away with a couple of MacBooks on the very first day, but are aimed at long-term cooperation, it is better to say this: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I would like to develop my PHP-5 skills and your position is a great chance for that. //       PHP-5,    -    .</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="how-much-would-you-like-to-earn---vashi-finansovye-ozhidaniya">  How much you would like to earn - your financial expectations </h2><br><p>  Yes, this is a rather difficult question if asked you, not you.  Of course, it's best to say that you are interested in a job that will help you realize your skills and interests: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">I'm more interested in finding a position that's a good fit for my skills and interests. I'm confident that you're offering a salary that's competitive in the current market. //   ,      .  ,        .</code> </pre> <br><p>  If more specific numbers are required of you, you can answer this: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">Well, according to my research and past experience, my understanding is that 75-90K per year is typical based on the role and requirements. //      ,   75-90        .</code> </pre> <br><p>  In the case when you are immediately voiced a certain figure, it is enough to say <u>I accept - accept or I don't accept - do not accept your offer (your offer)</u> . </p><br><p>  And in order to clarify what buns await you, besides your salary, simply specify: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">What bonuses will I have? //     ?</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="your-questions---voprosy-s-vashey-storony">  Your questions - questions from your side </h2><br><p>  Also prepare your questions about the vacancy to the employer, to show your best side.  In addition to the level of salary and bonuses, it is worth clarifying your responsibilities: </p><br><pre> <code class="xml hljs">Can I ask you a couple of questions? //    ? What will my responsibilities be? //    ?</code> </pre> <br><p>  It is also worth considering what more specific points you need to clarify.  So we will show that we are really interested in a job, and do not treat it as a bunch of others. </p><br><h2 id="naposledok">  At last </h2><br><p>  Some simple, but effective life hacking at the interview: </p><br><ul><li>  Before you go for an interview, try to learn more about the company and specify that you may be most interested in a future position; </li><li>  dress neatly and smile during the conversation in order to win over the recruiter; </li><li>  try to answer questions immediately - so you seem more sincere; </li><li>  adhere to the same tone of communication as the recruiter (tone of voice, movement, body gestures); <br>  after the interview, thank you for the meeting, not only verbally, but also in writing (so you gently remind yourself); </li><li>  do not press on the recruiter after the interview - just discuss the time of feedback and provide all the necessary contact information so that you can be contacted; <br>  behave with dignity at any decision of the recruiter (candidates are often denied due to their high qualifications, and not lack thereof); </li><li>  Do not forget about the sense of humor - this is one of the best ways to break the ice of the first dialogue and relax a little, because a recruiter can be worried when communicating with such a tough specialist like you! </li></ul><br><h2 id="bonusy-dlya-chitateley-habra">  Bonuses for Habr's readers </h2><br><p>  <b>Online Courses</b> </p><br><p>  We give you access for a year to the English course for self-study "Online course". <br>  To access, simply follow the <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/myprofile/purchases/4habra12/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">link</a> . </p><br><p>  <b>Individually by Skype</b> </p><br><p>  Specialized course " <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/skype/courses/it/%3Futm_medium%3Dblog%26utm_source%3Dhabrahabr">English for IT-specialists</a> " <br>  Classes are held at any time convenient for you. <br>  <b>Promo code</b> for 15% discount: <b>4habra15</b> <br>  Valid until June 1st.
