Two thousand houses remained small, very old.  Under the upcoming economic summit, almost everything was cleaned there, people were moved to the city.  As far as I know, military bases also redeployed.  To build new buildings began three years before the events described, which is pretty fast.  We had to provide the ‚ÄúIT stuffing‚Äù of the pilot office of Sberbank, where all the new technologies were tested.

      We passed the project in September 2012. It was not easy.  It was necessary to develop a concept, carefully design, find the equipment and systems appropriate for the terms of reference and the concept of the project, provide logistics, set up and assemble all of this taking into account heaps of features and integrate into a single system. <br><br>  But I'll start from the beginning. <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  The project turned out to be large-scale and rather long, so it‚Äôs worth telling what it was all about.  On the Russky Island was planned the Forum of the countries-participants of the Asia-Pacific region.  Funds were allocated for it, on which the infrastructure, bridges, roads, buildings of the Far Eastern Federal University were built.  For example, in this photo just one of the new bridges, which now, by and large, is a symbol of the city: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20d/052/9a5/20d0529a59cfe5f087d34bc1b5499093.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  But the new buildings of the Far Eastern Federal University.  This is the stand that I photographed in the city near the university.  It was planned to transfer here in general all the students who are now studying in the buildings scattered around the city.  Now they will live on an island with such an infrastructure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a2/7ec/b64/1a27ecb6475706cbfababf4684ff489f.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  In this case, the main building of the Far Eastern Federal University is now the office of "Sberbank", in which we implemented our project.  The task was to introduce in the room all the most modern information technologies that were available at that time in Russia.  At the same time, not just ‚Äúto be‚Äù, but to use all this in work. <br><br>  This is how the building looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/07b/1f8/bc8/07b1f8bc8c1d27f1d6a0ebe305017492.jpg" width="750"><br><br><h4>  Training </h4><br>  It all started with the preparation of the concept.  At that time we advised.  When it became clear what and how as a whole, the first difficulties emerged: a very serious experience was needed to pick up a lot of different equipment and correctly implement it all.  This is partly why, a little later, at the design stage, we were already working closely on the project. <br><br>  First, at the concept stage, everything was like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c3/151/c41/0c3151c4153857f6e2b2f0184e30ce24.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  And so it was about a month before the delivery of work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/072/2a8/932/0722a8932e92e610d049c06080324b12.jpg" width="750"><br><h4>  The next stage: the selection and implementation of equipment </h4><br>  When the design was completed, and the project was agreed, we began to procure and deliver equipment.  It sounds quite simple, but in practice it requires concerted actions and competent logistics. <br><br>  The choice of iron was quite laborious.  We collected information on the possibility of technical solutions - and in parallel, on how these solutions can be delivered to Russia, plus implemented according to customer requirements.  And there were quite a few requirements: for example, we had to take into account all the conditions that the security guards set, plus to think about the office design project and so on.  Virtually every company involved in the project somehow affected the actions of other teams. <br><br>  About the choice of iron.  Remember, we went to two major exhibitions of screens and brought a bunch of photos of equipment?  ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/186010/">http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/186010/</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/169863/">http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/169863/</a> ) Approximately the same trips were to Amsterdam and Paris.  The delegation included specialists searching for equipment specifically for this project.  We also visited IBM laboratories in Tokyo and Singapore, traveled to South Korea for consultations with Nautilus Hyosung (a supplier of several subsystems). <br><br>  In general, working with technological innovations is always a risk associated with the nuances of importing such equipment (some of the technologies implemented in the project have never been imported into the Russian Federation), obtaining the necessary certificates for it, and concluding partnership contracts with the manufacturers of these solutions. <br><br>  Plus, there is a risk associated with the launch of such solutions that our specialists have not worked with before.  Usually we try to run around all the new equipment in order to be ready for implementation by customers - but here many things came almost within a few days after the manufacturer‚Äôs release. <br><br>  The nuances were the sea, and the flexibility in the approach to solving problems really played into our hands. <br><br>  Of the important details, this was not work in Moscow, and indeed not on the ‚Äúmainland‚Äù: before launching the bridges in August, we traveled to the island by sea ferries and delivered equipment and food to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/089/15e/c42/08915ec428eb42980fafcdb9f784631c.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Russian Island in the distance</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f5/dfd/e4d/9f5dfde4d71574631268ab70caf03bbb.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>But the bridge across the Golden Horn</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/277/728/63f/27772863ff96ef388d34a87d955aae33.jpg" width="750" height="465"><br>  <i>This beautiful bridge on about.</i>  <i>Russian has greatly facilitated our logistics</i> <br><br><h4>  Implementation.  These were the main elements of the project: </h4><br><h5>  Large video wall </h5><br>  Video wall from MicroTiles projection cubes, made according to a unique design project for a non-standard screen shape.  Consists of 38 MicroTiles projection cubes and a Radar Touch device.  The content was developed according to a separate project by the partner company ENGAGE.  Radar Touch works very spectacularly: the device tracks the touch around the perimeter of the wall, and in accordance with this touch, it works out some kind of activity.  It turns out something like a big touch-screen.  People can watch precious metals rates, use exchange calculators, climb historical data of exchange rates, and so on.  Static content was simply poured onto the server and updated by hand, dynamic was constantly updated from various sources, prepared for the wall and was taken from the server by the controller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db0/283/fe5/db0283fe59ef14549bb29c38c952a7b9.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This thing is one of the most expensive solutions that we deployed.  She stands at the entrance to the office.  Instead of making a boring wall of rectangular or square shape, you can scatter the video cubes as you want.  The picture, of course, must be written under the wall.  On tests, she aroused the admiration of all the people who simply approached her.  What is important - you could immediately get the necessary information from the wall, for example, at the rate of gold. <br><br>  The wall was hung on the mount, which was prepared for individual orders.  It was welded to the bearing steel beams, on which the foundation of the entire building is built. <br><br><h5>  Hall ‚ÄúOnline‚Äù for negotiations </h5><br>  There are 12 LCD-panels, a complex of devices providing video conferencing sessions (VCS), a VCS control system, a video wall controller.  As a result, videoconferencing can be conducted, including with users of Android and iOS, as well as meetings and presentations.  The system we implemented VKS allows you to simultaneously participate in negotiations or training up to 30 employees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/729/f41/c04/729f41c042a60a29f9ec2cd9405a2a33.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Video wall in meeting room with remote banks.</i>  <i>Here is the video conferencing codec, it gives a picture of those people who are sitting in the hall, and a picture from remote regions is displayed on these cubes.</i>  <i>That is, it is possible to conduct some kind of training seminars or just meetings through a remote session.</i>  <i>Special suspension microphones were used (on top) - also a specific solution, they remove the sound from the entire room in good quality.</i>  <i>There are only two of them: they are very sensitive and are designed exclusively for this class of tasks.</i> <br><br><h5>  Quantum self-service kiosk </h5><br>  It was made on an individual project (typical terminals Sberbank puts in the usual branches), of the important modifications - a special software for video conferencing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/416/4b5/8b0/4164b58b0c65b467bc1bb7d587f0ea0a.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Video banking machines that we have customized for individual orders and for individual requirements.</i>  <i>Initially, this device on the market was supplied as a separate box.</i>  <i>It was necessary to ‚Äútie‚Äù to him another special window for communication with a living specialist.</i>  <i>The photo shows how it now works.</i> <br><br><h5>  The system of centralized distribution and management of media content, plus an electronic queue </h5><br>  There are 13 LCD panels, Digital Signage software;  Familiar to many system of electronic queue Qmatic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c47/740/32e/c4774032ebc92be6c7703c1e19cf4363.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Photo of the screen of the electronic queue, which displays information, where not only you can see your coupon number, but also the office plan with the coordinates where to go.</i> <br><br><h5>  IPad-controlled video wall </h5><br>  9 LCD panels, Radar Touch (device providing interactivity), Apple TV (device for displaying video from Apple devices on LCD display devices, projectors, etc.).  This is for a recreation area.  You can show content from iOS devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebf/13a/406/ebf13a406a68b6430d4c2aa8e424659b.jpg" width="750"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc9/168/8b7/dc91688b7351e484304b9b94a422388b.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>LCD panels</i> <br><br><h5>  Touch tables </h5><br>  Interactive 40 inch tables Multitaction from Finland, content from ENGAGE.  Shows interactive content in the "waiting" area of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbc/f4b/199/dbcf4b199c8be7d28dd28c349c717418.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Engineers tune the table.</i>  <i>The fact is that they have specific use.</i>  <i>They work best when the lights are muted.</i>  <i>They are very sensitive to light, especially to the directional one, so I had to test them in the dark.</i>  <i>Use them, of course, in daylight.</i>  <i>The tests went in several stages: first, technical characteristics were checked - for example, response time, then functionality, then software was rolled onto the table and the display of everything under the OS on a particular device was tested: it works like IE 9 - it works, but it is better to check.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86d/195/8f6/86d1958f6273ee7125d40c3abff3d6a9.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>The tables themselves in the interior</i> <br><br><h5>  Wi-Fi </h5><br>  They organized a wireless data network, deployed many auxiliary systems, because of the large area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe office, they made a separate weak point. <br><br><h5>  Interactive coin box </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/41a/6a0/4f0/41a6a04f063ca1682789d28f41e4d28e.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  Vandal-proof case (custom-made), transparent screen, interactive frame (also custom-made).  This is a special stand with exhibits on display on an interactive transparent glass of a coin box.  For example, you can put inside an expensive collectible coin, and around it will be shown infographics about it. <br><br><h5>  Mobile robot and bank terminals with contactless payment function </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/14a/6fc/51a/14a6fc51aed8da01dcb5259b87f8fe08.jpg" width="750"><br><br>  This is the main entrance, view at the entrance to the office.  Here is an interactive coin box, this is a mobile robot, tellers, a manager's office, sofas for waiting.  A weird sticking thing is the pinout of cables at the place of the future interactive table. <br><br><h5>  The system of centralized distribution and management of media content, plus an electronic queue </h5><br>  This is a system for generating a consolidated ‚Äúclient card‚Äù with information about the banking products it uses and displaying it to the operator in an automatic mode.  Upon receipt of the electronic queue coupon, the client identifies himself with one of the available plastic cards.  Information is collected from various bank systems while the client is waiting in the queue. <br><br>  When calling a customer, the transaction officer immediately sees the customer's name, information about his cards, deposits, loans, and so on.  Then the bank employee greets, turning on the name of the patronymic, and then on the situation: congratulates with a recent birthday, reminds about the overdue loan, immediately issues a reissued card, offers targeted services.  Sometimes immediately, but more often - selectively.  On the operator's dashboard, ‚Äúinfographics‚Äù are visible according to predefined criteria (expired dates, ‚Äúalarming‚Äù card statuses, etc.).  The uniqueness of the solution is both the presentation of information from disparate accounting systems of the bank in a single form and without spending time during direct customer service, and the inter-regional coverage of information - by using a common corporate bus, it is possible to access the data of all territorial banks where the customer is served. <br><br><h5>  ATMs for people with disabilities </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b8/14d/f6a/3b814df6a06297b02d961e056b1a7a56.jpg" width="750"><br>  <i>Here are the Koreans for setting up their ATMs.</i>  <i>Just "Nautilus Hyosung" where we went.</i>  <i>At such terminals, work is provided, including for people with disabilities.</i>  <i>For example, people with poor eyesight or lack of it can work with them by touch and focusing on sound.</i> <br><br>  By the way, together with Nautilus Hyosung, SmartCard Service CJSC and Sberbank Technologies CJSC, scenarios for using Sberbank of Russia contactless payment cards on self-service devices were also developed and put into operation.  Customers can now make a contactless payment (NFC) at a self-service kiosk and withdraw money from an ATM.  Contactless payments are also accepted by a robot consultant - an innovative development by Nautilus Hyosung, which, in addition to receiving payments, can advise a client on Sberbank of Russia products and services. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  By the end of the project (and this is almost a year), part of what was ‚Äúspace‚Äù for us has become familiar.  We received a solid teamwork experience from a large number of large companies, each of which carried out its own unique solutions.  At the same time, features of integration with builders and designers of the office were identified and taken into account. <br><br>  Different things happened - right up to equipment failures during the final setup (fortunately, they managed to cost them a reserve).  As a result, we got an excellent experience of fast - damn fast - work on the project by dozens of suppliers and with close interaction with many people.  The customer received a modern office - in many respects designed for the image effect, but already now it is quite affordable both in price and in terms of the possibilities of serial supply throughout the country.  Plus, during the operation and running-in of equipment, the customer‚Äôs specialists have probably already imagined that from this it is necessary to take to the ‚Äúbank of the future‚Äù. <br><br>  For me personally, this project has become an example of how you can work simultaneously quickly and efficiently.  Hard deadlines sometimes kept us awake, but he also gave us all the sweet feeling of victory at the end of the project.  Yes, at the summit the office was shown successfully.  We were there to promptly resolve emergency situations when working with the implemented systems, in case they occur.  But everything went well, and the reviews were also excellent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197390/</a></p>
