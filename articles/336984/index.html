      The main blocks of the algorithm: <br><br><ol><li>  ‚ÄúData import‚Äù - we prepare data about the applicant (myself) in any form; </li><li>  ‚ÄúDetermination of target position and critical path‚Äù - we set the selection function; </li><li>  ‚ÄúCreation of a summary and search procedures, selection of positions‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚ÄúInitialization of the procedure of interaction with the employer‚Äù; </li><li>  "Re-formalization of the notion of the applicant about the function of choice and approximation to optimal, the repetition of the algorithm." </li></ol><br>  Fly! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  <b><i>Data import</i></b> <br><br>  1.1 <i>Importing the applicant's source data</i> <br>  You can store as anywhere, from text files in the file system to a relational database (for example, PostgreSQL, those who have little knowledge of the database will be ‚Äúplus‚Äù, at least during the interview they will be able to distinguish a relational database from a document-oriented or columnar one) : <br><br>  - ability skills and intelligence; <br>  - certificates of education (diplomas, certificates), <br>  - motivation system; <br>  - obligations and privileges; <br>  - restrictions on working hours; <br>  - plans; <br>  - moral values. <br><br>  1.2 <i>Import of job search sites and potential employers</i> <br>  It's all clear <br><br></li><li>  <b><i>Determining target position and critical path</i></b> <br><br>  Important: the obligatory stage when we formalize our ideas about the ideal vacancy. <br><br>  2.1 <i>Definition of target vacancies, selection function (constraints) and critical path</i> <br><br>  2.1.1 <i>Select the criterion for the classification of target positions</i> <br>  When selecting, you can use the methods of the theory of algorithms. <br><br>  2.1.2 <i>Create the parameters of the optimal position for each class - the more accurately, the more parameters you define, the easier it will be to search, it is better to create several target vacancies</i> <br><br>  Suppose a job seeker has a specialty local area network; all his free time is programming, he dreams of becoming a programmer for a virologist.  It is necessary to create classifications (for example, by the criterion of motivation) and selection functions (abstract model, where, as an objective function, the parameters of our position).  The first class is motivation - income (an example of a position is an expert in sales and service of industrial routers).  The second class is the career "+" income (for example, the target position is the duty administrator of the communication service provider).  The third class is the "+" career "+" income of a hobby (in our example, the applicant has a specialty local area network, dreams of becoming a programmer for a virologist, the target position is the main virologist). <br><br>  2.2 <i>Risk and probability assessment</i> <br>  Important: to assess the main risks of the future position, the probability of successful completion of the competition!  Most graduates ŒôŒ§ dream of becoming developers at Google or data architects at Oracle, and as a result, a long lineup for these positions.  Therefore, at first it will be easier to get an assistant administrator, or even sell software or hardware, and only then, working and learning all my free time, move on and look for options. <br><br>  2.3 <i>Definition and study of the necessary skills</i> <br>  Understand what remains to be explored, and what is just as important, what will have to be sacrificed for the sake of the most cherished vacancy;  how to take off from the minimum acceptable job to the most desirable. <br><br>  Example: our student with no experience, therefore, most likely, he will first get settled in network equipment sales, then, pulling up theoretical university knowledge, receiving certificates (for example, CCNA), get a job in the technical support service of a well-known search engine (should to work, the <i>main thing is to have a good mind</i> ), then he will need a lot of perseverance and luck, as well as study the assembler and many other things to become the main virologist in a well-known company (of course after himself).  Joked and enough, let's fly further. <br></li><li>  <b><i>Creating a resume submission and search procedures, selection of positions</i></b> <br><br>  3.1 <i>Creating a resume submission</i> <br><br>  3.1.1 <i>Creating a database of knowledge and skills of the applicant</i> <br>  This data will be used when creating a resume.  Often employers or special jobs require a unique approach! <br><br>  3.1.2 <i>Creating a resume for targeted vacancies</i> <br>  Already created many topics of various positions on how to write a resume.  Here is what you need to remember: <br><br>  - resume should be readable, here helps group skills; <br>  - selection is made strictly by keywords, it is necessary that they are present in the resume in a prominent place; <br>  - you need to be honest, specify only what you really know, use the created database of skills <br>  - in the accompanying one, first mark those skills you are willing to pay for in a particular vacancy. <br><br>  3.2 <i>Search and selection of jobs that meet the established criteria</i> <br>  It all depends on the specifics of the search mechanism, there are many articles on this subject, ranging from search techniques on job search sites to describing acquaintance with employers directly (official sites, phone calls, going to the office), job fairs. <br></li><li> <b><i>Initialization of the procedure of interaction with the employer</i></b> <br><br>  We found what we were looking for in any way, going through the steps above.  Suppose the most common option - in a search service for job search.  Next we need ... <br><br>  4.1 <i>Choice from ready and update, or creation;</i>  <i>sending resume with attached cover letter</i> <br><br>  4.2 <i>Passing the initial selection</i> <br><br>  4.2.1 <i>Tests before sending a resume</i> <br>  Important: by clicking on the ‚Äúrespond‚Äù button, you should be ready for the appearance of the test form with a countdown timer, there may not be a second chance, prepare a calculator in advance and everything else.  It‚Äôs better to answer the questions right away, don‚Äôt leave them later, sometimes employers are cunning: scrolling through difficult questions you risk failing the test, because you will not be able to return back, despite assurances of this before passing the test. <br><br>  4.2.2 <i>Solving the submitted task by email</i> <br>  It is important: a comprehensive approach to solving the problem and its design, as well as return sending (you can use several types of attachments, mail systems), while keeping within the time frame, send at least one day before timeout. <br><br>  4.2.3 <i>Passing a skype or telephone interview</i> <br>  Important: no matter how you are tortured at a remote interview or in the office - it is always better to keep silent about the amount of income at the previous place of work before the employer first announces the amount! <br><br>  4.3 <i>Passing the secondary selection</i> <br><br>  4.3.1 <i>Successful technical (first, sometimes several) interviews on the employer's territory</i> <br>  Much decides whether the applicant has the required level of preparation for a particular vacancy: actual ready-made solutions to current problems.  For example, a web developer needs to have his entire background at the interview, since the source code weighs almost nothing, wraps up the results and / or knows yourself. <br><br>  4.3.2 <i>Successful completion of subsequent contests, individual and group</i> <br>  It is important: even if you are a wunderkind, got into a group interview with a team case solution, it is often better to show teamwork skills;  for example, there are those employers for whom it is more important to take three middle peasants, which, perhaps, are infinitely worse than the expert, but interchangeable and predictable.  But, if you go back to the last example, it's usually the other way around: 1 best senor is unlikely to replace even 10 juny for obvious reasons. <br><br>  4.4 <i>Successful internship, official or unofficial (sometimes "it happens")</i> <br>  Important: to be able to quickly understand what you really need from you (I repeat, sometimes you need to work in a team so that you don‚Äôt need a phone, you are always there), and also understand what you can omit, otherwise it‚Äôs likely to fail ! <br>  Strictly stick to the plan set by the project manager / manager, especially because job descriptions become obsolete very quickly. <br><br>  4.5 <i>"Sometimes it happens" so that all stages are completed: the applicant gets a job ...</i> <br>  It would seem that the mission is complete!  But we are waiting for the most important stage of our program ... <br></li><li>  <b><i>Repeated formalization of the notion of the applicant about the function of choice and approximation to the optimal one, repeating the algorithm</i></b> <b><br></b> <br>  Remember the second stage of the algorithm, where we were engaged in the formalization of the function of choosing the position of each class? <br><br>  Now we have to redefine the subjective ideas about the ideal job (sometimes, in a new cherished workplace there are different situations that the applicant could hardly imagine before the ‚Äúvictory‚Äù ...), therefore the position selection function itself should be changed , its limitations, many target criteria. <br><br>  After all, often, the parameters of the ideal choice function depend on how many positions a particular applicant has encountered, special attention should be paid to thematic articles (the better, the article on how to become an enikeer is unlikely to seriously help), and note different approaches to assessing a specific type of position by two or more experts in this field. <br><br>  Important: the <i>difference in the choice of several experts is all the more important the more often they come across the considered sets of targeted vacancies</i> ! </li></ol><br>  PS The algorithm has a nested procedure for improving the selection function, so it is possible to use it many times! <br><br>  The bonus is for those who read it to the end, and it is still difficult to understand: what position are you talking about, and why is it needed, and what does it threaten: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6IQ_FOCE6I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336984/</a></p>
