  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About gifts and e-shops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Searching for gifts often puzzles me.  And not only because you do not know what to buy, but also how to buy if you are at work all the time, and most of the stores close at 6: 00-19: 00.  And those that do not close, then sell at a premium at a later closing time. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Since I am not a walker for shopping, the thought immediately works aside - but where can you buy all this?  After all, it turns out, it is necessary to run around the entire city ... We dismiss bazaars in general - there has long been nothing normal to buy.  Is that the book market ... but do not want to freeze ... <br><br>  <strong>Shops offline</strong> <br>  Crowd, turn. <br>  This store is not. <br>  In another too. <br>  I found it here, but not that - without wings and mother-of-pearl buttons. <br>  Hot. <br>  Run over.

      <strong>Online stores</strong> <br>  In silence, calmness you look around the goods, you compare.  And here I come across a few problems. <br><br>  1. The choice of goods.  Why can't a normal photo be placed on the site?  Why, with the increase, do I get the same squeezed tiny picture?  Why not make the photo be in front / profile / open / closed?  After all, otherwise you will have to go to the offline store again in order to properly view the product and touch it.  Well, if you can still find a description on other sites, or even this is not.  Especially pleased descriptions like "for this flash drive do not need cables!".  Wow  It seems they hold me for a fool. <br><br>  2. Long choose the goods.  You rejoice at the price, call to check whether there is a product and, finally, order.  After some time, they call back to report that they do not have 4 of 5 goods.  And there are only those that I ordered only for the load - so that the delivery was free.  :) I refuse the order.  Going to another site.  And the same trouble.  I can not understand why before the holidays they did not take care of the assortment and why the product was five minutes ago when I made a phone call and now it is gone. <br><br>  3. Shipping.  Some online stores can deliver goods for weeks, and not dropping it.  But, we must pay tribute to them, usually brought on the second day.  I do not trust mail delivery.  It is better by courier. <br><br>  4. Payment.  For me, it will be safer, perhaps cash, because  You can pay with a card, and even with a debit card, but then a big trouble with the bank is to torture them, where did my money go, if there was no product, the money could still go, or they could go wrong.  Well, and so on. <br><br>  In general, online shopping is a good thing, but probably not just before the holidays.  It is better to buy goods in them one month before the onset of the holidays by feeling the goods in the offline store in advance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18076/</a></p>
