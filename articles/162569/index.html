The following artifacts (deliverables) were created: <a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/personas-ux.php">Persona</a> , <a href="http://www.dubberly.com/concept-maps">Concept Map</a> , <a href="http://www.joycehostyn.com/blog/2010/03/22/visualizing-the-customer-experience-using-customer-experience-journey-maps/">Customer Journey Map</a> , Card Sorting was used at almost every stage.

      I will very briefly talk about each stage, I suggest in the comments asking clarifying questions - if the topic goes, then I will focus on each with details. <br><br><h3>  1. Persona. </h3><br>  We began to analyze the public with which business meetings are coming, sorting and systematizing future interlocutors, paying attention to the following things: age, gender, education (they noted technical details), self-presentation elements (quotes, statements in interviews / blogs, assessments of what is happening in the world of startups ), branches of the economy, recent investments (volumes by branches), speech patterns, communication channels (from the question - how many handshakes between us - to which e-mail client on which device uses, that is, how many first  the message string will be visible at the first contact), etc. <br><br>  The main thing is to single out the clusters, the initial 4 (built on the form of the proposed investment) were as follows: <br>  1) those who invest material values; <br>  2) those who invest non-material values ‚Äã‚Äã(disseminate information); <br>  3) those who, having become interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa startup, will actualize, in communication with their colleagues, issues close to that with which our ecosystem comes in contact (itching will spread); <br>  4) all others <br><br>  In the future, the clustering criteria will change.  The value of each criterion is allocated clusters, for each of which you should create your own special version of the pitch / presentation / prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c5d/24b/49b/c5d24b49b2301beb0edf1f583e93af69.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  2. Concept Map. </h3><br>  Having a spontaneous pitch in our hands, we began to make a system pitch from it, removing redundancy and identifying where there are gaps and incomplete knowledge.  All phenomena were combed using <a href="http://www.danroam.com/assets/pdf/tools/TBOTN_codex.pdf">Dan Roeme‚Äôs visual code</a> .  The spontaneous description was split up and placed on the shelves: Who / What, How, Where, When, How, Why.  Then everything that appeared on the Who / What shelf (objects) was reduced to the mind map.  With the help of card sorting (card = vertex in the mind map) we managed to achieve optimization - the objects were arranged in a hierarchy: the most generalized (consumers, technological environment, market, contractors, finance, ...) came out of the central mind map, then in the second and in the subsequent circles from the central theme, they were overgrown with more and more refined, until they reached the ‚Äúleaves‚Äù like controller X, financial document of form N, etc. <br>  Already at this stage, it is possible to form pitch pitches that are different in degree of detail (coverage of circles from the central theme) - calculated for different presentation times.  The vertices of the mind map Who / What is overgrown with details from the other shelves (How many, Where, ...). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70c/8d4/d2e/70c8d4d2ef4e6368001f756a2a356803.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Having a mind map, we can construct a diagram of how its individual vertices interact with each other: we build a table with 8 columns: P, action (control), Q, how much, where, when, how, why and start filling it in to the following rule: we take all possible pairs of objects (P, Q) from one circle of mind map and find out what main action unites them (for example: P = end user, Q = technological environment, action = interacts, we get a line - the end user interacts with technological Wednesday), in the remaining columns we add details  and interaction (how much, where, when, how, why).  Thus, we will collect all possible connections of objects from the same circle among themselves.  Then we visualize all these connections.  For example, the fact that, on average, the end user will interact with the technological infrastructure at least twice a day looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9bc/512/a08/9bc512a088784f8a82056d43f42e7d86.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  3. Customer Journey Map. </h3><br>  The venture capitalist is regarded as the buyer of the idea, we present his acquaintance with the idea as a walk, and we will collect the episodes of this walk in the so-called.  Customer Journey Map.  To do this, we will determine what will force him to go for a walk along our route (general interest, recommendation from an authoritative source, triggers in the description of the idea) - 3-4 factors that will put it at the starting point of our route.  At the same time, we will take into account the context from which it comes before the walk and into what context it comes out of it.  Each episode we will formulate, noting the following points: <br>  1) scene <br>  2) act / action <br>  3) what is being used / with which is the interaction, <br>  4) thoughts (what the venture capitalist supposedly thinks about), <br>  5) emotional response, the choice of three options - :): |  :(, <br>  6) opportunities / points of growth, <br>  7) the reasons for the failure (of this episode) / thin places where it is torn, <br>  8) communication channels <br>  9) (missing) artifacts <br><br>  We use the concept map to describe the content of the episodes (scenes), filling in the Customer Journey Map columns.  In the future, communicating with venture capitalists, we will use this tool that describes the walk episodes (acquaintance with parts of the ecosystem), and to collect feedback - which episodes turned out to be impassable, which caused a negative emotional response, which have grain for entering new episodes what additional artifacts to reveal the essence you need to create. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ce/1f2/e6b/9ce1f2e6b78c2899a915fa87912742b3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The format of the documents in the illustrations and links to examples of artifacts should answer some questions that have arisen, I am ready to answer all the others in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162569/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162569/</a></p>
