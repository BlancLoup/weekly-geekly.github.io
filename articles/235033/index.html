Therefore, in the spring a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/226339/">new transport</a> was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/226339/">assembled</a> and closer to the middle of summer a test drive was arranged to Ryazan and back.

Again ... yes, the wiring, but a little not the way you thought.  How was the case: in the evening, all over the village suddenly turned off the light.  We even joked that we first cut down one house, now a village, and not far from the city.  The owner reassured and said that this is a frequent occurrence.  And without any hindrance, the generator started up.  Which ... fanfare ... is plugged into an ordinary outlet through ... once again, fanfare ... 0.75 squares.  The generator of course started, and even worked.  Minutes 5. Then there was a clap, and everyone understood what had happened.  In general, the generator carrier was also pumped, and the bikes were turned away from sin, otherwise he was poor and barely worked, if he had connected the water pump from the well, he would have stopped altogether.  But after half an hour the light was given and the process went the normal way. <br><br>  On the way to Perm there were two significant events, not including which in the general report - just blasphemy.

So I got a ‚Äúload of 200‚Äù, which I drove right down to Ufa (where I finally got to the post office and sent it to myself in the MSC).  I had to recharge after Alexey, and with a delay of 3 hours, already at night, I drove into the city alone.  Considering that in the morning on the shortcut from the place of overnight stay (a primer with pits on a half-wheel and a comb from tractors) I still had one of the two headlights fell off, it was not very pleasant.  The next day, my headlamp was restored, they came up with what to do with charging - we had one at once on 3 kW, i.e.  it was possible to solder ‚ÄúSharePoint‚Äù and to smoke two bikes and a half from it at once.

Firstly, in Ekb itself, as it turned out, the display keyboards all failed - in the rain they stratified at speed, water got on the contacts and hello, neither unlock the e-bike, nor the profile switch.  And secondly, according to the good old tradition, Kolya, who had flown forward, got into the very center of the thunderstorm and got up to work there.  As he later told, in the house of builders, where he asked for an outlet, he went four times.  People poured out of it like ants, shouting "light is flying there."  Naturally, the whole electrician got burned, it is unclear just how miraculously the e-bike charge survived and in general he led.  The controller took off the stabilizer to 5v and it could only go in a sensorless mode, because there was no power supply to the halls.  All this was eliminated in Yekaterinburg, the location in which is also worthy of special mention is the radio engineering college, in agreement with the director: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td width="400"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VdHx932FXOw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhje85EuqoJKJgMK1eXZov2_9fC9Yg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Andrey was optimistic that the road to Chelyabinsk would be more pleasant, ha!

While we were having lunch at the cafe, a very brave girl was found, who risked going up to the crowd of guys and asking who the bike was there, standing a little apart.  The girl turned out to be a motorcyclist with experience, the bike turned out to be mine, and having conducted an educational program for what, transferred control to her.  First with bags, then bags removed and sent to ride away.  She returned on foot and with a slightly curtailed rudder - some impurity bombed undercut her when leaving the yard.

There was a Fox Float, became Fox Vanila =) And so we went.  The road to Ufa was remembered by serpentines with gorgeous views and the moment when I had to pedal a dozen kilometers, because  I still had a charge with Andrei and I thought they were still ahead.  Or rather, I pushed up the hill, flew 50 off the slide, was sick 15 in a straight line.

Of course, we lost a little time on this, but we had a cultural program - a center, pictures, a movie.  I will not bring such a trivial matter anymore, it‚Äôs enough that I threw it out on the Lower River.  We reached Volsk (Andrei's homeland) without problems, not counting the fact that the second half of the way was in the rain, and the last 100km was after midnight, and I was cut down not in a detski manner.  5 times he came around on the side of the road, he caught consciousness a couple of times on an opposite, and once head-on with a counter gazelle - after which the whole dream disappeared like a hand.  In Volsk, we disconnected - after experiencing Volsk, I and Alexey thought that we should go overnight to Tambov, Kolya and Andrey decided to rush all 600 in one fell swoop.  Therefore, we left a day earlier, and on the same night, Andrei and Kolya lost another controller - the same bug with nightly charging (nobody knew the reason for my bach then, it was assumed that we were tired of fets), so we had day odds.  They repaired the controller, but lost a day on it.  In general, from Volsk to Tambov through Penza the road passed without the procession, <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/6828/43441103.23/0_a7407_1cadb757_orig"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2b/f29/bd5/f2bf29bd53793b189d63450f58ec1d06.jpg"></a> </div><br><br>  but after Tambov, when Aleksey had already driven off 100km in the direction of Moscow, his front hub bearings collapsed.  And we heard them in Tambov, twisted on weight, understood that the backlash, but decided that it was just a little bit (500 km) to the house, because there was no place to look for an imported bearing on Saturday.  And on Monday, he had to go to work.  I did not know yet whether I would go directly or still wait for Andrei and Kohl and would rush with them to Gubkin, so I stayed.  In general, a rescue mission was forcedly carried out at 5 am Sunday, and I finally decided on the route: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td width="400"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nh939bC2KO8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7nCit5kGLSNaggq-jA5fq2TaxRQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  So we continued on and rode with Lehoy, until the gayts ‚Äúneighing‚Äù stopped us: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td width="400"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W33XPXwmrpw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhji1dWlYyFe_NaR5c2JFG5QjyMt2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  This was not the first time, but the first, when a camera hung on me.
