The system tells the car owner how good he is at the wheel and at what points it is worth working on the usual driving style. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/862/a7e/5af/862a7e5af0de4cb393ca62361b3c4047.jpg">

      It helps to save on gasoline and nerves.  In addition to driving, the application monitors the condition of the car.  Thus, the express diagnostics function determines the nature of the current motor malfunctions, and monitoring monitors temperatures and ‚Äúelectrics‚Äù while driving. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  How it works </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51c/7c2/40d/51c7c240d1d2451889b91a628281d5b2.jpg"><br><br>  The heart of eConomy is a matchbox-sized gadget.  Connecting the device takes only a minute: you need to find the diagnostic connector that is used to diagnose the car in the service station, connect the adapter to it, install the application on the smartphone.  The application works on modern Android devices, and the gadget is compatible with any machines released in the USA after 1996, Europe 2001, Russia and Asia after 2005. <br><br>  Using the device, the mobile application is connected to the on-board computer of the car every time the driver is driving.  So according to Bluetooth technical information: speed, engine speed, temperature, pressure, etc. enters the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dc/c27/e73/2dcc27e73ebd45b7948e7e759dd531e5.png"><br><br>  Unlike similar Chinese devices, eConomy has a sleep mode, so it can be left in the car for a long time (the ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù discharge the battery in 4-5 days), and has a secure Bluetooth connection ‚Äî it is impossible to connect to it from a nearby car. <br><br><h2>  15 thousand savings </h2><br>  What can the application and web services?  Let's start with the economy.  We took the Hyundai Solaris and made two identical trips along the same route for about 50 kilometers.  In one case, the driver was driving aggressively, in the second - slowly in the right lane.  The screenshots show that the route is the same, but in one case the consumption of gasoline was 3.9 liters, in the second - 2.8 liters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f50/6c6/a32/f506c6a32e984d6893987a5374a061ed.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/9cb/94d/67f9cb94dd3245b182b25876700f20a8.jpg"><br><br>  If you count on the usual fuel consumption per 100 kilometers, then it is 6 l / 100 and 8 l / 100.  It would seem that only 2 liters or about 70 rubles per 100 km.  But on average, motorists travel 20.000-25.000 kilometers per year.  Thus, without straining, you can burn 400 to 500 liters less for a year, that is, to keep 14-17 thousand rubles in your pocket.  Obviously, this is not the biggest money, but the plus is that economical driving is also safer for the driver and passengers. <br><br><h2>  Statistics </h2><br>  Now about the sad.  More than a million people die on the roads every year, and no one wants to be in their place.  When drivers are at the wheel, eConomy monitors the sharpness of starts, braking, average and maximum speeds and sets a traffic safety rating from 0 to 100. This gives everyone the opportunity to statistically assess their chances of getting into an accident.  Of course, the creators of eConomy cannot promise that a drunk summer resident or a sleepy student will not drive into a person who has reached one hundred points and has become an ideal driver, but you can‚Äôt argue with the statistics - the likelihood of an accident during such driving decreases several times. <br><br>  It is clear that one can be skeptical of those who promise security on the basis of a strange points system.  However, the world practice of insurance companies, which have a vital interest in ensuring that their clients get into accidents as rarely as possible, suggests otherwise.  Such companies use similar driving safety rating systems as a basis and calculate the cost of insurance based on its data.  Unfortunately, local mistrust between insurance companies and drivers hinders the mass character of such projects in Russia, which is why eConomy passes the concern for its safety into the hands of the drivers themselves. <br><br><h2>  Future </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eeb/174/716/eeb1747160c7491b9dc4125a5eb2d217.png"><br><br>  According to the team, eConomy is a starting product on the way of creating an open Connected Car platform that will provide third-party developers with access to automotive data and will be able to offer their services to a wide audience of solvent motorists. <br><br>  In the meantime, I would like for one day the drivers to stop tearing at all pairs, to trim others, to drive around the city at extreme speeds and to rebuild from the left lane through three lanes to the far right.  It would be more comfortable for everyone to move behind the wheel and breathe easier in megacities. <br><br><h2>  Bonuses </h2><br>  The device can be purchased on the <a href="http://ezway.pro/economy/">official website</a> .  MDRBTS promo code is 6% discount.  If you hurry, you can have time to make a good New Year's gift. <br><br>  UPD. <br>  Responses to comments carried in the text. <br>  ‚Äú5990 rubles?  For a sticker on a regular OBD adapter? ‚Äù <br>  Technically, the gadget differs from cheap Chinese devices as follows: <br>  * Inside the gadget is the Stn1110 chip.  The 10-dollar Chinese devices are not even elm327, but its fake.  This chip surpasses the original elm327 in all respects: faster, has more memory, supports additional commands.  For those doubting here <a href="http://www.obdsol.com/downloads/stn1110_vs_elm327.pdf">www.obdsol.com/downloads/stn1110_vs_elm327.pdf</a> is a comparison <br>  * The gadget mates with a smartphone only after pressing a button.  No universal PIN codes and the same mac-addresses.  The possibility of third-party connection is excluded. <br>  * The gadget is able to fall asleep.  The discharge of the battery is also excluded. <br>  * Bluetooth connection is stable.  Moreover, unlike the Chinese, this device can work in parallel, for example, with a bluetooth headset and even during those moments when you receive calls.  Chinese devices will lose data during calls. <br>  * high-quality assembly, there is practically no marriage. <br><br>  That is, all the problems of Chinese elm327 are solved in it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364479/</a></p>
