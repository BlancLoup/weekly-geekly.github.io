  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ways to ‚Äúlure‚Äù users to the resource.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The problem of "promotion" makes the heads of project owners hurting for more than a dozen years.  However, recently the concept of ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù has begun to approach the concept of ‚Äúcheating‚Äù; almost any new project is dragged from the search by the majority of visitors.  In fact, this is not so bad, especially if an interesting product is presented.  But how to keep users and make them "work"?  Let's look at several ways, if something goes wrong - write comments, fix it. <br><br><h1>  1. Money. </h1><br>  The first option is putting money, lure money.  This is probably the most logical but least common option.  First, not every ‚Äúgreen‚Äù project will be able to pay good money, because we need a good buffer.  Often, project owners are free developers who have no extra 2-3 thousand green per month for their green project.  Secondly, I personally have not yet seen a single normal compensation program, or rather its implementation for the network.  The ideal is to install AdSense from Google.  Ideally, the user puts his AdSense code in his content (blog, news) and gets 100%, leaves the AdSense project and gets 50% (tell me, would you write more if you had a penny for each viewing of your news? ) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  2. Prizes, bonuses. </h1><br>  A great example is VKontakte.  It began as a St. Petersburg project for students, began in competition with fakultet.ru.  However, contact is the first thing that students really want to get an iPod for personal use.  Played 30 shaflov - received an increase in attendance at times, and most importantly - social.  effect, viral promotion.  Look now at almost any ‚Äúgreen‚Äù commercial service =) they all play iPods and iPhones, but I haven‚Äôt seen this effect yet.  I will say more, the contact came out only thanks to iPods, i.e.  due to the fact that the first scored the "critical" mass of users needed for social.  effect.

    <h1>  3. Promotion of users. </h1><br>  What does habr and nnm.ru.  Wrote good news - you read thousands.  However, we understand that in order to promote a user you should already have a certain attendance.  And if I know how nnm.ru developed, I, unfortunately, missed the history of building a habr.  <i>Guys, tell me how you scored a critical mass of users, interesting!</i>  . <br><br><h1>  4. "Measurement pussy." </h1><br>  My favorite =) People have always been measured pussy and will always be measured by them.  Yesterday at work they argued that a better, modern supercar, or audi s6 humpback nineties on the legendary 2.2 turbo with good tuning.  They came to the conclusion that it is better to lengthen your penis and ride a constipation without steaming.  Who played CS 1.6?  Remember the web game statistics?  Where was it possible to have a look with which weapon you run more often, how accurately do you throw grains, etc.?  Here, in addition to the stats there were always tops, remember?  I always had first place for spam, I was the most talkative.  And I was proud of it =) my nickname was full in TOP, because of this I went to the server every day stupidly to flood.  In the web, unfortunately, I have not seen such "good" systems tops users, but it would be nice. <br>  A week ago, on one of his projects on the main menu, he hung the top users (regarding the ‚Äúquality‚Äù of the added material), here's a schedule for visiting the /add.html page - adding content: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/338/91e/8bf/33891e8bf8e5ff9edb56be357eb98922.gif" width="450" height="294" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  He speaks for himself, if you do not pay attention to holidays and weekends, you can see how page traffic has increased 3 times over this week. <br><br><h1>  5. Quality content.  (from <a href="http://sshz.habr.ru/">sshz</a> ) <br></h1><br>  A quality copywriter on the project was always in the price, in our time - in a double.  Now, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù projects prefer to parse other resources than create their own content, because it is expensive and sometimes difficult.  For example, it is difficult to bypass anekdot.ru by inventing new jokes. <br>  But on the other hand, new, high-quality, unique content can attract to the resource not a small attendance.  As, for example, it was with nnm.ru, when apart from him at first, no one described the software. <br><br>  If you forgot something, add it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22323/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22323/</a></p>
