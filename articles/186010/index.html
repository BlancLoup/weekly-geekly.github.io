We returned here three weeks ago from the jubilee exhibition Infocomm in Florida and slightly took pictures of all sorts of interesting pieces from there.  Infocomm is one of the few world exhibitions that you definitely need to visit if you want to stay up to date with all the new products.  For the most part, everything is connected with different screens and display facilities in general. <br><br>  <b>The exhibition is held in two stages</b> - 2 days for partners, 3 days for the press and all people from the street.  The first two days, different closed decisions are shown, individual presentations are made.  For example, two years ago in Amsterdam, Mitsubishi invited us to show off their innovative geometry screens, which then, unfortunately, did not go into mass production.  They, like, even the press did not see.

      Something like that.  If you are interested in professional equipment, go to the topic, show you how it was.  <b>Only neatly, there are a lot of pictures inside.</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  First, a little about the exhibition </h4><br>  Exhibitions are generally made because some things simply can not be seen on the sites.  For example, in the oil segment, visualization technologies are very important - if we are talking about some kind of 3D-room for visualizing mining operations, this is a must-see.  And go those who then directly works with her and serves her.  If it fails at the exhibition, then it is necessary to separately plan for the customer to leave for production, for example, in China. <br><br>  <b>There are four more things that make you drive:</b> <br><ul><li>  At exhibitions often show new items.  To this we were waiting for a laser TV, which was not supplied outside the States. </li><li>  There is also being trained.  You can very deeply understand the topic, and the knowledge will be given by the engineer who collected all this.  We try not to miss such opportunities. </li><li>  It is often interesting to bring customers and engineers to the exhibitions, who will be with us in the introduction of new pieces next year.  There is an opportunity to compare everything on the spot and touch it with your hands. </li><li>  And, of course, you can manage to agree on cooperation with everyone personally, which is often much simpler and faster than through the network. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Photo report </h4><br>  Registration for the exhibition: there are queues, but they pass quite quickly.  In general, with the organization they have everything in order, the jambs, even if they happen, close very quickly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/416/b34/fb6/416b34fb6299231429cecb66347fc89f.jpg"><br><br>  Our team at the entrance, look at the site map - choose the route.  The exhibitions are large, so you need to go immediately by four or five specialists in different profiles.  There must be an engineer, necessarily someone who works with low-level software, plus specialists in various fields.  For example, I understand LED technology far from my colleague. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c48/2cb/b1e/c482cbb1e0a906f25bb390da822f4d30.jpg"><br><br>  This is how this exhibition looks from the entrance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b3/d5c/cc7/7b3d5ccc710715dd428ab75a546edc97.jpg"><br><br>  Below is an interactive digital signage.  Hands rotates, increases, decreases.  Like a big ipad.  Gray camera on top captures the target audience.  For example, when a girl comes up, the screen starts showing perfume when the boy is a car.  Very interesting thing, because it works quite smoothly and clearly.  We played with her for quite some time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f21/0e2/33d/f210e233d5c5efbc4da6d02753c4bf6d.jpg"><br><br>  This is the future jukebox.  I saw him here for the first time in my life, although I know what I have already shown at other exhibitions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/588/fc1/742/588fc1742514b22c38ae0b6a4fc06540.jpg"><br><br>  Seamless LCD screen.  That is, the seams are, but very small.  Some customers are very concerned about these seams, they even have to sometimes stick in the main color of the content.  With this screen, such a "crutch" will not be needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/942/6f3/2a5/9426f32a57ba7031e123aff28272ca54.jpg"><br><br>  Hyundai anti-vandal external displays.  By the way, the easiest way to break the anti-vandal display is to hit it with a sharpened shovel.  There were no shovels here, so they beat them with their hands.  Not broken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/249/b42/b01/249b42b0168cd848c0e39ac49b6080d8.jpg"><br><br>  This is an all-weather high-brightness screen.  It seems to withstand radioactive rain, but in practice has not yet been tested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/784/ccf/161/784ccf161a4e1cc284c39c5567f0cd51.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a version of the kiosk navigation for the bus stop.  Touch, also like a large tablet, open on the cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fe8/3db/b63/fe83dbb63712bc2a4d8226c428d134ef.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a window dressing for retail networks with digital signage elements (Aopen, known for making content players that play all content on screen films).  You can see the cubes in which the film.  You can go back and change something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/82c/938/836/82c938836c8a4e27b2c07adee89118bc.jpg"><br><br>  Another option for window dressing.  The control blocks are very small, similar in size to a large mouse.  These are not good old "coffins" that usually stand below and occupy a lot of space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bdf/fd5/40e/bdffd540e2a8dc9df6c951bafdc8a96b.jpg"><br><br>  LED screens of different shapes and different steps.  The new generation, of course, appears due to the fact that the pixel pitch is reduced.  Due to the fact that the manufacturer is China in 90% of cases, the quality is very different, and depends on the manufacturer.  And the technology is very different - someone invests, and some not.  In China, every year new screens come out with smaller and smaller steps, to the point that we saw a small 42-inch TV not with an LCD matrix, as we used to watch at home, but with LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78a/9fb/ead/78a9fbead83a9e190b2ac4b7db92c68d.jpg"><br><br>  The stand of our partner Multitouch.  And already familiar to us multitouch video wall.  But engineers are very interested, it seems, there was something new in terms of solutions for installation.  The key point here is the controllers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a30/369/3e5/a303693e56723587e01d0666c561e087.jpg"><br><br>  Another variation on the theme of the interactive table.  There are a lot of similar solutions on the Russian market (the same Multitouch does it). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/231/83c/f41/23183cf4185feadc842c798820d578b7.jpg"><br><br>  LED screens section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/831/a9f/35a/831a9f35abff56cf6161cf514ef5535f.jpg"><br><br>  Our partners Absen.  Stand with LED screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b32/2ed/22a/b322ed22a06c9986506d32e64fc12f4c.jpg"><br><br>  Option design stage design LED screens <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29d/69e/19f/29d69e19fcdb240837335081ac621a46.jpg"><br><br>  And the light ...: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88a/802/4db/88a8024db97275ff6f15a49370f01543.jpg"><br><br>  Our partner LightKing and their LED screens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/152/bd7/567/152bd75675aa77faeb96456a09789cf2.jpg"><br><br>  But this is already quite interesting - 3D-projection on 3D-objects (Coolux).  An interesting topic for all exhibitions and events.  Looks awesome cool. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/07a/416/b68/07a416b68809b281b2aed0e7898fa471.jpg"><br><br>  This is generally a fantasy - a projection on a jellyfish: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61b/5ef/366/61b5ef366be8df6e1b5237fc355d5ec1.jpg"><br><br>  Prysm we know already three years.  The display system is assembled from small cubes of different formats.  You can collect all sorts of letters, badges and anything.  Suture - 1 mm.  This is a laser-phosphorus rear projection: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4be/2fb/c1e/4be2fbc1e2525cea5f927d6428bc4635.jpg"><br><br>  Here is how one laser-phosphorus cube looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa2/8c7/6e9/fa28c76e9e252b9f322c44a179ab15ab.jpg"><br><br>  On-screen installation.  But these are ordinary LCD screens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/258/78f/96a/25878f96a6100e5bb2090b92c26f2f8b.jpg"><br><br>  Transparent displays from Samsung, are also used for window dressing - this is a film that can be switched in various modes.  Also not new, but it was interesting to touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f56/be8/0aa/f56be80aa660ccbf8fd8fe22fa27b312.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/581/610/aac/581610aac487d31b8ee8653ebfbac9f1.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung booth design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f0/0b6/35e/2f00b635ea70592d2faa8454dd99952f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f6/ef4/3e0/6f6ef43e05bebc465c1294053a1f3fb8.jpg"><br><br>  Their booth was one of the largest at the exhibition.  A great deal of attention at the exhibition was paid specifically to digital signage and various options for window dressing and advertising.  There it works with them with might and main, we are not so active yet, but we are working on it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c2/feb/b2c/4c2febb2ce6464746ce801ff2804c2c6.jpg"><br><br>  Martin is an expensive manufacturer of LED screens and stage designs.  In the center - the LED screen: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/86e/c54/51b/86ec5451b87b490c9777aaf154510438.jpg"><br><br>  Also LEDs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/030/937/318/0309373188a0d58ad60b232969f68ffd.jpg"><br><br>  Large LEDs.  They can be hung on the facade of the building: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88f/813/932/88f813932d32b6fb505a3b856dfe0afc.jpg"><br><br>  And again, 3D mapping on all sorts of items: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/77a/2e6/db5/77a2e6db5e7fc6c146188fdbbcc5e02a.jpg"><br><br>  Here, for example, on a typewriter that drives fast.  A very interesting thing, my colleague was busy with it for a long time, who wanted to understand the mathematics of all this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f9/dcc/a63/6f9dcca638ef15dab7e3c025465477eb.jpg"><br><br>  Stero-3D - without glasses: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c80/222/db2/c80222db23dd8caed7d57f047480969e.jpg"><br><br>  Warping projection technology: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf5/0dc/07e/cf50dc07e503b9a9177c67a330880d93.jpg"><br><br>  Stage light: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/680/43c/916/68043c916a74f7c0bac9ee0312558566.jpg"><br><br>  The next option for the design of the showcase from Samsung: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/978/4b1/2f2/9784b12f2febcc94211d36d662faeb35.jpg"><br><br>  Specialized control system of any control room.  In principle, this is not new, but interesting all the same.  The main thing in the new stand - the convenience of the operator.  One cable can control four PCs.  But, in general, here we must look more at the technical details, and not at the appearance.  They just really pleased me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f2/381/da9/8f2381da9912a0c7f59ac33a35db35df.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a26/cf9/d37/a26cf9d37cd9fb127e13091cccdab50f.jpg"><br><br>  Projection on items from our partner Christie: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/beb/8ae/4e3/beb8ae4e336e104a57adf4d22eb9ba92.jpg"><br><br>  Click on the red color and the machine became red: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2d/336/428/e2d336428a61dbb946768de93f46485d.jpg"><br><br>  Our old partner Crestron.  All sorts of things to manage smart home systems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28e/5a0/190/28e5a0190dd666449b72038799de8d7f.jpg"><br><br>  And this is the first in the world 60 Hz 4K projector - very clearly, very bright, very joyful.  Now 4K TVs are in fashion and they made a 4K projector.  This is also a Christie: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fce/452/c79/fce452c790a0921248685ddbe916c197.jpg"><br><br>  Actually projected image <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92c/d70/6c7/92cd706c7205b91d02a744ac335d6994.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f6/27c/23c/9f627c23cee56a8074156b31d2d75390.jpg"><br><br>  3D visualization for the oil industry, gas industry, space.  You can see what is happening and how - in detail.  I went for the sake of these things, because in Russia there are very few such installations: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dd0/2a4/478/dd02a4478edeb99c41e6f76e2ba5efca.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d6/b51/81e/7d6b5181e9147ff06f06729816806a70.jpg"><br><br>  Very high-quality projection screen canvas - the picture is very beautiful: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b5/e70/f99/0b5e70f993323f33068cfc2fb93a501c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5f/da1/2a9/b5fda12a9896ec9bf3f618ed17d5819f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3d/122/0a8/d3d1220a88b341924fcf6e900195ef95.jpg"><br><br>  It is a record of everything, video, audio.  The guys do this thing in different formats - you can insert it into a rack, you can carry it with you - conveniently (in the picture is a videoconference): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/082/f95/239/082f95239e491ebde1e8ff71069a95f5.jpg"><br><br>  Terminals on wheels for smart home.  Probably, they can go after the owner and moan with the voice of his wife ‚Äúthrow out the tree, well throw out the tree‚Äù: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca7/51e/d04/ca751ed040c46aff9c83050e8abb957e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7f9/4e2/ba3/7f94e2ba370ce44016900a291d65929b.jpg"><br><br>  And this is a very cool new Bosch congress system console.  It has just been announced, it will be in the fall.  Very interesting thing on Android.  In addition to the conversation, that is, directly the direct appointment of congress systems, you can program anything on it.  You can implement any functionality for the customer, for example, in one click to roll up the profile for the conference with the meeting protocol already selected.  This is a strong enough breakthrough in consoles consoles.  Previously, there were already remotes with a touchscreen, but they were without an OS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/626/87d/f49/62687df49d44c54f5adf405c99d51cf2.jpg"><br><br>  Another entry: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef1/b96/f81/ef1b96f817bc359a68a0ff829f2cf187.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c4/bc8/582/0c4bc8582da17c958b2db3a46c93af90.jpg"><br><br>  The sound didn‚Äôt show anything specific this time, these are just different microphones - on a goose neck, inset and so on.  Although audiophiles probably found something in the details: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d5/4b9/caf/0d54b9caf2589b465ba71946b17f6c44.jpg"><br><br>  Superspherical speakers.  Required for specific rooms with specific acoustics.  Also not new: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/656/5ed/3e9/6565ed3e9f2a3a869c45075ea315bab2.jpg"><br><br>  Linear arrays for the scene.  For a big event to play loud and fun.  We used the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/croc/blog/171147/">temple-</a> like ones like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8d8/414/d66/8d8414d66614f8be93af175b0d913701.jpg"><br><br>  Technology transfer full-HD video over Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4e/f29/da2/d4ef29da2a36dac2b262d425313c2523.jpg"><br><br>  Also 3d mapping: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f73/d62/d0d/f73d62d0db84ae261417fe0ff34aec0d.jpg"><br><br>  Panels for booking a conversation.  In our office we see the same ones from AMX too. <br>  In order not to put such a panel on every corner, they offered another new thing - a QR code by which you can understand how a conference room was booked and to book it from the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fa/e1b/857/9fae1b857c4eaa10f3e0993f760572c8.jpg"><br><br>  This is also a projection.  Inside the stand is a projector and it shines from the inside onto the ball.  And the result is such a picture.  At the same time, it is also a multitouch, you can hold your hand on it and if you put the same but big sphere next to it, then you can rotate something on the ball and change it on the sphere - change the content.  Good lure for events. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfe/9f6/21a/dfe9f621a300fbf77c607dbe03f541a9.jpg"><br><br>  Video wall from video cubes from Mitsubishi: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d71/0ea/e21/d710eae216b5294a8d30b92749b65a9e.jpg"><br><br>  Here is a top view of the exhibition: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e8/5fb/870/2e85fb87086e6f76a1eb6456d9978779.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  So, we expected to see something interesting for the American market, but there were few strong technological breakthroughs.  In principle, we have already seen a lot - for example, new prisms of Christie Microtiles for command centers could be seen at past exhibitions.  We did not see anything specific that would be closed, and would be sold only for the American market. <br><br>  Specifically, InfoComs are approximately equally distributed throughout the world.  The list of participants varies depending on the region.  This time there was a lot of China.  But it was ‚Äúspecial‚Äù China, already popular and already 10 years working in the market of America and much earlier than ours. <br><br>  In general, technological breakthroughs, as usual, remain with the market leaders: this is always Samsung, Christie, this year ProjectionDesign, which Barco bought, has very interesting things.  All these players have large R &amp; D teams, so they are expected to do something cool and new or modify already known products.  InfoCom has also become heavily sharpened for professional equipment.  Now, you may have to go to something like the Consumer Electronics Show, where they show all sorts of everyday things.  Perhaps there will be some unique devices for the highly specialized markets of America. <br><br>  <b>From wow-pieces - a lot of things for retail</b> .  Plus a huge stand of Samsung - according to the latest exhibitions, it seems that the Koreans are coming.  From home - beer, in contrast to the last Amsterdam exhibition is not poured, yet America.  But there were a lot of Coca-Cola and burgers.  Yes, after the exhibition we went for a walk around the city.  They looked at Universal, in an amusement park.  There is a very interesting room with 3D (without glasses).  Sit in the cart.  First, as if sitting in the car, you see the hood in front of you.  They throw you somewhere, from some skyscraper you fall, twist, and then you are already in the subway of New York, as in a real subway.  Then you fall from a skyscraper, and the transformer catches you.  There the wind is blowing, the ambience of the room is constantly changing.  We went a couple of times - at first, just to have fun, then argue about which technologies are used.  There are no such installations in Russia yet. <br><br>  <b>The city also has a lot of technology from the exhibition already implemented</b> .  For example, in the mall there is a huge LED screen.  Almost everywhere - navigation systems, to which information is displayed, even in the case of some kind of emergency.  In Boston, for example, they had information that they were looking for a terrorist.  Roughly speaking, many screens in the city are connected through one center.  I participated in the project for the World Trade Center, there is also a link with the Ministry of Emergency Situations.  But we have it in one company, and there across the country. <br><br>  Everything.  I hope you were interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186010/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186010/</a></p>
