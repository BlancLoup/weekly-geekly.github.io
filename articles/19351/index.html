  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ACDSee - a tool that is not fully used</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am a curious person and I like to install new programs, twist, twist and try new things.  Therefore, when a new version of a product appears, I install it without thinking, expecting an improvement in quality.  But, as it turned out, many programs do not just not improve their qualities in the new version, but also add unnecessary features that only slow down the machine.  In particular, take <strong>ACDSee</strong> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  You can offer me an alternative image manager, but I have already chosen this one for myself.  <strong>The combination of useful functions for me in one product turned out to be only in ACDSee</strong> . <br><br>  I want to talk about which version to choose.  The fact is that wherever I had to work, administrators set the latest version of this program by default, without thinking too much about how it will work.  Then reinstalling it is more difficult, and users often do not use the simplest features of this image manager, despite the fact that they are useful to almost everyone.  There are many reasons why this program is not used, but one of them is the brakes in the older versions.

      The best option for myself, I see ACDSee 5, which I recommend to everyone.  Some choose younger versions, but, as it seems to me, the functionality in them is poor.  If that suits you, then why not.  But it seems to me that you are depriving yourself of a convenient and simple tool for working with pictures. <br><br>  I want to tell those who are not familiar enough with this tool, about the useful features of ACDSee 5 <br><br>  When installing, I would recommend installing not the full version, but selective use.  You probably never need other tools.  So, by choosing Custom, disable the installation of FotoAngelo (for creating a slide show), as well as Internet Photo Printing Services.  To some, I would recommend disabling the installation of the FotoCanvas image editor, but for those who do not use Photoshop, it will be useful, so I would leave it. <br><br>  Tools that almost no one uses: <br><br>  <strong>1. Batch resizing images.</strong> <br>  Just select a few pictures, and select Tools -&gt; Resize in the menu.  Do not forget about the Options button - there is an opportunity to configure batch resizing. <br><br>  <strong>2. Batch change the rotation of photos.</strong> <br>  Select several pictures that you want to rotate, and select Tools -&gt; Rotate / Flip.  IMPORTANT: do not forget to tick Apply to all selected images. <br><br>  <strong>3. Conversion to another image format.</strong>  If you need to convert several pictures simultaneously from JPG to GIF, then the selected pictures need to be processed by manipulating Tools -&gt; Format Convert. <br><br>  <strong>4. Add to Favorites folder.</strong>  Useful if you often use the same folders that are difficult to search.  Just click on the folder with the right mouse button and select "Add to favorites".  Further, these selected folders can be found in the tab with the heart Favorites. <br><br>  <strong>5. ACDSee can sometimes be used as a regular file manager</strong> (not just pictures).  In order to select all types of files in Filter.  But since this is a somewhat perverted version of viewing files, I do not recommend it to everyone. <br><br>  <strong>6. An important function is to copy the full path of the file.</strong> <br>  For those who often have to insert pictures into letters using the ‚Äúfind and insert into the letter body‚Äù method, a small but very useful function is useful: copying the full path of the picture (and not only pictures, as you may have noticed).  Many do this (noticed by acquaintances): they look at the pictures via ACDSee, and then they go, for example, to the mail client, and there they again begin to look for this picture in order to insert it into the body of the letter, remembering the full path.  There is an easier way: select the image, press Ctrl + C, and the full address of the file is already in the clipboard.  It remains to insert it where you need it (it is especially useful in the webmail interface, where there are only forms with the ‚Äúreview‚Äù button - you don‚Äôt even need to click this button, just paste the address of your image into the field and download where required). <br><br>  If I remember something else, I will add.  In the meantime, that's all. <br><br>  I hope you find the article useful.  If not, please do not minus - I would like to write a couple more articles.  As it turned out, my advice on ACDSee is useful not only for ordinary users, but also for advanced users (they are simply not allowed to learn).  In particular, I want to describe ACDSee Pro, which may not be suitable for ordinary users, but for photographers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19351/</a></p>
