      <strong>1. Socialization.</strong> <br>  Work at home kills the person "sociality", sociability.  This is terrible for a person who wants to grow and develop, because we all live in cities, interact with people, earn money from people.  To be successful, communication is necessary, the ability to communicate with people, build communication relationships. <br><br>  We have been learning this since childhood, and now the time has come when we kill our flexibility and social skills.  Now this can be prevented. <br><br>  People working at the computer, at home, they basically forget how to talk.  They lose this skill.  We forget the words that are rarely used, we have to remember the most common words in order to relate a sentence, we lose the skill of speaking.  Yes, the same Wikipedia kills our brain.  A little earlier, we stopped counting in the head, calculators became available, now there are calculators in the cellular, standing in a queue we can calculate the amount of purchases on the cellular, but it is much more difficult for us to do this simple operation in the head.  Also with dictionaries, wikipedias and search engines. <br><br>  How does this happen?  Personally, I stop remembering.  If I forget a word, I search for it in a search engine, if I forget the name of a person, an actor, I go to Google. Images or just Google.  Meanwhile, the years of such a lifestyle affect flexibility, speed of thinking, memory, we are dumb. <br><br>  Socialization is one of the main advantages of coworking, which covers not only communication, but also allows you to develop the brain in other directions, those that "are no longer needed."  Stupid is not necessary. <br><br>  <strong>2. Business contacts, partnership.</strong> <br>  It is also a valuable item for people who want to build a career, grow, expand their opportunities.  Face to face, offline is much easier to build connections, real, stronger. <br><br>  <strong>3. Exchange of information.</strong> <br>  Inside, the exchange of information from hand to hand.  Getting the latest information straight from the heart of the industry.  This is not what you read in the media, this is the stage when information is only being born or is being prepared.  You can be one step ahead of ordinary people, consumers. <br><br>  <strong>4. Strengthening market position.</strong> <br>  Do you have a product, services - their positions, or your positions, will be strengthened by belonging to any community or team.  Hand washes.  This is your pack, you support and protect each other. <br><br>  <strong>5. Creating a new circle of friends.</strong> <br>  As you know, moving away from society removes you from your old friends, meetings become less frequent, only your work becomes interesting to you, some are chosen less and less.  Now you can restore closer ties with old friends, thanks to the increase of your interestingness and sociality, as well as create a new circle of friends, friends by interests.  Perhaps you will find true friends, like you, with the same goals, interests, similar lifestyle. <br>  Perhaps you will also be fun and interesting as in times of students. <br><br>  New jet, new life, active life, fun, joy, company, parties, girls in the end :) Coworking is not only a job! <br><br>  <strong>6. Improving social status.</strong> <br>  Do you need to explain how society treats working at home?  They are considered idlers.  It would seem so, and let them think what we care about.  On the one hand, I agree, on the other, not.  Everyone, albeit subconsciously strives for approval in society, in a pack.  Everyone is pleased respect. <br><br>  By the way, social status exists not only for a wide range, but also for a narrow one, such as your family.  Suppose not all, but many have heard the following: <br>  - how much can you sit at your freaking computer? <br>  - find a normal job. <br>  - you so absolutely dressed! <br><br>  Coworking solves this problem. <br><br>  <strong>7. Home is not a workplace.</strong> <br>  The house is not created for work.  The house is a place of rest, a place to sleep, a cozy nest. <br>  Coworking allows you to get a much greater pleasure from home, a true rest.  The house will finally become home again. <br><br>  After all, even psychology says that working at home is not right. <br>  The house has a bunch of "anchors" to rest.  And the distractions are no less: <br>  relatives, TVs, bed, friends (who believe that if you are at home, then you are free, and do not work at all), a refrigerator, etc. <br><br>  <strong>8. Increase productivity.</strong> <br>  Even from the previous paragraph it is clear that working in the office will increase your productivity.  I'm afraid to make predictions, but it seems to me that the increase in productivity will be huge.  Even without taking into account the partnership, contacts, strengthening positions.  You yourself just begin to do more, do more. <br><br>  <strong>9. Active lifestyle.</strong> <br>  You turn on what has been turned off, you will feel the taste of victories, you will feel movement, drive.  You will begin to move, to live a fuller life. <br><br>  <strong>10. Nutrition, health.</strong> <br>  More movement - more health.  You are finally guaranteed to start getting the necessary minimum of physical activity and warm-ups. <br><br>  You can follow the weight, eat right, because the kitchen, the refrigerator will be far away.  But this is a speech about snacks and the constant use of food, nobody forbids you to eat in the office, or to visit nearby cafes. <br><br>  Today, I think with the pluses you can stop, and go to a brief listing of minuses or possible <strong>minuses</strong> : <br><br>  1. Travel time. <br>  2. Cash costs for rent and travel. <br>  3. It is desirable to have a laptop. <br>  4. The question of backup and data protection. <br>  5. Meals can be a disadvantage if you make the wrong mode and menu. <br>  6. The team.  A bad team just needs to be changed. <br><br>  These are perhaps the main points that can become minuses, but these are more likely excuses for not wanting to move and laziness.  I think the pros significantly overlap the possible disadvantages.  Although there is a question of personal preferences, personal goals.  If a person does not seek anywhere and completely abstracted himself from society, then of course he does not need coworking. <br>  Coworking is suitable for active people or those who want to become one. <br><br>  Those who are active and purposeful, we invite to the Russian-speaking community of co-workers, <a href="http://www.officeshare.ru/">OfficeShare.ru</a> (beta).
