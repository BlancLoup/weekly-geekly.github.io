  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bad advice when working with payment systems</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Articles about what to do are not worth losing your money are already pretty fed up, so I submit to your attention an article about what will happen if you do some of the stupid things from the ones listed below.  Everyone gets money in different ways.  Someone is easy, but for the sake of a few dollars, someone gets up with the first roosters and plunges into work.  Regardless of how you earn your hard-earned money, to lose them all unpleasant.  And, interestingly, many people, having lost their virtual Tugriks, begin to hope for ghosts, magnetic storms, the black cat has gone the distance from the mouse to the computer, just not to blame yourself.  This approach will lead everyone to repeat the case of loss of electronic money.  To prevent this from happening, I will play a little in KO.  and tell you 5 ways by which you can intentionally lose your money. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1 way: Passwords and everything connected with them <br><br>  A real maniac, dreaming of being left without money, will surely make for his account in the payment system a simple qwerty123 password or his date of birth, so that attackers on the social network can find out his date of birth or pick up a password and steal money. <br>  If this does not help, then the right way is to have the same passwords for all resources - for mail and for ICQ, and for your account in the payment system.  In this case, once, hacking, for example, the base of some forum, where our hero was registered, the attacker simply enters the same password in the account in the payment system and collects the money.

        </script>
      <br>
      2nd method: Trojans, spies and so on ... <br><br>  In thought, as if to quickly find zeros in the accounts of your account, a talented hero will definitely use Internet Explorer and not use antivirus and firewall.  At the same time, it will climb all over the Internet, open even those pages that Google warns in a negative way, and of course, download everything that is offered on the Internet.  You should not also neglect the opportunity to actively use torrents, download programs that are offered on spam in ICQ and climb on porn sites of all stripes.  And, well, and, of course, our hero is simply obliged to go to follow the links that are given in the e-mail messages marked with a hacked account and the need to update the password.  Oh yeah, how can you forget that you should not use the on-screen keyboard and try to enter passwords everywhere with your hands in order to make it pleasant to keyloggers. <br><br>  3rd way: Storing data for access to the account, as well as files of wallets on your computer <br><br>  Wishing to lose your precious WM, PM, PP, LR, Poison, etc.  just obliged to keep files of wallets, passwords, certificates, etc. on your computer.  No flash drives !!!  This is done in order to lose all your money, if you have your laptop pulled out of your hands on the street, if your hard drive suddenly burns, or even nicer, the trojan will find the files you need and send it to the right recipient. <br><br>  4th way <br><br>  Universal trust in all users on the Internet.  It is even scary to think that it makes sense to refuse to any user on the forum with 2 posts and registration term of 2 days in the service for the exchange of electronic money.  We strongly advise against using protection codes.  It is important to immediately send the entire amount in full, expecting in return another e-currency that you have been offered to exchange with a profitable percentage. <br>  In addition, our hero can invest astronomical sums in HYIPs for an annual period without ulterior motives.  This method is very multifaceted, the main thing in it is to trust everyone and everything, and then the virtual, and the real wallet of our hero will necessarily flaunt the number "zero." <br><br>  Method 5: Settlement with gray wallets and incorrect notes in funds transfers <br><br>  In the hope of emptying his account, our hero is simply obliged to conduct settlements with various personalities, through whose virtual wallets a lot of stolen money passes.  In addition, you can still try to please the administration of payment systems with challenging remarks to transfers.  We advise you to write notes in the style of ‚Äúfor drugs‚Äù, ‚Äúpayment for 1000 kalas and 2 uranium reactors‚Äù or ‚Äúmy share in yesterday‚Äôs fraud‚Äù.  This method of reinforced concrete will give you a blocked account and worries for another year. <br>  Here they are such bad advice for those who care about their electronic money.  Think over all the above read and be careful in working with finances. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85249/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85249/</a></p>
