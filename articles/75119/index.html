By the way, I did not work in a completely white way, however, like all my predecessors.  Of which, at the mention of the oldest employees, there were 5 people, if not more. <br><br>  I was warned about my satisfaction for a month.  On this date, I had to conduct interviews with candidates for my position, find the right person and tell him the network layout used by the software, comment on the configuration of the servers, etc.

      Fortunately, at the same time, I was warned that none of the outgoing sysadmins received the latest salary.  Moreover, the leadership had some ‚Äúgarters‚Äù that allowed them to competently deal with a person even if his guilt was not proven. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And all this rather long story began with the fact that I came for an interview, which turned out to be quite unusual.  I interviewed the deputy.  director of the economic part, so the "serious" interview, we are certainly not talking.  I was shown one machine that crashes when I load into BSOD and asked to fix it.  A traditional 256MB flash drive with Hirens Boot USB, which I carry in my breast pocket all the time, helped to detect and fix the problem in 5 minutes. Then I heard the verdict - accepted. <br><br>  From that moment on, a lot of different duties fell on me.  Half-dead domain, video surveillance system, consumables orders, internal CRM for PHP, and most importantly - telephony. <br><br>  A relatively small call center for 10 people was the main source of income for% companyname%, receiving more than 15,000 calls per month.  But despite all this, behind a beautiful door to the server hiding this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/22a/8db/2a5/22a8db2a58a6d3d762c998e4a59f71cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd3/49c/cd2/dd349ccd2370042395088f902ab87c01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e0d/225/6c3/e0d2256c3be00257ed7c16d9b473151f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, it worked that way.  Communication drops, one domain account per 10 employees, switches (?) D-Link DES-1008, connected by a ‚Äútree‚Äù, and the apotheosis is an Internet gateway based on D-Link DIR-120.  He is there in the picture above.  And this is for 70 people and 8 servers. <br><br>  Needless to say, much has been done in six months.  Trunk channels were laid, most switches were replaced, a normal domain with personal accounts for each employee was raised, the server one was completely re-equipped.  Naturally, such innovations did not always immediately begin to work as expected.  But in general, a month later, the situation returned to normal, and everything began to work as planned. <br><br>  In general, I liked the work.  An educated (albeit far from IT) team, reasonable terms on assignments, tasty and free ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù food.  But the whole raspberry was spoiled directly by the owner of the% companyname% - the person is by no means stupid, but impulsive and extremely categorical.  These two character traits, mixing in it, periodically led to such unusual results that it was embarrassing to even tell them in the IT team. <br><br>  Therefore, from time to time assignments fell on me, a la throw a Wi-Fi channel through half of Moscow in order not to pay the provider extra 50 thousand Russian money for 10 Mb anlim. <br><br>  And worst of all, I dared (!) To criticize the decisions of the authorities.  Only in their field, of course.  And in general, I didn‚Äôt feel any kind of ‚Äúreverence‚Äù for Gender - it was too often I sat in his office with a report ‚Äúwhat was done during the last night / week / month‚Äù. <br><br>  Naturally, so long could not continue.  The reason for the dismissal was my categorical refusal to arrange the icons on the desktop as they were before the re-arrangement of windows.  The reason, I think, no one needs to explain. <br><br>  But after this incident, I did not sit in the chair, waiting for my dismissal.  Rather the opposite.  I began to bring to mind and run all the projects that "hung" because of the unplanned introduction of a new domain.  As a result, users received a bunch of useful functionality, but most importantly, the network became more difficult.  Much harder than before.  And the most transformed ... right, telephony. <br><br>  There was only one minus - I, as a developer of this system, was actually quite easy to maintain.  But the new man was much more difficult to do.  And since the bosses offered the applicants the ‚Äúold‚Äù salary, most of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù candidates turned around and left right after I showed lists of active network services and voiced the cost of their service. <br><br>  ... after my dismissal, the new team of system administrators called for another month asking millions of questions about the structure of this network.  A month later, I said that from now on consultations were paid.  Calls have stopped.  A month later, the director called and said he wanted to talk to me.  The conversation and the removal of one bug (although I eliminated it for three hours) cost him 10 thousand rubles.  True, we haven‚Äôt agreed on permanent cooperation - I requested a salary exactly twice as much as I did before. <br><br>  After another month, I learned that instead of the old system administrators, there is an outsourcing firm.  True, they did well for a short time.  On the fourth day of work, exactly half of all phones fell off.  In addition, the cost of services of this company 4 times my salary. <br><br>  And today they called me again.  And what should I tell them,% username%?  What would you say to them? <br><br>  I said - think about it.  Fortunately, I have time. <br><br>  Summing up - in order not to be afraid of losing your job and your last salary, all you need to do is: <br><br>  a) really work well and understand that the real effectiveness of your work exceeds the amount of wages at least several times. <br>  b) tie all the "ends" to themselves.  This is easy to do, being a senior sysadmin. <br>  c) not to be afraid of innovation - within reasonable limits, of course. <br><br>  In this case, even the dismissal can be profitable. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> Thanks to readers, transferred to the blog "Learn to work" =) <br><br>  <b>upd # 2:</b> I see a lot of questions in the comments about code documentation.  All this, of course, was done.  The emphasis was not on the confusion of the IT infrastructure, but on a direct increase in the <b>cost of its maintenance</b> due to an increase in the number of network services.  At the same time, the quality of user service improved, because  unnecessary services no one would simply serve.  Binding is not so much to me as to users. <br><br>  <b>upd # 3:</b> And yes, I have no personal dislike for superiors.  It's just that their task is to set tasks for me, and not to teach me how to live.  The last - only according to my desire.  And in the situation described, someone had to win, and someone to lose.  I simply did not want to lose. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75119/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75119/</a></p>
