The final competition was held at the QNX Russia 2012 conference. The main award was given to Vyacheslav Prokofiev, a student at St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University, for the JobClouder application, specially developed for the BlackBerry PlayBook.  Got a BlackBerry PlayBook tablet, as well as other prizes. <br><br>  By the decision of the jury, which included experts from RIM and SWD Embedded Systems, the JobClouder application, created by Vyacheslav, was recognized as the most creative and well-developed.  JobClouder allows using the PlayBook to access and manage content stored in the cloud, as well as work with remotely stored documents using an intuitive interface. <br><br>  The second place in the competition of developers of applications for the BlackBerry PlayBook-QNX platform was shared by Nikolai Abramov and Mikhail Figurin, also representing St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University.  They were noted for their game ‚ÄúFozzle‚Äù, which has an interesting interface and algorithm of work.  The third place was awarded to Vladimir Boyko from Saratov State Technical University, for the Super Traktor application, which allows using the PlayBook to remotely control the model of the Claas Atles 936 RZ tractor.

      This was the first competition organized by RIM for students from Russia.  The main objective of this competition is to popularize the operating system BlackBerry PlayBook, working on the basis of technology QNX.  At the same time, as part of the competition, students had to create applications that meet the criteria for publishing in BlackBerry App World, that is, ready to become a commercial product. <br><br>  But more importantly, Research In Motion has deployed the BlackBerry Academic Program to Russia - a program of cooperation with universities that will provide technical universities across Russia access to training courses and materials on administration, support and development of applications for the BlackBerry platform. <br><br>  RIM plans to expand its existing QNX courses in Russia with BlackBerry courses.  Paul Lucier, Managing Director of RIM in Russia, explained that the current QNX course system now has the opportunity to develop applications for a mobile platform and said that he is pleased to see St. Petersburg Polytechnic University and Saratov State Technical University as the first participants in the program. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For its part, RIM provides Russian universities with full access to all educational resources, including educational modules, laboratory complexes, software and device support, to help undergraduates to create applications, manage BlackBerry devices and services.  The course includes theoretical and practical materials, as well as laboratory work, which are designed to prepare students for developing applications for both BlackBerry smartphones and the PlayBook tablet. <br><br>  In the world with the BlackBerry Academic Program, more than 640 educational institutions from 113 countries already cooperate.  As part of this program, for example, the TargetFirstGrade application (also known as CibleCI) was created, designed to help teachers from developing countries work with students more productively in an environment where there can be 60-80 people in a class.  This academic year it is being tested in Senegal.  Also, with the support of RIM, QNX Software System and Texas Instruments, a laboratory for the development of automotive technologies at the University of Shanghai was established to study and create solutions in the field of on-board infotainment systems, traffic control systems and on-board general-purpose systems. <br><br>  For projects implemented under the BlackBerry academic prtogramm can be found here: <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/ataglance/academic/faculty/">http://us.blackberry.com/ataglance/academic/faculty/</a> <br>  BlackBerry Academic Program website - <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/academic">www.blackberry.com/academic</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143222/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143222/</a></p>
