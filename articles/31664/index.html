  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Internet goes to the third dimension</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Big players are looking for a standard for three-dimensional Internet.</b> <br><br>  Today, virtual worlds are closed reservations, whose three-dimensional landscapes are separated from each other in much the same way as AOL, Compuserve, and others once shared the two-dimensional Internet in the 1990s.  Now a group of more than 20 companies, including IBM, Linden Lab, Multiverse and Forterra Systems, have raised the question of how it is possible to combine modern virtual worlds to establish a single set of standards in order to create a three-dimensional Internet.  Although, until now, there is no unanimous opinion on what form this 3-D Internet should take, the main goal is to provide users with the opportunity to move between virtual worlds as easily as they are moving from site to site. . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúWe believe that this will be the next logical step in the development of the Internet,‚Äù said the head of the corporate three-dimensional network (intraverse) of IBM, Michael Roe.  He believes that the current situation with the delimitation of virtual worlds, inhibits the development of the Internet, because it does not allow to organize an integral market of virtual goods and services.  For example, according to him, if someone wants to open a three-dimensional online store, he must create it separately for each of several virtual worlds, moreover, using completely different technologies.  At the same time, the unified standard of the three-dimensional Internet could allow the store owner to give users a link by which they could go to his store from any place they would not be in other virtual worlds, in the same way that people now use domain names to go to commercial and other sites.

      To organize a full-fledged virtual Internet, according to Roe, developers must find ways to handle three-dimensional objects ‚Äî including avatars that people use for self-presentation ‚Äî in several virtual worlds.  For example, according to him, someone who has made a car for himself in the virtual world of <a href="http://content.vmtv.com/pmr/">Virtual Pimp My Ride</a> , which is owned by MTV, may want to take it with him to <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> , owned by Linden Lab.  In order for this car to look the same in both worlds, its program code must be adequately perceived by both systems.  By approving uniform standards for the three-dimensional Internet, as Roe believes, developers will be able to solve such problems and erase the boundaries that separate the individual worlds. <br><br>  However, the problem is much wider than pokatushki on virtual machines and shopping in a three-dimensional department store.  Scientist and pioneer of virtual worlds from the Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at the University of California at Berkeley, Jaron Leinier, believes that it is particularly important for humanity to develop search technologies in the three-dimensional Internet.  "The human mind is designed to work in a three-dimensional environment and our computational capabilities already allow us to organize a full-fledged three-dimensional interface capable of working at the level of the human brain," says Jayron.  He believes that people must find a way to combine three-dimensional physical perception of the world with the capabilities of the Internet. <br><br>  In addition, some steps in this direction have already been taken.  The head of Forterra Systems, John Vat, proposed a standard called the ‚Äúpage landscape format‚Äù that his company developed, and which, according to Vet, can provide virtual worlds with common points of contact, literally.  If the standard is adopted, it will allow developers to create such landscapes that will be equally correctly perceived on any system.  Page landscape format allows developers to use high-resolution graphics that are not available with existing landscape standards developed by the military.  Forterra is going to give everyone free access to its format specifications. <br><br>  Other companies, including Multiverse and Linden Lab, have developed platforms on which independent developers can create their virtual worlds more easily than if they had to do everything from scratch, which resulted in entire networks of virtual worlds that can be combined with each other. on the other, because they are based on the same technology.  These networks of virtual worlds are a smaller version of what can be a three-dimensional Internet.  It remains only to develop such standards that would combine networks based on different technologies. <br><br>  Head of Multiverse, Corey Bridges, said that his company has developed a special program code that fits in a specific place in the system, so that users can transfer their avatar from one system to another using Multiverse technology.  Bridges said that the main problem is to develop a system so flexible that in order to provide a bunch of different worlds, the developers are not forced to create the same worlds. <br><br>  Linden Lab chief executive, Cory Ondrejka, said that the first step to uniting virtual worlds is finding a suitable candidate for a single standard.  He is going to appeal to systems such as OpenID, which allow you to store personal information and transfer it between different worlds at its own discretion. <br><br>  Leinir, who claims that he has extensive connections among people related to virtual worlds, believes that although he personally would like to see the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa three-dimensional Internet successfully implemented, he is not quite sure that adopting a single standard will have a positive impact on developers. .  "Certain people seek to use the emergence of standards for personal commercial purposes," remarks Linin, pointing out that IBM and Microsoft‚Äôs history provides real-life examples of how standardization can be profitable for specific players.  However, Linir believes that the standard of three-dimensional Internet is unlikely to be developed in the same way as the standard developed HTML, namely, in the form of an abstract definition, which was accepted by the people.  He considers it more likely that the standard will be one of the most successful systems, like Adobe Flash, which has become the standard for high-capacity Internet applications. <br><br>  <b>Translation from English:</b> <a href="http://studio-bloger.livejournal.com/profile">Roman Rabe</a> <br><br>  Especially for <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b4/e5f/93f/3b4e5f93fec698b310e33c06b7cb2d3e.gif"></a>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/worldwebstudio">worldwebstudio</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31664/</a></p>
