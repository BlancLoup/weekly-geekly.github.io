  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota will fight for frequencies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://imghost.makeidea.ru/counter/832" width="1" height="1"><br>  At today's press conference at RIA Novosti, Yota CEO Denis Sverdlov, said that the subject of the trial is the 30 MHz wide frequency band from the total 70 MHz band, respectively, with any court decision scheduled for the opening of Yota networks in Kazan, Novosibirsk and Samara will be held as planned.  Technically, the 40 MHz band is enough for a fully functional new technology.  Yota's desire to get a wider band is due to the desire to provide users with new services (in particular, there are rumors about the launch of Yota voice services based on LTE networks in the 2011th year). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7b/21/7b219e8a6e9ec1fb2e8eedd837ba248d.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="http://imghost.makeidea.ru/counter/833" width="1" height="1"><br>  <b>Court</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúAfter permission to use frequencies has been issued, there are only two ways to revoke them.</i>  <i>The first is a non-judicial order, the grounds for which are described in detail in the law, and none of them are suitable for our situation.</i>  <i>The second is the judicial order.</i>  <i>That is, Roskomnadzor should do this through the courts.</i>  <i>We consider that our documents are lawfully received, and we will defend our position in court.</i>  <i>To this end, we are preparing a claim in the Moscow Arbitration Court, where we will appeal these decisions. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  The head of the company said that the court decision would definitely be in favor of Yota, since  the frequencies were legally obtained.

      <b>The impact of frequency selection on business</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúFor our current business, this has no impact, because our business plan was originally calculated from 40 Megahertz (from the number of base stations we planned), revenue, investment, number of subscribers, and other aspects.</i>  <i>They were all considered, based on 40 megahertz.</i>  <i>Therefore, this whole story has virtually no operational effect on our business. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  However, the band at another 30 megahertz is a matter of user comfort.  The company has repeatedly stated its intention to do everything for ease of use.  The lack of roaming in the country Yota users take for granted, while this is a unique offer in Russia.  Frequencies are needed so that users do not have to reconfigure their equipment while traveling to other cities covered by Yota. <br><br>  <b>Innovative company</b> <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe consider ourselves to be a very innovative company.</i>  <i>And this status is confirmed by a large number of international awards.</i>  <i>Moreover, in 2009, Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev personally handed us a prize called the Breakthrough of the Year.</i>  <i>And the situation is such that both Dmitry Anatolyevich and Vladimir Vladimirovich support all innovative companies.</i>  <i>And it seemed to us that we are the company that personifies this movement, because today we are the largest 4G network in the world.</i>  <i>And, in fact, we told Dmitry Anatolyevich and Vladimir Vladimirovich about our plans to launch LTE in Russia and that we are strongly supported by the regional authorities.</i>  <i>And in this aspect, it is rather strange that with all our focus on the development of innovations in our country, we began to feel very strong pressure from the beginning of summer on the part of the regulator. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Of course, there was not without stakeholders.  Journalists tried to find out about the attitude of general director Yota to competitors: <br><br>  <b>About Basis and RET</b> <br>  <i>Osnova Telecom focuses on the range of 2.3-2.4.</i>  <i>It turns out that there is no interest for her in this situation.</i>  <i>Rusenergotelecom claims a range of 2.5-2.7.</i>  <i>Of course, we cannot say this, but common sense suggests that, probably, if in any situation you need to look for a beneficiary (of course, we don‚Äôt believe in it), then frequencies can actually be withdrawn.</i>  <i>But if hypothetically such a situation is allowed, then, apparently, ‚ÄúRusenergotelekomu‚Äù it will be beneficial.</i>  <i>As for transactions, I, as the company's general director, can say that there are no transactions with Rusenergotelecom, with the structures of Grigori Berezkin, and never will be. ‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3f/e9/3fe956221543be6ade7a31f3ab452b2a.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, everyone is concerned about the urgent issue of network development in other cities, in which, as you know, instead of the usual for the capitals of WiMax, LTE networks will be developed immediately. <br><br>  <b>LTE</b> <br>  <i>LTE starts in Kazan and in 4 other cities this year.</i>  <i>And in the cities in which we are already present - in the 4th quarter of 2011.</i>  <i>We have a special unit that deals with subscriber terminals.</i>  <i>By the fall of 2010, they will begin to distribute modems.</i>  <i>Whose production they will be, I can not say yet.</i>  <i>We have different scenarios.</i>  <i>We are simultaneously working with 3 manufacturers due to the fact that the technology is new, we will choose the device that will be ready by that moment.</i> <br><br>  General questions on the company's position in the market were also asked. <br><br>  <b>How are yota</b> <br>  <i>We have a little less than 600 thousand subscribers.</i>  <i>For 7 months we managed to earn more than 2 billion rubles.</i>  <i>In this sense, we are absolutely satisfied with the business.</i>  <i>We have a lot of new interesting developments.</i>  <i>More than 1,200 employees.</i>  <i>When we started, we were told that it would be a great success and we would be very happy if we received at least more than 10 thousand subscribers in a year.</i>  <i>Recently, FOM research was conducted, we ourselves were very pleasantly surprised by the results, that in 80% of cases when a customer comes to the store, he is recommended Yota.</i>  <i>It was suggested that this is due to the fact that we pay more to retailers, but, in fact, this is due to the fact that today this service is one of the best on the market.</i>  <i>Therefore, if in a nutshell, no matter how this story ends, good or bad (although we believe that it will end well), we are absolutely confident in our future.</i> <br><br>  <b>Material compiled on the basis of the press conference Ryan-news from August 2, 2010.</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.rian.ru/technology/20100802/260906797.html">An article on Riana</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100758/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100758/</a></p>
