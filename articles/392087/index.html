Having a camera in a car has long been not a luxury, but a necessity on domestic roads, full of all sorts of surprises.  Despite the fact that registrars offer dozens of Russian brands, real device developers can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  Among such companies, <a href="http://trend-vision.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dspecial%26utm_campaign%3Dtrendvision_branding">TrendVision</a> , whose specialists stood at the origins of automotive ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù in Russia, occupies a special place.  A number of large companies are still using the services of TrendVision engineers when developing models or subsequently eliminating the mistakes of not quite straightforward Chinese.  For your information, in 2016 TrendVision will become the first Russian company in the field of registrars at the IFA exhibition in Berlin. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/trendvision/blog/273128/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8c/0b4/be6/a8c0b4be6c644765ab32e5a43bf5f7a1.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">A bit of history</font> </h2><br>  I have been actively interested in registrars for a long time, but I only had a chance to get acquainted with representatives of TrendVision only in the summer of 2015.  In the office of the company, I spent several hours talking in detail with TrendVision‚Äôs chief engineer and co-founder, Sergey Anatolyevich.  Already after five minutes it became clear that in front of me was a real fan of his work, who is a fan of domestic engineering thought and in every way contributes to its success. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e0e/63c/244/e0e63c24423ae7ddc005fa983ac98690.jpg">

      You know, when talking face to face, it is easy to understand when a company prefers to make a minimum of effort and only points its finger at the models you like in the catalogs of Asian factories.  And when fundamentally rejects all sorts of Chinese developments in favor of their own inventions.  Whatever I asked - Sergey had a detailed answer and explanations to all the most tricky questions, why certain points in the models were implemented in one way or another.  And up to the present, no matter how difficult questions about the work of TrendVision or the market of registrars as a whole I had, Sergei always answered me in the most prompt and detailed manner, for which he thanks a lot.  Including - for a number of interesting details and stories about Asian production and Russian brands ‚Äúlit up‚Äù in the comments on Geektimes. <br><br>  What is TrendVision?  The backbone of the company is a group of engineers, which in 2008-2010 refined and adjusted the first recorders of domestic brands to the final quality product stage.  In 2012, the TrendVision trademark was registered, under which the devices are manufactured.  The company is notable for the fact that it specializes in recorders without spraying dozens of types of devices, from portable speakers to photo frames.  This is a very positive effect on the quality of devices - in contrast to all sorts of ‚Äúumbrella‚Äù brands that are not interested in such ‚Äútrifles‚Äù and take quantity, giving sometimes a dozen completely new models a year.  Is it possible in such conditions to provide thorough long-term support of each registrar, to deal with, if necessary, its improvement and modifications?  Of course not.  For comparison: the current range of TrendVision cameras includes only seven models, not counting the already classic devices like TrendVision TV-Q5NV GPS. <br><br>  TrendVision has always focused on high-quality "stuffing."  From the very first models, the company prepared its own circuitry, lenses, software.  The only thing that was borrowed was the most successful ready-made buildings of Chinese factories.  This is not at all a whim of the company - it is the creation of an exclusive design that is the longest and most expensive procedure in the development of a registrar. <br><br>  In 2013, TrendVision TV-103 was released - the first Full HD recorder in Russia in the form of a lining on the rear-view mirror, the model immediately became the company's calling card.  By the way, TrendVision remains the technical leader in this narrow segment of automotive ‚Äúblack boxes‚Äù, for which a number of company model solutions are still out of competition. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/60a/60d/7f4/60a60d7f4630cb210f6f385f6829d2de.jpg"><br><br>  The TrendVision TV-103 still used a ready-made Chinese case, otherwise the ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù model was prepared by domestic engineers.  The success of the device says at least the fact that it remains in demand for three years and has not yet been discontinued. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">Domestic engineers in</font> </h2><br>  Currently, TrendVision produces only its own designed recorders, with unique cases and ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  The simplest and most illustrative example of an exclusive to which the chief engineer of the company immediately drew my attention was precisely the case of devices.  Designing for one registrar takes about three months and costs about $ 30,000. Such expenses are excessive for Russian brands, who order a dozen models in China annually and quickly throw support for devices.  And even for companies specializing in registrars who do not want to lay out an impressive amount for the case. <br><br>  In this case, the name of the organization is printed on the body with the status of "public design".  That is a design that the factory can sell to any customer.  If the company values ‚Äã‚Äãits product, wants to emphasize the originality of the design and protect it from copying with Chinese plants (there are plenty of such precedents), one of the ways to achieve the goal is to emboss the name of the organization on the case.  All the current TrendVision recorders, without exception, have this feature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/843/81c/0ac/84381c0ac09258a1f267cec50d5f6736.jpg"><br><br>  It is logical that the company seeks to recoup the cost of the design, using it in several of its models - say, in identical cases made TrendVision TDR-708GP and TDR-718GP, models in the form of a lining on the rear-view mirror (MR-700, MR-710, MR -712 and their variations).  So the developers are trying to achieve a reserve for low prices, because for each model it is not necessary to prepare accessories from the ground up, mold fasteners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a8/2e8/9c9/2a82e89c98b73e8a334bdc6e62e89578.jpg"><br><br>  TrendVision staff includes programmers, engineers, and individual employees are involved in the quality control of finished products.  TrendVision‚Äôs initial refusal of services from Chinese factories in terms of both hardware and software ‚Äústuffing‚Äù made it possible to avoid problems typical for other brands.  For example, Russian programmers get rid of most of the errors at the stage of testing recorders.  If users subsequently report problems, all notifications are taken to work, bugs are fixed in the nearest firmware. <br><br>  A team of experienced developers has enabled TrendVision to ensure that the company's registrars are among the leaders in the video quality market.  In the understanding of the philistine, everything is simple - you just need to take a top-end processor, a matrix and an objective, and such a bundle in itself will give an excellent result.  In fact, everything is much more complicated, the so-called human factor plays an important role.  Russian specialists are engaged in careful adjustment of the CMOS-sensor (brightness, contrast, color, sharpness, etc.), firmware optimization, increase in bit rate while maintaining stable operation of the device, etc. <br><br>  And what about the quality of recorders?  Colleagues "in the subject" know that when contracting order the release of devices in Chinese factories, you need to keep your ears open.  On Geektimes, wonderful stories have been repeatedly told about how ingenious our Asian neighbors are different in the matter of the hack-work and deception of Russian customers.  I will not hide - and TrendVision has had many cases that have convinced the company of the need to closely control the production process and inspect the products being shipped.  Compared to other companies, as a result, TrendVision chose the best option.  In fact, the company is fully working separately taken Chinese production, long-term cooperation has allowed to minimize the likelihood of events of the category "Chinese surprise".  The level of marriage is brought to the minimum indicator, which is only 1%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31c/089/d88/31c089d8845e28d931d039e84a675901.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48a/196/f9f/48a196f9f976c711e965ceb7d8330069.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f80/ee6/212/f80ee621235a0a3ce2a34ccdf0761054.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">Features of national registrars</font> </h2><br>  TrendVision is maximally open for feedback - the company maintains <a href="https://www.instagram.com/trend_vision/">Instagram</a> , the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG78mGIWrUY18idpOLgHdyw">YouTube channel</a> , the <a href="https://vk.com/trendvision">VKontakte</a> group and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trendvisionofficial">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://trendvision.su/forum_trendvision/">its own forum</a> , communicates with users of <a href="http://videoregforum.ru/forums/trendvision/">videoregforum.ru</a> .  The interest is mutual - on the one hand, the owners of the company's registrars can always find out the latest news, plans, get advice.  On the other hand, TrendVision is open to ideas and suggestions; when preparing new models, the wishes and comments of users are taken into account, allowing to take into account the peculiarities of operating recorders in Russia. <br><br>  This moment TrendVision pays close attention, although it would seem - what kind of "local features" can we talk about, what are the same bad Chinese or Korean models for our country?  I'll start at least with batteries.  Almost all Chinese devices simply do not start at a temperature of -10 ¬∞ C and below.  For this reason, for example, experienced motorists prefer not to leave their cameras at night in the cabin - from the morning until the cabin warms up, switching on the device is extremely problematic.  The Korean models have another extreme - due to the peculiarities of the legislation of South Korea, lithium-polymer batteries are not installed in them.  Supercapacitors are used exclusively, which, although they have a number of indisputable advantages (about them below), are not able to offer long autonomous shooting and allow only to complete the recording correctly and save the current video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5bf/4e9/00a/5bf4e900af1217f6dc833f44161e7def.jpg"><br><br>  In TrendVision models, this issue was resolved by an approach that no other registrar developer has yet repeated.  Specialists have implemented a special super-capacitor (0.22 F) in the recorders along with the usual Li-Po battery, which allows the camera to start when it is freezing down to -30 ¬∞ C!  In addition, in the case of a full discharge of the main battery, the supercapacitor can store date and time data for several days.  On the other hand, Li-Po is still installed, but it didn‚Äôt do without the ‚Äúnational color‚Äù - expensive cold-resistant batteries are used, which are not afraid of ‚Äúwintering‚Äù in the cabin and will not break down due to the cold. <br><br>  The harsh Russian climate is the root cause of TrendVision's rejection of standard circuitry offered by processor manufacturers and focused mainly on medium-price recorders.  In addition to adapting to the use of the battery and supercapacitor, some power chips have been replaced with more powerful ones, with enhanced temperature characteristics. <br><br>  Another issue that neither the Chinese nor the Koreans think about is fastenings.  In most countries, car owners do not remove the recorders, even if they leave the car for a long time.  Therefore, the brackets, to put it mildly, are far from the notion of ‚Äúquick-release‚Äù, especially the Korean models - with all the holders on 3M scotch tape.  The latter also completely ‚Äúgladden‚Äù with the absence of swivel mounts - this, again, is a consequence of national peculiarities, because, say, in South Korea, it is not customary to film a dialogue with DPS officers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e42/f02/f84/e42f02f84aa6eff66b647a1564634abd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c3d/14f/016/c3d14f016e2640ecec05b29b1ff13899.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/841/398/72f/84139872f4e33d7bc80b34594ac58e4e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/8cd/548/2918cd5482c5ad770dbd34687976bb6d.jpg"><br><br>  In the TrendVision models, the fastenings are made so that the driver with one hand can instantly take off or put the camera back, without any latches and screws.  Powerful neodymium magnets, which provide additional fixation of the recorder in the holder, help in this.  Complete with TrendVision devices, the bracket is offered with both a vacuum suction cup and 3M scotch tape. <br><br>  In the second variant, the design was made unobtrusive - the size of the square pad (mounted directly on the glass) into which the bracket is inserted is only 3x3 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80a/1da/ac4/80a1daac4ca89f6e0d36a84030bfd030.jpg"><br><br>  If you install an element in the field of silk-screen printing, it is almost impossible for a passerby to see it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76a/315/048/76a3150485d8189f2e4fa48d52f3b914.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the ‚Äútemperature theme‚Äù - a few words about holders, at the end of last year, this topic even gave rise to a small skirmish between the companies at Geektimes.  Let me remind you that the lens holder can be made of plastic or (more expensive option) metal.  Due to temperature fluctuations, the plastic may deform, thereby disturbing the precise focusing of the lens and leading to a ‚Äúblurred‚Äù picture.  Although according to statistics from one of the brands, this happens in no more than 0.05% of cases.  Engineers TrendVision gracefully approached the problem.  A special plastic was chosen with a minimum temperature expansion, and the height of the holder was reduced.  Indeed, even in the case of heating, a shorter holder will increase by a smaller amount than a longer one.  Plus, the lens is screwed into such a holder with effort and has no backlash, which greatly simplifies the process of setting up the optics. <br><br>  Also TrendVision is categorically against all sorts of glossy cases and other design delights that attract attention to the registrar and may cause hacking the cabin.  Absolutely all the models of the brand are made in matte, nondescript outward plastic.  This is a conscious move by the company, although due to the presence of gloss it would be possible to achieve a more spectacular appearance of the models.  However, Russian developers never give up aesthetics at the expense of practicality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/067/5a4/8f4/0675a48f4177e21906ec6e2357c77985.jpg"><br><br>  In the event of an accident, it is scary to give the inspector a card on which a record of the incident is preserved in a single copy.  Therefore, in all current TrendVision recorders, two memory card slots are implemented at once, including even the budget model TrendVision TDR-200 for 6,500 rubles.  Although initially the introduction of two slots was due to the desire of developers to give the user the opportunity to choose between microSD cards (up to 128 GB!) And SD (up to 64 GB).  Say, not everyone likes to search the small microSD card that has flown out of the slot, and they are more expensive than SD-versions with the same volume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/203/348/4e2/2033484e2c7fe47d362a346407919971.jpg"><br><br>  Among the TrendVision recorder chips, a polarizing filter with magnets is notable.  "Polaric" rarely found in the recorders, mainly the option of flagship models.  This filter serves to eliminate reflections from the windshield of the car dashboard and the objects on it.  However, to achieve this effect, a part of the world is ‚Äúeaten up,‚Äù which is not important during the day, but is critical at night.  Therefore, ideally, in the dark, the filter should be removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/280/072/ee3/280072ee3ce8a626dc8767debcbbe949.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46d/e89/96d/46de8996d87f655536da04a0073455d8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/612/226/a92/612226a92ce027f40a48893d5eb1e247.jpg"><br><br>  In almost all recorders, the "polarik" either fits very tightly onto the lens, or is screwed along the thread.  Of course, every time to remove-install accessory quickly get bored.  Engineers TrendVision found a way out of the situation - the lens was performed with a magnetic rim, so the shooting / installation takes place in a fraction of a second.  In addition, the magnet allows you to configure the lens by rotating it much faster than in the case of other installation options. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">Power and GPS "on the mind"</font> </h2><br>  Special attention is given to the organization of power supply in TrendVision recorders.  Which, in turn, is closely intertwined with the company's fundamental approach to the construction of a GPS receiver.  It is unlikely that anyone will be surprised by the power supply of the recorder when energy is supplied through a connector in the bracket, from which, in turn, enters the chamber.  This allows you not to insert wires into the recorder body, which means - quickly remove and install it back.  It is no secret that in Russia they love to drive not only on left-hand drive cars, but also on right-hand drive cars.  Therefore, when choosing the location of the power connector in the ‚Äúbox‚Äù models (TDR-708/718/200), TrendVision specialists took, and ... We installed two ports at once, on both sides of the mount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/980/362/cdd/980362cdd9b47caadf4f53aa485014ac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98d/c36/4d4/98dc364d486dd4c1defd22623bc0b764.jpg"><br><br>  In addition, a different inclination of the windshield was taken into account, in addition to the kit, such a competent adapter is attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b98/a17/ee9/b98a17ee9325c55b3a815e65c4a32191.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a4/659/e35/0a4659e352e9e03336de0a7c3a13c510.jpg"><br><br>  In models with a GPS antenna, the corresponding receiver is external, and in fact is included in the power supply chain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e8d/abe/438/e8dabe4388b2985d5a5c0e8f8bfe9f5b.jpg"><br><br>  That is, the cable from the recorder mount is included in the unit with GPS, from which, in turn, the wire with the adapter is included in the cigarette lighter connector.  This was done for the purpose of convenience - this is not how a ‚Äúhedgehog‚Äù is formed from a set of parallel wires. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/125/2ae/f14/1252aef14d80d6ca18a4bb9519e7ee55.jpg"><br><br>  In general, why did you need to make an external receiver, if you could embed it in the housing of the recorder or in the mount (the most popular option)?  Analysis of a large number of competitors recorders led TrendVision engineers to the following conclusions.  The most "beautiful" way out would be to embed a GPS antenna in the recorder's body, but the inevitable interference from the internal electronics would have a negative effect on the reception of the satellite signal.  And the more sensitive the antenna, the more susceptible it is to interference.  Therefore, the manufacturer may praise the GPS module in every way and not be guileless at all, but it is quite another thing to keep silent about the real operation of this component in the device. <br><br>  The companies that decided to install a GPS receiver inside the recorder's body chose one of two ways to fix the problem.  The first is the installation of a conventional GPS antenna, which solves the issue of a long search for satellites.  However, instead of 12-15 satellites, the recorder begins to hold the signal on average from 7-9 sources.  The second way is the shielding of the board with a metal frame, which actually eliminates interference, but creates a number of other problems.  For example, natural ventilation is disturbed, which causes the processor and other components to heat up more, the recorder starts to hang more often. <br><br>  In registrars of Russian and not only companies, brackets with a GPS receiver built into them are extremely popular, which is a very effective solution.  The main thing is that in the end the distance between the antenna and the recorder should be at least 20 mm to eliminate the negative effect of the clock generator.  It seems to be all great, but we are returning to the criminal plane - embedding the antenna makes the mount bulky and perfectly visible from the outside.  The result is a sharp increase in the probability of finding the abandoned car uncovered, which is only confirmed by police reports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4c/776/44d/d4c77644db77e11046e1a84947eee521.jpg"><br><br>  Also, do not forget about the increasing popularity of athermal windshields, which are not radiotransparent and interfere with the operation of the GPS receiver.  Of course, in such glasses there is usually a "radio-transparent window", the location of which is indicated in the instructions.  The only problem is that this is the very place of the ‚Äúwindow‚Äù from the point of view of mounting the recorder is often extremely inconvenient.  And on the contrary, the external GPS unit of TrendVision models allows you to install it anywhere on the windshield without being tied to the recorder. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">We do not throw ours</font> </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I said, TrendVision provides long-term support for its devices, and this applies not only to the release of new firmware. Last summer, when I visited the company's office, I already knew about the intention to change the design of the boxes of a number of models. For example, the TrendVision TDR-718GP package looked like this earlier (on the left), and this way (on the right) - now. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f7/68f/aee/6f768faee2a2147fb0000253139b62e3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c6f/e1d/097/c6fe1d097698d4e1cf3da4663826f86d.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the company was engaged in refining the bracket with a vacuum suction cup. Previously, it consisted of two parts and, alas, very painfully reacted to any irregularities of the road surface. Simply put - badly damped vibration, because of which there was a noticeable shaking in the frame. Now the mount is recycled, it is a single piece and is not afraid of "real" Russian roads.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/948/3b3/7b7/9483b37b7fb0fb0b01207e97be5a0660.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the TrendVision TDR-718GP update, a completely new mount came in, which now comes with the model. This is a special bracket for vertical glass - strange, but apart from TrendVision, no other manufacturer thought about such a holder. It turns out that TrendVision TDR-718GP is the only registrar fully ready for installation in all kinds of trucks and special equipment.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d7/a0e/2bd/7d7a0e2bd6e0fceb8a537202608599d8.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another example of subsequent major improvements is TrendVision MR-710GP and TrendVision MR-712GP, recorders in the form of a lining on the rear-view mirror. Last year I managed to work with both models and was not entirely happy with the way the installation of polarizing filters was organized. In contrast to the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù TrendVision TDR-708GP and TDR-718GP models, the Polarics overlaid recorders were screwed onto the external threads of the lens. What is for reasons already voiced by me above is not entirely convenient. Yes, and wind on the lens installed in the recorder in the car - something else is fun. So, the developers did not stint on the new molds of the lens housing and remade it so that now the ‚Äúpeephole‚Äù is compatible with quick-detachable magnetic ‚Äúpolarizers‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0aa/696/c50/0aa696c505f005b8c44e8173b59971c4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Enough about hardware upgrades, TrendVision has something to boast about in software. So, in January 2016, the largest update was released, affecting almost all current models of the brand. In particular, users are pleased with the following things. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SpeedCam was created from scratch, a GPS-based warning system about approaching speed cameras, including Avtodoria. This is the most flexible in terms of SpeedCam settings among all registrars sold in Russia, the developers took into account all the wishes of motorists. Updating the database, depending on the number of new objects, occurs about once a month. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SpeedCam example on TrendVision TDR-718GP: </font></font><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhTRKS_AAje4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTRKS_AAje4</font></font></a> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The recorders with the highest resolution Super HD 1296p shooting have the highest bit rate increased from 18 to 26 Mbit / s for Super HD 1296p resolution. At the same time, an increased bitrate is available for microSD cards with a volume of 8-128 GB and SD cards with 8-32 GB. As before, for SD-cards with 64 and 128 GB, the bitrate is limited to 18 Mb / s. In addition, constant or variable bitrate is available in the tinctures. As you understand, the increase in bitrate has a very positive impact on improving the quality of video.</font></font><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uh2asBXSiaA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiLFpFT2558" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among other notable innovations: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Implemented WatchDog (overload) in case of failure due to a memory card or software failure. In the case of software or hardware failure, most recorders simply ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù or stop recording. Many users periodically notice that files are being lost or even recording was not made during the entire trip. Sometimes this is not even the fault of the registrar, but due to the failure of the memory card. WatchDog in TrendVision models works in two modes. If the failure occurred due to a slow memory card, the recorder will simply restart the recording. At the same time, he will say with a voice that ‚Äúthe recording has been stopped‚Äù, and after a few seconds - that ‚Äúthe recording has begun‚Äù. If there is a more serious failure, the recorder will completely reboot with power off.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Significantly improved the quality of the recorded sound. The menu adds the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the microphone ("low", "medium" or "high"). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Separately adjustable sharpness for day and night modes. Plus, smoother settings for sharpness and contrast in the menu. Prior to this, it was possible to set the exposure and resolution / mode separately (say, with or without HDR) for shooting day and night. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Adjustable recording duration by motion detection in the menu. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Slow Record Mode (TimeLapse). Can be used in the parking lot to save space on the memory card.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Improved the algorithm of the LDWS (departure from the lane) and FDWS (warning of a possible frontal collision). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the stock firmware from Ambarella in LDWS and FCWS "knocked down the sight", which is impossible to fix the usual calibration in the settings. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Other brands prefer to keep silent about it, and only TrendVision corrected errors. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Additionally, the minimum speed settings have been added for LDWS, after which the option starts to work - after all, it is useful mainly on highways, but not in a slow traffic flow within the city. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- In addition to the other four stamps, an azimuth stamp per frame has been added. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Added algorithm for non-cyclic recording when used as a home camcorder.</font></font><br><br><h2> <font color="#105e94"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We get acquainted: current line</font></font></font> </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company's arsenal totals 20 issued registrars, the most relevant among them are shown in the table below. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f8/d76/61e/2f8d7661e7c396911b83d0e5f28099e9.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's get acquainted with some devices closer. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I note that the letter ‚ÄúG‚Äù at the end of the model name means the presence of a GPS module, and ‚ÄúP‚Äù - the presence of a polarizing filter.</font></font><br><br><h2> <font color="#105e94"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TrendVision TDR-718GP</font></font></font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc7/39f/c8b/dc739fc8b040e1428d1eaf1c51818f73.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Top registrar, model of the "best of the best" category in a monoblock form factor. Includes all of the company's listed in this material, from having two batteries and a pair of memory card slots to shooting in Super HD with ultra-high bitrate and SpeedCam support. The model costs 14,500 rubles. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For 17,500, you can get TrendVision TDR-718GP ULTIMATE - this edition differs from the ‚Äúregular‚Äù model by having a 32GB microSD Samsung EVO memory card and TrendVision Power Control uninterruptible power supply for connecting the camera directly to a car battery. The last accessory will allow the registrar to conduct a parking survey when the car engine is muted and the power supply through the cigarette lighter socket is stopped.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I‚Äôll add that personally in the TrendVision TDR-718GP I am extremely impressed with the joystick, which reduced the number of buttons on the case to three pieces and seriously increased the convenience of controlling the recorder. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, in the model, you can click on the stop when playing video and using the zoom button and joystick to view the license plate of the car.</font></font><br><br><h2> <font color="#105e94"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TrendVision TDR-708P and TDR-708GP</font></font></font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/82e/aec/07f/82eaec07ff025c76fbb8a76a7f8d79cb.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As I have already noted, the company used the same author case in the two models, so that there is no difference in appearance and configuration between the devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only in the 708th the Ambarella A7LA30 processor is installed, so the maximum shooting resolution here is 1920 x 1080 pixels. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the same time we have all the same high-aperture lens and the flagship matrix. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The presence of warnings about speed cameras depends on whether you choose TrendVision TDR-708P for 10,500 rubles or TDR-708GP for 12,500 rubles - as you understand, support is provided in the second case. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Alternatively, you can purchase the TrendVision TDR-708P and purchase a GPS module separately, its price will be 2,200 rubles.</font></font><br><br><h2> <font color="#105e94"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TrendVision TDR-200</font></font></font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d34/f95/191/d34f95191d09322bc126a1216af38e28.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">An excellent state employee (for 6,500 rubles) - a miniature case, together with the mount, the model is just above the lighter. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"Iron" - a bunch of excellent processor AIT 8427, time-tested matrix OmniVision OV2710 with the largest pixel in the class and the lens with five glass lenses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The status of the most affordable recorder on the market with two memory card slots is attached.</font></font><br><br><h2> <font color="#105e94"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TrendVision MR-710GP</font></font></font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b03/27f/349/b0327f34921446d9dc22ef6e5025fe09.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the moment, this recorder has the most advanced on the market "stuffing" among the models in the form of a lining on the rearview mirror and surpasses most of the flagship competitors in the monoblock form factor. The top matrix and the processor are complemented by a high-aperture seven-lens (F = 1.6) lens, the result is practically the best night-time video recorder among the recorders. It uses virtually the same firmware as the TrendVision TDR-718GP, so the user will get the same full functionality as the owners of the model in the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù case.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Among the advantages of the model - a large 4.3-inch screen, anti-dazzle mirror coating, buttons with automatically turned off backlight and, of course, two slots for memory cards. There is a connector for connecting an analog rear view camera. The model costs 14,900 rubles, the TrendVision MR-710 version without a polarizer and a GPS receiver will cost 12,400 rubles. I will also mention TrendVision MR-712GP for 15,900 rubles in the same package, but with a rear-view camera in the kit, shooting on both channels is in Full HD resolution.</font></font><br><br><h2>  <font color="#105e94">Instead of conclusion</font> </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">TrendVision is the rarest example of a responsible and talented domestic developer of recorders, and in combination it is also one of the technical leaders of the industry. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is pleasant to realize that not all polymers are missed yet - TrendVision once again reminds its Russian market colleagues about the possibility of creating their own quality recorders without the involvement of Chinese specialists. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the way to the current models, the company had to face many difficulties, but diligence and endless enthusiasm allow TrendVision with each new model to demonstrate what Russian engineers are capable of.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392087/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392087/</a></p>
