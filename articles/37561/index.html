  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Yandex "lowered" me for 1000 rubles ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there was such an amusing incident connected with our beloved Yandex. <br><br>  About six months ago, in November-December 2007, I deposited 1,000 rubles into Yandex.Money account, it was about one in the morning Moscow time.  In the morning, when I decided to check the account, I found out that I didn‚Äôt get another extra thousand from my account, without hesitation I quickly leaked my two thousand and completely forgot about such a case.  It is worth making a small remark, I myself was wrong once and put amounts from 100 to 500 rubles to people‚Äôs phone bills and was always convinced that it was only my mistake and therefore I only had to blame myself, therefore I did not try to return money and did not write to people, like ‚Äúreturn me, please, my money‚Äù, etc., therefore in such a case I spent a thousand good conscience :) <br><br>  Half a year passed and in early August I needed to use my Yandex account again.  Went to Money, everything is in order, the wallet is working, I went and threw 2000 RUR.  I come, check the account and see the following message (not literally) ‚ÄúHalf a year ago, you accidentally credited the money you spent, so we block your wallet until we understand the situation, contact us ...‚Äù.  Of course, I was surprised, because this message appeared only when money appeared on the wallet, before that there was no sign of the ear.  Well, that's okay, I think, half a year ago I ‚Äúfound‚Äù a thousand, now I ‚Äúlose‚Äù - everything is fair.  I am writing a letter, please understand the situation.  I receive a reply letter in 24 hours, I go to Money and discover that not only the ‚Äúrandom‚Äù thousand were taken off me, but also mine, which was also considered an erroneous payment =) Again I was a little surprised, but I thought that with a company like Yandex will be solved quickly and easily, wrote a letter, describing completely the situation - from where and what thousand came from.  In principle, it was all the same to the thousand, not so much money, it was interesting how to decide everything.  But everything was decided simply - I did not receive a response letter from them, although I sent the letter a couple of times.
