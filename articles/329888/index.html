      - ACM President Vicki Lynn Hanson </blockquote><br>  So, this year, 46,381 people from 2,948 universities <a href="https://www.acm.org/articles/bulletins/2017/may/icpc-2017">participated</a> in all stages of the championship.  103 countries from six continents joined the competition.  The participants of the last stage had no more than 5 hours to solve the final series of problems - as a result, the ITMO University team won an absolute victory, having solved the most problems (10 out of 12 possible) with the least number of attempts and spending the least time on it. <br><br>  In addition to the champion title in the Olympiad, gold, silver and bronze medals are drawn (the first 12 teams are awarded).  This year, in addition to ITMO University, the teams of the University of Warsaw, Seoul University and St. Petersburg State University won this year.  In addition to the St. Petersburg teams, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (silver) and UrFU (bronze) were among the medalists from Russia. <br><br>  A total of 13 teams from Russia took part in the championship: 3 from St. Petersburg, another 3 from Moscow, one team from Novosibirsk, Saratov, Tomsk, Ekaterinburg, Samara, Perm and Petrozavodsk. <br><br>  In addition to the Warsaw University team, teams from China, Sweden (KTH) and the United States (MIT) were among our most formidable foreign rivals.  As a result, students of Chinese universities (University of Xinhua, Beijing and Fudan universities) took from 6th to 8th places, respectively (silver).  The Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden) won bronze (11th place), and MIT was only in the twentieth position (all the results of the championship finalists can be found <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/results">here</a> ). <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThese guys solve problems in three minutes.  This is unbelievable, and I like it, because this is what happens when guys are involved in problem solving, when they have resources, fuses, mentors, and they work on it throughout the whole year, ‚Äù <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/389644-russian-itmo-students-icpc-champions/">said</a> the finalists. championship executive director Bill Poucher. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6fe/472/b54/6fe472b542a74c7b8adec6b98293bf92.jpg"><br>  / Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/141939107%40N06/">icpcnews icpcnews</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a> <br><br><h2>  Problems </h2><br>  By the way, the intrigue in the championship remained until the very finals - as the winners themselves and their coach, Andrei Stankevich, <a href="https://www.rt.com/news/389644-russian-itmo-students-icpc-champions/">admit</a> , the ITMO University team had to compete with very strong rivals, and until the last it was not clear if any of them would have time to solve the 11th problem .  As the results of the competition showed, not a single team succeeded. <br><br>  Students from the School of Mining and Technology at the University of South Dakota (it was in this year's South Dakota that the championship final was held) in an interview with the local television station <a href="http://www.kotatv.com/content/news/Russian-team-tops-college-coding-contest-424198283.html">noted</a> that the tasks (these are also ‚Äúproblems‚Äù) were much more complicated than those they themselves .  This team solved only 2 problems. <br><br>  The students also complained that the methods of teaching sports programming at their university are very different from those that are used, in particular, by the Russian teams.  Abroad, the Russian programming school is really highly rated - for example, last year students of ITMO University were <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/which-universities-have-the-best-coders-in-the-word/">recognized as the</a> best programmers in the world according to the Hacker Rank platform. <br><br>  Returning to the problems: the most popular languages ‚Äã‚Äãin solving them were C ++ and Java.  The innovation of this year was the ability to solve problems in Python - as noted, this is a serious step for the championship (in terms of organizational procedures), but not for the participants themselves - there are not so many solutions in this language. <br><br>  By the way, all the problems that the championship finalists fought against can be tried to solve on their own - the text of the problems is <a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/worldfinals/problems">publicly available</a> .  In addition, the judges of the championship final prepared exemplary <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~austrin/icpc/finals2017solutions.pdf">solutions</a> .  By the way, the only problem unresolved during the championship final was a problem called Scenery (Problem H). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/329888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/329888/</a></p>
