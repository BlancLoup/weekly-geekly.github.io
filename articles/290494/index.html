Together with foreign large companies that are actively trying to enter our market, we found that over the past 4-5 years, a huge number of Russian companies have appeared, offering services for small and medium-sized online stores of various kinds.  There are niche platforms that sell only children's products, there are platforms for the sale of clothing or handmade goods.  In short, the market is flourishing and developing, despite the fall of the ruble and the economy as a whole. <br><br>  So what made us take on a project in such a competitive environment? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We must begin with the fact that a huge number of stores began its activities over the past five years.  Each of them, in fact, is a competitor of any other store of the same direction.  Sellers spend significant resources on advertising goods and attracting buyers.  Together with the expenses for hosting, website promotion, advertising groups in social networks and commissions at other sites, the store's income is reduced to zero.  At the same time there is no guarantee that the customer who bought something will return to the store again. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Moreover, sellers and trading platforms themselves are aimed at selling goods and generating income.  And this approach may seem the only correct one.  But we at OneMarkt think a little differently. <br><br>  We initially decided to focus on creating the right communication between the seller and the buyer.  Any user who visits OneMarkt should be confident in the stores represented on it.  We want to make it clear that our sellers are very responsive to sales and are ready to offer the best purchase conditions. <br><br>  At this stage of project development, we are trying to give each participant - the store its "face".  When you visit a fully completed store profile, the buyer will see that such a store has been running for a long time, it has a social.  pages, your site, customer reviews, special conditions for the purchase of goods and methods of payment.  At any time, he can directly contact the seller and ask him questions. <br><br>  The next stage of development will be functions aimed at the buyer.  He will be able not only to find out the current news of the stores and buy goods at prices that suit them, but also to play their roles in the life of various stores! <br><br>  We welcome all comments and reviews! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290494/</a></p>
