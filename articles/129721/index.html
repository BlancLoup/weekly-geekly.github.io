The future is represented by faktura and Zen-mani ... well, first things first. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d3b8461b/7792f5ca/385774b9/2f1b8377.jpg"><br><br>  So, I want to tell you about personal finance services with us and with them.

      Why do you need it?  First, to manage something you need to measure it.  For example, do you know <b>how much money you spend going</b> to cafes and restaurants?  Perhaps, if you cook at home, you can buy a car on credit.  Or vice versa, having refused to travel by car, dine in restaurants on weekends.  Secondly - planning.  In finance accounting services, you can easily <b>add large purchases</b> (mortgage, freshly holed HTC Mozart) and calculate when you can make them and how much you need to postpone. <br><br>  At the inception stage of accounting finance, fancy Windows-based programs for home accounting were popular, even Microsoft developed <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2118008">one of them</a> .  The user had to make all expenses and incomes manually, for example, <b>collecting checks</b> (coffee and buns $ 0.7, payment on a mortgage $ 200, gasoline $ 10). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>In 2006, the</b> <a href="http://www.ofx.net/">OFX (Open Financial Exchange)</a> working group, led by Intuit, released version 2.1 of the protocol for exchanging data on banking transactions.  This allowed various services to automatically receive data on spending on bank cards and accounts.  Currently, OFX format supports about 6,000 (!) Banks in the United States, including the largest players. <br><br>  Thanks to the comprehensive support of OFX and Internet banking in America, there are services like Yodlee that support 10,000 banks.  That is, practically, any American bank is supported by this system.  <b>It is enough to specify the name of the bank, your login and password, and information about your accounts, income and expenses are available for other Internet services.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8df360b7/2372e729/2c8dddfa/7494d90e.png"><br><br>  An interesting point, 30% of banks do not support OFX.  For them, data providers (Intuit, Yodlee) <b>emulate user actions in the Internet bank</b> .  It takes your login / password and reads transactions from the Internet bank.  According to the same Yodlee: "We have allocated 150 people in the <i>Indian office</i> to connect new banks and maintain the health of the old ones." <br><br>  <b>In 2007, the</b> revolution ended with the advent of the free Mint service.  Simple Americans with the help of this service in two clicks add any accounts in banks ... and the magic begins. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cc92e613/34e8920e/75077243/30301c3b.jpg"><br>  The service <b>automatically picks up all the</b> incomes, expenses, loans, deposits, funds, lays them out into categories (food, gas, clothes, cars ...) and builds beautiful graphics.  And remember that all this is done in one click, you do not need to enter anything manually!  Considering that 90% of American spending and income passes through bank accounts and cards, we get the <b>perfect account of personal finances</b> . <br><br>  In addition, Mint has an interesting feature - restrictions.  Enter a limit on a caf√© of 5,000 rubles a month and when you sit in Starbucks you will receive an SMS message ‚ÄúYou have reached your limit on restaurants‚Äù and go sad and without coffee until the end of the month :) <br><br>  This is the beauty that happens in America, but this is <b>past</b> , Mint has existed for 5 years, has 1,400,000 active users and the founders have successfully put a large amount of money in their pockets. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/ea723898/8c43878f/182c65ec/8b183ddf.jpg"><br><br>  Talk about the future?  <b>About the future accounting of finances in Russia</b> . <br><br>  To date, 0.9 cards per person have been issued in Russia and only 5% of transactions have been completed with their help.  Although if you take Peter and Moscow, then probably all 20%. <br><br>  The question that worried me so much when writing this article: should we wait for good robots to carefully consider our expenses?  And then I personally get tired of manually taking into account all purchases. <br><br>  Judging by the data on the Internet, <b>none of the banks support OFX</b> and, in general, they are not going to: (Of the services that may become the future of Yodlee or Intuit, <a href="http://faktura.ru/">Faktura</a> may become. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8a7efea4/7114551e/23226c92/46c791ba.gif"><br><br>  The company provides a ready Internet bank for financial institutions, at the moment it serves <b>270 banks throughout Russia</b> .  But he does not even plan to provide access to third-party services.  It would seem that there are no prerequisites for the appearance of the Russian Mint. <br><br>  On the other hand, there are a lot of online personal accounting services in Russia: Homemoney, Easy Finance, 4 envelopes, Junk, beta FiniMani and others.  But none of these services set the goal of automating accounting, users humbly consider their expenses manually. <br><br>  We in <a href="http://zenmoney.ru/">Zen-mani</a> set the main goal of <i>automatic</i> accounting of finances. <br><br>  At the moment, six not very popular banks (VTB24, Citibank, Bank St. Petersburg, Bank 24 ru, Khanty-Mansiysk Bank and Master Bank) have been automated, automation has been implemented through parsing email alerts from the bank.  Although accounting takes place automatically, it requires a call to the bank (often this service is also paid) and manual addition of all accounts. <br><br>  The accounting of Alpha and Raiffeisen works semi-automatically through the parsing of Internet bank pages, although this is similar to the principle of operation of American data providers, but it is still inconvenient - each time you have to go to the Internet bank page and start parsing manually.  Well, the bonus is fully automatic accounting Yandex. Money. <br><br>  Unfortunately, this is just the beginning.  And the banks with which we constantly communicate, do not go to a meeting, do not understand why they need it.  Although it is not clear why?  What is bad that a user will be able to open his financial data to external services?  After all, then in Russia will be able to appear many wonderful projects, and people will become wiser to manage their finances. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129721/</a></p>
