  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Management tools: mind map ‚ÄúFormula of working with people‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At one of my first trainings, one of the managers present asked a question: <br><br><blockquote>  - Alexander, but this is the situation.  I return from vacation and find that, while I was away, my boss fired my key employee.  You, as an expert, think that this is normal or not? </blockquote><br><br>  When they call me an expert, you need to understand the effect.  I feel very pleased, I get off the ground, the brain turns off and then the flow of words begins.  (If you want to set up an experiment, go to the speaker at any conference after the report and say something like: ‚ÄúThank you, I liked your report very much. Here you are, as an expert, as you think ...‚Äù Then you can ask anything, but the person will no longer with you. We therefore ask you never to contact us as experts.)

      In general, I suffered ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  - Of course, not right.  This is micro-management, and in general ... </blockquote><br><br>  Then I began to use words like ‚Äúnot ethical‚Äù and other capacious, as it seemed to me, definitions.  In general, did not restrain himself.  I was emotional and convincing, as it seemed to me. <br><br>  As it turned out later in the evening, the head was sitting at the same training.  It was the CEO of the company that invited me.  Well, he is a calm man, he did not immediately kick me out.  And we even still communicate with him sometimes.  But the situation was unpleasant. <br><br>  And the main trouble was that I spoke out categorically, not knowing the context of the situation, the story, or the reasons that led to this behavior of the boss.  And the reason ‚Äúhe is an idiot‚Äù is not the only one that can be, right? <br><br>  When you work for a long time in a good company and read several books on management, you have a very complete picture of the world: it should be like this (well, or as Demarco said, Spolsky or someone else).  And life is richer. <br><br>  In short, over the years, I had to be very careful.  And now, before answering the question, you have to ask about 10 clarifying questions. <br><br>  In the end, we all clothed the intellect with a map.  And they painted there not only the mechanisms for solving situations with people and changing their behavior patterns, but also: <br><ul><li>  Daily work with people to be done </li><li>  Regular work with the management and the customer, which should be done </li><li>  Mechanisms manager inputs to the team (or enter a new person in the team) </li><li>  ... </li></ul><br><br>  Because the absence of all this often leads to problems with people who are baffling experts. <br><br>  We called the intellect card ‚ÄúFormula of working with people‚Äù - it seems to be like about people, but within the framework of a certain system: <br><ul><li>  <a href="">Formula for working with people (.mind)</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Formula for working with people (.mm)</a> </li><li>  <a href="">Formula for working with people (.mmap)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://stratoplan.ru/pmf/stratoplan_pmformula.xmind">Formula for working with people (.xmind)</a> </li></ul><br><br>  We do not post in pdf, because the map turned out to be huge, it was not possible to unfold it beautifully and fit even A2 into the format. <br><br>  By the very intelligence of the map prepared a video with the analysis of what we have laid in it.  The video was not too short (1 hour and 16 minutes), but a) ahead of the weekend :) b) it‚Äôs better with explanations than without them. <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/87799379&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgUPo_1ndTgcdh_NZBSe4BGOI47IQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Formula for working with people" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We hope that this will be useful to you.  And if you consider yourself experts :) and / or just have something to add - send your thoughts in the form of an intelligence card.  We will complement the picture of working with people. <br><br>  Successes! <br><br>  Alexander Orlov <br>  Stratoplan.Ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214171/</a></p>
