Apple presentation at WWDC 2019</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/c1/ao/apc1aochqgfcyjpz_1qj9mx4qiy.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Today in San Jose, on the first day of its conference, Apple held a big presentation with all the software updates.  Five thousand journalists and developers gathered to find out what updates are waiting for them iOS and macOS.  The action turned out quite impressive, and lasted two and a half hours - many times longer than the usual annual presentations of the iPhone and iPad.  And before him in the audience staged a beautiful show.  Illumination were only three giant black screens on which different light animations were shown. </p><br><p>  Slightly shorter, with an eye to the developers and their interesting reviews / impressions, I already wrote about WWDC 2019 <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/454428/">here</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dydus0x14/" class="user_link">dydus0x14</a> .  Recommended for reading.  We have a little less about developers, but a little more about everything else.  With details and in the order of the presentation, as they <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/423095/">used to</a> . <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/om/wc/x1/omwcx1klbahvgnfakt3lrjujfro.jpeg"><br><br><p>  It all started with a black and white sad video about the work of iOS-developers who do not sleep at night and do not take care of their eyes, in time to make the applications we need.  Then came the happy Tim Cook.  He told that the developers make this world a better place, and that this is the main support of the company.  Once again he told about the gradual transition of Apple to the model ‚ÄúIron + Soft + Services‚Äù.  Recalled the Apple Arcade with games that will be available later this year.  It will have 100 more games!  True, the price of the subscription did not name.  The same with the Apple Card: will be available this summer, so far no details. </p><br><p>  But told about the new series for Apple TV.  It will be For All Mankind's science fiction from Ronald Moore, known for his work on the Star Trek and The Star Cruiser TV series Galactica.  They showed the clip, it looks interesting: an alternative story in which the Soviet Union first landed on the moon, and then began to colonize it.  Given the recent <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/pochtoy/blog/430236/">statements by NASA</a> , the topic is again relevant. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/xp/3v/hnxp3vwsgxabhfz0htdr-4sajpm.jpeg"><br>  <i>USSR puts the flag on the moon</i>

    <p>  After stories about updates to Apple TV (the main thing: they can now be controlled from the Xbox and PS4 gamepads), the main thing finally began. </p><br><h2>  Apple Watch </h2><br><p>  The company produces a large update - watchOS 6. A lot of new screens (gradients, large numbers, analog, solar and others).  New ringing sounds (and quiet mode, where the dial tone is felt only by your hand).  The appearance of audiobooks and voice notes.  Improved calculator - capable of counting, for example, tips or how much everyone owes for lunch. </p><br><p>  Applications on the clock now work independently of applications on the iPhone.  The developers got the Runtime API for longer data reading by applications, the Audio API for accessing music streaming services like Outcast and Pandora.  The App Store also appears on the clock.  Applications can be installed directly on the clock.  The application icon and the text of its name occupy approximately the entire screen. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fb/pn/ku/fbpnkuzblwln2egakmokk14jzcg.jpeg"><br><br><p>  In terms of health - in watchOS 6 appears the function of tracking activity over time.  You can see if you have started running more or less with graphs and analysis.  You can even see the average speed of your movement.  If the schedule goes down, the clock begins to cheer, they say, even a little bit, you will succeed. </p><br><p>  Another Apple Watch attended to the health of our ears.  He will say if you are in a too loud, unsafe place, and will offer to keep your eardrums.  Decibels are displayed on the screen. </p><br><p>  Well and tracking cycles for women.  It will tell you when your period should begin or when your fertility period begins. </p><br><h2>  iOS 13 </h2><br><p>  We talked about how awesome iOS 12 was (97% of user approval, 85% accepted the transition - compared to 10% for Android 9).  iOS 13 will be even faster, and will require less memory on devices with Super Retina screens.  For example, Face ID scans are now 30% faster.  Applications will be stored differently, they will be 50% less, and updates for them will be 60% less.  This will allow applications on iOS devices to run about twice as fast. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wx/db/g9/wxdbg9vg_duxv7ttmvovgmverho.jpeg"><br><br><p>  One of the main new features was the Dark Mode.  All Apple apps and screens can now be black, down to messages, keyboards, news, and a calendar.  This reduces the impact of the screen on the eyes, saves energy, plus "looks cool."  The audience screeching and cheering. </p><br><p>  Joked about the fact that the team of Apple began to work emo.  Showed dozens of applications, camera, music, and so on.  It's funny that for Apple this is such a giant and high-performance feature when dark themes have been present in Android from time immemorial. </p><br><p>  Minor improvements for Safari, Mail and Notes.  Full processing of reminders, to the point that the system itself understands when you should be reminded, so it is not necessary to drive in a date (only if the system is mistaken).  Updated and improved maps - completely for the United States in 2019, some other countries a little later (Russia - hardly).  There was, for example, the function of "binoculars", just like Google Street View.  For this, Apple has traveled all over the country, and says that its data will be more accurate than that of the "competitors". </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/gm/oi/spgmoioxb39t3dhxax7vba3bmdy.jpeg"><br><br><p>  We talked about improving the security of the platform, there was a whole section on privacy.  At the same time on the word "security" showed the Telegram logo. </p><br><p>  Applications will not be able to access your location via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  A button will appear ‚ÄúConnect with Apple‚Äù - like ‚ÄúConnect with Facebook‚Äù and ‚ÄúConnect with Google‚Äù, only without tracking and other nonsense.  A new account can be created with Face ID, without revealing any personal information.  You can select the option to hide your e-mail, and Apple will create for you a random address from which you will be sent letters.  The address may be different for each application or site.  The random address feature can be disabled at any time. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ms/cx/pc/mscxpcemyuil3cb1qwtbkxf4iai.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Improved Posts.  Now when you send text to someone, they will automatically receive your name and photo.  Also new memodzhi and stickers, hundreds of them. </p><br><p>  Recycled camera, new portraits, new gallery - with machine learning, removing duplicates and "junk" photos.  New photo editing functionality, almost at the level of free Lightroom.  Updated gallery mode "By Month", able to collect photos and videos by event, and even classify them.  Click on your last birthday - it will give you the opportunity to go and see your previous birthdays, for example. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1q/bb/0f/1qbb0f8oz3o8il2yrwfsti2x8lo.jpeg"><br><br><p>  New features are very, very much (not even all are listed here).  The update promises to be interesting. </p><br><h2>  iPadOS </h2><br><p>  Finally untie the iPad from the iPhone.  Now they are two different ecosystems.  Work with the iPad will be more convenient.  They reworked a lot, starting from the home screen and ending with the addition of special modes and functions that the iPhone does not have.  For example, several simultaneously open windows on one screen in which you can work.  Many new gestures and movements to control this mode, copy data from one application to another, and so on. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ts/aw/oi/tsawoiyrov1jd9sx33tkjf8akri.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The main thing is that the iPad will now be able to natively support flash drives and SD cards, that is, you just have to insert them, and the data from them will immediately appear in the "Files" section.  You can even import photos directly into Lightroom. </p><br><p>  Improved Safari browser for iPad, made it more like a desktop.  Added a download manager, 30 new hot keys, text size changes, settings for individual sites, photo upload functions. </p><br><p>  Copying and pasting data on the iPad becomes more convenient: ‚Äúpinch‚Äù a file or a piece of text with three fingers, transfer it to the right place, open three fingers.  And with two fingers, you can reduce the keyboard and place it somewhere in the corner (a similar function has long been in Chrome OS). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/wk/li/h5wkliwrxyuzpt6niwvy1ty3nri.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Improved and Apple Pencil: now the delay is not 20 ms, but 9 ms, added functions.  The tool palette can finally be moved to any place on the screen.  Opened PencilKit for third-party developers so that they can use the pen features in their applications. </p><br><p>  IPad owners should be happy: Apple says bluntly that, although most of the functions and applications will come with iOS, it now intends to take full advantage of the large screen and powerful hardware.  With the keyboard connected, the iPad Pro is already approaching the territory of the laptops. </p><br><p>  The release date of the iPadOS, by the way, was never given. </p><br><h2>  Mac pro </h2><br><p>  The main thing on this presentation (at least for Apple).  Despite the fact that WWDC 2019 is about software, many rumors and leaks knew that this time the company would decide to update the Mac line.  The presentation was made as epic as possible, not even all iPhones deserved such a scene.  In appearance - one-in-one as a grater for vegetables.  Large stainless steel turret with a handle and a bunch of holes.  Opens in front and behind for free access. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d8/to/1d/d8to1dq6kbheo9wxl6a7l7lmx08.gif"><br><br><p>  Inside - an Intel Xeon processor, up to 28 cores.  It needs 300 watts of power, and so the Mac Pro has such a massive radiator - to give the processor a turn.  RAM - up to 1.5 TB;  8 PCI slots.  Mini headphone jack (lol), four USB ports, two Thunderbolt ports, two 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectors. </p><br><p> The video card is standard, but it can be replaced with any one with power up to 500 W (including from Apple itself).  There are no coolers in the case for it, instead - a huge radiator.  Apple says you can connect two AMD Radeon Pro Vega 2 Duo, and get, in fact, four video cards. </p><br><p>  For video editing - new card: Afterburner.  A hardware FPGA ASIC that can handle up to 6 billion pixels per second.  It can handle three 8K video streams and up to 12 4K video streams. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/dg/bz/ckdgbzwliispcg2_m4thnvjxz3i.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Mac Pro Power Supply - 1.4 kW (audience shocks).  Three large fans, blowing the case.  9 cubic meters of air flow per minute - but, according to Apple, quite quiet. </p><br><p>  New Mac Pro support has already been announced by Adobe, Autodesk, Sefi, Red, Epic, Avid, SideFX, Blackmagic, Unity, Pixar, Maxon and dozens of other companies.  To check the device on the stage, the processing of 1000 audio tracks simultaneously was turned on, the audience was impressed.  Then they started processing three videos in 8K and HDR, ‚Äú100 million pixels per second‚Äù, which the machine also coped with without any problems. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/io/ak/bzioakhambibule1_d80fpxew0q.jpeg"><br><br><p>  All this was done on the display, made in the same "vegetable cutting" style of Mac Pro.  And yes - this is also a new display from Apple.  Called Pro Display XDR.  Began to tell his characteristics: </p><br><ul><li>  diagonal - 32 inches; </li><li>  Resolution - 6016x3284, 6K Retina; </li><li>  HDR support; </li><li>  40% more than the iMac 5K display. </li></ul><br><p>  The P3 color space is about 25% wider than sRGB, the color depth is 10 bits (however, this was already in previous Apple displays).  Wide viewing angle, 25% improved contrast, new coating that reduces reflections.  All LEDs are factory calibrated, with a bunch of modulators providing the right light.  Peak display brightness - up to 1600 cd / m2, better than most TVs.  Usually works on 1000 cd / m2.  The contrast is 1,000,000: 1. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/ok/ty/kloktybpskqxm-89att2ldbzll8.jpeg"><br><br><p>  The entire back side of the screen is one big radiator.  It feels like you can't do without air conditioning in a room with it and with a Mac Pro even in winter.  Apple says one Mac Pro can connect up to six such displays.  All of them can spin and rotate on the stand, to become in portrait mode.  They can be removed from the stand, hung on the wall on the VESA mount. </p><br><p>  The price of the display is $ 4,999.  Stand under it - MORE $ 1000 (crazy?).  VESA mount - $ 199.  Apparently, Apple has such a justification that Sony‚Äôs televisions ‚Äúunder directors‚Äù cost $ 43,000. But still, five thousand for a monitor is somehow expensive. </p><br><p>  Price Mac Pro in the standard configuration (32 GB of RAM, 8-core Xeon, video card Radeon 580x, 256 GB SSD) - $ 5999.  Sales start this fall. </p><br><h2>  macOS </h2><br><p>  This part was <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/454428/">painted</a> <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/dydus0x14/" class="user_link">dydus0x14</a> , it makes no sense to repeat (his article just came out when I write this part).  Moreover, we still supply gadgets, not software.  In short - a new macOS called Catalina.  Applications break out of iTunes, now, as is the case with the iPad, they are made specifically for Macs.  Revealed Apple Music, Apple Podcasts and Apple TV.  The music program looks exactly like iTunes, but without the extra features.  It uses machine learning to recommend podcasts to you. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ag/ko/ww/agkoww_eqnbtak7q2u5mkel2dpg.jpeg"><br><br><p>  Apple TV without a sidebar, but with support for 4K HDR and Dolby Vision, the ability to customize the top-end sound (whether it is needed for a MacBook speaker is another question).  New Sidecar feature for using the iPad as a second display for Macs.  For example, for drawing on a poppy through the Apple Pencil. </p><br><p>  On Macs, like on iOS, Voice Control appeared, computer control is completely in voice.  Find My will help you find the lost device, and Activation Lock will block the MacBook, just like the iPhone, so there‚Äôs no point in stealing it. </p><br><p>  To help develop applications for the Mac, they launch the Catalyst project (previously known under the codename "Marzipan").  This is a simple port of applications from iPad.  Just click the Mac checkbox in Xcode.  Support for the cursor and windows is added automatically; other functions can be customized.  IOS developers are now becoming Mac developers too. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-r/vj/tb/-rvjtbecf3hckrxsiweddwbu1w8.jpeg"><br><br><p>  As usual, they talked about expanding support for AR, showed several games, including Minecraft in the real world ‚Äî building entire virtual buildings on their desk.  Capturing movements allows your little avatar to repeat your gestures exactly.  The world of Minecraft can also be enlarged - and then you can walk in these constructed buildings yourself.  The toy is the coolest, although all this could be shown and more interesting: the scene is empty, two adults (who hardly played Minecraft) are playing with a smartphone, nothing happens on the stage, the whole action is on the screen.  The public, among which completely adult developers and journalists, slowly starts to get bored. </p><br><p>  New SwiftUI framework.  With a preview of how the application looks.  And performing any action in the preview also changes the code in real time.  In one click, we can install it on our smartphone, test it.  The people shout and clap, finally the developers are happy. </p><br><p>  Tim Cook comes out again.  Announces that developers beta (watchOS, iOS, macOS, tvOS, iPadOS) are starting today.  Beta for everyone else - in July.  Release this fall.  Thank you all, applause.  Hooray! </p><br><p>  <b>PS</b> For delivery of goods from the USA use Pochtoy.com!  Now we also bring a <a href="https://www.pochtoy.com/sweets/">variety of sweets</a> from the US, from $ 5.99 per package. </p><br> <a href="http://bit.ly/PochtoyHABR"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pj/fo/ax/pjfoax1xtn_vz9bwmnhvl7jbmec.jpeg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454682/</a></p>
