The Internet has made information more accessible, but also increased the speed of the spread of myths.  For example, in many films you can find information that the brain works only by 10%, and if you increase this figure, then you will discover superpowers.  One of these films is Witch Mountain or the new film Lucy. <br><br>  1. Does brain size matter? <br>  2. The effect of alcohol on brain cells. <br>  3. Can drugs cause physical changes in the brain? <br>  4. How many neurons in the human brain? <br>  5. Is it true that we only use the brain at 10%? <br>  6. Your abilities depend on which hemisphere you have developed? <br>  7. Do you think that a person has five senses?  Is it so? <a name="habracut"></a>

But our lack of understanding gave rise to a great many myths about him over the years. <br><br>  1. For example, "the more the better."  While this may be true for some other organs, it is enough to look at the brain of the sperm whale, which is almost 6 times larger than the human one, to make sure that this is just a myth.  Yes, they are, of course, intelligent animals, but their cognitive skills fade compared to ours. <br><br>  2. Was it a fun night?  Don't worry, alcohol doesn't really kill brain cells.  Although it harms him and creates problems in the transfer of messages between neurons, the damage is mostly reversible. <br><br>  3. Similarly, drugs, in fact, do not create holes in your brain.  Although some of them can permanently change the function and structure of your brain, the only thing that can make a hole in your brain is physical trauma. <br><br>  4. Is it good that you have 100 billion brain cells - or not?  Surprisingly, it was so until 2009, until scientists discovered that the real figure is close to 86 billion.  Of course, this may seem like a small difference, but those 14 billion neurons can form a whole brain for a baboon.  And if you look at these numbers in a broad context, 1 million seconds is 12 days, and 1 billion seconds is 31 years.  So the difference of 14 billion neurons cannot be, after all, so insignificant. <br><br>  5. Despite this, we cannot use them all, right?  Most science fiction films and books tell us that people can use only about 10% of the brain ... which is absolute nonsense.  Thanks to modern brain scanning technology, we know that we use it all - constantly!  Not necessarily all at once: when you, for example, go, parts of the brain associated with movement are more active than other areas.  However, there is no part of the brain that simply does nothing.  It represents 3% of total body weight and consumes 20% of all energy.  What a brain - a hard worker! <br><br>  6. But we tend to use one hemisphere more often than the other, right?  Nope  Perhaps you were convinced that if you think logically or analytically, you are more using the left part, and if creatively or intuitively, then the right part is absolutely not true.  Despite the fact that different hemispheres of the brain are actually used to perform certain functions, for example, it uses the left hemisphere, and the right hemisphere helps to read emotions - studies of thousands of people have not found any evidence that any person has the left or right hemisphere.  In other words, you use both sides equally. <br><br>  7. And you really do not have five senses, as you have always been told - in fact, there are many more!  For example, nociception, which is a sense of pain, or proprioception, a sense of position in space.  Not to mention the sense of balance, temperature and time. </div></div><br><br>  Those wishing to refute theses in the video, I recommend immediately to look for links to peer-reviewed journals.  At least I found confirmations of all theses in peer-reviewed journals, did not add to motivate people to use Google. <br><br>  And as usual you can offer an interesting video for translation and voice acting in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362021/</a></p>
