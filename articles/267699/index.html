Sometimes the anxiety caused by them reaches such proportions that it begins to affect the results of labor: physically you sit and do one thing, and with the mind you are anywhere but not in this task. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To calm the mind, as they say in the ancient <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B">Vedas</a> , in particular in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2585%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Bahavad-gita</a> , "is more difficult than calm the wind."  Everyone finds their own way to curb stress.  My choice was yoga - the way through which one can learn to achieve this natural calmness of mind, concentration, and purposefulness.  I will tell you about my experience of yoga from the point of view of a programmer of a company engaged in development outsourcing in this article.  I hope, I will manage to be not only useful, but also to find on Habr√© those who share my views, like, for example, these wonderful gentlemen:

I am 32 years old, I am the technical director of EDISON.  Married, no children.  I help my mother - except for me, she has no relatives in the city.  I practice yoga and spiritual practice based on ancient Vedic knowledge.  In childhood and adolescence was keen on live music, theatrical performances, electronics, tennis and snowboarding.  I lead a healthy lifestyle, which automatically follows from yoga.  At least should follow if we are talking about real yoga, and not about fitness under the brand of yoga. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75f/978/4b3/75f9784b327a4c32af636a470c59671b.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="18bde0">How yoga helps me to live</font> </h2><br>  To answer this question, I ask myself - what is stopping me from living?  To help yoga, it is necessary that something hinders, right?  With my pace of life, as I think, and in many in the modern world, I was bothered by stress, insomnia, even depression.  And most of all - various disturbances of the mind, because you constantly think about all sorts of problems, problem solving, everyday and professional affairs;  hurry, but you still do not have time.  And with a restless mind it is impossible to do anything qualitatively.  After all, if you are in constant stress, then the activity takes place unconsciously: you go to work by inertia, do household chores, even communicate with friends - all life is by inertia.  There is no time and desire to really think and concentrate.  But there is a way. <br><br>  Harmony is one of the key concepts in yoga.  It was surprising to note that the ancient treatises that describe the yoga system contain wisdom that is applicable in all areas of my life, be it health, material prosperity, success in business, the achievement of life goals.  Acting contrary to the law of nature and being under stress, it was impossible to achieve meaningful success in any of the spheres of life, because it was not possible to make the right decisions.  Everyone has this experience when we make a hasty decision in a state of anger, passion, or vice versa apathy.  Later we understand that the decision was wrong, and our future depends on the decisions.  And by and large the decision is all we can do, this is the only thing that is in our power.  So, the yoga system as a whole allows me to have a calm mind in order to make the right decisions, on which success in my life depends. <br>  Why was the restless mind my problem? <br><br>  Being engaged in intellectual work, I often could not fully concentrate on one goal, scattered my attention between different tasks at the same time.  I am sure that many programmers had experience of such deep meditation while working, when you try to write some kind of code block or solve an interesting algorithmic problem - you can spend hours concentrating on this task, while obtaining excellent results and pleasure.  Any yogi will envy such a state of deep immersion!  But this happens rarely, and only when it is very interesting;  when you are not just doing your favorite thing, but also the specific task is fascinating;  and when no one distracts.  But most often the opposite: distraction of attention, switching from one task to another, and as a result - the day has passed, and not a single task has been completely solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/28a/5a1/a9c28a5a18754b289cf9e8bc786986db.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="18bde0">How I came to yoga</font> </h2><br>  I was invited by a friend for a trial lesson in a yoga studio - just to see, try exercises and asanas.  I went and realized that I have a certain inclination towards this, flexibility of the body.  At that time I was engaged in big tennis, and physical activity was, but rather rough.  And here I felt that this is a more subtle study of the muscles and joints of the body.  It became interesting to me.  I started practicing Hatha Yoga tightly with a trainer 2 times a week. <br>  After classes, there was a pleasant lightness and a sense of internal and external balance.  And even then, when at work I performed ordinary actions, I naturally performed various asanas.  Leaning into the nightstand for something, I did an exercise on balancing my actions: for example, standing on one leg and pulling the other.  It was pleasant, there was a feeling of a general rise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a78/b7c/d0b/a78b7cd0b71a424e9a25e17b1f7891dd.jpg"><br><br>  I cannot say that I consciously came to yoga, considering that I have a restless mind or something like that.  I already understood this after the fact, I realized the problem when I began to get rid of it.  And the fact that a restless mind is a problem became clear when I saw the difference between my usual state and the state that is achieved with the help of yoga.  For the first time it became noticeable when, at the end of classes, you had to just lie on the floor and not think about anything, how to meditate on emptiness.  The mind immediately began to rush about, think about some plans, digest the events of this day, jump from one thought to another.  Hold consciousness on one thing was impossible. <br><br><h2>  <font color="18bde0">How exactly does yoga soothe the mind?</font> </h2><br>  Now there will be a small excursion into the Vedic philosophy, and for a person with a rational mind, this may not seem very convincing.  But this is really my experience, I feel it, it works.  I will try to explain in more simple words. <br><br>  According to Vedic science, there are several streams of vital air in the body.  Health and well-being are based on ensuring that these flows are balanced.  When we get sick, it means that the flows are unbalanced, they fail.  In addition to the streams of vital air, there are three more qualities of material nature (guna) that are present in everything: in the body, mind, food, and the environment.  These are the three "qualities" of our energy activities: the mode of goodness, the mode of passion, the mode of ignorance.  Yoga aims to bring people from the third and second levels to the first - the level of goodness.  This is a level where a person can be happy at a given moment in time, and not when he reaches something;  a level where he does not need external sources of joy, but only internal ones.  There are also energy centers in the body (chakras) - yoga directs energy from the lowest to the highest center. <br><br>  Yoga is a very intuitive and, by the way, understandable science.  It is logical that if energy is retained in the lower layers, then we get a lower quality of happiness.  The mode of goodness, for example, is associated with higher energy centers.  Yoga helps direct attention to these energy layers and manage them.  And as a result - to bring the consciousness to a higher level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="18bde0">External</font> </h2><br>  Exercise and relaxation in hatha yoga is only one of the instruments of external influence on the mind and body.  Breathing is also important here, since so-called energy flows exist in the body.  If we learn to manage them harmoniously, then our whole body, and first of all the mind, comes to harmony and the absence of constant anxiety.  The various postures of the body in yoga (asanas) are also aimed at streamlining the internal flows, and not only air (blood, movement of other fluids). <br><br>  Nutrition is also important, because ‚ÄúI am what I eat,‚Äù but I didn‚Äôt like to see myself as just a firebox, into which I would shower something, if only some energy would appear, no matter what quality.  Nutrition affects not only the physical condition, but also the feelings, moods, even worldview.  In other words - to mind.  Remember this feeling, when after heavy and plentiful food it is impossible to work and think about something, but you want to lie down and sleep.  What is the performance here? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12b/acd/76c/12bacd76c5544a2798b0fdf6874f1af7.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="18bde0">Internal</font> </h2><br>  Inner yoga is the work that aims to develop a certain mentality.  The purpose of this inner spirit is to act not contrary to the laws of nature, body, mind, but in harmony with them.  In ordinary life, we cannot change the laws of nature for ourselves, it means one way out - to act in harmony with them.  If you act against them, then you act against yourself.  Results: diseases of the body and mind, problems, difficulties and general dissatisfaction with life.  Developing this mindset allows you to achieve that very calm and concentration.  This gave a sense of purpose, the ability not to be distracted by many things, but to do the work to which I dedicate myself at a given point in time. <br><br>  Such an action in harmony with the laws of nature opens up a lot of potential in me and releases internal energy.  It became clear that it is senseless to look for a source of energy to the outside - it is inside of me initially, just need to find and correctly direct this energy.  This is akin to the martial art of aikido, where the power of the enemy is used against him: when you are attacked, you redirect his kinetic energy in such a way that it is not you who got this blow, but return to it.  So in this approach: there is energy and potential belonging to nature, which we cannot be stronger than, but we can direct this energy in a convenient way for us.  To do this, you just need to be in harmony with nature. <br>  What does this give in the work? <br><br>  With yoga, it became easier for me to meet various problems and minor difficulties that arise in life.  Every time I stopped panicking and worrying, because I knew calmly that there was a solution, and its quality depended on the state in which I would receive it.  And this feeling of inner balance, calmness, regularity, which leads to a ‚Äúcold‚Äù mind when making a decision, was the important first fruit of yoga.  It remains to them now. <br><br>  Yoga allows me to expand my mind without any chemical means, without intoxication.  What does it mean to expand consciousness?  When I look back at my life before practice, I realize that I existed like a robot, like a rat in a cage.  I ran around the circle, not understanding why I was doing this - simply by inertia.  There was not even a goal in life.  Parents said: ‚ÄúHow to live?  And we live like this. ‚Äù  And I lived simply because it was said so, according to custom.  But I was not happy.  Now I see my mistakes, the reasons for this state.  This helps my consciousness to develop, to look wider at the world.  In addition, it allows me to understand the behavior of many people and the reasons for my own actions.  Thanks to this science (and I boldly call the yoga system a science), I now understand how this world works, what causes the various actions of people. <br>  I will be glad to talk and answer questions in the comments and on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/edsdru">our Facebook page</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://www.edsd.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d2/9f5/c4e/0d29f5c4eb324393af460af6a50bc5d1.jpg" width="400"></a> <br><br>  About company: <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/267569/">Software design</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/267671/">Software development: stages and principles</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/271495/">The tester is responsible for everything</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/267675/">Software support</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/267699/">How yoga kodit and live helps: personal experience</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/268009/">We teach employees English: the experience of Edison</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/edison/blog/268977/">Mental Labor and Physical Education</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267699/</a></p>
