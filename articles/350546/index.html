"Network Basics".  "Products in the field of wireless local networks."  Eddie Martin  December 2012 </h4><br>  So, we will look at our offers on the site and we will begin with wireless technologies.  Our go-strategy on the site is <a href="http://www.cisco.com/go/wireless">www.cisco.com/go/wireless</a> .  And again, our portfolio falls apart here, let's choose wireless access points. <br><br>  We'll talk first about Aironet's premium access points and again remind you that the technology of these access points was acquired along with Airspace.  But the product line itself and its name is our business. <br><br>  If you pay attention, the Model 3600 has 4x4 MiMo, which means that it has 4 receivers and 4 transmitters for spatial streams.  And the point can transmit three streams at once, providing a speed of 450 megabits per second.  It turns out, you still have one more stream in reserve, for redundancy and reliability. <br><br>  Let me explain a little by MiMO - this is multiple input and output, which has the ability to send the same signal in several ways, to create spatial streams.  I repeat that you can have one antenna and you will not be able to receive a spatial stream if you do not have MiMo.  In this case, we have 4 spatial streams.  If a client has only one radio antenna and this is a g-client, then using Client Link technology will ensure the arrival of all 3 signals simultaneously and one stream will be improved with which the client is able to work.  We have already talked about this before.  But it can not go all about one client.  Our access points can serve up to 50 clients in one room. <br><br>  So, the model 3600 is one of the premium class access points.  Please note that it is modular and it can be upgraded.  The modular design of our radio antennas and our capabilities allow us to support the next generation of technologies that ensure wireless network security and spectral analysis.  The chips that we put in there can be replaced with the best ones.  That is, you do not have to buy new access points, you can simply improve them.  Such access points have many slots inside.  This access point supports our Clean Air system, which provides protection against interference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/il/v-/pu/ilv-puiidfg9iv2cqknje-z1iiw.jpeg"><br><br>  If there is interference in the room and the system detects it, and if this interference can interfere with the client‚Äôs work, the system switches to a different frequency and leads the client. <br><br>  Why is it important?  Because this may be the only way for a client to connect to the network.  ClientLink 2.0 is the place where the bundle is formed. <br><br>  Remember how I recently talked about what the client can say and decide which access point is better?  Imagine that I Aypad, which can operate at frequencies of 2.4 and 5 gigahertz.  A 5 GHz signal will not be as strong as 2.4.  But I am an access point and I can say: ‚ÄúHey, I know that you are an iPad and can see me on both frequencies.  And I will close the 2.4 signal, because if the client asks me where to connect to it, I will say, hey, better choose 5 gigahertz, because 2.4 - this sucks.  This channel is very overloaded. ‚Äù <br><br>  In fact, we lie to the client and translate it to this frequency, because there are people who cannot connect to it.  We can give 2.4 to those who need it, and keep the rest at 5 gigahertz.  We have the opportunity to do this.  In some cases, a lie even helps.  But I will never tell Emily about it. <br><br>  This access point can be upgraded to AC.  When you order such access points, you can buy either the I-version, which is called the 3600 I, it has four internal antennas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zx/d9/xb/zxd9xbe_z6rjb0tzeipzpdbmdvs.jpeg"><br><br>  Or version E, that is, 3600 E. This model will have external antennas. <br><br>  What do antennas look like?  Can they just be attached to the wall?  Of course.  They can be attached to the wall and painted over and you will not even see them.  External antennas and we can definitely do it.  We have a lot of antennas that can be placed anywhere and provide a better quality stream, or you can choose another option and send a signal in all directions.  Requirements are established during inspection of the premises.  What the client wants and what are his requirements. <br><br>  So, this was our premium class access point.  These access points can improve, as I said.  We tried to give this opportunity to access points of the 3500 series, but it became much easier in the 3600 series. <br><br>  It must be understood that there are not always equal conditions.  You will have different access points and different antennas.  Imagine that I am a business owner and I own this room and two adjoining ones.  But behind this wall are completely different people.  I do not want to install an access point that will give out a signal in all directions.  I will get the model 3600 E with external antennas and install the antenna on the wall and will give all the signals in my direction.  People behind this wall do not even know who works here.  But if I have people on the floor above, then I don‚Äôt have to worry about it ... <br><br>  Although here I would rather give you an example of one story.  I‚Äôll say once again that sometimes Cisco doesn‚Äôt know what they are doing with their new technologies.  I tell the real story.  We bought Aironet and everyone at the company became obsessed with these wireless technologies.  Everyone started to install them in their offices.  That is, technology has become a new toy for us.  Those people who originally invented and founded Aironet worked as wireless network consultants for us.  It was once in the two thousandth years. <br><br>  So, we bought the company and already owned it for about 6 months, those people were hired as consultants and they had to go everywhere and talk about the future of wireless communication and talk about which direction they should develop in Cisco.  In general, perform high-class work in the field of consulting.  They landed at the airport in San Jose, got into a rented car and drove between all these beautiful buildings.  They did not drive up to the central building, but stopped at some other one and then came to the meeting and said: ‚ÄúYes, you don‚Äôt understand a damn thing about wireless technologies.  I approached your four buildings and went around your firewall in four different places. ‚Äù <br><br>  And then I was still working at Cisco, and we told IT professionals to disconnect the entire wireless network and had to go from one access point to another, since they were in each laboratory and they did not have protection and disconnect them.  They stood in the parking lot near our building and could bypass the firewall.  For people, this was all just a new toy; nobody knew anything about it then.  And if we did this stupid thing, imagine what our customers would do. <br><br>  About four years ago I went to the mall.  I took my laptop and turned it on and I will tell you that then I could bypass the firewall of any user in the mall.  Therefore, it is important to place the access points of the 3600 series where you need the Clean Air function, possibly to the depth of your building.  But do not poke them everywhere.  You can fit the 2600 series and you buy hundreds of these and you will have a whole set of different access points. <br><br>  Some companies do not want their wireless network to even go outside the building, so that someone in the parking lot could not see their network at all.  We know that there are excellent hackers.  I have a friend who hacks wireless networks well.  If I saw him in a car near my house, then I would have to disconnect the network, since this would be the only tool to protect against it.  So good he is.  Given that I am confident in the security of my network, I still would not risk it.  That is, you do not need to use one product, it may be a combination of different products, everything ultimately depends on your needs. <br><br>  Now let's talk about the model 2600, it also has the functions of Client Link, Clean Air, but MIMO is already 3x4.  This means that the access point has three transmitters and four receivers.  This is slightly less than the previous model.  The device supports a stream of 450 megabits per second and you can choose the version for which you need a controller or a standalone solution.  You can still purchase an access point with our iOS operating system, which you can then individually configure or you can do it with the help of a controller.  The simpler the better, as I said.  Of course, controllers are good, but for customers who have only 3 or 4 access points they don‚Äôt need it, it will just raise the price very much.  It all depends on your client.  We can sell access points only with AC support, but are there any customers for them now?  Maybe there is a couple, but there are definitely very few of them.  It will take time and they will not be at all. <br><br>  Let's continue to talk about access points of the 2600 series, they belong to the class of access points for entrepreneurs (enterprise class).  They do not have all the features and opportunities for improvement, say the possibility of an upgrade to AC. <br><br>  The 1600 series is the easiest access point from our company.  They have the Clean Air Express feature.  This function essentially removes the radio signal and uses Clean Air on it.  There is no "iron part", only software.  Our competitors use this as their Clean Air feature.  They do not put chips inside.  The general essence of the work of this function is the borrowing of the original radio signal to perform work on it.  We put a separate device for this and performance does not suffer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lv/c2/sv/lvc2svimioref3wxhwhstjhlg6s.jpeg"><br><br>  If you ask me about outdoor access points, then no special cover is required from the external environment.  This is the 1500 series and this is what they look like: <br><br>  These access points are installed outdoors, for example, on college campuses, in large enterprises, in the public sector, in stadiums.  Although for stadiums we have special access points.  They also have the Clean Air function to change channels and so on.  All this information is on our official website, I do not want to complicate anything for you now. <br><br>  So, these were our access points, and now we will look at the controllers.  Controllers are the brain of simplified access points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z7/y1/ls/z7y1lskgaebevo8_zdl_ttaxylg.jpeg"><br><br>  Now I will explain to you from a theoretical point of view, why I need this management ability. <br><br>  The field of information technology is becoming more and more complex.  Now everything is not as simple as before.  Why not put these all things in the cloud?  Why not provide such functionality?  Is it possible?  Of course.  Once again, all our technologies originally came from the cloud and we return to it.  Over time, we try to translate our technologies into cloud technologies, because after three years or five years, customers will want this. <br><br>  I had a familiar information technology director from a fairly large company at that time.  It was about three years ago.  I came to his office after working with his team, he looked at me and asked: "How do you like my team?"  It was a difficult question and I tried, as always, to be as honest as possible.  Do not ask a question if you do not want to hear the answer to it.  I told him that in many matters they jumped over my head.  I spoke specifically about the fact that he tried with the help of IT specialists to plug problem areas in the contact center, which is impossible.  I told him about it.  He was very frank with me and at the end of the conversation he told me, I will clarify that he had only about 185 employees, he said: ‚ÄúIf Eddie, in an ideal world, I could choose the number of employees for my company that I would paid, I would hire five.  I would have five people, administrative assistants in charge of architecture, design and development, and I would hire everyone else through outsourcing.  I would hire people to handle the mail, which we have already begun to do and I would take people to outsource everything else. ‚Äù  He was the director of information technology.  And soon he will have such an opportunity, they are thinking about it now.  Why did he decide that?  How long is the IT director in charge?  About two years, and more recently, it was generally 18 months.  The main task for them is to save their work.  Why?  From time to time, one of the business executives says: "We are turning in this direction."  And the director will answer this: ‚ÄúWe cannot do this.‚Äù  How does it look from the side?  As if he is a stumbling block.  Why?  Because he does not have enough new equipment or he is not ready for such a vision, it is possible that his mistake is that he does not follow what is happening. <br><br>  John Chambers once said such a thing - the job of the CIO is to nod his head when the manager decides to go in a new direction and assure him that everything is possible.  But not every information technology director will do that.  If he suddenly refuses and says that he needs to slow down, he urgently needs to start sending out a resume in search of a new job or update the page on LinkedIn or Facebook, depending on what he uses.  His career is over.  I started talking about this - information technologies have changed a lot and become more complicated.  IT specialists cannot confirm their importance and lose most of the team, the backbone of the group at best. <br><br>  So, some of these controllers can work in Flex mode, that is, they can be controlled from a central point, at the head office, or they can be serviced by a partner provider program.  This can be important for your customers.  How to understand whether it is important for the client?  To ask.  Just ask and understand.  We have used wireless networks here for a long time and they seem to work, but it becomes important for us too.  Maybe partners will come to us and offer us some kind of solution with the management and maintenance of the network with them. <br><br>  Look at the 8500 series controllers. They are ideal for deploying networks on large campuses.  They can serve up to 6,000 access points.  This is a lot of access points.  They do not have to be in the same building, one campus.  They may be in different campuses or even in different places.  They are designed for 6,000 access points.  Would you like this?  No, if not necessary.  By the way, Cisco access points have a function such as failover, which provides fault tolerance and corrects the connection.  One access point can be controlled by one controller, and the other controller will support it, and if the first controller turns off, a spare one connects without losing customers.  This is very important now, given the popularity of BYOD.  This is what the 8500 series controller looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8l/ak/bv/8lakbvekszv9huezr9ck1lvgdzi.jpeg"><br><br>  This is essentially a closed server. <br><br>  We also have a Flex controller, which appeared before the 8500 series. It was created specifically for service providers (service providers) and it is designed for 6000 access points.  It turns out that the software is the same, but an older platform.  Connecting to the controller using a special protocol CAPWAP, using a physical cable.  You will have 6000 ports on 6000 switches that will provide PoE.  And your controller will be in the data center, most likely.  After connecting the access point, the signals will pass through the network to the controller.  Wireless multichannel communication implies the following - we have an access point that sees other access points.  And if it happens that a point cannot get its configuration from the controller through the network, it can use the administrative wireless network to connect and get its configuration. <br><br>  Go to the 5500 series controllers. They support up to 500 access points today.  Now there are up to 500, but the number will definitely grow.  This is an upline (device) from Cisco and you decide where and how you will use it.  You can purchase licenses as needed.  That is, let's say buy 50 licenses in order to work with 50 access points.  What does it mean.  Imagine I buy a 8500 series controller with 300 licenses.  It can serve 6,000 access points, but I pay less and will only use it for 300. If I want to add more access points, I will purchase more licenses.  In my opinion, for the 8500 series there are licenses for 300, 600, 1000, 3000 and 6000 points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cl/hi/ar/clhiarybnkil42yat_smw8umnne.jpeg"><br><br>  The more licenses, the higher the price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/rs/li/klrsliglw3ri0ijbgzr89o0cs9s.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is a cute little box and I really like it.  This is a great Christmas present, but I already have a similar controller.  This is a 2500 series controller. <br><br>  It has the same software as the oldest model, but it serves up to 50 access points.  You can buy it for five points and then purchase another 5, 10, 25 licenses as you like.  The filling of the device fully coincides with the large size, it is just a smaller version.  I love these "kids", they are just adorable.  All these controllers are kind of personal computers with our application.  And with the new software, version 7.3, they can support the failover function. <br><br>  Every time you hear the word uplines (device) from Cisco, be aware that this is the server where our operating system is installed.  You can configure it, but you cannot touch it.  And our device really looks like a server. <br><br>  But what if you want to put our software on your server?  For what purpose would you want to do this?  Iron control, right?  What if I already have a server and have enough computing power and memory for it?  Licenses are already purchased and I could spend them on it.  This way I can connect and disconnect them whenever I need and as I like. <br><br>  Cisco sells software for VMWare virtual machine controllers.  For this we have the so-called virtual controllers.  They are designed for 200 access points and three thousand clients, in addition, they support management in several different locations and everything else.  In general, everything is the same, but on a virtual server.  When you order it, you actually get an image of a real controller.  This is a very important function in the modern world, where people do not want to buy all these uplines.  Software will be similar in this case.  There is something interesting, let's move on to network services. <br><br>  We already talked about infrastructure management with Prime.  Now we have a new line of products for network management.
