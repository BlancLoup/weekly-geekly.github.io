  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual television</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, this month the first <a href="http://virtual-mutant.ru/">site</a> in runet was <a href="http://virtual-mutant.ru/">launched</a> , dedicated to the creation, advertising and reviews of virtual television in general and virtual series in particular.  You have to think, you have already decided that I so pretentiously present you with a clone of the interactive television " <a href="http://telesa.tv/">Teles</a> " - oh no, this is a completely different format.  As the author himself learned quite recently, by virtual serials, the creators imply a series of texts with illustrations and multimedia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn the virtual TV, the reader does not have the opportunity, like in the book, to find out what the character thinks, what his next actions will be, whether he believes <nobr>something</nobr> or just pretended to take everything at face value,‚Äù reads the <a href="http://virtual-mutant.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D5">information section</a> .  We will take these guys to their word, for so far the TV shows exist only on beautiful spoilers, and the release of the first series is promised not until next month. <br><br>  But finally Konstantin Korneychuk, the leader of the Mutants, who gave a few comments on the project, should clarify everything.

      <b>- Does your project have Western counterparts?</b>  <b>Or do you claim to the originality of the idea?</b> <br><br>  - No, there are Western counterparts - for example, the <a href="http://onlinevirtualnetwork.com/">Online Virtual Network</a> , so you have to admit that we did not come up with this idea. <br><br>  <b>- What is the difference between your project and, for example, stories about <a href="http://vladimir.vladimirovich.ru/">Vladimir Vladimirovich ‚Ñ¢</a> or <a href="http://artandreich.livejournal.com/">Artemy Andreich ‚Ñ¢</a> ?</b>  <b>Would you agree to make the first epic one of his serials if Maxim Kononenko supplied his texts with relevant illustrations?</b> <br><br>  - Our project is an attempt to create our own television, even if it is virtual, with its own TV shows and movies.  Virtual series is a series of texts that work also like real TV.  Such series usually have either 22 episodes per season, or 13 <nobr>(mid-season)</nobr> or 6 <nobr>(mini-season).</nobr>  Each episode represents from 30 to 45 minutes, ‚Äúscreen time‚Äù. <br><br>  As for the second question, I think not. <br><br>  <b>- On the spoiler of the first announced series, I see stylized shots from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0361217/">Nip / Tuck</a> .</b>  <b>Do you plan to select illustrations for your series in the future?</b> <br><br>  - I will correct you a little, this is not Nip / Tuck, or rather not only him.  There, besides Julian McMahon and Famk Yasen ("Parts of the Body"), also Josh Holloway ("Staying Alive") and Saar Michel Gellar.  This is a collage made in a graphic editor;  in such a poster, photos of actors whose faces we use in our projects are used.  And, yes, each episode of each of our shows will be advertised in a similar way. <br><br>  In addition, usually in the virtual series uses a specially created video for captions with a list of actors. <br><br>  <b>- In what format will the series be?</b>  <b>Scenario or in the form of ordinary modern prose?</b> <br><br>  - So far - ordinary prose, although in the future it is possible the emergence of series in the script format.  Just ordinary prose is more understandable to an unprepared person. <br><br>  <b>- When is the release of the first series planned?</b> <br><br>  - On October 11, the first of our projects, <a href="http://virtual-mutant.ru/%3Fp%3D3">Dead Swords</a> , starts, episodes of which will be released once a week, on Wednesdays, as long as, presumably, 22 episodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/599/80f/5d8/59980f5d8f6136e7b5e4e14f9c1e5607.jpg"><br><br>  <font>Dead Sords poster</font> <br><br>  And do not forget that anyone who has a desire to create their own universe can join our project. <br><br>  In the meantime, when we subscribe to the <a href="http://virtual-mutant.ru/%3Ffeed%3Drss2">rss-channel</a> , we follow the news of the ‚ÄúMutants‚Äù, I want to tell you about the project, it would be quite appropriate for one of the ‚Äúserials‚Äù, but in reality it is a novel that is laid out daily in a text passage with the possibility of comment. <br><br>  ‚Äú <a href="http://preemnik.commodore.ru/">My dear successor</a> ‚Äù is a work resembling the above mentioned stories about Vladimir Vladimirovich ‚Ñ¢, with a completely unpredictable political plot, which is limited only by the imagination of its author, written, however, with knowledge of the matter.  Three storylines appear in the first chapters - George Bush <nobr>with the</nobr> <nobr>vice director of the</nobr> CIA, who decided to introduce his special agent to the Kremlin, Mikhail Kasyanov and Irina Khakamada, who want to take power, and the unlucky Putin and Khodorkovsky, who decided to raise YUKOS in the eyes of Western partners , the results of which we all know. <br><br>  The third, not yet completed chapter ends like this: ‚ÄúMisha, I figured out how to fix everything.  You will be my successor.  Become a president.  In exchange for YUKOS, you will get all of Russia.  I‚Äôll tell you now, ‚Äùlike all other texts, intriguing your reader. <br><br>  In general, we begin to read the series - perhaps it will be much more interesting than a banal viewing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4442/</a></p>
