What is the worst thing to happen if you enter it incorrectly during registration? <br>  Collapse, the ubiquitous end of the world, gas and hot water? <br>  Taking into account the fact that the password is usually sent to the specified e-mail, that's okay: I made a mistake, it turned out bad - I'll change it, I'm too lazy to change it - I will find it in the letter. <br>  Not sent - I can always change, there would be a good e-mail address. <br><br>  Have you seen cases of duplication of input fields of other information? <br>  "Name / Name", "About Me / About Me".  Not met? .. <br>  Oh yes - e-mail.  Another relic and tradition, but even it is more important than a password. <br>  Specifying the wrong e-mail is much more fraught than to come up with an ‚Äúugly‚Äù password. <br>  But to require to enter it twice - even more nonsense than a password.

      <br>
      Here it is necessary to minimize the password and touch duplication on the example of e-mail. <br>  How long have you last entered the main e-mail with your hands? <br>  If the form developer did not philosophize slyly and gave the form field a "standard" name "email" - the address will probably prompt the browser. <br>  Even if you entered with your hands, do you enter with your hands a second time? <br>  Does input attenuation increase with duplicate?  On the contrary: you enter and the matter of the developer, his relatives and the canary. <br>  You think: ‚ÄúOkay, strike fast with your hands,‚Äù and then you seal up, introducing a second time.  Familiar? <br>  Spent time, nerves, sense - zero. <br><br>  What does the form of ‚Äúincreased usability‚Äù write to you when the values ‚Äã‚Äãof duplicate fields did not match? <br>  That's right - "does not match." <br>  Surprised, damn it.  It helped. <br>  Now sit, look for where and what you are not so hammered.  Where is the correct value?  Where is the typo? <br>  Found?  Drive in a new one, or copy the correct version. <br>  In the e-mail you can still see the error, and they hid the password, taking care of me - drive both of them again, maybe the hand will not falter. <br><br>  Password hide. <br>  Around spies, everyone badly needs my passwords. <br>  Well, feed paranoia and leave the password hiding by default, so as not to irritate the unusual behavior over the years the trained user. <br>  But let me see what I entered, if no one is standing behind me and five cameras are sent to my monitor! <br><br>  What do they want to achieve from me by doing two things: hiding the input value and offering to enter it twice? <br>  Improve password complexity?  Hell no. <br>  A person is given the task to enter a complex one, and I hope you use complex passwords, a sequence.  Blindly.  Twice. <br>  Preparation for the sapper craft, not otherwise. <br><br>  To invent a difficult password in such a situation is unrealistic.  More truly, to think up - it is real more than, to repeat and remember it is unreal. <br>  That forces either to enter a long-invented and used password, or to invent it in another place - for example, a text editor - and copy it into the field. <br>  Well, either use the password manager and copy from there to two places. <br>  Form developers test my ability to copy text into fields? <br><br>  Did hiding help?  No, stuffed in the editor and copied. <br>  Increased complexity?  No, I drove blindly simpler so as not to be mistaken. <br><br>  Well, can this increase your attention when entering a password? <br>  Well, yes, when you enter it from the third time - you will invariably be attentive and rub off half the input a couple of times so as not to see again the nasty inscription about the mismatch of fields. <br>  And why care?  Damn it, it's just a password!  My name and list of hobbies is more important! <br><br>  None of the perceived benefits came true. <br>  Farce. <br>  "Just like others". <br><br>  As a result, you can spend up to a few minutes on a completely uncritical thing and finish the registration not in a satisfied mood, anticipating the benefits of the service, but cursing and cursing everything, wondering five times if you need it and what kind of idiot it was. <br><br>  Do you need a lot to radically change the situation? <br>  Not: <br>  1. remove duplicate fields; <br>  2. give the opportunity to see the entered value. <br><br>  Everything!  No nerves, complicated passwords, users satisfied with the registration procedure. <br>  It's very simple, even the work becomes a little less - no need to check two values. <br><br>  Comrades, think about the users.  Test the forms on data other than "111" and "222", then you can use the same one yourself. <br><br>  <em>Thank you, transferred to user interfaces.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94548/</a></p>
