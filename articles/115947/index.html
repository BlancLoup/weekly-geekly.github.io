  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hosting company survey results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In March of this year, we conducted a survey of hosting companies in Russia and the CIS.  Hosters were asked to answer a few simple questions regarding the services offered by their providers.  Thanks to all those who responded to this request and took part in our mini-study.  As we promised, we will publish the survey results in the company's blog on Habrahabr. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a0c33cb7/753a318c/1cd2c09d/af8f667e.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The most popular service among hosting companies is server rental.  The result can be called expected, given that the number of small companies on the market prevails.  Note that often the variants dedicated and colocation are often called together. <br><br>  The next question concerned the geographical location for the rental and placement of equipment.  The absolute majority of hosters place (rent) equipment abroad or in the CIS countries.  And the second option is not so far behind the first.  Apparently, the factor affected was that among the respondents were a large number of hosting companies from Ukraine and other countries from the post-Soviet space.  Russian data centers have not yet enjoyed such success. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Based on the results of the previous question, one can predict that most of the hosters prefer budget proposals.  In particular, few of the respondents said that they are placing equipment at a price of more than 2500 rubles per month (unlimited, 1U single placement, connection to 100Mb / s) and no one pays more than 4000 rubles per month for this service.  At the same time, the market of domestic data centers is filled with similar offers.  Most likely, for customers from other fields of activity such a price is not an obstacle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1f24f362/2487b89c/f83bbd6a/e04c8c95.png"></div><br><br>  When choosing a provider, hosters so far prefer the recommendations of bloggers and reviews on the forums - these two options scored a total of 45%.  It would seem that all data centers are visible, but nevertheless, the answer option ‚Äúsearch engines‚Äù was called quite often.  Interestingly, many providers are very active in using context and cold calls, but these options were not named successful by any of the respondents. <br><br>  Despite the huge amount of negatives that are being merged in forums and in communities dedicated to hosting, addressed to their providers, the majority of respondents are either completely satisfied with the services provided, or they say that the existing problems are minor.  Only a few of the hosters have serious complaints about their provider and are ready to start searching for a new service provider in the near future. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/88a716d0/1b195886/1a04ed68/20445eae.png"></div><br><br>  The last question is ‚ÄúWhat could motivate you to move the equipment to a new data center with more favorable conditions?  (modern data center, quality services, prices are lower than those of competitors) ‚Äùwas especially interesting for us.  As it turned out, some respondents are not ready to change the provider, practically, under any circumstances.  But the fact that 41% are considering the possibility of moving to a new data center with special offers can not fail to please us as a ‚Äúyoung provider‚Äù. <br><br>  At will, respondents could tell in a detailed form about what, in their opinion, is not enough for modern providers.  Several very valuable and useful answers were received with which it would be great to introduce the readers.  But we will tell about this some other time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115947/</a></p>
