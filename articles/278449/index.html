But Eugene <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/likegroof/" class="user_link">likegroof</a> broke into my immanent connection with the text editor and suggested adding an internal kitchen of the program committee and telling about homemade preparations. <br><br><blockquote>  CodeFest is a conference for developers, testers, managers and designers.  We listen to the reports, communicate in the apartment (special discussion format), have fun at the afterparty.  We meet in 1500 helmets on March 26‚Äì27 in Novosibirsk. </blockquote><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Secrets of the program committee </h2><br>  This year we decided to open the internal kitchen, tell you how the program committee (PC) works, and answer the popular question ‚Äúhow much does a report cost?‚Äù. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      There are 19 people in the program committee, plus several independent experts from different cities and countries who help us with topics, speakers and just good old trolling. <br><br><h3>  How to choose topics? </h3><br>  Firstly, we, of course, follow the trends.  And this is not only Scala and React - no one has canceled our beloved PCP. <br><br>  Secondly, no matter how much we would like to think about the program down, we are doing it first of all for you, which means that we need to know everything about you.  Therefore, once or twice a year we launch a survey, after which we instantly begin to understand you perfectly, recognize your professional interests and guess where you put the curly bracket immediately after or on a new line. <br><br>  Thirdly, we take the formula 80/20%, we run through it the trends and sacral knowledge about you and we get an explosive mixture, which eventually becomes the CodeFest program. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hostess note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  80% - topics interesting to all over the past years.  But every year we deepen them, expand them or show them from the other side; <br>  20% - topics that you are likely to discuss next year, topics ahead of the curve.  We don‚Äôt really care where the IT community will develop, so these 20% are considered very important. </div></div><br><br>  Fourthly, we never put advertising reports in the program.  Yes, sometimes something ambiguous leaks, but this is an accident, and not intent.  Any of our partners can confirm that all our commercial cooperation takes place exclusively outside the halls, but not within their walls. <br><br><h3>  How do we prepare the speakers? </h3><br>  We do not care how everything goes, we care about the comfort of the speaker and your expectations of beauty.  Therefore, we help the speakers with the preparation for the presentation.  In the compulsory program - two skype auditions, slide run, technical review and course of a young speaker, if necessary. <br><br><h3>  Domestic speaker - import speaker? </h3><br>  In 2013, we first invited foreign speakers to visit.  <a href="http://2013.codefest.ru/speaker/3147/">Axel</a> then danced on the table under his own story about EcmaScript 6 and was so inspired that the next year came again.  We liked it too, and it became a CodeFest tradition like cranberry pies.  No dancing - foreigners, which we have since invited every year.  We invite you in advance, because if you don‚Äôt write them for half a year, then there is no chance to squeeze into their tight schedule.  Therefore, every year, on the first of September, someone gets a satchel, and the PC uncovers its gimmeils and facebooks. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hostess note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  The situation with domestic speakers is the opposite.  Before the New Year there are no decisions - we will celebrate it and then ... And until Olivier is finished, the country stops waiting. </div></div><br><br><h2>  Homemade preparations </h2><br><h3>  Dating board </h3><br>  In that year, Lyosha Dolgushev burst into the life of the CodeFest organizers with a proposal to make a <a href="http://2015.codefest.ru/lecture/1058">home</a> apartment <a href="http://2015.codefest.ru/lecture/1058">how to take everything from CodeFest</a> .  The discussion then turned out to be stormy, ideas came up with a lot, and one realized right away: meetings of interests.  For example, you want to argue about load testing - you hang a sticker in a prominent place.  In our case, these were letters.  You write a meeting place, a time and, in fact, a topic.  And then meet with the guys who "pecked" on the sticker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f1/52b/e8a/0f152be8aa5f48b79f67a6a0d359f527.jpg"><br><br>  We liked the idea.  This year we will prepare polypric stickers, more contrast markers and tell you early (actually, already), and you meet on health. <br><br><h3>  Two Keynotes </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e9/da7/b87/8e9da7b8755e4762aa173312ed90a7a9.jpg"><br><br>  Traditionally, we have one keynote report that opens the conference on the first day.  This year there are twice as many keyoats.  On the first day, Horta Theroks, the evangelist of open-sourcing and the Maintainer of CocoaPods, will speak.  Orta will tell you how <a href="http://2016.codefest.ru/lecture/1087">open source principles</a> help engage the community and create successful commercial products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bc/fb9/304/0bcfb93040c24b69bd2e74dd9b54043b.jpg"><br><br>  On the second day, the honored ‚Äúdoctor of IT psychology‚Äù Max Dorofeyev will re-open the conference.  We agreed with Max that he will help <a href="http://2016.codefest.ru/lecture/1116">get rid of the problems and close the gestalts</a> . <br><br><h3>  Community meetings </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/422/ba4/aae/422ba4aaeefc421ebc6f18ce79009741.jpg"><br>  That year we gathered the guys from the communities and asked to tell <a href="http://2015.codefest.ru/lecture/1057">how to make the community and how to live with it</a> .  This year, they offered to keepers to meet during the conference.  Three communities responded: <a href="http://2016.codefest.ru/lecture/1117">PyNsk</a> , <a href="http://2016.codefest.ru/lecture/1122">Dev2Dev,</a> and <a href="http://2016.codefest.ru/lecture/1121">the Go community</a> .  Meet <br><br><h3>  Expert zone </h3><br>  Another idea is to give participants and speakers a legitimate place to socialize.  Now it looks like "caught the speaker - asked a question."  At the upcoming CodeFest we will make an expert zone.  The mechanics are simple.  We agree with the experts that they will be in the expert zone at a specific time.  You will learn in advance from the schedule on the site or in the zone itself on the days of the conference who will be when.  Then it's up to you. <br><br><h2>  The main themes of 2016 </h2><br>  I can not say about the program at least very little, I will be brief and referenced. <br><br>  Our pride is the authors of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies.
