I will even make it the first point.  No, not even the first two points.  Perhaps this is the most important.

      <b>1</b> - I do not do another Monkey Island.  I have no plans to make a new Monkey Island.  I do not even formulate plans to create a new Monkey Island. <br><br>  <b>2</b> - I repeat.  There is no Monkey Island at work and I don't even have plans for this.  I just wanted to invite you to immerse myself in my thoughts and dreams.  I ask you not to put your hands out of the boat during our journey.  And do not get up, so as not to get wet. <br><br>  <i>But if I did make a new Monkey Island ...</i> <br><br>  <b>3</b> - It would be a game that would take us back to the first and second parts of Monkey Island.  I would make it "enhanced low-res."  Nice clear pictures in retro style, but complemented by the iron that we have today: parallax, depth of field, warm glow and so on.  All those things that we wanted to do back in 1990, but could not.  Monkey Island deserves it.  He is authentic.  He does not need 3D.  Yes, I saw the video, it's cool, but Monkey Island should be what it is.  I would like the game to be as we all remember it. <br><br>  <b>4</b> - The game would be very difficult.  It would be the same adventure game as the ones that made that era so adorable.  No instructions or hint systems.  No bastard puzzles, no fast food.  The game would be hardcore.  You will get stuck.  You will not succeed.  Some puzzles will be difficult, but absolutely everyone will be fair.  This is the very aspect of Monkey Island that I am very proud of.  Read <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/2152210">this</a> . <br><br>  <b>5</b> - I would get rid of "action."  I love ‚Äúactions‚Äù, I really love them.  They will be difficult to refuse, but it is rubbish.  This is not as scary as it seems.  Until the end of this idea, I have not thought through.  Not that I think about it, but if I did (which I don‚Äôt do), I wouldn‚Äôt have thought about it yet.  I can change my mind, but it is unlikely.  <i>Mmmmmmm ... "action."</i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Actions</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fc/376/125/8fc37612549d2977a6311295e8ca9c73.jpg"></div></div><br>  <b>6</b> - Maximum worked inventory.  Beautiful big juicy icons full of pixels.  In the very first version of Monkey Island 1 there was a text inventory, in later releases and in Monkey Island 2 there were huge icons in the inventory and it was beautiful.  You will like them so much that you will want to lick them. <br><br>  <b>7</b> - The game will have a box.  I understand that most copies of the game would be sold in digital form, but do you really not want to dig into the box, where are all your adventure games?  I definitely want to!  In addition, where else to store the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_wheel">code disk</a> ? <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Code disk</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/500/c27/4af/500c274af5fcd32cf4e63c751fc359a0.jpg"></div></div><br>  <b>8</b> - There would be interactive puzzles in the game.  These are not real puzzles, but we call them that anyway.  The ability to tell four jokes at a time, just to get worn out, get lost in the humor of the discussion - this is the signature style of Monkey Island.  No one has surpassed us in this.  It seems to me. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Traditional duel of insults</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18d/a19/265/18da19265db06777c48d0984ed99d797.jpg"></div></div><br>  <b>9</b> - I would revive <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM">SCUMM</a> .  Not a specific programming language, but what SCUMM brought into the games.  This language was created specifically for adventure games and fast iteration.  The engine could do those things that <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua">LUA</a> never dreamed of.  When LUA was in high school, SCUMM took his lunch money.  This, by the way, is a true story.  SCUMM lived and breathed adventure games.  I would build such an engine and language so that the ideas that we laughed at lunch by the evening would be already introduced into the game.  SCUMM did it.  And this is something that is very lacking today. <br><br>  <b>10</b> - We would have a very small team.  Not 30 or 20 people, but 10 or maybe even less.  Of course, the development would take much more time, but the game would be individual and made with love.  Monkey love <i>(in the original ‚ÄúMonkey love‚Äù - idiom, meaning crazy animal sex, requiring a certain acrobatic training, approx. Translator)</i> .  Stop ... No, I didn't mean that ... <br><br>  <b>11</b> - The only condition under which I would be engaged in the development of a new Monkey Island is that I must be the copyright holder.  I spent too much of my life creating and developing what belongs to other people.  I would not only allow you, but even encourage the development of ‚Äúfan games‚Äù based on the original.  Please call the game "fan", respect the game universe and characters and do not say that you all came up with it.  Although, when lawyers got to the last sentence in this paragraph, they would have turned it into seven pages of text. <br><br>  <b>12</b> - The game would be called Monkey Island <b>3.a.</b>  All the games in the series that came out after Monkey Island 2 do not exist in my Monkey Island universe.  I apologize to all the talented people who worked on these games, all the people who love them, but I would like to continue from the place where I stopped.  Without baggage.  At the carnival.  This does not mean that I will not get a couple of good ideas or characters from other games.  I am <b>NOT</b> above this. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The final scene of Monkey Island 2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/038/7fa/afc/0387faafcf3e7391123f37745874d74b.gif"></div></div><br>  <b>13</b> - The game wouldn't be the one in Monkey Island 3, which I was going to do in 1992.  Today I am not what it was then.  I could not do it now.  That game is lost in time.  But I hope that the new game that we are talking about would be better. <br><br>  <b>14</b> - The press would not receive a copy in advance.  I know why they ask to send them copies in advance, all these reasons are really objective.  But still, in my opinion, they should play the game at the same time as you.  I hope they will not be offended by me.  My karma on Metacritic.com also hopes that they will not be offended at me. <br><br>  <b>15</b> - The game would be voiced completely.  We dreamed of this in the past, but today we can do it. <br><br>  <b>16</b> - If I decided to use Kickstarter, then there would be no funny videos with me in the lead role, trying to look charming (as if I can do it).  No concept art, no pompous promises, crazy stretched tasks, inflated rewards to heaven.  Everything would be simple and honest.  Such an approach would free me from the hype and other irritants that could prevent me from making my best game.  Yes, indeed, I could not make a lot of money and break any records, but this is not what I am striving for.  I want to make a game. <br><br>  <b>17</b> - The game would be the game that I would like to create.  No need to push me and try to force me to make the game that you want me to do.  I would be lost for a long time.  I would not keep you informed and would not begin to spin the hype around the game.  Sometimes, I would share with you those things that amused me or impressed me.  If you let me do all this, you will love the game.  I promise you that. <br><br>  I hope you got the same pleasure of reading as I did while writing all this. <br><br>  Ron Gilbert, 04/15/2013 <br>  <a href="http://grumpygamer.com/5777333">http://grumpygamer.com/5777333</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220779/</a></p>
