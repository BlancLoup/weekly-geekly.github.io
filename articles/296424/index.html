But since IT has already penetrated absolutely all areas of private and professional life, we decided that it would not be superfluous to dilute startups and their advice with the story of a person who creates a biotechnology company in Russia.  Besides, Denis <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/265166/">already answered</a> questions of users of Geektimes. <br><br>  Denis graduated from the Biological Faculty of Moscow State University.  Mv  Lomonosov in 2007, graduating from the Department of Molecular Biology with a red diploma.  He enrolled in the postgraduate studies at the Institute of Biochemistry RAS, where he worked in the ‚ÄúLaboratory of the Structure and Function of Human Genes‚Äù to create antitumor preparations of molecular-directed action, based on ‚Äúsuicidal genes‚Äù - now these gene-therapeutic drugs are undergoing preclinical tests.  In 2012, under the leadership of E.D.  Sverdlov Denis Kuzmin defends his thesis.

      As Denis admits, in 2010 he began to actively seek practical application of his own knowledge and, as a result, ended up at the Independent Laboratory Invitro, where until 2014 he was engaged in the creation and management of a network of medical centers operating in the franchising model.  After retiring from Invitro, Denis became the CEO of Solix Biosystems Vostok (R &amp; D center created by Rosnano and Solix Algredients), which is still the only company in Russia specializing in the industrial cultivation of microalgae and the separation of specific value from biomass. <br><br>  He also notes that he has gone from preparing a business plan and forming a team to launching a laboratory and semi-industrial production;  implemented technology transfer to our country - the import and localization of Solix photobioreactors of the Lumia AGS260 series, which have no analogues in the Russian Federation.  Today, in his laboratory, screening of microalgae strain from the collections of leading Russian research institutes for the presence of substances with a high potential for commercialization (Omega-3, astaxanthin, etc.) has been put on stream - Denis modestly adds that they have found one strain-flow factor of antioxidants, in a number of parameters surpassing most of the currently known in the world. <br><br>  Denis Kuzmin is an expert at the Skolkovo Foundation (Biomedical Cluster), mentor of the Center for the Development of Entrepreneurship in Moscow under the Department of Science, Industrial Policy and Entrepreneurship (areas of medicine / pharmacology / biotechnology). <br><br>  It was a great introduction, but we believe that everyone should know such founders and enthusiastic people "in person" in detail.  And now - the word Denis, who summarized his experience in three simple tips. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First tip: <br><blockquote>  Despite all the geopolitical difficulties, sanctions and various restrictions, it is not necessary to accept the logic of isolation imposed on us.  This is especially true of the "world of high technology." <br><br>  It is extremely important to transfer technologies and know-how with the subsequent implementation in the domestic realities. <br>  Using Western technologies and our scientific potential (including the achievements of previous generations of scientists), we can obtain the synergy that, in the end, will allow us to create a unique product. <br><br>  Instead of protecting my customs territory more promising, I see protection of value-added chains generated by domestic innovative business. </blockquote><br>  Second tip: <br><blockquote>  The most difficult, I would say the main task, is the struggle with skepticism, with the wall, which erected between the people of science and business people.  The biased attitude of domestic scientists to any investors, including the leading development institutions, leads to the fact that many promising developments remain lying "in the table."  Instead, many research groups go for state.  financing and get the so-called "grant millstone." <br><br>  On the other hand, people from the "world of money" often perceive scientists as some kind of marginalized and treat them with a touch of irony and condescension, which does not at all contribute to normal communications.  At the same time, it becomes obvious that only projects that include balanced teams have a real future.  Now, any high-tech project is first of all people with a high level of expertise in the core field, management and finance, specialists in the field of promotion of the final product. </blockquote><br>  And the third tip: <br><blockquote>  As F. Kafka said, ‚ÄúAll human errors are the essence of impatience, a premature rejection of methodicalness, an imaginary focus on an imaginary business.‚Äù <br><br>  Try to get a good basic education, if possible fundamental.  The main thing that gives education - meta-intelligence - the ability to obtain skills / knowledge.  Constantly develop new skills.  Now there are many opportunities to get online education.  Be sociable and open.  Often a meeting with a person from a completely different field of activity can open up new horizons for you. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296424/</a></p>
