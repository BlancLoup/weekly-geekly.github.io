From various companies: Airbus, Facebook, Synacktiv, Kaspersky Lab, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, Shape Security, Wrike, X41 D-Sec GmbH and others. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e_/bg/dl/e_bgdlmpieqakv8_qkeoovja04a.jpeg"></p><br><p>  The main topics of the conference: </p><br><ul><li>  How hackers can get hold of a mobile device via Wi-Fi chip </li><li>  How faxes can become enemies in the corporate network </li><li>  What USB device drivers for Windows contain a large number of vulnerabilities </li><li>  How Git Web Servers Extend Attacker </li><li>  How to use hardware to compromise <br>  network equipment and infrastructure </li><li>  How attackers can use the UPnP protocol to hide their network activity </li><li>  What are the problems of security and the process of closing vulnerabilities in the products of Russian process administration systems? </li><li>  What are the consequences of the rash use of new technologies in client development </li><li>  As in the compilers, there are errors that can be used to embed backdoors in the software </li><li>  How can the system be infected to the BIOS level </li><li>  That the Ntlm Relay attack is still dangerous and can be used in new ways. </li><li>  How can you quickly and efficiently evaluate the security of network equipment configuration files? </li><li>  What are the security issues in SD-WAN technology? </li><li>  How development systems can be attacked and used against their owners. </li><li>  How GPU virtualization tools can be used to attack the system </li><li>  What vulnerabilities and problems can be found in widespread products and libraries ImageMagick, Redis, SCADA systems and node.js projects. </li></ul><br><p>  As part of ZeroNights, various activities were also implemented: hacker quests, Web Village sections and the Hardware Zone. </p><br><h2 id="web-village">  Web village </h2><br><p>  It's nice to see Web Village gathering a huge amount of viewers again and again. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/ol/b0/x7olb03ofvfsdcj6cixs_stigzm.jpeg"></p><br><p>  We already note the traditional stream of reports from experienced Weber with extensive experience in the practical field.  See for yourself, this time among the speakers: Mail.Ru, Yandex, Kaspersky Lab, Digital Security, Sploitus, Acunetix, Deteact, Rambler.  We also consider a big plus - the complete lack of public relations companies, various solutions and arguments about the market.  But, of course, the main achievement of ZeroNights 2018 is a high level of preparation of reports with non-beat examples: </p><br><ol><li>  Do you know everything about XSS?

Full reports from the stage covered the topics of practical security of ATMs, IoT, tools and methods for analyzing hardware protocols and much more. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ot/uj/0h/otuj0hbbg3dgh222g7cmpltrkr8.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Participants could hack a vending system and game currency using NFC-cards, which could then be paid off at the bar.  To successfully complete the task, the participants used useful information obtained at several workshops by Pavel Zhovner, as well as all the necessary hardware tools presented at the stand.  Anyone could apply this knowledge in practice and test his strength in the analysis of wireless protocols and conducting attacks on typical representatives of the IoT world, receiving (as a result) not unhelpful memorable gifts (proxmark3, chameleon mini, BBC Microbit). </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qc/kg/gt/qckggtbwjvww18af3hkpbavuduk.jpeg"></p><br><p>  The activity of the participants shows an undying interest in the topic of security of embedded devices and hardware hacks, so we will continue to continue the tradition of the Hardware Zone and increase the number of educational reports and competitions. </p><br><h2 id="konkursy">  Contests </h2><br><p>  The site also held activity from our partners. </p><br><p>  Mail.ru held a contest for pneumatic hacking, the winners earned $ 100 and Bug Hunter hoodies. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j-/pv/gn/j-pvgnffrem8wgsdqk74fsmbfw4.jpeg"></p><br><p>  SEMrush played MacBook Air, Sony PlayStation 4 Pro and Quadcopter DJI Spark in the Crush SEMrush competition.

And in the ‚ÄúSlot Machine‚Äù competition - one-armed gangster, the game of which is built on the basis of Blockchain, the jackpot was 100 units  cryptocurrency, the first hacked system received a ticket to ZeroNights 2019. </p><br><p>  Also at the opening of the conference was a party, the headliner of which was the musical project The Dual Personality, the winners of the remix contest from Linkin Park and the participants of the Alfa Future People electronic music festival. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/au/yi/zcauyi0fgkvpdqd52yatbh7kmg8.jpeg"></p><br><p>  We thank each participant of the conference, as well as partners who supported ZeroNights this year: Yandex, Mail.ru, Sberbank, Epam, SEMrush, Digital Security. </p><br><ul><li>  Video presentations are available on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxzEsshgkoWE%26list%3DPLHlFrzuFU1EVtUOZ3k7f7Nw6CoUnOm4RF">YouTube</a> . </li><li>  Photos from the conference are available <a href="https://2018.zeronights.ru/gallery/">here</a> . </li><li>  Conference materials can be found <a href="https://2018.zeronights.ru/materials/">here</a> . </li></ul><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/hv/ci/jmhvcivz28kstv-n_ebzymqfm9c.jpeg"></p><br><p> For those who read to the end - the competition!
