I present to you the translation of the article <a href="https://www.techinasia.com/talk/27-things-started-programming">‚Äú27 things I wish I knew when I started programming‚Äù</a> by Ken Mazaika. <br><br>  Before starting to program, I would like to know a lot of things, but here are 27 of them that come to mind. <a name="habracut"></a>  I put the most important ones under numbers 14 and 26, so that it would be interesting for you to read the full article. <br><br><h4>  1. Learn from practice </h4><br>  The only way to get better at programming is to program.  Do not let your efforts be interrupted by paralyzing yourself with analysis.

    <h4>  2. Programming is not like preparing for a test </h4><br>  Remembering overflow is not significant. <br><br><h4>  3. Fraud is perfectly acceptable </h4><br>  I use Google to solve most of my problems, like many of the programmers. <br><br><h4>  4. Accumulating unverified developments is a bad strategy </h4><br>  I made random changes in my code and expected it to work right away.  The disadvantage of this approach is that problems are collected one on top of the other, and it becomes difficult to figure out what went wrong. <br><br><h4>  5. Learning on your own is very difficult </h4><br>  Discussing the code and collaborating with other novice developers is the best way to learn for most people. <br><br><h4>  6. Do not be loaded with regrets </h4><br>  On the way to programming skills, you will encounter error messages. <br>  In order to grow up in conditions when ‚Äútricking‚Äù is an integral part of the matter, you must meet punctures steadily. <br><br><h4>  7. You do not need 5 monitors </h4><br>  Contrary to the Hollywood cliche, to be a programmer, you do not need a crazy cascade of monitors.  The computer you own now is probably good enough to start programming.  Do not waste your money. <br><br><h4>  8. There is a big difference between uppercase and lowercase </h4><br>  It took me a while to get used to the subtle differences between similar characters and start to notice them.  Until you get used to it, it can be pretty unpleasant. <br><br><h4>  9. Trying to understand everything is a hopeless affair. </h4><br>  At first, I tried to find the cause of each problem I encountered.  It's not obligatory.  Computers are so complex that you will always have something to learn from them.  You will never understand everything at once, and this is normal. <br><br><h4>  10. Participate in pair programming as much as possible </h4><br>  There is no faster way to learn how to write code. <br><br><h4>  11. Changing bad code is part of the job. </h4><br>  I used to think that every piece of code needed to be made perfect.  But making improvements to your code is natural.  You are not writing a book so that you cannot change it after publication. <br><br><h4>  12. Seek help correctly </h4><br>  Everyone at some point needs to ask for help.  When you are about to do this, follow these four steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Summarize the details that you have discovered. </li><li>  Clearly decide what should happen in your opinion. </li><li>  Clearly clarify what is really happening. </li><li>  Specify why you think that should work differently. </li></ol><br>  By following these steps, it is very likely that you will come to a decision without even asking for help.  This approach promotes holistic consideration of problems. <br><br><h4>  13. You do not need to be a genius in mathematics </h4><br>  If you are not a ‚Äúmathematician‚Äù, this does not mean that you cannot be a programmer. <br><br><h4>  14. Always celebrate small victories. </h4><br>  Creating utilities with code is really cool.  I would never get to where I am, if I hadn‚Äôt turned around and admired the amazing things that I had created along the way. <br><br><h4>  15. Mitapas are incredibly valuable </h4><br>  In the beginning, it was very scary to get to a level where I would feel comfortable.  But as soon as I took part in the meeting, I realized that there were many developers like me. <br><br><h4>  16. Avoiding merge conflicts makes you happier </h4><br>  Merge conflicts are annoying.  Therefore, when I realized that I could get to some function before my teammate, so that he (or she) had to deal with it instead of me, I was extremely delighted. <br><br><h4>  17. To admit that you do not know something is normal </h4><br>  When programming your first tasks, you may be inclined to ‚Äúpretend until you do.‚Äù  Don't do this - no one expects you to know everything at once. <br><br><h4>  18. It does not take 10,000 hours to get a job </h4><br>  In reality, you just need to be generally positive, be prepared to correct and resume an active trajectory when faced with problems.  It takes much less time than 10,000 hours. <br><br><h4>  19. Get ready to wake up in the morning thinking about code </h4><br>  And when that happens, it's really damn cool. <br><br><h4>  20. Making big mistakes is natural </h4><br>  Once I made a mistake that cost my company 10,000 US dollars.  As a result, I learned the most important lesson of my programming career: don't be afraid of situations where you can make a mistake if the risk justifies it.  Thanks to this, you, as a developer, will become better. <br><br><h4>  21. The algorithm is similar to finding a name in the phone book </h4><br>  Algorithms are a step-by-step approach in which there is only one correct next step.  The easiest way to imagine this is with the example of a strategy with which you would look for a specific name in the phone book.  I wrote about this process <a href="http://blog.thefirehoseproject.com/posts/what-is-an-algorithm/%3Futm_source%3Dquora%26utm_medium%3Dquora_ken_answer%26utm_content%3Dwhat_are_some_things_you_wish_you_knew_about_programming%26utm_campaign%3Dquora_answers">here</a> , if you are interested. <br><br><h4>  22. You will never feel that you are ready to program seriously </h4><br>  There is an impostor syndrome.  Try not to forget that knowing not everything is normal.  The most important thing is to understand that you are able to deal with what you do not yet know. <br><br><h4>  23. Programmers never stop learning </h4><br>  New technologies are constantly appearing, therefore successful programmers are those who continue to learn and develop their skills on an ongoing basis. <br><br><h4>  24. Make the computer think like a human </h4><br>  Too many people have the impression that you need to think like a computer.  In fact, the opposite is true. <br><br><h4>  25. Programming is the use of a suitable tool for work. </h4><br>  At your disposal are many different open libraries, tools, and frameworks.  Therefore, you need to expand your developer‚Äôs tools and understand which tool is more suitable for solving the problems you have encountered. <br><br><h4>  26. Stop right before the changes for the better - a common act </h4><br>  Learning to program is a big job, especially for the level where you can enter the profession.  It takes time and discipline, but it is feasible.  Too many people make a mistake - they complete the massive work, almost reaching the desired. <br><br><h4>  27. Learning to program is not easy </h4><br>  But that is why this is a worthwhile business. <br><br>  Looking back, in fact, I am very glad that at first I was so naive.  Weak knowledge motivated me to critically understand everything that I learned later. <br><br>  Now I can help other people achieve their programming goals.  What could be better? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461175/</a></p>
