But in the real world, the situation is different: in the App Store extremely high competition, and even the creation of an excellent program does not guarantee that you will pay back the costs. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://app-promo.com/wake-up-call-infographic/">statistics from the</a> marketing company App Promo, 59% of apps on the App Store do not pay back development costs, and 80% of developers cannot rely on the App Store as their only source of income.  Although the marketing firm App Promo is a concerned person, such results of the survey are similar to the truth.  Some independent developers <a href="">say</a> that in fact the figure of 59% looks even understated, and more real - 85% or 90%, to be honest with the cost of development. <br><br>  Perhaps, for many iOS developers, it is more profitable to make custom projects for companies with large budgets than to independently launch paid applications and sell them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The results of their <a href="http://app-promo.com/whitepaper1/">research</a> company App Promo published in the form of infographics.

They agree that this business can in some sense be compared with a lottery.  A new application in the catalog is almost impossible to find if it does not fall into the list of Top-100 or Top-200.  Thus, there is a weak link between the effort spent on development, the quality of the application - and its future success. <br><br>  Approximately the same situation in other businesses with high competition, for example, in the book publishing and music business, even in Internet start-ups.  Most new books / music albums do not pay back the cost of creating them, and only a small number become bestsellers.  You can call it a ‚Äúlottery‚Äù, but in fact it is a natural result of high competition, where ‚Äúluck‚Äù, that is, unpredictable factors, decides a lot. <br><br>  Initially, it is very difficult to predict the success of an application in the App Store, and even an investment in promotion does not guarantee success.  According to App Store statistics, 91% of developers understand the need for investment in promotion, but in fact 52% do not invest a single cent in it. <br><br>  Development costs are thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, plus marketing.  It is difficult to recoup such amount, based on the price of the application at $ 0.99 - in reality, it is 70 cents for the developer.  Often there are problems in high user expectations: they used to pay $ 20-30 for a desktop program from an independent developer, but the App Store quickly accustomed them to the price of $ 0.99-1.99, even this is a high barrier for customers, many of whom prefer Download free alternative.  If someone raises the price above the standard price of 1-2 dollars, then you can get critical feedback from users and journalists. <br><br>  Another problem that the developers are talking about is the poor ‚Äúvisibility‚Äù of the App Store applications in Google search results, unless you make special efforts for SEO optimization. <br><br>  Developers are also turning to Apple with a request to develop some mechanism for publishing demo versions of programs with a limited duration of work (for example, 30 days). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143424/</a></p>
