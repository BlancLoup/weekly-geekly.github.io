  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PR in the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article explains why you need to promote the site, the benefits of <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/promotion.php">site promotion</a> and <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/promotion.php">site optimization</a> . <br><br>  The first association at the mention of a non-Russian, but already so native, word Internet? <br>  - Yandeh, there is everything! <br><br>  Here you can quote the well-known Yandex ‚Äúmom‚Äù of Elena Kolmanovskaya.  She recalled the situation when Yandex refused to work for the outside world for as long as thirty minutes: ‚ÄúWe all, except the admins, left the office on the street, because all the acquaintances of Yandex employees called and asked what happened.  Vedomosti wrote about it then.  How so?  Such a thing (with irony)!  And then we also received a lot of letters from providers, to which their clients came and said that the Internet does not work for them.  Because if ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù does not open, it means that the provider has ‚Äúlaid down‚Äù the Internet ‚Äù(interview with Webinform.ru, June 2, 2004).

      Well, we have to put up with the fact that Yandex in Russia is looking for at least 70% of the computerized population, and Google‚Äôs foreign guest is far behind in popularity, although it is believed that he is a head taller.  Head and shoulders above in search relevance, that is, in accordance with the search engine output to users' expectations. <br><br>  Have you noticed that, for example, while typing the harmless word <a href="http://mex.foxco.ru/">fur</a> in Yandex, instead of encyclopedic answers ‚Äúfur is this,‚Äù you are given a list of firms trading in fur?  Have you ever wondered why this is happening?  Search engine mission - to find exactly what you want.  To the question "sale of fur" to find offers for sale, to the question of fur - an explanation of what it is.  But pay attention to the table: <br><table width="500" border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>The words</b> </td><td>  <b>Impressions per month</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  furs </td><td>  34601 </td></tr><tr><td>  fur sale </td><td>  301 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  According to statistics, requests for the word "fur" are set by users 115 times more often than the phrase <a href="http://mex.foxco.ru/">sale of fur</a> .  This suggests that if your promo page advertising your fur trading company in the ‚Äúfur‚Äù query is in the top ten, then 34,000 people can visit it in a month.  You are given the task to consider the situation with the phrase ‚Äúsale of fur‚Äù and compare the result. <br><br>  Of course, you are not the first to whom such a situation made you think, so do not break your head - ‚Äúhow can this be done so that my such ordinary website will appear in the search engine for such popular queries in the top ten ??? <br><br>  Everything is invented, as they say, for you!  Promotion, promotion, optimization, call it what you want, but this means only one thing - you are a winner.  Your site is on the first positions, the mass of visitors, with targeted!  visitors, pay attention (because if I want to find fur, it means I need it!). <br><br>  Now a bit of terminology: <br><br>  <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/promotion.php">Website promotion</a> is a set of activities aimed at increasing the popularity of the website in the information environment.  Often the words promotion and optimization are often mentioned as synonyms. <br><br>  Promotion is a modern term that defines the promotion of a specific process in a business, starting from its formation or education.  Promotion refers to the company, branch, advertising, brand.  This term is one of those that are now widely used and are moving from the category of "jargon" to the literary form. <br><br>  Optimization (Search Engines Optimization) - these are the measures taken for the more likely adoption of the created site by search engines.  They are aimed at working with the quality component of the web pages, that is, to work out the content and structure of the site. <br><br>  The goal of search engine optimization pages - getting high places in the search results for given queries. <br><br>  I'm afraid that sounds too easy and optimistic.  Probably, the search engine will not put in the top of a blank page, no matter how it "unwind".  It is necessary to work on the text, increase the volume of the site, promote it with quite standard methods adopted in marketing (advertising in the media, ads), make your eyes sound, so to speak, your site.  Only then can he become first among equals. <br><br>  In parting words, contact the professionals, too often we think that we know and are able to do everything, but experts still know more, and even more so seo professionals working in such tough competitive conditions. <br><br>  All the best to your site <br>  <a href="http://www.seomen.ru/">Seomen Design Studio</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6398/</a></p>
