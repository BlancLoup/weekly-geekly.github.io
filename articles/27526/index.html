But I ... tell you about Digg! <br><br>  Namely - about the social mechanisms of Digg in comparison with Habrahabrom - based on the impression left by me after several days on Digg'e. <br><br>  I understand that Digg should be compared rather with news2, but still Digg and Habrahabr have a lot in common, and these notes will be interesting to many who had previously only read Digg.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  The first impression - Digg is huge.  Multiply Habr by 100 (including the number of idiots) and get Digg.  New topics appear there every second. <br><br>  The second impression - Digg is radically different from Habr in that the author's content is welcome at Habré, whereas in Digg it is considered a bad form to post links to his articles. <br><br>  In other words, Digg is a great linkwashing machine. <br><br>  The third impression - Digg is the <b>mafia</b> :) <br><br>  No, I'm not joking.  On Digg, your connections decide everything - not how interesting your topics are or how high your karma is (yes, Digg has something like karma, but more on that later). <br><br>  Try to post even a super-interesting topic on Digg - you will receive a maximum of 4 votes until your topic leaves the first page of Upcoming in a couple of minutes.  He just lost in the ocean of the same topics as yours. <br><br>  Another thing, if you have friends.  Good friends who will not fail to click on the "digg" button in front of your topic in your friend tape. <br><br>  To display a topic on the main page, you need at least 60 diggs in a short period of time - which means you need to have about 200 American friends and post a topic at a convenient time for them to manage to write it down. <br><br>  You can see this by viewing the profiles of users whose topics form the main page of Digg - many of them have thousands of friends. <br><br>  But even a hundred votes will not raise your topic if it does not have at least one voice from top-poster.  A top poster is a user who has at least one post that has visited the main one.  The "karma" of a user is defined as the ratio of top posts to all user topics.  In top users, this ratio reaches 80%. <br><br>  Interestingly, Digg encourages "mafia" - the green tag among all topics are those topics that your friends voted for.  Something like: “Hey, yes, here your friends were noted, and you vote for it!” <br><br>  Many users in the profile direct text or transparent hints says: <b>"Be my friend and vote for my posts - I will not be in debt!"</b> <br><br>  If on Habrahabr is drochat on karma, then on Digg drochat on friends :) <br><br>  Friends on Digg is just a tool.  It would be more correct to call them the term “followers” ​​- because it makes me a little confused about how to treat friends on Digg.  If "friend" does not vote for your topics, then it is better to remove it from the list. <br><br>  Many on Habrahabr complain about such dark sides of the “collective mind” as a herd sense and conformism - rejection of alternative points of view / criticism.  So, on Digg - thanks to its incredible mass character - this is manifested most acutely.  The rule for comments works: <b>“if you can put a minus to your comment, you will get 100 minuses”</b>  I do not know, however, whether cons for comments affect karma. <br><br>  I noticed that with the increasing popularity, more and more topic links appear, videos from YouTube and other “Lolz” - and interesting author articles are easier to get lost in the general stream of content.  I really would not want Habrahabr to turn into Digg once - from a collective blog to a collective link trash - and the main page would be completely formed thanks to some kind of Habra Mafia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27526/</a></p>
