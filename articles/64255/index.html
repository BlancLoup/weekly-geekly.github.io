  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BlogEngine.NET 1.5. Russified assembly with themes and extensions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I compiled for myself the distribution kit of the blog engine BlogEngine.NET (version 1.5.0.7), ready to be deployed on the hosting in seconds and Russified as I need (starting from slugs to a lot of translation improvements in the special file and the code itself, including extensions), with various extensions and with a large package of topics, but I thought that maybe someone else would need it. <br>  Next: for those who do not know what BlogEngine.NET is and what it is eaten with - perhaps the story about it will be interesting, for those who are ‚Äúin the subject‚Äù - a list of changes made in the engine. <br><br><h4>  What is BlogEngine.NET? </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/">BlogEngine.NET</a> is a lightweight and fairly functional open-source blog engine written using ASP.NET technology.  It can work both with databases (Microsoft SQL, Microsoft SQL Express, MySQL), and with XML files as storage (by default).  With normal blog sizes, there is no difference in performance. <br>  BlogEngine out of the box with a standard theme is <a href="http://madskristensen.net/default.aspx">an engine developer blog</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What is BlogEngine not? </h4><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/07/12/08/28/4411167_1184x430.jpg"><br>  BlogEngine is not Wordpress.  I repeat: this is not Wordpress.  Of course, to compare them (in general, the best blog engines on two different platforms).  But BlogEngine is a different class engine: not so extensible with ready-made plugins (although you can write your own quickly and simply), but as easy and fast as possible, providing more functionality than is necessary for an ordinary blogger (not playing with his blog, but just writing it) . <br>  It should not be used where any function may be required: unless you really want to learn ASP.NET by writing the necessary UserControls and extensions.  But in cases when you need something easy, fast to deploy, easily customizable, convenient for the end user (BlogEngine dashboard is much simpler and easier than the Wordpress panel) - then it makes sense to try BlogEngine.  In the developers FAQ, there is a question ‚ÄúWill my mom be able to use it?‚Äù :) The answer is yes, it can.  Everything is quite simple and intuitive for both the user and the developer.  For a developer this way, all you need is to upload a project posted on the official website in Visual Studio and enjoy the convenience of working with beautifully written code :)

    <h4>  What can he out of the box? </h4><ol><li>  It‚Äôs normal to work with caching (without disturbing the user), mobile devices (they are given a special theme by default), trackbacks, pingbacks and even OpenSearch (blog search can be inserted into the search bar of modern browsers in addition to Yandex, Google, Bing, etc.). d.) </li><li>  Tree comments, gravatars, notification of comments on the mail, ping services </li><li>  Maintaining a multi-author blog, detailed profiles for authors </li><li>  Widgets for tag cloud, twitter, favorite blogs, notification of new posts to mail, drag-n-drop work with these widgets </li><li>  Avtoresayz downloadable images </li><li>  Use bbcode in comments, preview comments </li><li>  MP3 audio player on Flash technology </li><li>  and many many others! </li></ol>  And most importantly - all this is easy to manage, and the work of the blog does not slow down the possibilities.  Instant installation and minimum system requirements are also a serious advantage.  Even the installer is not required, see below :) <br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/07/12/09/06/4411512_1199x724.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Windows hosting is expensive !! </h4><br>  Nothing of the sort: many serious companies offer Unix and Windows hosting for the same price.  Moreover: Windows hosting usually has a test period.  Personally, I am satisfied with the Windows hosting from <a href="http://infobox.ru/">Infobox</a> and <a href="http://agava.ru/">Agave</a> , but I absolutely do not insist.  In addition, for BlogEngine .NET hosting requires much less powerful than for Wordpress. <br><br><h4>  Who is it useful? </h4><br>  If you are only interested in the ASP.NET platform, then this is a good designer for starting.  The BlogEngine code is written beautifully and easily, it is quite understandable even without much training in the field of .NET technology.  It is free to dig into it and easily correct it for yourself, at the same time gradually understanding ASP.NET.  If you have never worked with ASP.NET, but would like to try - just play around, not trying to write your own CMS from scratch - try BlogEngine, you will not regret.  On its basis, it is quite possible to make your own CMS, everything is ready for the usual non-blogging CMS (NB is ready does not mean done ;-) For example, there is support for the tree-like organization of the pages in the control panel, but for the actual website you have to code it yourself for now). <br><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br>  BlogEngine works without a database (although it is quite possible to connect it) and for installation it is required only to upload to the hosting and specify write access for the App_Data folder.  Then load the main page;  for the first time it will load a little longer, but then everything will happen quickly. <br><br><h4>  What is changed in this build? </h4><ol><li>  The official translation in the file <em>\ App_GlobalResources \ labels.ru.resx has been</em> seriously added and corrected <em>.</em> </li><li>  Where possible, the names are translated directly in the code (since not everything is in a separate file, and not everything is possible without a lot of changes in the engine; I hope some day this will change) </li><li>  <em>\ bin \ BlogEngineCore.dll</em> rebuilt.  Now Russian headlines do not turn into slug'and of the form <em>d09ed0b1d0be-d0bcd0bdd0b5</em> (a headache for BlogEngine, because here you can‚Äôt disable rewriting URLs), but are shown directly in Russian letters (a la Wikipedia).  Personally, I like it so much :) But the assembly includes an emergency case and a plugin for transliterating slugs at posts (unfortunately, this does not apply to categories and tags, so the solution did not suit me completely ...) </li><li>  Added a fully Russified version of TinyMCE instead of English. </li><li>  Added a large number of extensions, all translated. </li><li>  Included assembly comes 50 different topics.  They did not Russify; nevertheless, very few changes are required (on average, significantly less than in Wordpress themes; a simpler code has an effect);  I think that this will not be a problem, although in the future I plan to transfer them if necessary. </li></ol><h4>  What else will need to be done </h4><ol><li>  Not just translate, but translate the engine qualitatively, especially with regard to the control panel.  Remove discrepancies in terms (I confess, there is no end of work ...), and in some places correct the code for correct translation. </li><li>  Translate topics (at least a few) </li><li>  Improve, improve and once again improve BlogEngine :) In general, I would like the whole translation to go in only one file in the future - and then the site would be translated automatically into the language of the user who has come in without tambourines (ASP.NET technology allows this to be done out of the box).  Beauty :) </li></ol><h4>  Finally, why did I do it </h4><br>  Everything is simple: it was necessary to have on hand a ready-to-install distribution of the blog engine for ASP.NET, Russified enough to give control to the hands of a simple user.  So that there are themes and extensions already.  Those extensions for which use it is not required to enter UserControls in themes.  This, of course, is easy, but not for this case :) <br>  Since BlogEngine has enough problems in Russian-speaking spaces from scratch, and moreover - not all problems are solved by editing scripts (for some reason you need to rebuild the kernel, and then not everyone will open Microsoft Visual Studio for this ...), then rummaged, Failed - and laid out. <br>  Even if no one needs it (after all, we have little use of ASP.NET in such a ‚Äúlight‚Äù web segment, which is a pity, a very good technology), then at least I need it.  :) <br><br>  Download, bude anyone interested, you can <a href="http://gromadin.com/blogs/hard-n-soft/2760">from my site</a> ;  there is a list of used themes and extensions with links to sources.  If something works incorrectly (it may well not have been industrially tested :) - write, we will understand.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64255/</a></p>
