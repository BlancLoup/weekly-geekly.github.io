  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another brilliant idea in the style of a crowdfude TK text game</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Interactive books are popular among a few, but their essence generally migrates to all MMORPGs and based on texts, stories and quests are written, and so on.  Recently, in the comments I suggested using the text game engine and decided to familiarize myself with the possibilities a bit. <br>  It was found that at least several of these engines and their list and list of games is available at <a href="http://rilarhiv.ru/">rilarhiv.ru</a> .  It may not be interesting for everyone, for lovers mostly, many do not write books, but everyone read at least one and did all the quests, maybe someone played in the mud, the game mechanics of interactive books smoothly turned into game and real life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d37/41c/627/d3741c6279f7467e8faaf003e8821788.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first pearl (pearl || perl) - but what if you create a single base of objects and manipulations with them and integrate into each game automatically.  That is, the engine finds words and makes them active, and the user can do with them what the model allows in the engine.  Now you need to create your own scripts for each game - this is easy, but in fact you can make a synthesis of things, that is, if you use items in the book and the engine can process them into others, the script can already work on new items that are not in the book and from this pull out a new plot.  For the reader (user), this is a game component, which may be interesting in terms of finding new moves, for example, there was a game mist, well, all sorts of quests and in general all games where you can craft gear. <br>  But I decided to go even further - to think.  And then I realized that the true diamond could not be craft craft, but the transition of the plot and (evolving to the next step) I suggested that you can enter tags (#phantasy, # sci-fi) and firstly set libraries for crafting. resources, and secondly (and this is the main thing) to do jumps between instances, that is, this is a stargate - we jump from one book to another through some sort of tag + tag.  Suppose I scrapped myself "@ alien_korabl", my book under the tag of science fiction, with this tag there are a dozen more books, in three of them also there is "@ alien_korabl" and the plot has a flight scene, then I get a menu for switching to another book and I appear already in other plot.  About this approach I was thinking recently for alien arena (open source quake3) to jump between servers and maps without constant reloads. <br><br>  In textual RPGs, you can set the qualities of the hero and the inventory, and if you implement the jumping system, these qualities can move from one game to another or serve as an additional criterion for complicating the plot, the choice of settings and so on.  Having a synchronized base of things, you can create their visualization and when parsing the scene fill the picture with details for designers a huge field of action and self-expression, the music library can be filled with each new game, and the user can choose items for his inventory with his actions, creating his own unique action scene Many people like to explore or collect collections - this is about it.  The number of things in the inventory may not be limited, but the scene parsing depends on it and let's say the reader can put together a special hiking collection in a new book. <br>  Playing in mud, I wanted the letters to generate 3D objects and lined up in a terrain map - and this is the next level of abstraction, when each object is assigned a 3D model and the 3D scene is automatically filled, where possible, at home and cars and everything that the book needs, but this is multiglobalism, which cannot be managed without a kickstarter and a stop of millions of lines of code, although many tools already exist and exist, including 3D game engines. <br>  To implement the need a team - let's go! <br>  That is, firstly, to analyze the existing engines, maybe use the existing code, I liked the ‚Äúinsted‚Äù in terms of the availability of the android and epl versions and the already existing urq module, but you need to connect more books, but rather a separate turnip with books. <br>  Secondly, with raws to work on git-hub, and not through svn. <br>  Then you can already look at the books and collect the scripts into a single database (if the license and the author allows), you need to determine in what form it will be stored and how to distinguish the script of the book from the script of the database, how to do overrides, well, in general, I do not like programming, I can to give very valuable advice and I mainly do such fantastic trips here, I almost do not play games - it‚Äôs boring and sad, and I don‚Äôt have anyone to give a hand ... </div>
