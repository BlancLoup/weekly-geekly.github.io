Stereotypes, of course, no one likes, but still there is no ‚Äúsmoke without fire‚Äù, as popular wisdom says.  In recent years, I regularly hear that the Germans are famous for their efficiency literally in everything.  I emphasize, not greed, and efficiency.  Several years ago I visited Germany for the first time, and this installation was repeatedly confirmed by my observations and the words of the Germans themselves.  For example, in Dresden there is a church, which during the war suffered very much from the bombing.  This church is very old, and the stones turned dark brown from time to time, but when it was restored, they collected more or less useful fragments of these ancient stones and used it wherever possible.  Where such ‚Äúnative‚Äù dark-brown pieces, fragments did not reach, they put in pieces of the same breed, but processed quite recently and therefore are much lighter.  So it is today, this restored church, like a spotted cow.  The German, who showed me the city, said with pride that this is a very remarkable expression of the praised German spirit.  A normal German, he says, before moving on to using something new, will make sure that he makes the most of the old things available to him.  That is why in Germany there are surprisingly a lot of very ‚Äúancient‚Äù German cars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year a German joined me.  Whether the renewed ties with Germany made themselves felt, or the notorious crisis in the subconscious pressed, I don‚Äôt know what the matter is, but only the German In I was involved as never before.  When I was in America at the beginning of the summer, I decided to buy some kind of gadget, because they have a lot of things (cursed burzhuinov) in stock and prices are moderate (especially for second-hand and refurbished with a limited warranty).  I put aside US $ 250-300 for this case.  I no longer wanted tools for audio podcasting, because the Rode Podcaster USB microphone had already been purchased in the United States a year earlier, and the portable recorder ZOOM H2 in Hong Kong.  Having teased myself with different pictures and descriptions on the Internet, I identified for myself several directions in which one could move: <br><br>  A. B \ Y or refurbished Iphone 2g (without comment). <br>  B. or: an inexpensive unpretentious camera, "sharpened" under the publication of video on the Internet (for experiments in the field of video podcasting). <br>  V. or: MP3 player (listen to podcasts and audio books). <br>  G. or: Used \ or refurbished device for reading books (for I like to read on trips, and I don‚Äôt carry the library with me from my hand). <br><br>  When these directions were indicated, I plunged into the study of relevant reviews, ratings and prices, and even managed to make a small list of two or three appealing options for each category, and that is where the German In Me entered.  O_o.  And that's how it was.

      Being a podcaster and constantly communicating with geeks, many of which are obvious or latent macnats, I apparently fell under their influence and first of all began to lick at the iPhone.  But the German in me suddenly asked such a direct question: <br>  Do you really NEED? <br>  When I realized that my inner German could not be deceived, I answered honestly: <br>  No, not needed.  I just want it. <br>  Aha  I knew it, the German exclaimed with triumph.  - That is, it's just a whim, a whim, self-indulgence in general, not worthy of spending your pennies. <br>  The German convinced me.  ‚ÄúKaput!‚Äù I said to myself and struck out the iphone from my mental list. <br><br>  The next was a video camera.  By this time, I no longer only had several worthy bidders in mind, but even chose a specific model for myself and - imagine!  - held her in his arms.  German here.  Again with questions: <br>  Why do you need a camera? <br>  What do you mean why...?  I'm almost an internet doer.  Well, there to shoot all.  On the site at publish. <br>  Sure? <br>  Uh-uh ... <br>  You do have a camera with you right now? <br>  Well yes.  There is.  I lent time to Vova. <br>  Well, experiment now.  You will understand that it is yours and you cannot live without it, then you will buy it.  Maybe immediately something decent, but more expensive. <br>  Again, the Germans have nothing to say.  Auvviderzayne camera! <br><br>  Now I had to make a choice between the e-reader and the MP 3 player.  From the reading room, the German quickly dissuaded me too.  He was helped by the release of the Mobile Review podcast with a review of Sony's new reader.  When I started thinking about a new mp3 player, the German reminded me of my phone.  Although he is already a great-grandfather in the market of mobile devices (Sonny Ericsson w810i), but when I bought it, it was positioned as a device ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù for listening to audio in mp3 format.  In short, the German again asked a question that made me think: how many percent do I use the capabilities of my phone?  That is: what is the efficiency of my phone?  A direct question requires an honest answer.  The answer was: and 30% will not.  Then we agreed with the German that I set myself the task of maximizing efficiency, and only having achieved this, allow myself to lick at the new phone. <br><br>  To date, the following has been done: <br><br>  1. I reconfigured Internet access (with the help of a more advanced friend), so the phone stopped ‚Äúdevouring‚Äù all the money after each Internet connection. <br><br>  2. On the phone installed: <br>  - mobile version of Opera <br>  - Google's email client for Gmail. <br>  - set up a Google Calendar possibility of reminders by SMS (very satisfied). <br>  - Twitter client (Twibble was installed first, then switched to jibjib). <br>  - client for Gtalk ot Google (one minus - the skin is gay girl-pink in hearts, since the last release was timed to the day of all lovers). <br><br>  3. I bought a new 4 GB memory card for my phone.  Officially declared support for cards with a capacity of up to 2 GB, but from reliable sources I learned that you can put a card on 4 GB.  Believe, Bought, Won.  Works with a bang. <br><br>  4. Installed on the laptop :: <br>  - A program-converter for texts ReadManiac Builder Wizard, so that the phone turned into a reader. <br>  - ‚ÄúMyPhoneExplorer‚Äù is a program for synchronizing a phone with a computer, and with some services from Google (the program is free, its functionality caused a screech in me.) <br>  - MonkeyMedia, a free program for working with music and video (something aytyunzyoobraznoe, sharpened, including for work with podcasts).  I set it up so that all new podcasts to which I have subscribed are automatically downloaded to the phone. <br><br>  Well, perhaps that's all.  Now I am going to use the phone in this mode for some time.  I have a big request: if I missed something wonderful, due to ignorance and computer incompetence, let me know about it, and I will continue the experiment with pleasure (do not offer games and entertainment).  The bottom line is that now, when I plan to buy myself a new phone or gadget, I will be ready to talk with my inner German. <br><br>  So, the result: The efficiency of my mobile old man soared rapidly.  Life has become easier, life has become more fun.  I began to understand what I would need from my next phone and ... which is important in times of financial crisis, I saved the family budget.  By the way, he added some more to the money saved and brought the whole family to Finland for a weekend break.  All were glad!  :) <br><br>  Denis aka Radio Grinch (heading "Lamera Corner"). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65614/</a></p>
