    <h3>  <b>Techleads program mitap # 1</b> </h3><br><h4>  <b>Mobile Web: Back to the Future</b> <br>  <b>Vitaly Sharovatov, Mobile Web Team Lead and Ruslan Bayramkulov, Senior Mobile Web QA Engineer (Badoo)</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Description:</b> </h5>  The number of users of mobile devices has long exceeded the number of users of desktop computers and laptops.  In turn, the mobile web is the fastest growing mobile platform (according to comScore, 2015).  And if the future is not behind this platform, then at least it will be a noticeable part of it. <br><br>  Long time ago for the Mobile Web in Badoo there were ‚Äúdark times‚Äù.  Designs of native platforms were used and their behavior was emitted.  Even releases happened once a week or two.  About a year ago, the situation began to change for the better.  The mobile web version of Badoo caught up with the number of features of the remaining platforms and showed significant growth in all indicators.  Now the mobile web is released every day. <br><br>  In the report we will tell about what is wrong with the processes inside and outside the team.  For example, we take both our own rake and others, but these are common mistakes in work organization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will not talk about what did not help, and we will not hide anything that worked.  This information will help you work in pleasure.  In the assortment of stories about: <br>  - as one automator covered all regression; <br>  - how the product designers made friends with the development team; <br>  - how greedy programmers took all the responsibility; <br>  - purple QA likes to sit with developers shoulder to shoulder; <br>  - why you need to keep an eye on bugs that break automation, and how to finish a feature after you have finished a feature. <br><br><h4>  " <b>How autotests speed up releases at OK.ru</b> " <br>  <b>Nikita Makarov, Head of Testing (Odnoklassniki)</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Description:</b> </h5>  Since 2012, Odnoklassniki have come a long way in speeding up releases. <br>  One of the success factors was testing automation, which was implemented from scratch. <br>  In my report I will tell: <br>  - about how we taught testers to write autotests; <br>  - they made a team of automators and built a testing automation infrastructure; <br>  - about our mistakes, defeats, useful practices and processes. <br><br><h4>  " <b>Technology vs communication: what is more important?</b> " <br>  <b>Algis Fateev, Head of Testing (Avito)</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Description:</b> </h5>  Over the past few years, the Avito project has been growing in an avalanche-like fashion, since 2012 the development team has grown 20 times.  In a very short time, we have gone from ‚Äúwell, shall we be released?‚Äù To the debugged process of rolling out code into production.  The report will discuss how the team has changed, the development processes and the life cycle of tasks in Avito over the past years, how testing was implemented in the project. <br><br>  In addition, I will separately consider issues related to project manageability with a sharp increase: <br>  - what solutions put forward at the initial stage allowed us to scale quickly; <br>  - what are the main growth diseases we are faced with and how they were solved; <br>  - how to prepare for the case of avalanche growth. <br><br><h4>  " <b>Bugfixing the development process in iOS: a look from two sides</b> " <br>  <b>Ekaterina Nikolaenko, iOS QA Lead and Katerina Trofimenko, iOS Developer (Badoo)</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Description:</b> </h5>  The Badoo app for iOS has been around for about 7 years and has already gone through 4 reincarnations.  Our processes and approaches were not always optimal and we are not the only ones who have known releases through the pain and suffering of all participants in the development process. <br><br>  To find the perfect balance between speed and quality, we decided to refactor the development and testing processes in the iOS team and make releases once a week.  From our report you will learn about the evolution of the team in terms of development and testing.  And also we will tell you how we reduced the crash-rate 40 times. <br><br>  The beginning of the first report at 12:00.  Sign up for the mitap <a href="https://badoo-development.timepad.ru/event/369372/">here</a> . <br><br>  Promo code that must be entered - HABRAGUEST. <br><br>  Come!  We wait! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311574/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311574/</a></p>
