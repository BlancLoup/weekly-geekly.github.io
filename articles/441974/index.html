I want to tell you about a very unusual way to coders.  From historians via HR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h2/dx/0o/h2dx0ojry6r3qigehegeqmhxpbg.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is the real story of one of our employees.  He received a liberal arts education, graduated from the Faculty of History, all his student years studied literature, philosophy, history - nothing close to information technology.  After graduating from the university, it was difficult to get a job in his specialty, and his acquaintances advised him to try his hand at recruiting employees in a personnel agency.  At that time, he was glad of any accident that turned up. <br><br>  In 2014, having worked a little at the agency, having worked with the selection of specialists of a different profile, he realized that it was time to change something, to move on.  The head advised him several promising areas in which the HR manager will never disappear: IT, pharma and the like.  The choice fell on IT.  He began to look for options, came for an interview at one of the banks.  And bingo!  They took in Promsvyazbank.

    <h3>  Jobs in IT-HR: technology delays </h3><br>  At first, our hero had to deal with the usual bank selection, but soon he focused entirely on IT specialists.  In the process of selecting suitable IT candidates, he was confronted with the fact that it was necessary not only to know the terms, various three-letter abbreviations, but also to understand what was hiding behind them.  Super deep knowledge was not required, but it was necessary to have an idea about everything a little. <br><br>  So he worked as an IT recruiter for about 3 years.  The work itself forced me to dig deeper and deeper into IT, and at some point he dug so deep that he himself was on the other side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/kq/oo/xqkqooogb8c6yip7jxseqqu_b5k.png"><br><br>  In general, this is a rare case when someone comes to IT from outside.  More often there are people who initially focused on programming, choosing the appropriate university.  And when a humanist has a crazy idea to escape from HR to IT, a lot of ‚Äúbuts‚Äù immediately arise.  Purely statistically, this almost never happens, however, the hero of our story decided to try to go this way. <br><br><h3>  Self-study: money as a whip </h3><br>  He came across programming only at school: in computer science classes I tried to write something in BASIC, Pascal, and made HTML pages.  And so he decided to write something in a more complex language.  First, took up the java-script.  I started talking to my colleagues on this topic, and they advised to learn Java. <br><br>  He decided to choose an educational online course on Java, watched both free courses and full-fledged paid programs.  And then one colleague advised to pay attention to the proposal from JavaRush.  So began the online training. <br><br>  He had no special illusions, just decided to go to the end - until it becomes quite difficult.  And gradually, getting involved in everything, through a bunch of questions to colleagues, this course finished in about a year.  As a result of training, a large amount of basic knowledge and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãquestions appeared.  Helped colleagues from IT.  They tried to help understand the subtleties, throwing links to useful articles.  Thus, after the basic course, he continued self-study. <br><br>  If you set a goal, you can not throw, otherwise all efforts will be in vain.  In this regard, paid courses are very motivating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/36/ls/j6/36lsj6klb5stwrambeof3tbjyr0.png"><br><br>  On the other hand, online courses are not a panacea.  They do not give a complete baggage of knowledge, after them you can do something primitive, simple, but for a full-fledged corporate development you need to learn a lot more.  And this barrier had to be taken somehow. <br><br><h3>  The knight's move: corporate courses at their own expense </h3><br>  Our renegade historian quite often spoke with Java developers about their work and did not miss the opportunity to ask questions of interest.  As a result, they talked about the situation to their boss, who called our hero and asked about plans for the future.  ‚ÄúI want to become a professional developer,‚Äù he replied. <br><br>  The development manager promised to take a self-taught programmer to his team if he can pull up his skills to a normal level.  Gave materials for study, a voluminous book, practical materials. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cy/3b/4r/cy3b4r1bwsxh1mibwrz1b5konsc.png"><br><br>  At the end of the year, IT specialists had free corporate training, and they offered our hero to join, however, at his own expense.  The courses turned out not cheap, but he was ready for this purposeful investment.  After all, the courses made it possible to get the actual knowledge, the necessary skills that would be required directly in the work. <br><br><h3>  Good luck again: suitable project </h3><br>  When a large ancient project is being developed, it is difficult for a beginner to understand it, especially for those who have no work experience.  But in the new project you can take a person who understands everything in the process of creation.  And then the stars came together.  Not so long ago, a new employee came to the development department, and he began to single-handedly make a fairly large new project within the team.  And there was an understanding that he needed a man to help under simple tasks.  Our self-taught took to gain. <br><br>  He now works in a department that develops a unified front-end banking system.  It does server backing, and he likes it: complex logic, data manipulations, new techniques that can improve and speed up development. <br><br><h3>  And finally </h3><br>  From the moment when our hero wanted to try his hand at IT and about a year and a half before he went to work.  This, of course, does not compare with 5-6 years in high school, which many students spend on studying IT.  There is a difference in what: they get wide knowledge and can choose further development from many options, and in this case, the person had to initially focus as much as possible. <br><br>  For those who want to follow this example, we want to advise one thing: do not be afraid and go to the end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441974/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441974/</a></p>
