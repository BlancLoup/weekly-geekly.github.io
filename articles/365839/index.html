      We give the language definitions from two points of view. <br><br><ol><li>  Language is <i>information</i> , a huge number of connections of the form ‚Äúsign &lt;-&gt; meaning‚Äù (this applies not only to vocabulary, but also grammar: the arrangement of words is also a sign). </li><li>  A language is the <i>skill of</i> instantly operating the ‚Äúsign &lt;-&gt; meaning‚Äù connections that are already known (in the form of specific phrases).  (Compare language with mathematics and natural sciences. In sciences, problems require <i>original,</i> often <i>complex</i> solutions: original connection of existing knowledge into new unique knowledge. Language requires <i>ready-made simple</i> solutions: phrases that have already been heard and used many times. This is what makes language a skill. And here we don‚Äôt consider the level of proficiency that allows us to create outstanding literature, since the task is to learn the usual use of the language, and not to become Joseph Brodsky.) </li></ol><br><br>  We prove that any language is accessible to everyone. <br><br>  <i>Proof the first.</i>  Any skill is mastered through repetition.  And if the creation of original solutions in the sciences may not be available to everyone, then the use of ready-made solutions in the form of language formulas after memorization in repetition is obviously accessible to everyone. <br><br>  <i>Proof the second.</i>  We are all of the same species and it is logical to assume that the ability to develop languages ‚Äã‚Äãformed by evolution manifests itself similarly.  Therefore, there is no such language that would require transcendental abilities.  And, indeed, although it is believed that Russian or Chinese are complex languages, Russian and Chinese, no matter how mediocre, can perfectly (!) Know their native languages.  (The fact that they learned them in childhood does not change anything: the less <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">‚Äúplasticity‚Äù of the brain</a> and the lack of time in an adult can be compensated for by an effective organization of education.) <br><br>  The statement about the availability of languages ‚Äã‚Äãis not obvious, because at first glance it seems to everyone that there are more complex languages, and there are less complex ones.  But the famous Hungarian translator and polyglot, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE">Kato Lomb</a> , graphically describes the speed of progress in learning various languages. <br><br>  The speed of learning Chinese, Russian, Arabic: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/915/093/28891509329445adaa007d5065b3cfae.jpg" alt="Speed ‚Äã‚Äãlearning Chinese, Russian, Arabic"><br><br>  The speed of learning English, Spanish, Italian: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/821/ecf/841/821ecf841584448f981defe54c4858cd.jpg" alt="Speed ‚Äã‚Äãlearning English, Spanish, Italian"><br>  ( <a href="http://www.gumer.info/bibliotek_Buks/Linguist/lomb/04.php">Source</a> .) <br><br>  That is, in her opinion, different language arrangements (for example, differences in writing) and their proximity to their mother tongue can give different speeds of mastering them at different stages, but ultimately, to achieve a good level in any language, it is necessary to have about the same time .  That corresponds with the second proof. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br>  <b>Get motivated in this beautiful <i>fact</i> : you are talented enough to learn any (!) Foreign language.</b> <br><br><h2>  2. Insufficient attention to practice </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/d21/2e9/4c4d212e9af2476f8543edcb7b4526a7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>The emphasis on textbooks and courses, rather than in practice, does not work, which reduces motivation.</b> <br><br>  In fact, more than 99% of the training is practice.  No practice - no training.  (By practice we mean reading, listening, writing, and speaking. Practice is opposed to theory here; doing theory is understanding the grammatical rules, the meaning of new words, the details of the language). <br><br>  <i>Evidence</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Let us recall: language is information (links ‚Äúsign &lt;-&gt; meaning‚Äù), language is a skill.  Each connection must be 1) <i>understand for the first time</i> , 2) be <i>fixed in memory by repetition</i> .  From rough estimates it is easy to see that for a good knowledge of the language, the information contained in one textbook and in one dictionary is sufficient.  If it were not a textbook with a dictionary, but, for example, ordinary prose, then reading this volume would take only a few days.  That is, the amount of time spent on the <i>initial understanding</i> is several days.  But there is a fact - it takes years to learn a language.  And these years are just spent on <i>fixing in memory by repeating</i> what was once first understood in order for it to become a skill. </li><li>  Practice is the only (!) Correct form of repetition studied, because it is practice that is the repetition of what is really necessary to remember, that is, that <i>this</i> meaning in all its details, drawn from the whole accompanying context, is connected <i>precisely</i> with <i>this</i> familiar, which is not just, for example, a word, but a word surrounded by other words.  (What should be remembered is not, for example, the memory of what ‚Äúon‚Äù in English means ‚Äúon‚Äù, and ‚Äúscold‚Äù means ‚Äúscolding.‚Äù These are all crutches that will not allow instantaneous translation of signs into meanings and back. Therefore, cramming such matches is an inefficient waste of time.) </li></ol><br><br>  Thus, if we are talking about a separate connection (a word, for example), then the sequence of its development is: 1) primary understanding, 2) repetition in practice.  If we are talking about learning the language as a whole, then the priorities in the work are: 1) repetition in practice, 2) primary understanding of the new. <br><br>  Here, for the time being, we will only state the priority of practice.  The following describes how to approach it, when it seems that it is still too complicated, and how to allocate time between reading, listening, writing and speaking. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br>  <b>Make 99% of your study language practice.</b>  Use dictionaries, textbooks and reference books in parallel, but only as needed, or systematically, but little by little. <br><br><h2>  3. Abuse of will </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/752/6db/eae/7526dbeae5584efdab8ddef46415fbd6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Abuse of will leads to its rapid exhaustion and the inability to continue working.</b> <br><br>  In fact, the will can not act as the main engine of study. <br><br>  Will is the ability to endure discomfort while pursuing the desired goal (deferred pleasure).  For example, you suffer discomfort from studying at a course or reading a textbook in order to still learn a language. <br><br>  Will is a valuable and relatively quickly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion">consumable resource</a> . <br><br>  Fast expenditure of volitional resources means the impossibility of relying only on him in the long work of learning the language. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br>  <b>Make sure that the application of the will does not bother you.</b> <br><br><h2>  4. Lack of pleasure </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iTvXdoqJTyg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgFOLborrodKFqn2HSD-N61mmZj8A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>The lack of constant pleasure in learning a language makes it impossible to study long enough.</b> <br><br>  One can identify such obstacles in the study as ‚Äúlack of time‚Äù or ‚Äúlack of motivation‚Äù, but in fact the main root cause here is the lack of pleasure. <br><br>  Pleasure is the only worthy engine of study because it <br><br><ul><li>  engine, which is sufficient for the entire long period of study; </li><li>  means emotional involvement that improves memorization; </li><li>  means better concentration that makes learning more effective. </li></ul><br>  The pleasure <i>in the first place</i> is an interesting practice for you personally.  The language here is just a tool to access something valuable for you. <br><br>  The <i>second</i> pleasure lies in the language itself: in its structure and its ‚Äúmusic‚Äù.  But these sources of pleasure will not suit everyone.  Firstly, not all linguists are in the shower.  Secondly, most often it happens that the most practically interesting language is not the most interesting in the sense of its device and its musicality.  An example is English.  But still it is worth choosing those educational materials that most interestingly "reveal" the language in front of you.  Interest here is more expensive than accuracy and completeness of presentation (example: Petrov courses). <br><br>  Oddly enough, people do anything, but not what they really want and joy.  Most often: read a boring textbook and go to courses.  But you should always start with an interesting practice for you personally.  Here are some examples. <br><br><ol><li>  If you want to travel, start here.  Immediately.  You should not postpone what you want, get involved at once in the most interesting (yes at least try to place an order in a restaurant) and then accompany the practice with secondary things: reading dictionaries, textbooks and teaching from teachers.  You can combine: go to any multi-month intensive course abroad. </li><li>  If you want to read your favorite books in the original, read.  Immediately.  Take the simplest book of interest to you, read it, make it your intensive course, if you like (and then many times listen to the audio version of the chosen book; about the benefits of this - next). </li><li>  If you want to become better as a professional, then find the actual interesting source of information on the profession (book, blog, podcast) and read and listen. </li></ol><br>  Once again: practice is primary both for training, and for pleasure.  You should find some of the things that you love that give you access to the language and concentrate on that.  It can be anything: from the libretto to the operas of Wagner to parties in Ibiza.  Then all the training <i>will</i> simply <i>become an integral part of your life in pleasure</i> and the problem of lack of motivation will be solved almost completely.  There is no other way: there is not enough strength on the other way. <br><br>  It is possible to spoil the pleasure a little, if you take on too complicated a task.  For example, being a novice will not just read, for example, Ulysses. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br><ol><li>  <b>Make it so that all your practice is a pleasure: read, listen, write, speak only about what you personally find very interesting.</b> </li><li>  <b>Prefer, other things being equal, to a practice that is only slightly more difficult than the level at which you feel free.</b> </li><li>  <b>Choose educational materials that give an interesting point of view on the language device.</b> </li></ol><br><h2>  5. Ineffective allocation of time between listening, reading, writing and speaking </h2><br>  <b>Inefficient distribution of practice time between reading, listening, writing and speaking skills slows down progress, which reduces motivation</b> . <br><br>  It is advantageous to use the following optimal proportions of the time distribution of practicing different skills at different levels of skill. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/e08/97b/26ce0897b13b4096838a06af19b129e5.png" alt="Effective proportions of vrimaniya skills"><br><br>  <i>Evidence</i> <br><br><ol><li>  Input (reading and listening) is primary, Output (writing and speaking) is secondary. <br><ul><li>  Let us first recall such common concepts as <em>active</em> and <em>passive</em> knowledge (of a language in general and vocabulary in particular).  Passive knowledge is usually considered to be that which only provides understanding (Input), and active knowledge - that which provides the ability to write or say something (Output).  But the formulation itself is misleading: it may seem that active and passive knowledge is knowledge in some different types of memory or one knowledge in different states.  These are erroneous impressions.  In fact, active knowledge is simply knowledge of a larger volume.  The fact is that with Output (letter or speech) to convey meaning, we need to choose from the set of synonyms the best, pick up all the surrounding words, set the form for all words and order.  This requires a large amount of knowledge.  With Input (reading and listening), we need a much smaller amount of knowledge, almost everything is given in a ready-made form: both the necessary synonym, and the necessary form, and the necessary word order.  Even the meaning of a specific word is somewhat clear from the context. </li><li>  It is known that any information that is repeated is remembered, even if there is no special effort to remember it.  Compare two scenarios.  First: we do not have enough knowledge to implement Output and we will immediately deal with them.  This will result in a great deal of work on targeted, special study of all the information that is needed for Output.  The second scenario: we will focus first on Input.  Then many details that we will not pay special attention to will be remembered simply because we will often meet with them, making Input.  These details can be said to be in vain.  The second scenario is much less expensive, therefore it is profitable. </li><li>  (The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe primacy of Input is the most important. Here is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B_%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1_%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">more</a> about this.) </li></ul></li><li>  Listening and reading are equally important and must accompany each other.  First, when reading, we almost always say to ourselves, that is, in fact, we listen to ourselves, and thereby fix the sound of words in memory.  It is important that this sound is correct, that is, it is important to immediately get acquainted with it.  Secondly, before something to learn by ear, it is easier to first disassemble the text. </li><li>  In the choice between writing and speaking, writing must first be given higher priority.  Letter and speech are related: when we write, we say to ourselves.  But when writing more time to think, not to make mistakes and, accordingly, not to contribute to its consolidation.  Please note that the letter does not replace the speech: to say to yourself is not the same thing as being able to articulate by speaking out loud.  Therefore, it is necessary to practice it separately. </li></ol><br>  These three points of evidence and allow to draw a conclusion about the approximate distribution of practice time indicated on the graph.  Please note that all four skills must be given time at any stage.  The question is only in proportions. <br><br>  In the specified distribution, of course (!), Personal preferences should change.  If, for example, a student is so passionate about the practice of oral communication that he does not want to do anything else, then it is more profitable to follow his desires. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br>  <b>Allocate practice time as indicated on the chart above.</b>  Make edits to this distribution only if for you personally it will increase the pleasure of practice. <br><br><h2>  6. Ignoring the practice at the primary level </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/05c/7c5/da505c7c50e84fefa3fde77d09bd321c.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>The conviction that an absolute beginner still needs to complete a course and read a textbook before embarking on practice, makes it impossible to start practice early in pleasure, which reduces motivation.</b> <br><br>  In fact, in order to begin the practice of reading and listening to the simplest things, you only need to know what is described in the first chapters of a self-instruction manual of the language or in some very, very short introductory course (for example, the courses of Petrov).  These are the following things. <br><br><ul><li>  Writing: alphabet, hieroglyphs, or others ... (First of all, in order to start reading). </li><li>  Phonetics: how sounds and sounds of language sound.  (First of all, in order to start listening). </li><li>  Basic grammar. </li></ul><br><br>  These basic things are enough to start reading and listening to the simplest things: adapted sources (in simplified language), short forms (quotes, excerpts, <a href="http://bit.ly/1wjJoQ8">sammari of popular literature</a> , articles). <br><br>  If we talk about the average Russian who graduated from school, the language he studied at school is already familiar to him at this level. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br>  <b>If you are at the very beginning level of training, learn only (!) The very basics and immediately begin to practice.</b> <br><br><h2>  7. Ineffective organization of the practice of hearing </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/535/690/980/535690980fb74c609f924b73eca33b46.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Failure to organize for themselves the difficult practice of hearing slows down progress, which reduces motivation.</b> <br><br>  It is beneficial to organize the practice of listening to pay special attention, because it is the most difficult skill to perform: words go in a continuous stream and there are many variations of their pronunciation. <br><br>  Because of the complexity of the hearing, it is beneficial to first read the material, then listen to it many times (it can be a book, a lecture, a film with subtitles).  In order to have the desire to do this, the material should be extremely interesting for you.  Therefore, once again it is useful to remember: find what you like. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br><ol><li>  <b>Make sure you do not avoid hearing.</b> </li><li>  <b>Listen many times to what has previously been read.</b> </li><li>  <b>With other things being equal, choose sources with high speech density</b> (the speech density in a film is much less than in a podcast or radio program, for example). </li></ol><br><h2>  8. Inefficient organization of speech practice </h2><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31b/8f5/988/31b8f59888ae4f02a7cd586f1d56cf6c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>The inability to organize for themselves the difficult practice of speech slows down progress, which reduces motivation.</b> <br><br>  It is advantageous to organize the practice of speech to pay special attention, because there are many difficulties associated with it: there can be nobody to talk to, it can be scary to speak, incorrect speech leads to fixing errors. <br><br>  The main task is to understand which speech formulas you tend to use and then make them correct.  This can be done in a simple friendly conversation in pleasure.  Just after each such conversation you need to learn the lessons. <br><br><h3>  How to overcome an obstacle </h3><br><ol><li>  <b>Make sure that you do not avoid the practice of speech.</b> </li><li>  When organizing practice <b>1) do not try to avoid mistakes, <i>just speak in pleasure</i> ;</b>  <b>2) ask, if possible, the interlocutor (teacher) to notice all the errors and provide them with a list after (!) The dialogue</b> (of course, then you should remember the correct versions of what was said). </li></ol><br><h2>  9.

And this problem is relevant mainly for vocabulary (words, phrases), all other knowledge in comparison with vocabulary is a drop in the ocean. <br><br>  The optimal rate of repetition - at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">increasing intervals</a> .  For example, you repeat a new learned word every other day, then after three, then after a week, a month, three, a year (there are different algorithms by which such intervals are calculated).  But it is impossible to literally every fragment of the first time studied carried out at such intervals.  But it is nevertheless necessary to secure a collision with the newly studied before it is forgotten.  What is necessary to apply the following approaches. <br><br><h3>  Approaches to the organization of repetition studied </h3><br><h4>  1 approach: goal setting </h4><br>  It is beneficial to have a goal - to master the vocabulary of one limited area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge - and to relate the whole practice to this goal.  Examples of such areas of knowledge: orientation on the terrain on travel, programming, cooking, etc ... Such a restriction will allow to meet the newly learned words more often and thus not allow them to forget. <br><br>  After achieving one goal, you can either put the next one, or go without a goal and apply the language in many areas of knowledge at once. <br><br><h4>  2 approach: systematic training </h4><br>  It is necessary to systematically engage in language as often as possible.  Ideally - every day, albeit little by little. <br><br><h4>  3 approach: ignoring details </h4><br>  While reading and listening, you should not translate many words you have encountered, if the meaning is clear without this, but you should read and listen, keeping the speed, further, because the speed ensures a fairly soon encounter with what has already been learned.  In any case, you will come across a missed one later. <br><br><h4>  4 approach: intensification of practice </h4><br>  For some time, you can make your practice much more intense than the usual level, which will allow you to ‚Äútake a new height‚Äù and then hold it with less effort. <br><br>  Intensive practice can be arranged at home, and you can go abroad (for example, in a language school) for a while. <br><br><h4>  5 approach: use of adapted sources </h4><br>  An adapted source is a source in a simplified language.  In it, the same word or rule is more common, which makes it more likely to encounter the newly studied.  But adapted sources deprive some pleasure because of the artificiality of the content.  Examples of sources: adapted books, articles in simplified English on wikipedia (only <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_English">850 words are used</a> ), <a href="http://bit.ly/1wjJoQ8">sammari of popular literature</a> (they are usually simpler than the original). <br><br><h4>  6 approach: the organization of interval repetitions </h4><br>  You can organize repetitions at strict intervals with the help of special computer applications.  Why do you need to keep words in them and repeat them every day (about 10 minutes).  Words are stored on special cards: on the front side - the word to be studied, on the reverse - meaning.  Looking at the front side you need to remember the meaning and check yourself by reading the back of the card.  In the case of a correct answer, the application will offer to repeat the card at an extended interval, in case of an incorrect answer, the application will offer to repeat the card in the near future. <br><br>  With this approach, the following is very important. <br><br><ol><li>  Repetition should imitate practice (recall: practice is the only true form of repetition studied).  On the cards it is possible to imitate only one type of practice - reading.  (We omit the proof).  Therefore, on the front side should be phrases that set a clear context.  It also means that there is only one meaning of a word per card. </li><li>  On the response side, it is desirable to have an interpretation in the target language, which will provide a more accurate understanding of the meaning and more reading practice (reading interpretations is also practice). </li></ol><br>  Here is how a card could look like compiled according to the following rules (example for English): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7c/e85/b66/d7ce85b6620d4967918f4a6cea7badf0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you stick to this method for a long time, then you are guaranteed to get knowledge of the language, because the vocabulary is growing, practice is easier and you will not notice how much it will become and this will give knowledge of the language. <br><br>  The method is very effective, but, unfortunately, most language learning services that allow you to create cards for interval repetitions do not allow you to do this in the best way.  A good, but time consuming, solution is to create the cards yourself and use the free <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki">Anki</a> program.  (Advice for learners of English: the best explanatory English-English dictionary for this purpose is from the publisher Longman). <br><br><h4>  7 approach: the use of textbooks with good presentation </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This method is suitable for those who find texts in textbooks quite interesting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Good textbooks introduce new words and rules gradually, and provide a repetition of the already studied words and rules at the right time, when they have not had time to forget. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this approach is appropriate only at the initial stage.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> How to overcome an obstacle </font></font></h3><br><ol><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Set a goal to master the vocabulary of one area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge and correlate the practice with this goal.</font></font></b> </li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Exercise systematically as often as possible.</font></font></b> </li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Ignore many words and details if the meaning is clear without them.</font></font></b> </li><li> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Use at least another (!)
