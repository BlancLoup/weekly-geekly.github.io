The consequences of this dramatic event are manifested in various fields.  Including in the sphere of freedom of speech in RuNet. <br><br>  The results of the accident and its discussion in the Russian blogosphere are quite serious (of course, here we do not compare it with human losses): one criminal case per blogger Mikhail Afanasyev <a href="http://rukhakasia.livejournal.com/">rukhakasia</a> .  A less serious consequence is that the diary of an engineer is closed (according to some data from the SS HPP, but more likely from St. Petersburg NPF Rakurs) of a certain greycygnet (according to different opinions - of his own free will). <br><br>  How to call a campaign to cover the accident - sabotage hysteria / PR on blood or real journalism - the moral choice of everyone.  Consider the situation in more detail and summarize the dry results.

      Under the cut some details. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Journalist </h6><br>  The original news from Mikhail Afanasyev (08/20/09, 12:54): <br><blockquote>  A criminal case has been opened against the author of this blog, journalist Mikhail Afanasyev.  Yesterday evening, his keys to the apartment, his mobile phone, and his system unit were confused.  Apparently, as an instrument of crime.  The journalist is charged with ‚Äúpossessing sufficient, reliable and truthful information about the progress of rescue operations at the secondary power plant, accused the leadership of the secondary power plant and the head of the Khakassia Firsov Emergency Situations Ministry of committing a crime under Article 293 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation‚Äù <br><br>  In the case, journalists Erik Chernyshev and Grigory Nazarenko, who worked at the scene of the accident, are passing as witnesses.  They also have mobile phones and system units. <br></blockquote><br>  ( <a href="http://rukhakasia.livejournal.com/11104.html">source</a> ). <br><br>  All three are signatories <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/cachedcopy.xml?f=41b887b35528048bc62fe92ff1d4c187&amp;i=275&amp;m=">to the ‚Äúunderground knock‚Äù letter</a> . <br><br>  I can not be an expert on the recommendations given in the letter (maybe someone will help).  For example, a <a href="http://sceptic-rus.livejournal.com/1856224.html">critical look at the version of the knock</a> .  And <a href="http://tekhnik76.livejournal.com/162517.html">an alternative version of what could be done</a> . <br><br>  The criminal case, in the opinion of the accused, is the result of Shoigu‚Äôs instructions. <br><br><blockquote>  In response to the heated discussion in blogs of information about knocks in the flooded engine room of the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP, the Minister of Civil Defense and Emergencies Sergei Shoigu called for "punishing the distributors of false information and not sowing panic." </blockquote><br>  ( <a href="http://rukhakasia.livejournal.com/11460.html">Source</a> ) <br><br>  Further news about the criminal case was spread across the blogosphere polit.anazhirovannoy Marina Litvinovich.  Stillavin, whose political involvement is no less famous, found that <a href="http://www.yurclub.ru/catalog/user.view.php%3Fid%3D1897816">Eric Chernyshev</a> , who was passing through the investigation, works for Rusal (Company No. 1 in the region is an influential player, but its role in this scam is not very clear - it‚Äôs logical that the process of melting aluminum was supposed to slow down at least). <br><br>  Actually reference to the <a href="http://www.prokrh.ru/novosti/2009-193.html">conclusion of the Khakass prosecutor's office</a> : <br><br><blockquote>  The prosecutor's office of the city of Abakan checked and found legal the initiation of criminal proceedings against the chief editor of the Internet magazine "New Focus" MV Afanasyev.  A check on the fact of the dissemination on the Internet of knowingly false information about the situation at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP accident was carried out by the prosecutor's office of the town of Abakan, then on August 19, 2009, by the department of inquiry of the Department of Internal Affairs for Abakan based on the report of the city‚Äôs assistant prosecutor in respect of Afanasyev Mv  a criminal case was initiated under Part 3 of Article 129 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (defamation, coupled with the prosecution of a person for committing a serious crime).  It was established that on August 18, 2009, Afanasyev M.V., possessing reliable and official information that the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP is in continuous work to eliminate the consequences of the accident and take all necessary measures to find the missing people, distributed to the Internet - the journal "New Focus" deliberately false information, discrediting the honor, dignity and undermining the business reputation of the leadership of the republic and the US hydroelectric station.  In accordance with Art.  146 of the Criminal Procedure Code of the Russian Federation within 24 hours from the moment of initiation of a criminal case, the decision to initiate a criminal case and the materials of the inspection are verified by the prosecutor‚Äôs office of the city of Abakan.  The initiation of a criminal case is recognized as lawful and justified.  Currently, a criminal case is under investigation.  In addition to the above, the prosecutor‚Äôs office of the republic organized a check of other information about the accident at the SSh hydroelectric station, distributed in the media in the Republic of Khakassia. </blockquote><br><br>  Let's leave the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù network (oh, horror), but think about the wording of the charge. <br><br><h6>  Engineer </h6><br>  An interesting and closed blog of the engineer-ASUshnik greycygnet (for the news, thanks to LJ-user <a href="http://orleanz.livejournal.com/446676.html">orleanz</a> ): <br><br>  Here it is worth making a reservation that under the nickname greycygnet, it was not the engineer of the secondary hydroelectric power station that was hiding (as was mentioned on some resources), but ‚Äúthe employee of the company conducting the automation from St. Petersburg, possibly NPF Rakurs.  A new automation system was installed just on GA2, which flew into the sky.  ‚Äú <br><br>  ( <a href="http://avmalgin.livejournal.com/1601659.html%3Fthread%3D34274171">Anonymous comment on avmalgin blog</a> ).  He continues: <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow a commission is working there that decides who is to blame.  Accordingly, the participants of the regatta tensed and gave their employees teams to tense up and crush the public discussion of the last one. " <br><br>  <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/search.xml?author=">Yandex Cache</a> has saved the latest entries (if not deleted, then the <a href="http://altzgamer.ru/files/dnevnik-inzh.docx">docx file of the latest entries here</a> ): <br><br>  I remember this one (dated 08/15/09): <br><blockquote>  Well, in general, that's all. <br><br>  The tests of the GA6 are completed, the reconstruction of the automated process control system of all units of the SSh HPP is also completed. </blockquote><br><br>  Moreover, the anonymous engineer did not write anything special.  Is that the unreality of the terrorist attack, as well as the version with the destruction of the turbine cover (what is no special crime).  In any case, very aggressive characters came running to the user during the online campaign, after which the magazine was deleted. <br><h6>  Results </h6><br>  1. There is a closed diary under the pressure of Internet gopnik. <br>  2. There is a criminal case against a blogger who tried to make the incident widely publicized and accused of defamation against the leadership of the republic and the hydropower station.  Even if you have doubts about the good faith of Afanasyev, the fact of the criminal case, moreover, is inappropriate. <br>  3. There is an informational response from people who are considered to be pro-Kremlin bloggers (not that it was written on them, but in all such situations they occupied a changeable, but always similar to the official-media position). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67704/</a></p>
