      Here's a quote from <a href="https://www.google.com/support/adsense/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26sourceid%3Daso%26answer%3D78426%26medium%3Dlink%26subid%3Dww-ww-et-asui">google.com</a> : <br><blockquote>  <b>What are Rapida payments?</b> <br><br>  Rapida is a payment method that allows you to receive AdSense payments in cash through the Rapida money transfer system.  You can receive payment at your local post office two days after it is sent in accordance with our standard payment schedule. <br><br>  Choosing the Rapida system to receive payments means that you will not have to wait until the check arrives in the mail.  It also allows you to reduce bank fees and reduce the time of clearing associated with the deposit of checks. <br><br>  Rapida payments are made in US dollars.  The exchange rate will be calculated based on the rate used by the local post office on the day the payment is received. </blockquote><br><img src="http://rapida.ru/img/logo.gif" alt="Rapida"><br>  On the website of the rapida payment system, it turned out to be difficult to find any useful information, but oh well, it was clear that some kind of notification would come and you just need to come to the post office! <br><br>  And here begins the most interesting!  :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b92/709/f4e/b92709f4e98557b300b3f3859fccc72e.gif" alt="Post of Russia"><br>  You need to come to the post office, and just get a payment transfer. <br><br>  So, I come (Saturday, the second hour of the day, the sun, wonderful weather). <br><br>  I enter the post office building and I see, oh no, a line.  No, it's not that there is a huge queue, so there are 15 people in total, and 5 maintenance windows, of which only two worked.  Moreover, the people there received pensions, and pensions were issued in onk number 3, despite the fact that as a service to issue pensions was marked on the plate above the window number 2, but oh well. <br><br>  I stand, I listen to the archives of the podcast <a href="http://runetologia.rpod.ru/">Expert show ‚ÄúRunetology‚Äù</a> , I don‚Äôt touch anyone. <br><br>  A parallel develops a scandal on the subject of ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt stand here,‚Äù a scandal, shouts, even someone‚Äôs tears, sending for some reason to ‚Äúyou mustn‚Äôt be on the subway on Monday,‚Äù ... In general, there was some sort of disassembly with me). <br><br>  And then I hear, through the sounds of an expert show, that there is no money on hand.  So, interestingly, the money is transferred through the Post of Russia, but there is no money on hand.  People begin to ask, dear, and when the money will be.  I don‚Äôt know, says a postal worker, we‚Äôll earn money, then we‚Äôll give it away.  Well, an interesting approach, I have a small amount, so I think that I have enough, I stand further. <br><br>  In general, the money was bummed at another box office, it seemed that the queue began to move slowly, and then it was the turn of the pensioner who received something of the order of 20 thousand somewhere.  There was no money for her, so in order to get her pension, she still stood for 20 minutes at the window, until the missing amount in the next box office turned up. <br><br>  And then the cashier from the 3rd cash desk in which I stood informs, everything, there is no money in short, who is to receive transfers, go to the queue at the second cashier, you still will not get anything. <br><br>  Okay, went to the second cashier.  I stood in another queue for another 30 minutes, and now, it was my turn, they asked for the amount, I call it, the cashier checks his bins and says that there is enough money.  Ok, I give her a notice, she enters some numbers into their email applet, and the system finds nothing. <br><br>  In general, she left to figure out where to go, then she comes and tells, go to another department to receive. <br><br>  Well, okay, basically a fool himself, you had to go to one branch, but came to another (the number differs by 1 digit), although the fun system was so hard to do so that money could be received in any branch, considering their problems with money. <br><br>  As a result, he left with nothing, spent 1.5-2 hours, received no money, received a bunch of negative emotions from swearing and hysterics of people in the queue, during which time the money ended in cash twice, in general, shock from the Russian payment reality. <br><br>  Went home, well, and somehow I went so that I passed by the necessary department, decided to stop by, try my luck. <br><br>  In this department of people, it was almost completely absent, and in general it looked like something newer than chtoli, but oh well. <br><br>  I get up to the cashier, people like some kind of translation get there, but something is also wrong with them, the cashier can be seen in confusion, some kind of problem she had previously encountered and does not know how to solve it.  Then, just one more cash desk was released, I approached, asking if I could get a transfer, and in reply: ‚ÄúOh nooo, go to the 3rd cash desk, I have no money.‚Äù <br><br>  I smiled, because it is just ridiculous, and went to the third cashier, but they still understood the problem translation. <br><br>  I look, the second one is free, I come up, ask if it is possible to receive money, they ask me the amount, and after I call it, they check the sufficiency of the money on hand and say that there is enough money. <br><br>  Bottom line: I got my miserable 100 USD. <br><br>  What thoughts I visited. <br><br>  The first thought, when I only stood in the first line and did not know that there were money problems at the post office, I thought that 100 USD is not worth it to lose a sunny day, stand in a line, listen to the squabbles that occur in the line.  And it‚Äôs better, well, I don‚Äôt know, to collect more and withdraw large amounts. <br><br>  Later, I was glad that I had a small amount, because there was not enough money for ‚Äúlarge‚Äù amounts in the Russian Post Office.  And now I do not understand, but what if I wanted to get 1000 USD?  It turns out that to transfer to someone such a sum - please, and then how to get it?  After all, the transfer can be obtained only in the post office that serves the recipient's address, and there may not be money. <br><br>  In general, sadly, this is somehow all, especially in the light of current trends and conversations about e-government. <br><br>  Here and on the site of the Post of Russia the face of the President flaunts <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/923/150/1aa/9231501aa914d273ac99b525d7fd70bd.jpg" alt="The face of the President"><br>  but to sense, the transfer system was made, but there is no money in the system. <br><br>  And note that all this is happening somewhere, and in the Capital of Russia ... what is happening outside MKAD ?! <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89873/</a></p>
