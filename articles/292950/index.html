But before this lyrical omission.  Recently, they have been writing to me that I have forgotten how to write, my texts are unreadable, crooked and look like a stream of consciousness.  Guys, we have here <a href="http://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> and the torments of creativity with the price of an error in the device in the corporation.  So, I apologize - I not only have to deal with new product development, in which there are a lot of open questions and not certainties, but also describe the construction process, which is not completely understood.  At the same time, it seems to me that the stage of finding solutions and concepts is interesting as a topic of posts, and perhaps my practical material will help someone not to make mistakes and develop their project.  So, choose for yourself, read or not read 'raw materials from the fields'. <br><br>  Plus, yesterday I was at the <a href="http://openstack.ru/">Open Stack</a> Birthday <a href="http://openstack.ru/">Party</a> , I congratulate the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ilya.alekseyev/posts/920333308033797%3Fpnref%3Dstory">Russian community and Ilya Alekseev</a> again, and I will say that it is easy to write about Cinder, Nova, Swift - everything is complete and understandable, but it‚Äôs difficult to build something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/160/d60/c02/160d60c02c464306ab6538b3108daef5.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <u>Which player has freemium</u> <br><br>  - <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/prices/">Bitrix24</a> - 12 users <br>  - AmoCRM - 3 jobs <br>  <a href="http://www.moysklad.ru/subscription/">- MoySklad - 1 workplace</a> <br>  - ASoftCRM - one workplace of the simplest configuration <br>  - opiny <br>  - maybe someone else, but I do not see them <br><br>  Interestingly, Bitrix24 announces on its website 500,000 user companies and only 6 or 8 K payers.  Those.  conversion is 1.2 +%.  This is catastrophically low and as a result you can expect a ‚Äúhard‚Äù transfer of a free client base to paid tariffs.  This is my hypothesis and we must look.  If we talk about Evernote, then they have a conversion from a non-paying base of 2-4% (for business solutions). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">UPD</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>UPD</b> : <i><i>I can‚Äôt remember exactly where I read about the paid clients of my colleagues, but after the evening walk, I doubted that paying customers was an order of magnitude less.</i></i>  <i><i>If so, then we have a rather risky picture by metrics.</i></i>  <i><i>Tomorrow I promise to talk with Bitrix and ask for comments on statistics.</i></i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Sergey Ryzhikov declined to comment, but <a href="http://json.tv/ict_video_watch/press-konferentsiya-bitriks24-intervyu-sergey-ryjikov-osnovatel-bitriks24-ideya-vozmojnosti-i-perspektivy-razvitiya-servisa--20150619104627">such statistics</a> is <a href="http://json.tv/ict_video_watch/press-konferentsiya-bitriks24-intervyu-sergey-ryjikov-osnovatel-bitriks24-ideya-vozmojnosti-i-perspektivy-razvitiya-servisa--20150619104627">available online</a> : <i>‚ÄúBy and large, we have an internal indicator, more than 20% of those who registered and looked, 20% of companies become our active customers.‚Äù It</i></i> <i>remains to figure out 500 K is 20% or still 20 from 500.</i> <br><br>  <i>Today I managed to get comments from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/arahimberdiev%3Ffref%3Dts">Askar Rakhimberdiyev</a> (MoiSklad) - he has ‚Äú30% of the active users are free.‚Äù</i>  <i>One third of the active does not pay - whether it is good or not</i> <br></div></div><br><br>  In the practice of Russian SaaS, there were cancellation of free tariffs.  This was done by colleagues from Copiny - they apologized to users and said that small companies did not need their product.  Cancellation, of course, is a personal matter of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/da.chistov%3Ffref%3Dts">Dima Chistov</a> , but, in my opinion, this is a stress for the new SaaS market and a decline in confidence in SaaS as a whole.  We don‚Äôt want to do that, and therefore weigh the pros and cons before making an important decision for us. <br><br>  <u>Important</u> <br><br>  In fact, in a startup, the indicator is not critical of the number of users of the free tariff TOTAL, but the rotation from free to paid.  Rotation = money and you can influence this parameter by the following factors: <br><br><ul><li>  external clear difference between tariffs </li><li>  value of paid functionality - it may turn out that the free part of the service will be enough for the user to solve his tasks </li><li>  self-sufficiency of free functionality - the user will not work on the semifinished product </li><li>  scenarios for using paid and free tariffs - ideally, they may be the same or complement each other </li></ul><br>  At the same time, I believe that "Rotation" is more an external factor that you cannot influence.  For example, how do you know when the director of a client company decides to develop a business and buy more licenses?  Yes, the half-life rule also works for SMB - in 5 years half of the established companies will be closed, among which will be your customers. <br><br>  Following these limitations, we began to develop Freemium. <br><br>  <u>As we argue, the decision has not yet been made</u> <br><br>  We have a too narrow segment in Russia - 10,000 clinics and 100,000 doctors.  If you look at the Beatrix conversions, then we will fly in the local market and we think more about global progress, which is our priority.  Previously, we got 2 scenarios of providing Freemium - the first 1 workplace with full functionality, the second - partial functionality for one or several workplaces. <br><br>  What is Freemium for? <br><br>  1.1.  Removing the cost threshold of the decision on the use of the product - no price; <br>  1.2.  Virality - doctors will tell each other about free; <br>  1.3.  Promotion without a budget of the above. <br><br>  Minuses <br><br>  2.1.  Conversion 1.2-4%; <br>  2.2.  Limited market; <br>  2.3.  It can interfere with earning - some potential users are willing to pay; <br>  2.4.  Costa on hosting; <br>  2.5.  With the free easily go; <br>  2.6.  Switching to paid tariffs is rather a process that lives on its own and you do not affect it. <br><br>  <u>Freemium <a href="http://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> Options</u> <br><br>  <i>"All functionality for one doctor"</i> <br><br>  3.1.  Only for cabinets; <br>  3.2.  There is a trend in the dental market towards urbanization - offices are closing or doctors are going to clinics.  The situation of constant rotation will have a positive effect on conversions into paid tariffs; <br>  3.3.  We receive less money due to the fact that the cabinet as a whole is solvent; <br>  3.4.  Conversion only in case of consolidation or the desire to delegate part of the work to the administrator is ‚Äúrole growth‚Äù.  - i.e.  such a scenario <br>  the doctor works, likes, buys; <br>  3.5.  It is possible and preferable to limit the number of visits, as pressure on the update.  The problem is re-registration on Freemium, that is, there should be no ‚Äúimport-export‚Äù functionality unambiguously. <br><br>  <i><i>"CRM"</i> - only work with clients without BPM ( <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/dentalcloud/blog/17648/">service structure</a></i> ) <br><br>  4.1.  Only customer records and stickers; <br>  4.2.  There is no treatment module and all treatment is in the form of stickers; <br>  4.3.  Additional purchase of the treatment process is possible.  There is some new functionality for which you have to pay; <br>  4.4.  Case - the doctor rents the office and there is no desire to use the bldg automation tool or the doctor "boiles" and he needs to maintain his base; <br>  4.5.  Reporting in this case is removed for the artificial formation of a functional for which you have to pay; <br>  4.6.  The technological complexity of 'picking out' the desired functionality. <br><br>  <i>Functional for several doctors and administrators with restrictions on patient visits</i> <br><br>  5.1.  The technological complexity of 'picking out' the desired functionality. <br>  5.2.  There is no understanding how many visits to include in the tariff. <br>  5.3.  Undefined rotation rate for option <br>  5.4.  At the end of the number of visits or a clear rejection of the use or payment of the service.  Those.  we do not purchase a pool of free users, but the rotation in paid users can be high. <br><br>  Note <br><ul><li>  In both cases, it is possible to connect a communication module for money. </li><li>  Sticker - notes, planning, working with calendars. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbd/3ea/c8f/bbd3eac8feb34e66aa23af6f0c62dd6b.png"><br><br>  <u>Summary</u> <br><br>  It is still scary to announce Freemium in Russia against the background of a solvent automation segment and is obvious for global development.  Perhaps we will conduct a study and decide how to develop. <br><br>  Actually, that's all - I promised to be short and concise.  By the way, this is a cake with DR Open Stack <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c9/067/807/2c90678076a040c8912a1ddd4fd4082a.JPG"><br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/dentalcloud/blog/17648/">Previous materials of the author</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292950/</a></p>
