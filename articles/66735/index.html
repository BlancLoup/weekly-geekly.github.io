Article after article, box after box ... and, behold, the predictable moment came when there was a shortage of free space where you could hide some boxes, instructions, driver disks and other unclaimed wires. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/vhs.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After a bit of defragmenting the situation in the room, I found one hot spot - a bedside table full of old VHS tapes.  ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe director himself‚Äù, ‚ÄúKVN‚Äù - well, what else to say :) I think many will understand me - it seems like no need for a long time, but I‚Äôm somehow sorry to throw it out ... The solution was found rather quickly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Definitely deciding on a bold act, I began to look for a means to digitize everything that even after digitizing I would hardly look :) all the more, there seems to be a place for this case - a recent NAS from <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/60850/">Netgear</a></b> ... well, or the same popcorn, which even more practical.  But first, the whole thing needs to be digitized to a working machine.

      Having looked through the Internet, I decided to stop at a cheap and angry version, the name of which is <b><a href="http://www.leadtek.com/ru/tv_tuner/overview.asp%3Flineid%3D6%26pronameid%3D394">Leadtek WinFast VC100 U.</a></b>  This is a video capture device, the attention to which I stopped for the following reasons.  First, it is cheap - about a thousand rubles.  Secondly, it is miniature (the size of a bit larger than a flash drive!), And I would not like to buy a ‚Äúgiant‚Äù a couple of times, which would then take the same place. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, a small box, inside of which was: <br>  - "Flash Drive" <b>Leadtek WinFast VC100 U</b> ; <br>  - CD with software; <br>  - A small instruction; <br>  - USB-&gt; USB wire <br>  - Splitter from the device to the component S-Video, Audio L / R and composite tulip. <br><br>  The appearance of the device itself to the disgrace is simple - a small oblong cylinder with a large green unsigned button.  More precisely, the signature is - the name of the company is nearby;  and on the other hand, a status LED. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/31.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the one side of the ‚Äúcylinder‚Äù there is a USB-dad, on the other - an audio-video connector into which that splitter from the kit is inserted. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/22.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite its modest white dimensions (if I'm not mistaken, this is one of the smallest devices of its kind), the device knows a lot of things.  For example, take a picture not only from cassette video recorders, but also from DV cameras, DVD recorders and other sources directly to a computer, to MPEG-4/2/1 format.  The green button on the board allows you to take screenshots of the recording at the right time. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is nothing complicated - everything is as simple as possible.  I insert a USB extension cable (it can be done without it, but it was very helpful to me - the last USB port didn‚Äôt have enough space) from the kit, and there was a video capture device.  It is the ‚Äútail‚Äù of the wires, which I have already connected to the video recorder. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/winfast_vc100u_ve_7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt remember that some drivers started to be installed - everything is much simpler.  Put, perhaps, a specialized program-combine - <b><a href="http://www.arcsoft.com/estore/software_title.asp%3FProductCode%3DSBDVD2">ArcSoft ShowBiz DVD 2</a></b> , which, surprisingly, on the author's website is 99.99 forever green presidents. <br><br>  Although the softphone has something ‚Äúnot seriously childish‚Äù in the interface, it offers a huge variety of settings and features - the video can not only be saved and burned to disk, but also edited by adding various effects such as menus, titles and transitions.  By the way, I would like to mention the latter separately - all actions are divided into groups (text, transitions, turning over, pictures, effects, etc.), each action has its own icon and vivid animated preview. Thus, put the soul, though not in Hollywood blockbuster, can even the youngest user.  If it does not confuse the English language interface. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/viz.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It's funny that when the device is disconnected, the program can record what is happening with the webcam. <br><br>  After inserting the cassette and making a sample of the pen, I realized that everything works :) The maximum resolution available was 720x576, which resulted in a good picture (I couldn‚Äôt see a better thing even on a video player).  Having digitized small fragments into different formats, I estimated how much all my cassettes will pour out for me in terms of volume.  Since I didn‚Äôt have any extra 300 + GB, I decided to dwell on the MPEG-1 format, which takes about 10 megabytes per minute. <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arc13.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So now all that‚Äôs left is to convert each cassette from analog to digital - to digitize, digitize and not to digitize. The whole point is that this is done only in the absence of parents - I want to make them a pleasant surprise (yes, throw out all the cassettes) . <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/arc10.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Together with the tapes, it seems, the video tape recorders will go to the next stage of their difficult life journey, which, I don‚Äôt even know where, there are two.  Irrevocably morally obsolete, they served faithfully for more than one year ... but these consoles, with the batteries running down, wrapped in plastic bags ... brr!  How pleasant it is to realize that the place occupied by IT will soon be freed - some kind of a direct feast of soul and body! <br><br><img src="http://boomburum.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, if someone is familiar with the situation that I described, do not pull it on the back and do not be afraid to part with the trash;  translate old memories into a new format and free up space.  I chose <b>WinFast VC100 U</b> from <b>Leadtek</b> and have no regrets!  Some minuses can not name, because  under the task, this baby is completely fit.  But from the pros - a small price and even smaller sizes. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66735/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66735/</a></p>
