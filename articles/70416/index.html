We have two softwares, both recognized industry leaders, but each of them lacks something for happiness.  Ableton has not very convenient transport part, but almost complete freedom of action with audio routing and connected VST effects.  Traktor has the opposite: a very convenient and intuitive transport control panel, but with strained effects.  The built-in ones are, of course, quite good in their own way, but they are far from enough for all needs.  Even for Ableton, the tracks must be specially prepared, and this is not to everyone's liking, and besides, others believe that it‚Äôs too easy to reduce in Ableton and not to work.  :) <br>  The thought arises - it is necessary to cross them somehow.  Brainstorming - Tractor allows you to scatter audio output to different channels, and Ableton allows you to collect audio from different inputs.  Already something. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, immediately to the point.  What do we need?  Need to: <br><ul><li>  UPD.  Vindous :) There is no Mac at hand, so you have to search for the recipe yourself, although if you follow the logic of the topic, you can do it there (UPD. <a href="http://www.djtechtools.com/2008/05/16/smart-mixing-traktor-into-ableton-4-mac/">The recipe is</a> found. Tell me if you need to translate) </li><li>  MIDI controller  I do not see another convenient way of taxiing sound in two programs at once.  I have this Behringer BCD3000 (thanks <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/notxcain/" class="user_link">notxcain</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.native-instruments.com/">Traktor</a> .  In principle, any older version.  I worked with 2.6.1, 3, Scratch Pro 1 </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ableton.com/downloads">Ableton Live!</a>  The version requirements are the same. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.asio4all.com/">ASIO4ALL</a> - a special audio driver that will take over the functions of audio marshutization </li><li>  <a href="http://software.muzychenko.net/eng/vac.html">Virtual Audio Cable</a> ‚Äî Virtual Audio Cable <s>(your KO)</s> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.midiox.com/">MIDI-Yoke</a> - MIDI Message Shuffler </li><li>  <a href="http://www.midiox.com/">MIDI-OX</a> is a special program that allows you to "multiply" one MIDI channel for use in several clients. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.biglimemedia.com/smartmixer/">Belvario's Smart Mixer</a> is a tricky project for Ableton, in which two audio channels with a sidechain compressor compensate for the ‚Äúflaws‚Äù or ‚Äúoversupply‚Äù of the loudness of frequencies when mixed. </li><li>  Well, actually, <a href="http://www.kvraudio.com/get/1315.html">Side Chain Compressor itself</a> </li></ul>  We put the software.  Where you take Tractor, Ableton, and VAC is a matter of conscience, because they are paid :) Just in case, I post programs (except for the main heavyweight characters) <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/13449172000/TDS_AL_soft.rar.html">here</a> (1.8 MB). <br>  My first thing is installing drivers for a MIDI controller, that there is a special shamanism, however, at the simplest request, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHptK-BDQRpo">instructions on YouTube</a> will fall out on Google, so there should be no problems. <br>  Tractor and Ablton put without problems, in my opinion. <br>  ASIO4ALL.  When installing, you need to specify only the first component - ASIO4ALL, the rest (ReWushcel and Off-Line Settings) are not needed. <br>  MIDI-OX - Personal Use will do for us. <br>  VAC - make sure no previous version is installed <br>  After installing MIDI-Yoke, we reboot. <br><br>  Everything, it is possible to begin.

    <h4>  Showdown with MIDI </h4><br>  First of all, we take on MIDI-OX.  If the controller is not already on - it's time to turn it on.  Turned on, the driver is loaded, the device in the system is excellent.  We launch MIDI-OX.  We do not get lost in the nondescript interface and immediately stamp in Options ‚Üí MIDI Devices.  We select our device in MIDI Inputs.  On the right, we see a list of objects where the signal from the BCD3000 will multiply and broadcast.  Add to this list "Output to MIDI Yoke: 1" and "Output to MIDI Yoke: 2".  We get this picture: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500162_1.png"></div><br><br>  After these manipulations, MIDI-OX does not close! <br><br><h4>  Disassembly with audio </h4><br>  With MIDI cables sorted out.  Now to the audio, go to the Control Panel from VAC.  In the Driver parameters, select the number of cables (2) and click Set, the driver restarts.  During the reboot, the sound may disappear in Winamp, for example - do not be alarmed, just click on Play again.  In the parameters of each cable set: <br><ul><li>  SR - 44100 ... 48000 </li><li>  Connected Source Lines - Line </li></ul><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500157_2.png"></div><br><br>  Set again, Exit. <br><br><h4>  Start the Tractor </h4><br>  At the Tractor, in Audio Setup, we indicate the ASIO4ALL device, despite the fact that there are plenty of others: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500158_3.png"></div><br><br>  Then, in the ASIO4ALL control panel, we turn off all audio devices in general, except Out-channels for Virtual Cable 1 and 2: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500166_4.png"></div><br><br>  The tractor may not like this disgrace, so we restart it for loyalty.  After the restart, we go to Output Routing, do this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500155_5.png"></div><br><br>  Our mixer is True External, so we are not surprised. <br>  A little more shamanism with MIDI in the MIDI Setup tab: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500154_6.png"></div><br><br>  Remember, the signal from the BCD3000 is multiplied on Yoke 1 and 2?  From the first one (which is intended for the Tractor) we will receive a control signal for transport (Play / CUE, loupes, jogs, etc.).  And through Yoke 3 we send MIDI Clock, the synchronizing signal for Appleton. <br><br><h4>  Live Ableton </h4><br>  In Ablton, go to Options ‚Üí Preferences, Audio tab / Select the type of driver ASIO and ASIO4ALL.  Have you noticed, did we have a second driver control panel?  Here it is necessary to turn off everything except the VAC inputs and the output of your sound card. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500156_7.png"></div><br><br>  Whoever did not understand - we connected successively the outputs from each Tractor deck with the inputs of Ableton, and all this happiness was sent to the sound card.  But rejoice too early, the magic is not over.  Configuring inputs in Ableton (Input Config): <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500160_8.png"></div><br><br>  Now MIDI: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500164_9.png"></div><br><br>  Now you need to install the VST-plugin compressor.  It's pretty simple - you need to unpack it into a folder (the generally accepted standard is C: \ Prorgam Files [\ Steinberg] \ VstPlugins, but you can do it anyway).  After that, you need to specify this folder on the Folder tab and make a rescan.  The plug-in is installed, you can open Belvario's Smart Mixer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500161_10.png"></div><br><br>  Note that it is important to enable external sync (in the upper left corner, EXT).  Now, we see we have three audio tracks (which is usually enough for a regular DJ), but we‚Äôre set for two, so you can forget about the third one.  If the I / O panel (inputs-outputs) is not already turned on, we include: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500163_11.png"></div><br><br>  On each channel, select Audio From ‚Üí Ext.  In, for the first 1/2, for the second 9/10.  We click Monitor ‚Üí In, we start tracks in the Tractor.  Beauty. <br>  For complete happiness, you need to press Ctrl + M and ‚Äútrain‚Äù Ableton to the faders and knobs on the controller. <br><br><h4>  How to make a headphone output, aka pre-listen, aka CUE / MIX / MASTER? </h4><br>  This should be done in Ableton, but provided that there is not just a single-channel stereo card, but at least two channels.  Alternatively, this card can be switched to multi-channel mode (Surrond or 5.1).  Then we have in Ableton, in the Output Config panel an additional pair of outputs appears, 3/4 for example. <br>  Switch Options ‚Üí Cue Switches, each audio track icon appears with headphones.  By clicking on it, we can listen to the track through the 3/4 output, if we have headphones connected there, and attention, on the master track for Cue Out is 3/4.  To the left of the master fader there is a switch that Solo most likely is now showing, so click on it to make a Cue, that's all. <br><br>  Now you can hang everything on audio tracks in Ableton: filters, equalizers, some CamelSpace or glitch, the master can be equipped with oZone (if the machine allows it) and generally dispose of the sound as your heart desires.  Cool?  Cool.  :) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i500165_12.png"></div><br><br><h4>  FAQ </h4><br><h5>  No sound </h5>  We check the outputs from the Tractor on VAC, check the inputs in Ableton, check how the sound goes through the channels in Ableton, look at the signal monitors and once again carefully do everything as in the topic. <br><br><h5>  I can‚Äôt assign the corresponding controls in the Ableton to the MIDI controller </h5>  Sometimes it helps to install Remote for MIDI Yoke 2 in the Ableton MIDI setup (as in my case, for example). <br><br><h5>  I have a sound card with built-in routing, why the hell is this witchcraft to me? </h5>  Indeed, not necessary.  If there is a built-in out of the box ability to steer audio channels - for God's sake. <br><br><h5>  And I am a very cool DJ, I also need some more audio tracks in Ablton to start broadcasting </h5>  I failed - for some reason the signal is ignored, no matter how I tried to do it.  Perhaps if there are two sound cards, it will be possible to make a detour, but it somehow looks doubtful. <br><br><h5>  The sound "lags"! </h5>  Keep track of the buffer size, audio latency, and its compensation.  Everywhere. <br><br>  Well, that seems to be all.  Ask questions, I will try to answer, but I will immediately say: I am much more specialized in the Tractor than in Ableton.  According to Ableton, there are other guys here who think :) <br><br>  When writing a topic used materials <a href="http://cjcity.ru/content/traktor-plus-ableton.php">CJCity.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70416/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70416/</a></p>
