Part One - Land</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is believed that the creation of cottage settlements (the so-called land-development) is extremely <br>  costly and resource-intensive occupation, requiring a team of specialists in full time, serious connections and a lot of money - in general, inaccessible to mere mortals.  In these articles we will share our experience and knowledge, and tell you how to make the village "on the knee" - with minimal costs, at the party-time, while maintaining mental health. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a2/3e2/c2f/3a23e2c2f15742aab9e2a8e9235d9a34.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  To build a village is not <s>to buy a</s> startup run </h1><br>  I mentioned mental health for a reason.  If you are accustomed to IT business, in which common sense rules all, there is always comprehensive documentation, and any problem has a predictable solution - then the device of affairs in the field of land development will cause you, to put it mildly, to be surprised.  Now I understand perfectly why all the previous attempts by the IT community to make a settlement were ultimately abandoned by the founders. <br><br>  The first article of the cycle will be devoted to the second most important resource in land development (after mental stability) - directly to the ground.  The article is based on our own experience in the construction of the <a href="http://poselok-programmistov.ru/">village of programmers</a> and the experience of those professionals with whom we eventually began to cooperate.

      <br>
      So, the land in the Russian Federation can be obtained in one of four main ways. <br><br><h1>  1. Collective farm shares </h1><br>  As you remember, in the distant nineties we were all lucky enough to become holders of vouchers.  This voucher could be invested in some special scam, and then discussed with friends, whose scam is cooler.  Part of the population of this joy was deprived.  These people were then called "collective farmers", and everyone laughed at them.  Instead of a big beautiful voucher, they were given some ‚Äúshares‚Äù - useless shares in the stupid property of their collective farm. <br><br>  As you understand, the situation has changed somewhat since then, and now collective farmers can laugh at the unlucky scam investors.  Most of the land suitable for development, is the property of collective farms.  As a rule, one share is equivalent to a plot of land ranging from 2 to 20 hectares. <br><br>  It would seem that a happy collective farmer can now sell his share to another downshifter who escaped from the city and live in clover for a couple of years, but this was not the case.  The fact is that a collective farmer cannot sell or donate a share to NOT a member of a collective-farm cooperative.  The only legal way for a collective farmer to transfer his share is to die, having bequeathed his share to a chosen person.  As you know, not everyone is ready for this. <br><br>  That is - except for jokes - the status of a collective farmer, as conceived by the lawmakers, has become something of a noble title.  He gives a lot of privileges - a normal share in liquid assets and the opportunity to buy such shares from their fellow nobles.  You can pass it only by inheritance - everything is like that of nobles, no trade. <br><br>  Of course, there is still a ghostly possibility that you will be accepted as a member of a collective-farm cooperative for a certain official contribution to this cooperative.  But in practice, most collective farms today are bankrupt.  Of course, each such collective farm has a special office in the business center with a team of crisis managers who will acquaint you with the statute, tell you how to get documents for joining, collect an extraordinary meeting of board members and solemnly accept a savior investor in their cooperative. <br><br>  In general, the collective farmer cannot sell his share.  He will first have to ‚Äúsingle out‚Äù this share - i.e.  to transform its share in common property into a specific land plot.  This procedure requires the participation of certified cadastral engineers, requires a minimum of 100 tr.  costs, takes from six months to a year, requires a lot of unobvious manipulations and the constant study of new obstacles that lawmakers do not get tired to grind. <br><br>  Therefore, the mighty entrepreneurial spirit of the Russian people has invented an ingenious scheme in its simplicity how to overcome all this: <br><ol><li>  A collective farmer writes a power of attorney in the name of the buyer, who trusts him to allocate his share to a specific land plot, and then donate the resulting plot to any other person; </li><li>  Immediately receives all the money on hand; </li><li>  The buyer begins his self-agonizing journey and, if the titled nobleman did not change his mind at the last moment and did not withdraw the power of attorney, in the end he became the owner of the desired site. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  The important point is that if someone follows this path, it is important to state in the power of attorney the right to donate - and not to sell.  The fact is that the sale of a plot of agricultural land usually requires special coordination in the relevant department of the region - while donating such coordination does not require. </blockquote><br><h1>  2. Public bidding </h1><br>  As a matter of fact, this is the path we tried to go at the very beginning.  In theory, this path looks like this: <br><br><ol><li>  You look after a plot on a public cadastral map that is not a ‚Äúshare‚Äù and is not cadastral registered.  It is also important that the site does not belong to the lands of the state forest fund - unless, of course, you do not have a few extra years in reserve and a spare nervous system; </li><li>  Go to the administration of the rural settlement to which the site belongs, and ask them to issue an order for the survey.  Since this does not bind them to anything, obstacles usually do not arise; </li><li>  You go to any land survey office, pay them money from your pocket, they put the land on cadastral registration - now the land officially exists - but still belongs to the specified rural settlement; </li><li>  Ask the administration to appoint a public auction.  They set a starting price and print an ad in the local newspaper a month before the auction; </li><li>  Win public tenders and get your plot. </li></ol><br><blockquote>  As I said, in the beginning we tried to go along this path.  The head of one of the districts of the region was interested in our project and he promised full assistance with the completion of this complicated procedure.  We picked up the site, registered the company and filed an application.  We were promised to issue an order on the survey in a week.  Unfortunately, this week lasted about 4 months, and by the time we received the coveted order, we had already got used to waiting and had bought the land elsewhere. </blockquote><br>  Of course, in this procedure, too, everything goes, to put it mildly, not quite smoothly.  Her main problem is the non-guaranteed result, since  Anyone can join the ‚Äúfight‚Äù for a plot for which you have already spent time and energy. <br><br>  Legally, this procedure is arranged so brilliantly that it actually led to the formation of a new unusual profession.  In general, some sharp-witted individuals register applications for such tenders solely for the purpose of interfering with the main interested party.  In case they win the bidding, but cannot ultimately pay for the lot, they risk only the sum of the initial payment, which, as a rule, is small.  And the main interest is the risk of losing a month or two of time, because they do not appoint repeated auctions faster.  As a result, with such figures he has to negotiate "in the corridor", unfastening them cash for withdrawing applications from the auction. <br><br><h1>  3. beg </h1><br>  Strange as it may sound, the state can be begged out.  Rules of procedure may vary depending on the region, but the essence is approximately as follows - you choose a village and write a statement to the administration of a rural settlement with a request to provide a site for permanent residence. <br><br>  If you are not yet the happy owner of the individual housing plot, you seem to be obliged to provide such a plot.  Naturally, if there are vacant land plots in the residential area in the general layout of this settlement.  Here, too, everything is not so smooth - the procedure lasts for months, but formally you have no influence on the decision on where your section will be. <br><br>  The maximum size of such a site, of course, will be limited by the regulations of the region, but it does not matter.  The guys who are engaged in this scheme, as a rule, simply immediately sell the formed plot or simply transfer it to another owner, and repeat the procedure again. <br><br><h1>  4. Buy </h1><br>  You understand that all these procedures will take a lot of time.  You will have to learn a lot of legal subtleties, acquire negotiation skills with the kolkhoz nobility and spend a lot of nerves - because such things do not pass smoothly.  Therefore, the most suitable plot for you is the easiest to buy, of course. <br><br>  Awkward legislation, consisting of ridiculous procedures, regulations and restrictions, made it extremely difficult to directly transfer land to mere mortals, resulting in a whole profession of people who "do the land."  These guys, combining all the above methods and launching several processes at the same time, try to form the most attractive sites and sell them to the final consumer. <br><br>  In general, we ultimately found this path to be optimal for a programmer community.  All this costs not such big (by the ITC standards) money, and it saves a lot of time.  When we were tired of waiting for the results from the attempt to make the project together with the authorities, we simply began to look at the appropriate options on Avito.  It turned out that the landowners-professionals (and not those who designed the inherited share) ask for quite adequate money for their products.  Finding the right option is a matter of a couple of weeks. <br><br>  PS <br>  In the next article of the cycle, we will tell you in popular language about land surveying - the legal procedure for dividing a large area into many small ones, as well as about the transfer of land from one category to another.  By the way, <a href="http://poselok-programmistov.ru/">in the village of programmers,</a> we began to build houses for the first customers.  We will tell about planning, architecture and technology in one of the following articles. <br><br>  You can follow our news and the progress of construction on our <a href="https://twitter.com/it_poselok">twitter</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/it_poselok/">instagram</a> . <br><br>  Pps <br>  The post was moved from Habr at the request of the administration, since  content is "okologikovsky". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364817/</a></p>
