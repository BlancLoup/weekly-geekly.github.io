Features of this camera, 3X inch touchscreen display for easy control and viewing, high-quality Full HD video, ultra-high sensitivity in low light conditions and waterproof case (GC-WP10 only). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One of the features is the 3X inch display, which displays floating graphic icons for maximum convenience and intuitive control.  The second is the size of the display itself, allowing you to view the footage that you just shot with maximum convenience, both as a group and alone.  Plus, the touch screen's pressure sensing system integrated into the display allows you to control the device even with gloves, which is very comfortable when recording winter sports or in cold weather.

      PICSIO camcorder CMOS sensor allows you to create JPEG photos with natural, non-interpolated resolution of up to 5 megapixels.  In addition, it allows you to record Full HD video with a resolution of up to 1920x1080P / 25 fps, which, together with the image stabilization system, makes it possible to view high-quality footage on an HDTV using an HDMI output.  Also available, 4x digital zoom and a huge variety of shooting modes.  Video is recorded in MPEG-4 AVC / H.264, and saved as an MP4 file, which is easily edited and can be sent to multiple devices without loss of time and quality.  One of the functions - Time-Lapse - allows you to record a long event, or a natural phenomenon, in a short file. <br><br>  The pre-installed software, LoiLoScope EX for Windows, allows you to intuitively and quickly edit and upload footage to YouTube, Facebook, export to iTunes, and so on.  It starts automatically as soon as the camcorder is connected to any computer, which means there is no need to install programs or work with the camcorder only on your computer.  The download process, as well as editing, is available in just a few simple steps.  In addition, the camcorder integrates a whole set of special effects to create creative videos, the management of which is based on easy access to functions using icons and simply dragging necessary elements.  This software supports Windows 7 Multi-Touch, therefore, it can also be controlled using any PC with a touch interface.  Also, there is the ability to transfer data to directly create a DVD. <br><br>  Mac users can use iFrame video recording, ideal for editing in iMovie.  Also, both cameras offer the ability to record in IFrame format, a specially designed format to simplify the process of editing video on a computer to the maximum.  IFrame is compatible with both Mac and PC applications that support this format. <br><br>  The PICSIO camcorder is equipped with an SD / SDHC / SDXC memory card slot. <br><br>  Pocket video camera GC-FM2 is equipped with a special, extended to the side with a USB connector.  Both models are charged by USB connector, therefore, you can continue shooting immediately after transferring files, without fear of discharging the battery.  A USB cable is supplied, and an AC adapter is available as an option. <br><br>  The model of the video camera PICSIO GC-WP10 is waterproof at a depth of 3 meters (IPX8 certificate) that allows you to create video under water, at high humidity or in the rain.  If we talk about the huge number of cameras that broke due to a fall into the pool or pond, GC-WP10 provides much-needed insurance against such accidents.  The GC-WP10 video camera also has an integrated MP3 voice recorder that allows you to record absolutely everything, from lecture to party at a concert. <br><br>  JVC GC-WP10 and GC-FM2 will be available from September 1 <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102487/</a></p>
