  <section class="page js-page"><h1>As we studied project management in the mountains. Vertex # 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After a successful spring project on organizing and conducting a training expedition to the <a title="How we studied project management in the mountains" href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/181498">First Peak</a> , we decided to continue.  The story of the first peak here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/181498/">habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/181498</a> .  Read about the second peak in this article.  Third, we are just starting to cook.  If you want to participate - contact the bottom of the article. <br><br><h1>  Kickoff meeting </h1>  The Independence Day of Ukraine loomed on the horizon, and I wanted to not just swell these three days off, but to spend it in a useful and interesting way.  In this uncomplicated way, we received the <strong>first limitation of the</strong> project - the duration of the expedition itself and the duration of the preparation.  <strong>The second limitation was</strong> remembered from the last expedition - we had a shortage of height on the first peak, so we had to choose the highest of the 2.5-thousand meters.  This peak was the highest point in Bulgaria - <a title="Mount Musala" href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Mount Musala</a> (2925 m).  <strong>The third restriction</strong> came up with themselves, guided solely by greed - you need to keep within <strong>$ 300</strong> per person. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The introductory meeting was started as competent project managers - by studying the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits/264354113708024">lessons learned from the experience of the</a> past project.  And although the memories were still fresh in the memory, it was helpful to read the recommendations: <br><ul><li>  If possible, reduce the time of preparation and ascent: This will reduce the likelihood of "losing" team members due to financial, social and health risks.  A longer time interval is an increase in the likelihood of unforeseen external and internal factors, from changes in the weather to legislation and attitude in the team. </li><li>  Money for a hike to collect immediately, after the status meeting, to exclude the refusal to participate in the climb due to "unforeseen financial expenses." </li><li>  Create a project page, you can google, it would be very convenient.  Here you can lay out the documents.  This is very important in the virtual management of the project team. </li></ul><br>  We had so little time, just a month to organize the ascent in a foreign country, in which none of the participants had previously been.  The page was created right on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits">Facebook</a> , and the documents, as last time, decided to upload to <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> . <br><br>  We took the documents on the <a title="1st peak" href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D297">first peak</a> and quickly re-registered them under the requirements of the new project - we received <a title="Project Charter &amp; quot; Musala.BG &amp; quot;" href="https://www.facebook.com/download/preview/482231425204137">the project charter</a> , the expedition support management plan and the expedition communications management plan.  All documents of our expeditions published for general access are constantly available at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits/files">facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits/files</a> .

      Then we focused on the expedition preparation schedule, the main stages of which turned out to be: <br><ol><li>  Elaboration of logistics Kiev-Sofia-Kiev and purchase of tickets. </li><li>  Preparation of documents for visas and visas. </li><li>  Development of the Action Plan and the expedition route. </li><li>  Acquisition of the missing equipment and ammunition. </li></ol><br>  This time they decided not to use <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/">SmartSheet</a> , but simply created a schedule file in <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project/professional-project-management-desktop-software-project-professional-FX103797571.aspx">MS Project Professional 2013</a> and published it for the working group on <a href="http://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> .  It turned out "cheap and angry", but not very convenient.  Therefore, <a href="http://www.smartsheet.com/">SmartSheet</a> continues to hold leading positions in my personal rating of cloud software for managing small projects.  This is not an advertisement, but a personal impression.  Unfortunately, no one, except ourselves, has yet sponsored our expeditions. <br><br><h1>  Training </h1>  The sequence of preparation for the expedition ranked in terms of costs.  Offhand, it turned out that most of the project budget "bite off" the road to Bulgaria and back.  Slightly less, but also a sensitive piece - visas.  The third part is the smallest - moving and housing in Bulgaria. <br><br>  To begin with, we calculated the most optimal movement Kiev-Sofia-Kiev.  Consideration included options: <br><ul><li>  <strong>Personal car</strong> - at a cost of almost as the plane (expensive gasoline abroad, payment for roads and transit).  Plus, it was necessary to prepare the car for a lengthy droge. </li><li>  <strong>Bus</strong> and <strong>train</strong> - cheap, but long.  Running late.  At the same time, the bus is also tiring - shaking for a day while sitting in a chair. </li><li>  As a result, the chosen <strong>aircraft</strong> - flights <a href="http://wizzair.com/">WizzAir</a> Zhulyany-Sofia and Sofia-Zhulyany.  Very convenient, because of Zhulyan.  Yes, and Sofia Airport is located in the city. </li></ul><br>  True, there was one "ambush" - there was no return flight on August 26.  Therefore, we took the return tickets for the 27th, and this is already a working day.  The plane arrives at 16:25.  While the customs and baggage - in the office, even at the end of the day do not have time.  Therefore, we decided to dig deep into our time limit "to <em>meet 3 days</em> ."  Why did we set this limit?  Because they wanted the expedition not to intersect with the main work.  And if we do this so that we do not ‚Äúskip‚Äù the work, but still be in Bulgaria?  How? <a href=""><img alt="Working day at Sofia Airport" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7e/48a/d21/d7e48ad21e2da838384478684250b8ea.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a>  And just to find a good connection to the I-no and the outlet near the airport or at the Sofia airport itself.  Fortunately, the office has <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/ru-ru/lync/">MS Lync</a> , <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/microsoft-exchange-server-2013-email-for-business-email-server-FX103765014.aspx">MS Exchange</a> , and other things for remote work.  We can call the office in Ukraine, respond to the mail, organize meetings ... But this makes our luggage weighed down on the weight of laptops / tablets and chargers that can‚Äôt be left unattended in the camp and have to be dragged to Musala. <br><br>  The price of round-trip flights was $ 173.5 each.  So we have <strong>$ 126.5</strong> per person from the budget.  The next big expense is visas.  And here the classic positive risk worked, which the last <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> began to call unequivocally - ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù.  As it turned out, I do not need a Bulgarian visa, because I have a Schengen cartoon.  I made a request to the embassy and received the following answer: " <em>The Bulgarian embassy draws attention, having a valid Schengen visa with multiple entries, a national visa of an EU member state or a residence permit in one of the countries of the Schengen Union, the applicant can stay in Bulgaria for up to 90 days within each 6-month period, without opening a visa to Bulgaria. The total number of days allowed to stay in the European Union is not calculated from the visa.</em> " <br>  The only difficulty is that insurance is still needed for those who only receive a visa, and for those who have it.  We were told that the existence of insurance is checked upon entry into the country (which in the end turned out to be untrue).  So as not to risk, we quickly made the most simple travel insurance in Ingo Ukraine.  To the question " <em>This is just tourism, or you will be doing something extreme,</em> " answered " <em>Just tourism</em> ."  Issue price - $ 5.4 per person.  Total from the budget, we have <strong>$ 121.1</strong> per person. <br><br>  We collected all the documents for a visa, but it turned out that the consulate does not accept a printout of the hotel booking from <a href="http://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a> .  Here you have the first <a href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D383%26doc_id%3D544">Change Request</a> !  Now you need to somehow get a copy of the reservation on the letterhead of the hotel.  They corresponded and called up with the Bulgarians - but they are as mandatory as the Ukrainians ... I had to suffer and spend extra money.  The consulate of Bulgaria is only in Odessa and the documents had to be submitted in Kiev through the <a href="http://www.bulgariavisa-ukraine.com/">visa center</a> .  Therefore, the costs were 35 ‚Ç¨ of the visa fee for the visa, 22 ‚Ç¨ for the visa fee, 30 ‚Ç¨ for the accommodation and 9.51 ‚Ç¨ for the SWIFT payment to Bulgaria.  Total: ‚Ç¨ 96.51 or $ 128.2. <br><br>  After receiving visas from the budget, we have <strong>$ 57</strong> per person.  Bulgaria, of course, is not a very expensive country, but according to calculations, transportation costs in the country will take another $ 31, so there will be only <strong>$ 26 in</strong> reserve for each ... To the book!  Not even drink wine ... And still need to climb to the top ... <br><br>  In parallel with the purchase of tickets and obtaining visas, we completed all the project management documents and created an <b>Action Plan and itinerary</b> .  The document turned out to be such that it is possible to send a little bit literate ram on a trip and he will return from there satisfied and with magnets.  The document itself is <a href="https://attachment.fbsbx.com/file_download.php%3Fid%3D604023792975136%26amp%3Beid%3DAStrxlL6Et94ePzrlmpdjA5OpDaCdtY2kHgervR8XN0Oh4elQCpFFp18haqCIbZncw4%26amp%3Binline%3D1%26amp%3Bext%3D1379618641%26amp%3Bhash%3DASv4JLt_uBnVL6R0">HERE</a> , and I will retreat lyrically: <br><br>  This document is based on the <a href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D383%26doc_id%3D558">Configuration Management Plan</a> , but the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> template has been completely redesigned to fit our industry and our project.  By making such significant changes to the document, we followed the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.pmi.org/PMBOK-Guide-and-Standards/Standards-Library-of-PMI-Global-Standards.aspx">PMBOK</a> .  Quote: ‚Äú <em>The main purpose of the PMBOK Guide is to highlight that part of the Project Management Knowledge Base, which is generally considered good practice.</em>  <em>Good practice does not mean, however, that the knowledge described should always be applied in the same way to all projects;</em>  <em>The organization and / or project management team independently determines the applicability of this knowledge to a particular project</em> . ‚Äù <br>  <strong>What we did!</strong>  Now imagine that an engineer receives such a document (or rather creates it himself) and performs its technical work on it.  The sequence of actions is already modeled to the smallest detail.  The probability of not doing the job is minimal, and even if something goes wrong, the maturity of the thoughts and ideas of the engineer to do this job is such that he quickly finds workarounds and accomplishes the task.  If a person has modeled everything in his head, he has already foreseen most of the problems and has come up with ways to solve them - it remains only to put this into practice. <br><br>  I have a good friend from Lviv.  At school, in the classroom, they were divided into boys and girls.  The boys were taught to shoot, march, disassemble, assemble the machine, etc., and the girls were taught health care.  And she did not want to be a nurse, she wanted to shoot and disassemble-assemble the machine gun.  She wanted it so much that she remembered the posters from the CWP office and every evening, going to bed, she ‚Äúpracticed‚Äù AK-47 disassembly-assembly in her mind.  And then the military director received the order ‚ÄúTo send two boys and two girls to the city competitions from the school‚Äù.  The voivod began frantically searching for girls who could at least approach the machine gun.  I found only one biathlete, and my friend volunteered herself.  When the military commander asked them to train, from the first time she gave out an army standard for speed ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù.  NVP-Schnick ohrenel!  And the thing happened in Soviet times in Lviv, and you know, the rumors that every third Hutsul family had Schmeiser stashed somewhere hidden ... Well, he cautiously finds out <em>‚ÄúIs there no case in your machine?</em>  ".  ‚Äú <em>No,</em> ‚Äù she answered, and told him how she had done that. <br>  Today she is a professional certified project manager.  And in his spare time from idleness, he writes a PhD thesis on project management. <br>  A good one turned out to be a parable about how useful it is to model future execution in my head.  And the idea tends to materialize! <br><br><h1>  Go-go-go decision </h1>  3 days before the departure, a meeting of the ‚ÄúGo / No-Go Decision‚Äù was held.  Spent purely formally, because everything is ready.  It remains only to conduct the expedition itself.  Even jokingly called the meeting " <strong>Go-Go-Go</strong> Decision". <br><br>  Since the project budget was running out, and the expedition itself had not yet begun, we decided to save money and purchased supplies in Ukraine.  A classic set of tourists - suhpay, sneakers, canned food. <br><br><h1>  Expedition </h1>  <em>You want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Folk wisdom</em> <br><br>  Any plan is like a smaller suit.  It is incredibly cramped and uncomfortable, and it always cracks at the seams.  So it is with us - even the moment of collecting the backpack, everything went according to plan, or rather not quite according to Pan ... <br><br>  I remembered that a tourist can with gas in the plane could not be transported.  Accordingly, it was necessary to deviate from the route, find a tourist shop in Sofia and buy gas.  It was necessary to use a temporary reserve for unforeseen circumstances, the benefit of the schedule of all transport to the foot of Mount Musala was prescribed from the landing of the aircraft until the night. <br><br>  But further - more.  Departure of the aircraft was delayed for 10 minutes.  Arrived 15 minutes later.  Because of this, we missed the bus to the city, and the next - in half an hour.  While they were running for gas, it began to rain.  Used it as a reason to buy a 3G card.  While we waited for a downpour, bought and set up a 3G card, we had accumulated a total backlog from the schedule at 1:00.  Because of this, Samokov-Borovets did not have time for the last bus.  We traveled by taxi, and this is an overrun of 4 levs ($ 3) per person.  Total from the budget we have left <strong>$ 23</strong> / person. <br><br>  The taxi driver tried to check in at the hotel for 20 lev / night.  Telling us stories that there are no campsites in Borovets.  I took out the printed <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download/604023792975136/7PMS.2.1.6%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582.pdf">Action Plan</a> and showed him the address and telephone number.  He dialed the number and reluctantly took us to the campsite.  Helping a taxi driver did not bring him additional income, and our budget has not decreased.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download/604023792975136/7PMS.2.1.6%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582.pdf">The plan</a> worked! <br><br>  There was a thunderstorm in Borovets.  Tent set in the rain.  We sat in it.  We made a short ‚Äúattack‚Äù on the nearest store and ‚Äúgot‚Äù a bottle of Bulgarian red.  Preparing dinner right in the tent.  They waited for the rain to end.  They drank wine.  When the rain ended, already in the dark we went to look for from where the lift to the mountain Yastrebets starts.  Checked the start time of the robots and the cost of the climb.  Everything coincided to a second and <a href="http://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">stotinki</a> .  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/download/604023792975136/7PMS.2.1.6%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582.pdf">The plan</a> worked! <br><br>  We had an early breakfast and advanced to storm the mountains.  The route of climbing Musala is as follows: <br><ol><li>  On the gondola lift to the mountain Yastrebets (2369m). </li><li>  Walking along the path to the hut Musala. </li><li>  Further in the direction of the Aleko peak to the lakes at an altitude of 2545 m. </li><li>  We pass the lake and after that strictly upwards on Musala (2926m). </li></ol><br>  As planned - at 12:00 we were on top.  The goal of the project has been achieved! <br> <a href=""><img alt="Musala - the second peak of project management" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/220/2ed/d1c/2202edd1c9307bcb34f601376e37568e.jpg" width="625" height="416"></a> <br><br>  And it was here that we made the biggest and most frequent mistake of the project manager - we <b>relaxed the bread</b> . <br><br>  The following way was planned: Malka Musala (2902m) - Irechek (2852m) - Deno (2790m) - Shatyr (2495m) - then at Sladkata Voda, reaching the top of 2208m left to the ‚ÄúSitnyakovo Express‚Äù chair (1778m) and on it go down to Borovets (especially since we have a ticket for the ascent). <br><br>  In the beginning everything was great.  The trail is difficult, in some places almost steep, but with stretched steel cables. <br> <a href=""><img alt="Steep descent" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fb/520/35e/7fb52035e844756bd70fe9fa0e036a95.jpg" width="625" height="351"></a> <br>  So we moved forward quite vigorously and quickly.  Then the path began to disappear periodically and reappear.  Two hours later, she disappeared completely.  Moving along the landmarks, we wandered into such a thick juniper that we could not move further along the ridge.  That's where we were rescued, bought in the rain, 3G.  Download <a href="http://androzic.com/">Androzic</a> , reviewed the map and our GPS-coordinates.  The trail has long gone sharp left to the river.  If we go further in a straight line, then we leave to the precipice.  It will be nice to see Borovets from the cliff, but it was not clear how to get down from this cliff and we did not check this path.  I didn't want to go back either.  We still had two hours to close the lifts.  Therefore, we chose the only wrong decision - to go down stupidly down to the river through the thickets of juniper. <br><br>  With each step down, the juniper grew taller and reached a height of 2-3 meters.  It was possible to move only by stepping on the trunks of the lower trees and holding on to the branches of the upper ones.  The main thing was not to fall down between the trees and not go to the dead dry juniper.  If he fell down, then at first it hurt about something that hit and twisted his arms, and then lost a lot of time squeezing between the branches of the trees and climbing onto the tops.  If you go out to drywood, you will come across large and small branches that the hard mountain wind has turned into sharply sharpened sabers and spears. <br><br>  Time went by.  The water is over.  The trees were getting higher.  Forces became less and less.  The group broke up, but saved the radio.  Periodically, we called each other and got together.  From fatigue, we increasingly fell through the trees, because of which we spent even more strength ... <br><br>  When we went down to the river, half an hour remained before the lift stop and we had two options: <br><ol><li>  For half an hour run 3 km with a climb of 600 meters. </li><li>  Two hours to go down along the river bed. </li></ol><br>  Chose the second.  There was no strength to run.  Get undressed, showered in the river.  Juniper needles, I found even in shorts.  And not one or two, but a whole zhmenyu.  Water scored in the same river.  I wanted to drink in such a way that unsanitary conditions did not interest anyone. <br><br>  Were washed, rested, had a snack and slowly moved down to Borovets.  We returned to the camp at 7 pm  After 10 hours 25 km along the mountain paths and without them.  We recorded the track: <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps%3Fq%3Ddocs:%252F%252F0ByB3dxwoS2ynQ2s5cEY2VmxzcEk%26amp%3Bie%3DUTF8%26amp%3Bll%3D42.222202,23.592223%26amp%3Bspn%3D0.087246,0.028902%26amp%3Bt%3Dm%26amp%3Bsource%3Dembed">HERE</a> . <br><br>  All evening stupid, sat, talked.  We went to bed early.  And in the morning they moved to the side of Sofia.  Then everything was according to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/download/604023792975136/7PMS.2.1.6%2520%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%2520%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520%25D0%25B8%2520%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2588%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2582.pdf">Plan</a> .  If there were any deviations, they were made consciously. <br><br>  During the day we walked around Sofia.  In the evening, they gave praise to the Gods of Project Management - they drank wine, ate meat.  Bulgaria is a very cheap country.  ‚ÄúPraise‚Äù cost us $ 19 per person and we still have <strong>$ 4 of</strong> unspent project budget.  Project management taxis! <br><br>  The next day, I wanted to check if the flight safety system would notice the tourist can with gas packed in a <a href="http://www.jetboil.com/">JetBoil</a> iron jacket?  Noticed! <br>  For the second time in my life <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D343512125685337%26amp%3Bset%3Da.459308047439077.92397.100000796589189">I was escorted to the airport‚Äôs bins</a> for the removal of a can of gas. <br><br>  And WizzAir, as always, lingered.  We arrived in Kiev with a delay of 1.5 hours. <br><br><h1>  Experience lessons </h1>  <em>Mountains are energy accumulators, and man is a transformer.</em>  <em>If you go to the mountains, you need to be able to transform the energy they give you.</em>  <em>If you do not transform it, then you get no benefit.</em> <em><br></em>  <em><a href="http://www.astrohoroscope.info/ru/uchitel5.htm">Teacher.</a></em>  <em><a href="http://www.astrohoroscope.info/ru/uchitel5.htm">Life in the mountains</a></em> <br><br>  Gathered after the expedition and brought experience lessons.  The document itself is <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits/326736980803070">HERE</a> , and the recommendations are: <br><ol><li>  When departing from Zhulyan, they waited in the terminal for 1.5 hours.  We believe that you can come to the check-in later, since there is not much point in being the first in the queue for landing. </li><li>  Carefully consider the time when using low-cost airlines.  Since on the way back from Sofia to Zhuliany the plane was delayed for an hour and a half. </li><li>  It is advisable to have small money with you.  For example, it is difficult to settle with a taxi driver.  We told him that we practically had no money (so that he would not ‚Äúwind up the price‚Äù), but when we had to pay him, somehow, he didn‚Äôt take out ‚Ç¨ 100 from his pocket. </li><li>  When using public transport, it is desirable to form not only the route of this transport over time, but also to know the list of stops for better orientation. </li><li>  In the Action Plan, it was time to buy a 3G card, but did not take into account the fact that they spent about an hour setting up the gadget. </li><li>  Pay attention to the stress in foreign names (tops, hotels, places, etc.).  They did not immediately understand that MusalA is correct, but not Musal. </li><li>  Particular attention should be paid to the issue of navigation.  Ideally, have a separate device. </li></ol><br><br><h1>  PS </h1>  We begin to prepare the third peak.  The next peak will be increased not upwards, but ‚Äúwide.‚Äù  We are planning a winter ascent or in the Carpathians, or in the Crimea.  In addition to studying project management methodology, we want to practice climbing skills - walking in a bundle, using ice axes, walking in cats and snowshoes, climbing rocks, etc. <br><br>  If you want to participate - write to me at <strong><a href="">anatoly@savin.pm</a></strong> . <br>  The ‚Äú7 Summits of PM‚Äù group on Facebook: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits">www.facebook.com/groups/7PMSummits</a></strong> <br>  Description of the idea on PMDoc.ru: <a href="http://www.pmdoc.ru/%3Fpage_id%3D239"><strong>Educational program "Seven peaks of project management"</strong></a> <br><br><hr>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/project-management-institute/">Project Management Project Management Training Courses</a> <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194526/</a></p>
