  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tired of topics about startups for startups. You too?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I increasingly see topics like ‚ÄúI want to make a startup, but I don‚Äôt have experience‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to make a startup, but I don‚Äôt know which one‚Äù. <br><br>  To be honest, constantly reading this nonsense on the first page of Habr is a little depressing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I think everyone is interested in reading about new, interesting ideas and startups like the Purchaser.  However, a lot of people simply can not imagine what a serious Internet project is, how to do it and how it threatens. <br><br>  I will try to explain what a startup is: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      1) <b>Idea.</b>  Ideally, this should be a really unusual idea that has not yet been implemented on the Internet, from which you can really find your niche.  We need a very clear understanding of the market, analytics.  If the project consists of 95% of already implemented ideas, it will most likely be a waste of time and money. <br><br>  2) <b>Money.</b>  You need to understand that a startup is more expensive than 100K dollars.  This is at least an office team.  Many of course will say that you can make a startup with a friend Vasya talking on the Internet.  It is impossible. <br><br>  3) <b>Team.</b>  This is at least a project manager, designer, coder, 2-3 programmers, content manager / moderator.  And it should be people with experience, especially the project manager, who will have to plan the activity of other employees and be the engine of the entire project.  The right guys usually lure away ready-made teams, realizing that creating a team with 0 is hard and takes time. <br><br>  4) <b>Hard schedule.</b>  A start-up is a hard-mode operation for 12-14 hours a day, even if you do not play the role of Project Managera directly.  If you plan to do a project in your free time, this is not a startup. <br><br>  5) <b>Monetization.</b>  It is necessary to clearly imagine how and at the expense of what the project will subsequently pay off (unless, of course, you have no intentions and the opportunity to profit later on by increasing the cost of the project) <br>  Many people do not understand this simple truth and say that as soon as they make a startup, everyone will immediately run to advertise on it, buy paid services, and then get very bitterly disappointed. <br><br>  And all this does not at all exempt from a high probability of failing.  For some reason, too few people think about this.  Therefore, at the planning stage of a startup in a business plan, there must be a section dedicated to actions if everything goes bad (how will the loan be returned? How to pay the payroll). <br><br>  I hope, with this post I will at least a little explain to people that startups are not as simple as they may seem.  What can not be done with a friend Vasya "on the knee" in his spare time from work. <br><br>  <b>Better spend this time with your family.</b> <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  <b>Upd1</b> According to numerous requests from workers, I will explain what a startup IMHO is. <br>  A startup is an innovative ambitious project, which is designed to fill some sane niche in the market by providing new services (new services may be in traditional segments, for example the selection of work).  Under the understanding of a startup, projects that aim to set a monthly turnover of less than 10 thousand dollars that do not carry anything new are not suitable, or the utility of a new service is negligible. <br><br>  <b>Upd2</b> Main message: Guys, let's publish really interesting things, with a serious approach.  Enough to publish crap about nedtamptapy. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49609/</a></p>
