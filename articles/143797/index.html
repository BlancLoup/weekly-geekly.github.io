  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make money on a desktop application?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, many companies, both large and not so, have a desire to earn income and try different directions.  Orientation to one narrow segment of the market is an erroneous strategy in conditions of rapid and highly competitive development of modern technologies in all areas and thematic niches. <br><br>  Many companies develop small useful applications not for the order, but for themselves.  Such applications will make the company a good reputation as a portfolio, allow users to familiarize the application users with the company, as well as gain invaluable development experience.  Such applications are usually distributed free of charge, in order to attract the largest number of active users.  But sooner or later the question of the monetization of applications becomes.  Any business loves an account and a balance, and if the costs invested in development have not paid off, this is a signal to the manager. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Modern marketing market offers various options for monetizing applications.  And only the right combination of a software product and a way to make money on it can bring a considerable income to the company.  The main options for monetization are: <br><br><ul><li>  development of Premium versions or additions to the software product; </li><li>  introducing advertising affiliate programs; </li><li>  selling a popular application; </li><li>  appeal for a voluntary contribution to the development of the application by users; </li><li>  implementation of contextual advertising in the application </li></ul>

      <b>Premium version</b> <br><br>  Plan the development of the application so that you can enter two options for its use: free and premium. <br><br>  A free application should have a sufficiently wide and attractive functionality to attract the interest and attention of modern audiences.  Do not expect that users will immediately be ready to pay for additional features.  In many cases, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmonetization comes already during the success of the free application.  This is the best option, because  for earnings you will only need to think over and modify the Premium version, and most importantly, correctly present the information about it to users. <br><br>  The main task when starting your project is to create the widest possible range of active users.  Accumulate satisfied users and addictive to the use of your software.  Add and expand the functionality of both the main and Premium versions. <br><br>  With proper selection of functionality over time, users will begin to buy the application to expand their capabilities.  When calculating the cost of the application and the desired income, remember that, according to research, less than 10% of users will switch to the paid version. <br><br>  Remember, creating Premuim versions is not the most profitable, but a stable and predictable way to monetize your ideas.  And most importantly, it is fair to the user, because the modern user is very picky, and his respect will serve you in the future more than once. <br><br>  <b>Partnership programs</b> <br><br>  In developing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application, it is worthwhile to think in parallel about what additional relevant information and services you can provide to your future user.  Ideas may appear while viewing affiliate offers from various companies in your niche.  Sometimes, you can go the opposite way - to get the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application based on the attractive offers of affiliate programs. <br><br>  Placing information about partners in your software in the form of banners, buttons, or in a more original way will give the user the opportunity to use the services of your partners, and you will earn on their activity.  Pick a way of advertising carefully and unobtrusively, so that the user does not ask himself the question why he uses your application, remember excessive advertising - this is annoyance and doubt. <br><br>  The key to the success of this type of advertising is a good combination of application functionality and affiliate program topics; take the time to thoroughly and thoroughly work out this issue.  Let the advertising component be a logical addition to your software, and affiliate services and information will be useful and thematic. <br><br>  <b>App sale</b> <br><br>  If the application is in demand and is popular among users, there is always a company or investor willing to buy this application.  Be sure that customers who offer you a serious amount for the rights to your software already have a business strategy and know how to capitalize on its popularity or on a customer base. <br><br>  In many cases, this is a good way to monetize, since you will not always be able to implement a strategy similar to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour customers.  Before refusing a deal, estimate how much was spent on development, whether you currently have a clear plan for developing and monetizing the application, how much you can get from monetization, and most importantly, how quickly this will happen. <br><br>  <b>Donate</b> <br><br>  If none of the options above does not suit you, try simply enabling your users to subsidize the development of your application.  A direct and frank request will have a more effective response in the hearts of users and may bring you a very good income.  With this approach, you will not lose your users and their respect. <br><br>  <b>contextual advertising</b> <br><br>  One of the most unsuccessful options for earning an application is the placement of contextual advertising, similar to Google Adsense.  There are a number of reasons why you should think about the feasibility of such monetization: <br><br>  Users do not like explicit advertising, especially in desktop applications.  Users are more loyal to contextual advertising on the web, but the desktop is associated by people with a personal and comfortable place to work and play, and the appearance of advertising is an invasion of personal space and violates the boundaries of the territory of comfort.  Therefore, intrusive and frank advertising in the application provokes a massive rejection of its use, especially if there are alternative applications with similar functionality.  Therefore, when starting an advertising campaign, consider whether you are ready to lose your users? <br><br>  Regardless of the path that you take, the most important thing is the creative approach and original ideas.  The creative component in promoting your application will be able to ensure you success and income.  Therefore, we wish you original ideas and inspiration in the promotion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143797/</a></p>
