      So why, on the one hand, do these topics attract us, and on the other, they cannot be repeated?  How to treat the instructions and how to extract from this more good than we used to? <br><br>  This will be discussed further. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is the instruction?  This is an understandable sequence of actions due to the reasons or pattern of actions to achieve a certain result.  The instruction does not accept deviations from the sequence of actions. <br>  The simplest example.  Adjust TV channels.  You go to the desired menu item, find the autotune and start the channel search.  All is ready.  Works?  - Of course it works. <br><br>  There are a lot of such instructions and they are often associated with inanimate objects - computers, telephones, microwaves ... Or with animate objects, but where there is no choice.  For example, a tourist guide to the city in which the route is laid from the museum to the theater.  Walk 500 meters straight, turn right, after 300 meters turn left <br>  . <br>  Everyone learned such instructions?  For sure. <br><br>  Than they are good - they are clear, simple, consistent, not subject to doubt and achievable.  People are so used to them that they begin to try them on in an area where instructions give nothing. <br><br>  Instructions are unacceptable in relationships between people.  In business, and business is first and foremost relations between people, in family and friendship ... <br><br>  Such instructions are unacceptable in conditions of uncertainty, for example in the works.  In those areas where human consciousness is involved. <br><br>  From here we get frustrated by following the instructions to achieve our goals.  ‚ÄúI tried, but I failed to build a business‚Äù, ‚ÄúProbably in this manual, something is missing, so I could not repeat the marketing campaign‚Äù ... <br><br>  People make 2 major mistakes when trying to copy step-by-step algorithms or templates from other people.  First of all, it is a habit to take instructions as dogmas, and not as personal experience of the creator of instructions.  Secondly, they do not fill the implementation of their task on the basis of instructions with emotional meaning. <br><br>  Absolutely not true is the position "Now I will do everything as indicated in the step-by-step algorithm and I will succeed - I will find new customers, I will write an article, I will develop a new product."  This blind copying does not allow your consciousness to express itself and create something new.  But this is the meaning of our consciousness.  Therefore, the only correct thought that should visit you when using someone else's template ‚ÄúThis person managed to do it and he went through the following steps.  How to make it so that I got even better based on his experience.  What can I take from the experience and what can I change or improve.  I understand that since he will not be able to do it, but I can and should do even better. ‚ÄùEvery task has many solutions and ways to achieve it.  The pattern in this case is just one of many possible options. <br><br>  We do not ask ourselves another major question.  "What did the creator of the instruction feel when he went through all her steps to achieve the result?"  What actually made step-by-step instruction possible?  This is one of the most important issues.  Because we are not driven by instructions, but by emotions.  In certain circumstances, we are able to move mountains and achieve our goals.  At the same time, we clearly do not feel sad and definitely don‚Äôt feel indifference.  We are on an emotional high.  Is this the answer to the question of why people achieve results? <br><br>  Do we really need someone else's algorithm for solving problems?  Or we need only a belief in success and an emotional charge, and the rest we will find how to do it.  Or on the contrary, when we have instruction on our hands, but no desire to use it, are we able to achieve something? <br><br>  What is the instruction?  This is the framework of other circumstances.  The truth is that it is impossible to create something of your own and new, being in slavery of circumstances.  And by copying other people's actions, we do just that. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">More on slavery circumstances</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tv8Pa15Dt-c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgu_CSm5Hl5k5dX7J2QvaFjHp2NEw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br>  As soon as you see another instruction on how to do what you have not done in 5 simple steps, do not try to copy another person‚Äôs action template.  Treat it as one of many solutions and be sure to fill your way with emotions.  Then the instructions and templates will really benefit you and eliminate frustration. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293768/</a></p>
