  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of the needs of customers sites</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The purpose of the review is to streamline ideas about the web development market.  Ordered ideas about the needs will further allow you to choose a suitable niche for your development and to determine the competitive advantages of a new product or web resource.  The review may be useful to developers who are launching new solutions to the market or to novice web studios, since in conditions of high competition it is necessary to identify the needs of customers not covered (or create such needs) and gain a foothold in the market.  The point of view "Customer" is caused by the need to first of all solve the tasks of the customer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Customer groups and their needs: </h4><br>  Customers can be divided into several large groups. <br><ol><li>  Large companies (holdings, corporations): products or services of large companies are often produced and sold in large volumes or are very expensive.  Clients of such companies, as a rule, are also large representatives of the markets. <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  Image sites - a unique, complex design, a lot of videos. </li><li>  Sites with a list of products, but without prices and other commercial information.  They are purely exploratory in nature. </li><li>  Several languages </li><li>  Customers want to see a profitable presentation of their company‚Äôs activities on the site. In addition, the sites contain feedback forms or other functionality that allows the user to get a personal response (for example, to calculate electricity debt as on <a href="http://www.sesb.ru/">www.sesb.ru</a> ). </li></ul><br></li><li>  Large distributors: are engaged in wholesale and retail sales of consumer goods.  Distributors may have a large, extensive network of warehouses, but often have only one major resource on the network.  The site contains a voluminous catalog and is used for online purchases. <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  Online stores - the main part of the site is an extensive catalog with product descriptions. </li><li>  Good resource optimization for search engines (friendly url, meta for each product, unique texts). </li><li>  User account. </li><li>  High performance and site resiliency.  It should be designed for a large number of visitors. </li><li>  Fast synchronization of the site directory with accounting systems and aggregators (Yandex.Market, price.ru). </li><li>  Receive electronic money. </li><li>  Online consultant </li></ul><br></li><li>  Financial and legal organizations: banks, accounting services agencies, real estate agencies and others. <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  The site should contain many different forms of feedback.  These can be: the form Question specialist, various calculators (loans, cost of services, etc.) </li><li>  Large Banks or insurance companies may also have an extensive network of branches, the content on the site should vary depending on the region of the user. </li><li>  It is desirable on the site to reflect information about exchange rates and other financial information in real time. </li><li>  Multilingualism </li><li>  Recently, Internet banks have become increasingly common.  Through the Internet bank, the site user gets the opportunity to manage their deposits.  A mandatory requirement for an online banking system is the security of transactions and protection from hacking attempts. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Mass media: the main goal is to attract a large audience to the resource, get feedback from the audience and make money on advertising. <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  Placing heterogeneous content (mainly videos, articles) </li><li>  A large number of staff to fill the site </li><li>  Ability to discuss content (comments, forums, voting) </li><li>  High performance </li><li>  Mobile versions </li><li>  Newsletters </li><li>  <a href="http://wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258B">Microformats</a> support </li><li>  RSS or Atom support </li><li>  Online broadcast support </li></ul><br></li><li>  State structures and institutions: create websites for public relations.  The main goal is to unload the staff of the institution through the withdrawal of operations on the network.  Such operations can be: applications for passports, an appointment at the clinic, certificates of taxes or fines.  For example, <a href="http://www.r77.nalog.ru/">www.r77.nalog.ru</a> . <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  Increased resistance to crashes and attacks </li><li>  Personal user accounts </li><li>  If the state.  The inter-regional structure must take into account the region of the user in the display of content. </li><li>  Availability of specialized feedback forms </li></ul><br>  Large state institutions have an extensive structure of representative offices in the regions.  Each representative can have a resource on the network.  This fact again creates an important need for centralized management of all sites in the structure, that is, minimizing maintenance costs. <br></li></ol><br>  In addition to the listed categories of large customers, there may be categories whose overall global goal is to make money online by creating content and attracting audiences. <br>  Of course, there are customers in the market whose business is smaller and the needs are largely covered by those already described. <br><br><h4>  Types of sites depending on the goals of the customer </h4><br><br><h5>  Internet portals </h5><br>  Recently, the concept of an Internet portal has become more ‚Äúblurred‚Äù, however, it is worth distinguishing two groups of sites that fall under the definition.

    <h6>  Public themed portals </h6><br>  Thematic portals are created mainly to increase the interest of the audience to a particular topic.  Owners make money from advertisements and subscriptions from companies that provide services or products related to the portal or related topics. <br>  Feature of the resource in its size.  As a rule, if we talk about popular portals, these are very large sites with high traffic and often subject to attacks.  With the development of the Internet, many thematic portals are increasingly growing and also need territorial distribution (for example, the portal about the construction and repair of <a href="http://vashdom.ru/">vashdom.ru</a> ). <br>  Another feature of such resources is the presence of forums and guest books that need constant moderation.  At such resources, various contests and polls are held to stimulate the demand for products or services of sponsors and advertisers. <br>  Portals can contain small directories of hosted companies.  This fact forms another possible need - to link goods or services from catalogs with an article.  Naturally, the unique content and optimization of the portal comes first. <br>  Needs: <br><ul><li>  The site should contain a variety of content elements (news feeds, articles, blogs, directories, etc.) </li><li>  It is necessary to create links between content elements (for example, attach the same video to the article and to the news line without duplication) </li><li>  Convenient moderation of forums and comments </li><li>  Resistance to high loads and failures </li><li>  Mobile versions </li><li>  Site search should produce the most relevant results. </li></ul><br>  The feature of portals can be in the laboriousness of creating content, because it is required to combine many different elements into one material, for example, if there is a need to insert an advertising banner into the text of the article.  An important requirement in this case will be the versatility and ease in the development of the administrative panel. <br><br><h6>  Corporate Portals </h6><br>  Corporate portals are used within large organizations for employee communication, discussion, and sharing of general information.  The peculiarity of such portals is a special approach to information security, because in many cases the corporate portal is part of a public site.  Corporate portals should be protected by authorization via LDAP or similar. <br>  The key tasks to be performed by the corporate portal can also be attributed <br><ul><li>  Task management </li><li>  Integration with accounting systems </li><li>  Forum </li><li>  Time tracking </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Social networks and community blogs </h5><br>  Social networks, the main purpose of which is to accumulate a large number of users, can also be general and thematic, but they are created mainly as a platform for collecting statistics, broadcasting advertising, as well as for monetizing through social applications or the provision of paid accounts. <br>  Basic requirements here: <br><ul><li>  Resistance to stresses and attacks </li><li>  Availability of mobile versions </li><li>  Multilingualism </li><li>  A convenient moderation system, where it is needed </li><li>  Good search engine optimization </li></ul><br>  A possible need for blogging sites in the future may be tracking and filtering plagiarism, as well as integration with individual blogs via OpenID or Oauth. <br><br><h5>  Online stores </h5><br>  Having an online store is more profitable than a store of glass and concrete by minimizing the cost of its creation and maintenance.  With the advent of a large number of engines for web commerce, you can open a store in a short time and at almost no cost.  The customer will focus on further promotion of the store in the network and its advertising. <br>  One of the key goals in the creation of a store is to achieve maximum confidence in the resource.  A high level of customer confidence will increase attendance and number of purchases.  Therefore, the functionality of an online store must meet the following requirements: <br><ul><li>  Good product descriptions that must be kept up to date </li><li>  Quick response to an order or user question. </li><li>  Availability of reviews on products and stores </li><li>  Availability of catalog search or advanced product filter </li><li>  Reception of electronic money </li></ul><br>  Particular attention should be paid to the usability of the site.  It is important to clarify the need to fill in certain fields when placing an order.  On any page, the user must see the phone number by which he can contact the store operator.  It is worth noting that the appearance of any errors or inaccuracies in the work of the store is unacceptable, as this can permanently deprive the store of user confidence. <br>  It is <a href="http://infomsk.ru/interview/generalnyiy_direktor_internet-magazina_OZON_o_perspektivah_razvitiya_internet_torgovli">believed</a> that the volume of online commerce in the near future will only grow, because the main business need is satisfied - an increase in sales. <br><br><h5>  Promotional sites </h5><br>  The main task of promotional sites is advertising a product, service or promotion.  Such a site is likely to be promoted by advertising in the media.  A resource can be stimulated by an attractive design, possibly with interactive elements. <br>  Requirements: <br><ul><li>  Support for flash or its analogs (maybe even a site entirely made on flash) </li><li>  Feedback </li><li>  Audio, Video content on the site </li></ul><br>  Special requirements in such projects are given to design and constitute the largest share of the budget.  There is another feature - it is possible that there are game elements in the content or various contests, for example, on the site <a href="http://foxy.yandex.ru/">http://foxy.yandex.ru</a> you can participate in the ‚Äúrace‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Web services </h5><br>  This is a special category of web resources.  They may look like sites, or they may exist for complex data processing, or as interfaces between heterogeneous applications and resources on a network.  Services use various protocols in their work, for example, XML-RPC, SOAP.  Web service requirements vary greatly depending on the goals and objectives. <br><br><h5>  Help systems </h5><br>  Resources on the Internet containing various documentation or dictionaries.  In essence, they represent a large network of interconnected web pages.  With the ability to constantly update them from the browser.  The main requirements for such systems will be: <br><ul><li>  Multilingualism </li><li>  Its simple markup language </li></ul><br>  In general, consideration of needs in terms of goals and objectives of customers can be completed.  The next step should be a review and analysis of the needs of developers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120146/</a></p>
