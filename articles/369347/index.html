I recommend downloading the application before purchasing the game and understanding it - after all, this is hardcore, the paper box is expensive. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9">Hive</a> </h3><br>  2 players, fast, medium difficulty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b0/38b/0bd/9b038b0bd7bc4127ba3e9fa23280c138.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It's like chess, only without a field, with insects, and not at all like chess.  Here is the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/236749/">GameDev-post</a> about the dude who made this game.  In general, the magical story of how the nerd came out and Steam.  And for us the most important thing is that the game after the semi-annual tests on children was recognized to be very good for increasing the concentration of attention. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdEdWk09bUQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjQFHM_q9ThurRZXtQgWajpmXK56A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/nefarius/">Nefarius</a> </h3><br>  2-6 players, short, cheerful, medium difficulty (if there is a person who read the rules in advance). <br><br>  The game is about crazy scientists trying to take over the world.  You are one of them, and you have to beat the competition.  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/216133/">post about the development</a> .  In short, the coolest in the game is its infinite variety, because every time the world is new thanks to the rules change cards.  If you have a beard or glasses - you will like it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cc/ab3/dbb/8ccab3dbb3ec455b9c1e4b45f27cff93.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/soprotivlenie/">Resistance</a> </h3><br>  5-10 players, difficult (skill decides), long, you can play at the table in the evening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d25/f4b/eec/d25f4beec2244194ae8cf014bcd95ada.jpg"><br><br>  The post about how we painted the poster had to be cut out since Habr became the media (more precisely, it entered the register of distributors of something-there).  But nothing, I still have the source of this poster: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f9/fc0/35c/7f9fc035cca5ff0df8a21a1d7a770d0f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <sup>It seems that it was before heartbleed</sup> <br><br>  And the game itself is a logical and very deductive Mafia.  I don‚Äôt really like the Mafia in the original, but I just adore Resistance for a lot of logical arguments and the ability to calculate people reasonably.  And for the calm nature of the game.  Very, highly recommended - probably my favorite game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mG5xpWjwbNw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRy2JbRPbHMGGAk3sBOtq1El6Xrg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/manhattan_project/">Manhattan Project</a> </h3><br>  2-5 players, difficult, long. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e8/84a/cf3/5e884acf320349c5b424a875d87fec38.jpg"><br><br>  You manage the nuclear program of a single country.  A game about project management and tremendous tactical depth.  It teaches to keep everything under control at once, but it is suitable only for sophisticated players (for beginners it will be difficult and boring).  In general, a piece of hardcore. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6wbluDkkbg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjXLOErOF53BctZdIP30sSkSSS8hw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/startup/">Startup</a> </h3><br>  2-6 players, difficult, long. <br><br>  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/139623/">post about the development of the game</a> .  Since then, we have already released a couple of reissues and replaced pencils with felt-tip pens (stable release - v1.2).  In short - you rivet your projects, earn together (or separately) and negotiate a lot.  Inside there are a lot of situations familiar to every IT specialist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ad4/290/04a/ad429004a73933d2fdfca161f17b2a81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/galaxy_trucker/">Space truckers</a> </h3><br>  2-4 players, long (full set of 3 flights), medium difficulty <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b07/413/0fe/b074130fe774951c266a7fe3a35a30d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You build a ship of modules and set off on it towards adventure.  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/176517/">post about the game</a> , here is a post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/270861/">about the development of mechanics</a> (I asked Vlad Kvatil). <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/septikon/">Septicon</a> </h3><br>  2 players, long, difficult (how to kiss a viper). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/459/357/01845935725745fca8e4a26a8c37c786.jpg"><br><br>  A very atmospheric game about an automatic uranium mining complex in the asteroid belt and a war with another such complex.  In terms of style, the Strugatskys reminded me of something; in terms of gameplay, it doesn‚Äôt look like anything, but very cool.  Be sure to read the rules, because if you don‚Äôt interpose at this stage - better not take it, the atmosphere is the most important part of the game. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a4b/d0a/ffe/a4bd0affed934c828e7ffb8fa3ce17bd.jpg"><br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/jackal_treasure_island/">Jackal</a> </h3><br>  2-4 players, long, the difficulty depends on the skills of the players. <br><br>  Our first game that started Mosigra.  To hell with the details, here's the video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUMsxFrg8vs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6YSwaXUXl-UZOTQzJAMwUMckguQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/270529/">post about AI applications</a> . <br><br>  For children, I recommend the <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/Jackal_card/">Card Jackal</a> - this is generally another game that teaches you to think with algorithms: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7wiGi4N1ok%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiV2mBZ8jB8lODtdxakZ-u1OTH-4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <sup>And yes, this is our most awesome voice-over announcer.</sup> <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/qwirkle_rummi/">Quirkle Rummy</a> </h3><br>  2-4 players, medium duration, easy to learn, deep in tactics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/360/6ed/61f3606ed2b64308803584db1de38b01.jpg"><br><br>  Very cool and at the same time a cheap novelty.  Two megahit games - Quirkle and Rummi - were combined into one mechanic.  Previously, both games were quite expensive because of the carriers (the sea of ‚Äã‚Äãwooden chips in the Kk√∂rkl and dominoes in Rummi), and here everything is done on maps.  In fact, the developers wanted to make exactly the road version, but it turned out they are much cooler.  This is the case when the first copies are bought up by sellers in stores. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/Evolution/">Evolution</a> </h3><br>  2-4 players (expands to 6 add-ons or up to 8 with another basic box). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/349/3c3/b52/3493c3b52fa44bb5bb4ba3c60265f0ca.jpg"><br><br>  Good old game about how to make an elephant hippo.  You hang features on animals and see how they will behave in this complex world, where everyone competes with everyone.  Made by a child biology teacher.  Probably one of the best things that happened on our market in terms of direct copyright publications. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/taksi/">Taxi</a> </h3><br>  2-4 children, children, simple, fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c45/eb0/082/c45eb008241e42f5a8b72a52e740dc52.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A game that teaches you to think algorithms at a very, very basic level.  Here is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/246795/">post about her</a> .  Extremely simple and necessary, in fact, for a couple of weeks, until the child begins to think <s>portals</s> as a developer.  If you have a printer - do not buy the box, but simply download the Creative Commons files <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/blog/id2%25D0%25A1100000378/">from here</a> and do it yourself. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/sovushki_au/">Sovushki</a> and <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/sokrowischa_trollya/">Treasure troll</a> </h4><br>  2-4 children, simple, fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a0/800/1a0/9a08001a02484a5c9224859f4d356891.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dff/b4e/375/dffb4e375114459794c2a7fb99c2e95c.jpg"><br><br>  These are amazing team games.  Both on logic.  Especially cool "Sovushki" - there it is necessary to make such moves that are not always beneficial to a specific player, but beneficial to all at once.  Children understand this concept for 5-6 parties, and adults, as our experience has shown, not always.  In general, just look, a very cool thing. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/urfin_jus/">Urfin Jus</a> </h3><br>  2-4 players, simple, fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e6/1af/ae2/7e61afae2fe547baa2ee22f8bc207b50.jpg"><br><br>  This is a classic Tower Defense, only in the form of a board game.  Do not let blockheads in the Emerald City.  Immediately develops everything - fine motor skills here (you need to get pieces of towers out of the bag to the touch, like in a lotto), and tactics plus system thinking (where to put the towers), and teamwork (negotiate who does what).  For adults there is a hardcore mode of increased complexity. <br><br>  One of our city leaders thought we put a cube in this game just to make someone crazy.  But he is needed in hardcore mode, do not think.  We are not like that.  Although‚Ä¶ <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/Face/Show/dad_and_son/">33 adventures: dad and son</a> </h3><br>  The game we did together.  Not even a game, but a set of cards that dad does today - 33 adventures for unusual days.  That's <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/mosigra/blog/265766/">how it was</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd9/166/23a/fd916623ad484a57a129247f24cd842f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Still </h3><br>  Tomorrow will come " <a href="http://mglan.ru/ru/games/soon-588.html">Goblin Corporation</a> " - in this game you need to build huge battle goblin-like robots, paint them red (or apply special goblin pin-up graffiti) and DOWN! <br><br>  If you need more sociable games that are not quite for bright geeks - here‚Äôs a <a href="http://www.mosigra.ru/blog/nabor_niviy_god/">set of ‚Äúthink for me‚Äù</a> , there is a list of all that is worth taking to the party.  Genga, Activity, Ruff, even Monopoly (at the request of the viewers), that's all.  Where there are no words "difficult" and "long", but there is "noisy" and, sometimes, "smash the apartment." <br><br>  Well, do not forget - in all 4 countries (Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan) in all stores or by phone you can say " <b>Habrahabr</b> " and get a maximum retail discount of 10%.  Effective another week. <br><br>  And yes, you buy gifts from us, but we would like to balance the bill a little.  Here is a fresh build of good <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/274077/">materials on GameDev</a> in Russian in the form of a PDF. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369347/</a></p>
