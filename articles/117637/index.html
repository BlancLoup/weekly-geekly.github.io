  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rental housing in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I had the opportunity to go to work at a new place in Moscow.  For me, this is the first move from home, a kind of departure from a cozy heated nest ... And just like the chicks, they are trying to throw their nest, challenging themselves, going to the next level of knowledge of this world, I also want to, despite what to go for.  But then it became interesting to me ... If these chicks knew how much they would have to pay to sit on a higher tree, would they fly out of their nest? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some facts simply do not fit in my head ... If the <a href="http://www.developers.org.ua/lenta/work/salary-survey-report-oct-2010/">average salary of a programmer in Ukraine is</a> 1296 dollars (if you take cities, the ‚Äúother‚Äù category), how can you pay $ 1,000 for one-room rent in Moscow?  We in Chernivtsi for the money you can live in a great hotel, where you will still <s>lick your ass</s> wearing coffee in bed. <br>  Well, okay, I think, after all, for the first time you can just rent a room.  And here prices began to amaze me - an average of $ 500 per room.  And this is for living with people unknown to you, sharing with them a <s>jerk of a</s> san-node, a kitchen, a refrigerator, and so on ... Given that $ 500 a month is much more than the average monthly income of an average Ukrainian. <br><br>  In principle, I taught economics, and I understand everything - where the supply line intersects with the demand line, a market price is formed there.  The capital, the demand is large, and the area is not rubber - the offer is limited, everything is logical ... But why should a <a href="">German in the capital have to collect an apartment for 3 years, and a Muscovite 17?</a>  Is the demand for the capital of Germany much less? <br><br>  And in general, why does it happen that in our countries there is so much expensive real estate?  Resources are enormous, labor is cheap, but prices are much more expensive.  Lagging behind in technology?  Corruption in the struggle for land?  Improper planning and concentration of industrial and commercial areas ..?  There are a lot of reasons to look for a lot, but I really don‚Äôt know what to do.

      I guess I can put up with it, because all the same in Moscow, even taking into account the cost of real estate, you can earn more than in some provincial cities.  So how to correct the situation in the real estate market is not in my power, it remains only to find some optimal option.  Optimally, I think it would be to rent a two-room apartment together with some other IT person.  Habrovchane, if someone can help with renting housing in Moscow (preferably in Lefortovo), or to share experience - who has been confronted with similar problems, respond </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117637/</a></p>
