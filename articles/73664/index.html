      All together gathered at the appointed time near the metro station Oktyabrskoe pole.  We were given helmets with flashlights, and everyone went first to the entrance, to see the subscriber, who seemed a little dumbfounded by the number of people in the stairwell. <br>  Then we went to another entrance, from where we climbed into the attic and reached the subscriber‚Äôs entrance in the attic.  It should be noted that we went there in vain, because all the work did not take place over the subscriber‚Äôs entrance, but through one from him, that is, where we came from in the attic :) <br><br>  Back we went back on the roof.  We passed two entrances and went down to the attic, where Beeline equipment was located. <br><br>  The installer opened the box with the switch.  Cable held to the attic was connected to a laptop.  The installer made a ping to Corbin.  And then he inserted the cable into the switch.  And we left.  We returned to the entrance to the subscriber, almost no one went inside to his house, so as not to embarrass the guy.  The installers connected the cable to the Wi-Fi router.  And they went to configure the Internet subscriber already on the computer. <br><br>  All the others went to the Primavera restaurant, which was located nearby.  There, a table with various goodies was already laid for us. <br>  We sat in a friendly atmosphere talking on various topics, most of which relate in some way to Beeline / Corbin and their communication services. <br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiLuIVqqPI/AAAAAAAAAWk/gz3XZ7p61tM/s720/IMG_3540.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>Gennady Alekseevich Pyatkin shows us certificates that give the opportunity to work at height.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiLvkdceMI/AAAAAAAAAWw/cQzdReEeyYw/s720/IMG_3548.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>These are the helmets with flashlights we wore on our heads before climbing into the attic.</i>  <i>Several times this helmet saved our heads (and mine in particular) from strikes against the ceiling.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiLw0C8a9I/AAAAAAAAAW0/l9FvjYexpfc/s512/IMG_3552.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>Installers laid the cable in the "elevator for cockroaches."</i>  <i>It is said that when several cables are laid there and the cable passes tight - they use dishwashing detergent to lubricate :)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiLyOCizvI/AAAAAAAAAW8/eb8c-91YJy4/s720/IMG_3562.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is us already in the attic.</i>  <i>The inscription on the dust noticed only when I looked at the pictures at home :) I want to note that I had never been in the attic or on the roof before.</i>  <i>It was interesting :)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL1-UIkJI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/gn3uXsLpOtg/s720/IMG_3587.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is Dmitry Aleksandrovich Danilenko.</i>  <i>Director for the development of broadband access of the Moscow region.</i>  <i>Dmitry Alexandrovich was apparently tired, straightened his legs, took off his helmet.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We were all pretty tired while we were bent in the attic.</i> <br><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL3yB-E3I/AAAAAAAAAXc/lTyzez3DNWk/s720/IMG_3604.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>This is Ekaterina Tolkacheva.</i>  <i>Corporate Communications Manager.</i>  <i>And <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/absolvo/" class="user_link">absolvo</a></i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL4nhMtAI/AAAAAAAAAXg/9GMYZMgNp-E/s720/IMG_3606.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>The installer includes a laptop to make ping to Corbin.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiWGnyJwvI/AAAAAAAAAY0/zjkHQgD3jPE/s720/IMG_3609.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>A cable with the subscriber‚Äôs apartment number is hung on the cable so that there is no confusion in the future.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL5paoX3I/AAAAAAAAAXo/tDeAFjCaOVI/s512/IMG_3611.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>The subscriber is given a gift certificate for a month of free Internet.</i>  <i>And also any thanks for the help in carrying out the event, etc.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL8czpJMI/AAAAAAAAAYA/ngSokRqeepA/s720/IMG_3621.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here we were led to feed us :)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL6HXGEmI/AAAAAAAAAXw/iu7-HutvHm0/s512/IMG_3613.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>We ate and discussed communication services, various technologies, etc.</i>  <i>It was delicious and pleasant to talk, thank you :)</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_T2IXrEXyScs/SuiL67EPLWI/AAAAAAAAAX0/YFmGUwo2Agw/s720/IMG_3616.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>We are presented with gifts - yellow-black cane umbrellas.</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  The question was asked whether there is any plan for the development of tariffs for the next few years.  So, such a plan is not done for a long time, because  most often there are new tariffs due to changes in the market of providers. <br><br>  One of those present said that the price of the tariff had increased one day for his past provider. <br>  Dmitry Danilenko told us that prices are not rising or falling, they are frozen.  Do not grow - because it would be a swine to customers, do not decrease - because some purchases are made on the basis of their calculation. <br><br>  We were also told that soon there will still be 3G in Moscow, about which it was recently written in the press. <br>  They discussed various technologies for connecting to the Internet, such as the Internet through a socket and through a gas pipe. <br>  While Corbin is not planning this kind of connection. <br>  Unfortunately, I can not remember everything that was discussed.  I hope in the comments will help me attending the event habrayuzer.  I will then do UPD <br><br>  Many thanks to the organizers of the event, as well as to all those who attended it - it was interesting to talk with you all!  Hope to see you more than once! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73664/</a></p>
