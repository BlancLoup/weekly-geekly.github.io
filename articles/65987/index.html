  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Live on the bright side or die trying</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This story began with the aggressive advertising campaign of Beeline, which has recently become one of the active players in the Internet broadband market in Ukraine.  Delighted by the emergence of new tariff plans and the ability to quickly connect, I left a request and waited.  Very little time passed, and a team of slightly drunk, but very positive subcontractors, who for a modest half hour stretched the cord from the switch in the front door to my laptop, fell into my apartment. <br><br>  After politely saying goodbye to the citizens, I happily sat down for my contractual 5Mbits, which I had previously paid using one of the sets at each corner of the iron boxes that accept payments.  But my happiness did not last long ... I did not have time to calm my delight with free traffic and the breadth of the channel, as the first alarm bell rang.  The Internet turned off and disappeared for 4 days.  The support service happily answered that she was well aware of the causes of the malfunction and was doing everything to ensure that, as soon as possible, I was again ‚Äúin the ranks‚Äù.  After 4 days, the Internet appeared and it began to make me happy again, as it disappeared again. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For the support service, everything turned out to be even more perfect, neither 20 calls to the support service, nor 5 open requests for repairing the malfunction, or checking the connection on 3 different laptops solved my problem.  Personal communication with the head of the support service, who judging by his tone, considered me a naughty schoolboy, rude engineers, workers of those services who consider the most sensible advice to ‚Äúmove the cable in the socket / reboot‚Äù and skillfully dialing ctrl + win, cmd, ‚Äúip configE / Oll ‚Äù, and then in surprise consulting with his comrades and possible options for writing this mega-command and happily forgetting the keys to the shield, into which all the wires are wired.  The most surreal is that I communicated with almost all the technical staff who are in my city, I was sworn to promise to fix everything ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù (they just had a check from Kiev, all not closed repair requests, respectively, were closed. And then they asked to wait a little more).

      In general, for 3 months of these fruitless attempts, I did not download a megabyte, I now hate Beeline with fierce hatred and recommend everyone to choose an alternative service provider to access the network if you have such an opportunity.  I tried one more time, and then decided to go to the main office and understand.  Everyone there was on vacation, once again they scolded me for what I came in, were surprised that ‚ÄúI still need some money‚Äù and sent me back home.  Of course, I scored a bolt, but the most unpleasant thing in this story is that I have never heard the word ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù, did not hear the phrase ‚ÄúThis is our problem, but we will fix it‚Äù.  Moreover, 3 times I was told that everything works when I was sitting right in front of the computer obstinately giving me the coveted 800 error and were rude in response to my arguments that the problem was in the hardware.  The moral of this story is that you should think twice before milking the goat. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65987/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65987/</a></p>
