  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Forty thousand new top-level domains in a few years - reality or fantasy?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, Frank Schilling, one of the largest domain investors in the world, owner of 400 thousand domains with a total value of about $ 500 million, wrote an article in his <a href="http://domainnamesales.com/sevenmile/2012-05/in-new-gtlds-the-only-certainty-is-change/">blog</a> in which he made bold predictions about the future of the domain industry and, in particular, new top-level domains. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In his opinion, the World Wide Web will change its appearance beyond recognition in the next few years: <br>  ‚ÄúLarge companies that did not participate in the first round of registration of new gTLDs, as well as those whose applications will not be considered due to the restriction on the number of applications that ICANN plans to process in one round, will put strong pressure on ICANN.  They will struggle to ensure that ICANN increases the number of applications considered in one round and, as soon as possible, opens the reception of applications from new applicants.  Already in the second round of registration of new domains, 10,000 applications will be submitted, and in the third, 30,000 applications. The number of people willing to get into the ‚Äúhappy thousand‚Äù (ICANN plans to consider so many applications in one round) will not decrease. <br><br>  When the Pandora‚Äôs box opens, the technical standards of the Internet will soon be changed: the organization of the whole world will demand this.  At the ICANN meetings we will see new faces.  Representatives of companies that will become administrators of the first 500 new domains in 2013 will fundamentally change ICANN's policy towards innovation and brand-orientedness. ‚Äù

      <br>
      To imagine how far-reaching Shilling‚Äôs forecasts are, we recall that today there are 315 top-level domains.  293 of them are national domain zones;  14 - sponsored domains, such as .mobi, .travel, .xxx;  4 public domain (gTLD): .com, .net, .org, .info;  3 gTLDs with limited registration: .name, .pro, .biz.  However, registration rules in the last three domains are becoming increasingly free. <br><br>  Frank Schilling sees a lot of potential in new top-level domains, which will be mainly sponsored domains: <br><br>  ‚ÄúPeople will invest billions of dollars in creating websites with intuitive and easy-to-navigate domain names such as Used.cars.  Such sites will become popular largely due to large brands that register their own top-level domains.  This will be similar to how the PickupTrucks.com resource has been unwound thanks to the domains with the names of the brands ToyotaTrucks.com, EbayMotors.com, etc. <br><br>  If you want, you can believe that everything will remain the same, but modern tech-savvy users will quickly get used to new domains and to any innovations in general, unlike the users of the last century, who took their first steps on the Internet. ‚Äù <br><br>  The statements of Frank Schilling excited the entire Internet community: they are actively discussed in forums and blogs, some have changed their opinion about new domains on the diametrically opposite.  But, of course, no one can say for sure how profitable and new domains will be in demand.  And Schilling himself says that his goal is not to convince himself that he is right, but to suggest looking at new gTLDs without prejudice as a source of new business opportunities: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt doesn't matter what you think about the potential of new domains, whether you agree with me or not, think of new gTLDs as the source of new opportunities, as you once thought about the .COM zone, registering your first domain in it.  Those who will master the space of new domains are no more insane than those who registered domains in the .COM zone at the dawn of the development of the Internet.  But no matter what happens, I am sure of one thing: new top-level domains will bring significant changes, and we should prepare well for them. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145171/</a></p>
