      But first things first. <br><br>  Snom C520 combines two wireless data transmission technologies - DECT and Bluetooth.  Thanks to this combination, the C520 is almost the ideal device for holding conference calls.  Even if employees are on different floors or at different ends of a large office, this module will help to easily establish mutual communication and conduct negotiations, meetings or brainstorming even in a fairly large room, and participants will not have to gather closely around the device to hear them well. interlocutors at the other end of the line. <br><br><h2>  Design </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c6/097/170/5c60971707bffb82fd13f730998cc973.jpg"><br><br>  The conference module Snom C520 is made in the case of durable high-quality plastic and its appearance resembles a futuristic spaceship.  When the lights are off, the similarity with the spacecraft landed on the planet is further enhanced.  Three supports with damping plates provide a high stability of the module, it does not slide on the table and cannot be brushed away with a slight movement of the hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/314/e10/01e/314e1001eae2123e70dba88b59816054.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68a/aca/e60/68aacae60ac7eb959cc6458206ee17c7.jpg"><br><br>  To control the operating modes of the module, bright LED indicators are placed on the case.  Throwing a glance at the device, you can quickly understand which functions are involved and which modes of operation are active. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ea/c8d/acf/4eac8dacf9391eeace1038e52b3bfdca.jpg"><br><br>  Snom C520 is equipped with three high-quality and sensitive microphones, two of which are wireless.  Installed inside the conference module itself, the main microphone, in combination with powerful speakers, provides full duplex communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/e4e/333/a2fe4e3338c0706657f56fed9161f661.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d5/c9c/066/4d5c9c066f0a391ff72c82b56e3fe0a3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c0/94b/c66/5c094bc66721548f67422c6a0ba483c6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ce/ddc/d66/3ceddcd66203c6d5af6622b82b70c3c0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/141/d97/d05/141d97d052b459ab587bd32cefb647ab.jpg"><br><br>  Wireless microphones are connected to the base station using DECT.  They can be carried away to a distance of 50 meters.  This ensures maximum freedom of communication with any conference participant, even in the most spacious or crowded rooms.  Built-in rechargeable batteries guarantee reliable operation for up to 12 hours in active mode and up to 70 hours in standby mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d9/3e8/47d/1d93e847dda61faedc27bfb8bc78ffec.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to the automatic volume control of the speakers and the sensitivity of the microphones, modern noise reduction algorithms and the elimination of the <a href="https://lektsii.org/16-38003.html">local effect</a> with adaptive feedback, the conversation participants do not need to raise their voice.  During testing, the speech was perfectly audible to all interlocutors at the other end of the line, even if the speaker was a few meters from C520 and spoke without raising his voice. <br><br><h2>  Convenience in work </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01a/4aa/964/01a4aa9641f7ab36298cf6e0a48c35df.jpg"><br><br>  The module is equipped with a contrasting three-line matrix LCD display with backlight.  Its resolution (158x57 pixels) is enough for comfortable work with the system.  All navigation through the device menu and the phone book is carried out using the usual four-button joystick.  All settings can also be controlled using the password-protected embedded web server. <br><br>  When using the phone function, the display shows the date and time, as well as the duration of the call.  The subscriber identification function helps to find out with whom you are connected.  There is also a local phonebook for 200 numbers with the ability to quickly copy the caller's ID.  An alphanumeric search will help you easily find the right contact.  The phone automatically remembers the last 10 dialed numbers and which you can quickly redial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/896/7ce/261/8967ce261cbc64b854f4ababc69b3e71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b65/b70/6b1/b65b706b1e39daf5cc653bb68470cdef.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab4/0f7/73b/ab40f773b9d4eb001e6ce8233a0134a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e29/305/a2c/e29305a2c4dcf9797358433104453c91.jpg"><br><br>  The built-in synthesizer generates 10 ringing tones, of which 4 are polyphonic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a6/e01/c75/5a6e01c7528e9d9f9cc997915da21cdc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e9/671/ffd/2e9671ffdea78c3b0dd7241a8d3bc100.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d5/9a7/91d/8d59a791dc6383e54fae8209ef0cd30a.jpg"><br><br>  For speech processing in the device uses a modern broadband HD-codec G.722.  It provides a very clear voice and accurate transmission of emotions and nuances of speech.  Snom C520 supports three SIP identifiers with simultaneous call control.  Plus, using DECT and Bluetooth, you can easily connect compatible devices to the system, greatly expanding its capabilities.  In particular, through Bluetooth you can, for example, use both a smartphone and a headset at the same time, or connect a laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d47/59f/790/d4759f79017b5b2effbbaf798435acb2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b83/ae7/47f/b83ae747fde60cece1bd842dd411cf36.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/060/260/a11/060260a1140f4974573218780f36ebbc.jpg"><br><br>  If there seems to be little coverage of the C520, you can easily expand them using various optional equipment.  For example, to sound large halls, powerful C52 wireless modules can be connected to the C520. <br><br><h2>  Snom C52-SP - independent forward and team player </h2><br>  The design of the C52-SP is fully ‚Äúin tune‚Äù with the C520: a squat star with the same ‚Äúspace‚Äù contours.  The speakerphone has no display, as well as dialing buttons - this is a passive satellite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bf/cd7/754/2bfcd7754e44c40a8437909b6e4ae09f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/5fc/e99/7ac5fce996b1f1d519f3c9f3676345fb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/209/1e3/418/2091e3418c598f8ea2b27d8128fa039f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ca/e44/fee/2cae44fee483f2995954cd4e33c36a21.jpg"><br><br>  As mentioned above, the Snom C520 conference call module and the Snom C52-SP speakerphone complement each other perfectly, providing comfortable and efficient holding of conferences in large halls.  The use of DECT technology in combination with a powerful battery allows you to connect up to three Snom C52-SP speakerphones to the Snom C520, each of which can be moved up to 50 meters from the C520. <br><br>  Here are some examples of using the C520 + C52 bundle. <br><br>  Conference call between multiple rooms: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b3/764/10d/3b376410d5b4d19ab55b4c512e014b6c.png"><br><br>  Conference call in a large room: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/02b/293/e3b/02b293e3be5f89d727f5d83cae355784.png"><br><br>  Or even in a large hall with separate tables: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/318/620/76f/31862076f46246977db50e1759ba77fb.png"><br>  At the same time, the C52 has an advantage over the C520 - the speakerphone is equipped with a battery and can operate completely wirelessly.  This is convenient if conference calls are spontaneously held in different rooms or in very large halls.  In such situations, you can simply carry C52 and put on any suitable surface, even on the floor.  A fully charged battery allows you to work with the device for 12 hours in active mode or up to 70 hours in standby mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9c/12e/7bd/c9c12e7bda26af15484fadfba2cbcf34.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b11/293/6ea/b112936eafcd0dd6b0bef89d07ef9f79.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/657/449/ab4/657449ab407e8e54f17a557a9746c89e.jpg"><br><br>  C52 can also be used as a standalone device - using a DECT dongle Snom A230, this speakerphone is connected directly to the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c96/76b/d06/c9676bd06015d9baefa7e4a147b41f7f.png"><br><br>  We insert the dongle into any Snom phone of the D7xx and D3xx series, at C52 we press the Registration button, and that's it, the speakerphone is connected.  Now, just press the headset button on the phone itself, and you can hold conference calls, taking the C52 to a distance of 25 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/43c/6b3/3d643c6b31e82e581782b3cbe76dbf5f.jpg"><br><br>  The C52 + A230 bundle is very convenient if you have a small office, or you do not often need to arrange conference calls, or if the possibilities of the C520 are redundant for you. <br><br>  In terms of sound quality and speech fixation, the C52-SP is not inferior to the ‚Äúolder comrade‚Äù C520: during testing, the voices of all participants were equally well audible and as picky as possible.  There was no annoying echo or whistle in the process of communication, the speech of colleagues was always so clearly and clearly audible, as if the interlocutor was nearby. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/270203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/270203/</a></p>
