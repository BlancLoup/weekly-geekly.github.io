Recently, they began to make them really comfortable, inventing all sorts of different things so that the suitcase really helps on the road.  A couple of years ago, a suitcase appeared on the crowdfunding platform <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bluesmart-world-s-first-smart-connected-carry-on">IndieGoGo</a> , which can be called universal (it collected $ 2,261,662 in just one month).  The fact is that it can be used in a variety of situations, including such unpleasant ones as luggage loss. <br><br>  Yes, we are talking <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bluesmart/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dbluesmart">about Bluesmart One</a> .  I must say that it is not cheap.  On the other hand, its price is comparable to those suitcases that are sold by well-known manufacturers of all kinds of bags and suitcases.  Well, to get a quality suitcase with smart features for the price of an ordinary good suitcase (well, or a slightly larger one) is great.  We experience it with the whole team on all sorts of trips, flights and other movements from point A to point B. Well, let's try to present the impressions (really convenient) here, and we will do it as objectively as possible.  The most interesting - under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Let's start with the design </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bde/77e/c80/bde77ec8076b44748f6930cf26d8c80b.jpg">

      There is nothing to be done - without a description of the appearance and "entrails" can not do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/16f/1c7/f21/16f1c7f211d44274b5fbfa2d31c65b9f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8fe/e40/f19/8fee40f198ec4d5988047a166bb5cfc7.jpg"><br><br>  The suitcase itself is black with shades of blue.  You can't call it pure black, but all this looks pretty.  The body is made of plastic with nylon seals.  The suitcase has two internal compartments and one outside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/2a1/aa8/3c2/2a1aa83c2d93462bb06651f5991638a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/30a/cde/35a/30acde35a124455f9f34fe2202fad26e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/23a/eb7/b51/23aeb7b510114f9a815c2d571661844e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3c8/9ae/f2c/3c89aef2cfbb479380057e76117e3a03.jpg"><br><br>  Suitcase material is waterproof, besides, Bluesmart One is resistant to damage.  Case included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/411/30e/26f/41130e26ff8346cb9751c67f2fa45aeb.jpg"><br><br>  Since the suitcase is smart, then at Bluesmart One you can see a couple of things that ordinary suitcases do not have. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7fa/599/e31/7fa599e313014f9187b51b22f1bb3895.jpg"><br><br>  These are light-emitting diodes in the upper part, which show the charge of the internal battery (well, yes, a modern suitcase, you cannot do without universal charging).  There are also LEDs on the side - these represent a connection with an iOS or Android application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/857/854/ba2/857854ba27de4764ac3f5c93fd1d1b1c.jpg"><br><br>  Its dimensions are 559 x 355 x 229 mm, which is quite standard.  The suitcase is large enough to fit most of the equipment that the traveler decided to take with him.  And not only technology, but all other things that can be useful on the road. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b74/3eb/19c/b743eb19c2e34c09b4867bc9402c47bc.jpg"><br><br>  And yes, access to things is easy - you do not need to disclose the entire Bluesmart, you can use the front pocket, which is extraordinary (compared to other suitcases) deep.  There will fit everything you need to put out of fragile things. <br><br>  There is also a document net, which many manufacturers simply forget. <br><br>  Why was an outside pocket made?  The developers decided that users should be given a chance to keep all their devices together.  So now when you fly, you can not be afraid of trouble with the electronics - all at your fingertips.  The pocket is very soft, there is nothing to damage.  Here is another USB port for charging electronics.  In general, it is really convenient when you can take anything out of your pocket at any time, and not climb into the inside of a suitcase full of clothes and other things that only dream of falling out (or falling out).  Collect things around the airport?  Dismiss. <br><br>  Under the handle is the charging port. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/75e/876/4c9/75e8764c93bf4ae48b5828c4195756df.jpg"><br><br>  The suitcase has a built-in battery; its capacity is 10,000 mAh.  Unfortunately, the battery is not removable.  The entire electronic filling is assembled in a plastic box, which is protected from both water and shock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b75/cc1/76c/b75cc176c99941eabfe01800221e103a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/6f3/5f2/914/6f35f29144764114bb447dbfb371fc27.jpg"><br><br>  And also there is a set of adapters for sockets of different types.  Attention to trivia as it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8a2/b43/6c1/8a2b436c1e3641a3ac4efdb106c28a27.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d1c/3b1/4a4/d1c3b14a4ca0441f9eaf068fdcc4d83b.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a detailed instruction, warranty + set of branded stickers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b48/090/533/b4809053387a4007944c868264c1da51.jpg"><br><br><h3>  application </h3><br>  For Bluesmart there is a special application that allows you to manage the suitcase and receive information.  Which one?  First, you can score upcoming trips here.  Why not?  Secondly, the application shows a summary of the location of Bluesmart, its weight, the state of the castle and other things. <br><br>  To get started, you need to connect the suitcase and give it a name.  Well, yes, here at Bluesmart, you can say, a pronounced individuality, why not give it a name? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf6/2a2/00e/bf62a200e6514698b7b4388326ec03c3.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7bd/6c6/124/7bd6c6124d564f0f88194b55cd5d9ea2.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Flights are added manually, after which it becomes possible to search for the desired flight in the database. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dc2/fa5/059/dc2fa50593c246ee832318fe0081579d.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8c7/734/e5d/8c7734e5d2f848ebaa15e14ede0ccca0.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Secondly, the application shows which countries the user has already visited.  In the settings you can select the metric or imperial system of measures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/77e/038/604/77e038604bae433f9091218254700930.jpg" width="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/96d/30f/311/96d30f311b1642efb0ae0f1bb654309f.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  All functions are collected in one place.  Here you can see where the suitcase is currently located, the state of the internal battery, the weight of the suitcase with things.  You can also open it (about the REMOTE LOCK system - a little lower).  You can also view summary information and data about your previous travels, as already mentioned.  This is a kind of logbook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/07b/9c0/673/07b9c0673525400d8154c4bfc25da4c6.jpg" width="350"><br><br><h3>  One, two, three - a suitcase, be there! </h3><br>  Well, well, it is clear that the suitcase can carry things user.  But there is still a lot that can be useful on the road.  The main feature of a suitcase is a geotag, which determines the coordinates using GPS and GSM triangulation, and then transfers the data to the user.  Bluetooth is not used.  Battery energy lasts about a month of the built-in geotag.  During this time, you can find any luggage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c5b/44e/ee5/c5b44eee5cc74915a535dfd4f9750ddb.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  In general, geotags can be attached to a regular suitcase.  But most of the bottom work only with the identification of the location of the suitcase on a cellular tower signal, plus they need to be charged.  And you have to pay for the subscription - for many geotag it is this model of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e6d/bef/66b/e6dbef66ba1a4f5e9def0c754e694ba3.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Works suitcase and Bluetooth.  At short distances, this allows you not to lose or forget the suitcase.  If this happens, a message arrives immediately to the mobile phone (where you need to pre-install the application). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e19/313/235/e19313235f3d44db8e0c24633fa26e9c.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Well, if there is a ‚Äúbad man,‚Äù that is, a thief who has decided to steal a suitcase, having taken it imperceptibly from under the owner‚Äôs nose, then the owner immediately knows about it.  As soon as the suitcase is outside the Bluetooth coverage area, the ‚Äúalarm‚Äù on the phone is activated, and the user receives the last point where he saw the suitcase. <br><br>  By the way, there is another bun here - this is the REMOTE LOCK technology.  Being in the Bluetooth area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe owner‚Äôs phone is open.  But once he leaves the ‚Äúzone of influence,‚Äù the constipation works and the suitcase closes securely. <br><br>  We, by the way, know that the Bluetooth connection of many devices is not very reliable.  In the case of a suitcase everything is ok.  The range is 50 meters. <br><br><h3>  We proceed to weighing </h3><br>  Many of you, probably, at least once in life overpaid for luggage.  This is not always a lot of money, but sometimes you have to open a wallet widely.  And all because the majority have no scales at home, allowing to understand how much luggage weighs.  If it turns out to be harder than the norm, then the load can be very, very valuable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7cc/edc/fac/7ccedcfacccb4c868dad1a19c3f0d9f0.jpg" width="350"><br><br>  Bluesmart has a solution for this case - built-in scales.  This is really convenient, because you can measure the weight of the baggage immediately after the fees, and if necessary, put extra. <br><br>  For weighing, you also need an application on your mobile phone and an active Bluetooth connection.  Download the app, and raise (and hold) the suitcase for a few seconds.  If everything is ok, the measurement result appears on the phone display.  First, the system must be calibrated to correctly show the weight, and then the weighing operation itself must be carried out.  For calibration, simply put Bluesmart on the floor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/3d6/3d1/236/3d63d1236dcd449ab057b7cad212dc47.jpg" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/0b8/e9c/8ff/0b8e9c8fff5c43ceac59a8fbabe99c88.jpg" width="350"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e2f/bb2/1f3/e2fbb21f3f36484bb3981468ca7d71f4.jpg" width="350"><br><br><h3>  Where to find bluesmart one? </h3><br>  In Russia <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bluesmart/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dbluesmart">, we sell</a> this suitcase <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/bluesmart/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dpr%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dbluesmart">, Madrobots</a> .
