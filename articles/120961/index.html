  <section class="page js-page"><h1>CPanel and Parallels Plesk Panel from the point of view of a hoster. Part Three and Last</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to readers Habr.  Well, we got to the final part of the blockbuster translation from TheHostingNews.com magazine about the comparison of hosting control panels.  If someone missed something, I remind you: the links are the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/120821/">first</a></b> and <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/120923/">second</a></b> parts.  The third and last series is quite short and is devoted to summarizing the comparison. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  First, we recall that the initial review of cPanel and Parallels Plesk Panel features was conceived by TheHostingNews.com team for four target groups: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      - Hosters of all sizes, including large ones (from 1500 customers) <br>  - Intermediaries for the sale of hosting services <br>  - Web developers who create websites for customers and these sites themselves lead, having thus an average of 60 clients <br>  - IT professionals and end users. <br><br>  In general, both panels made an impression of quality products that you can safely trust.  TheHostingNews.com refrains from naming a single winner of the duel, as each of the panels is good in each case. <br><br><h5>  For IT professionals and end users </h5><br><br>  Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2 demonstrated an impressive array of end-user capabilities.  This is a built-in site builder and application store.  Both makes Plesk Panel a good choice for small businesses - the site‚Äôs functionality can always be complemented with a large number of web applications that are easy to install and easy to manage.  cPanel impresses with an intuitive user interface and intuitive video tutorials for a number of functions.  Parallels has a slight performance advantage for popular applications such as WordPress.  But cPanel also copes with its tasks very well. <br><br><h5>  For resellers and web developers </h5><br><br>  Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2 is, in fact, a ‚Äúpackaged‚Äù solution for hosting business.  Panels in some places do not have enough notification tools, although you can add them by installing the appropriate plug-ins.  cPanel, in the opinion of the editors, is more focused on developers who want full control over the control panel and want the maximum of functions to be available at a distance of a minimum number of clicks.  Qmail, which comes with the Plesk Panel, works incredibly fast and efficiently, even with default settings.  Both panels have powerful communities where users share ideas and make recommendations.  Both panels support free migration.  The editors honestly admit that they did not check this function, nor did they check the quality and speed of support. <br><br><h5>  For large hosters </h5><br><br>  Based on experience, it can be assumed that the key quality of the control panel from the point of view of the host should be the price.  DNS-only and cPanel licenses in a cluster will be good for large companies.  Plesk offers versions for Unix / Windows, offers hosters excellent integration with tools that will help create new services for customers and make more money on these services.  These are Application Packaging Standard (APS), Storefront, Business Manager, SiteBuilder, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers.  Having experienced many server migration procedures, one of the editors of TheHostingNews.com calls how the cPanel migration is implemented, a huge advantage.  The fact that Business Manager allows you to act without being tied to customer accounts makes Plesk Panel an excellent tool for working with large customer bases. <br><br><h5>  Sentence? </h5><br><br>  The review remains a review in the debriefing, so there is no winner in the fight.  Fighting draw  CPanel and Parallels have very worthy products that will continue to fight for market share.  And it will be good for all categories of users - for hosters, and for web-pros, and for end-users.  Because products from such competition only get better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120961/</a></p>
