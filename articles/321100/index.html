      To assess the level of speakers, watch the <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/archive/2016/">video and presentations of</a> last year's reports or read the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it_people/blog/302286/">report on Habr√© about the DUMP-2016</a> . <br><br>  Registration for participants is open.  Until February 15, a ticket costs 4,000 rubles.  <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D3.02%26utm_medium%3Dpost">Join now!</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Program committee</b> </h2><br>  We invited people with diverse experience and from companies of different sizes to the program committee to make the program interesting for both the corporate employee and the developer from a small web-studio. <br><br>  Program directors review applications, select the most useful and interesting ones from them, help the speakers to prepare for the reports, arrange rehearsals for the performances. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In the FrontTalks section, the front end titans are doing - <b>Oleg Mokhov (Yandex)</b> , <b>Vadim Makishvili (Yandex)</b> and <b>Alexey Ivanov (Evil Martians)</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Serverside is preparing different guys who are steep in their work: <b>Alexey Spiridonov</b> , <b>JetStyle</b> technical director, <b>Daniil Skrobov</b> , head of development at <b>Vostok projects</b> , <b>Konstantin Beklemishev</b> , head of <b>Naumen Contact Center</b> development department, and <b>Alexander Kazakov,</b> leading software engineer at <b>SKB Kontur</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The section for mobile developers is made by <b>DataCrat</b> security <b>director Rodion Revin</b> and author of ET Transport, developer at <b>QIWI, Maxim Rovkin</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ In the DevOps section, the main this year is <b>Danila Shtan (Brainkeys)</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Design reports are prepared by <b>Acronis</b> Design Team Leader <b>Alexander Kudymov</b> and <b>Ridero</b> art director <b>Daria Prokuda</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúTesting‚Äù makes the team of the best Yekaterinburg testers: <b>Ilya Vakhrushev (Exadel)</b> , <b>Maxim Zakharov (SKB Kontur)</b> , <b>Anastasia Ronzhina (SKB Kontur)</b> and <b>Dmitry Yakin (SKB Kontur)</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Reports for managers are prepared by the director for web development at <b>Abak Press, Alexander Karabasov,</b> and the development manager at <b>SKB Kontur, Eldar Safarov</b> . <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Major on science at DAMP-e - <b>Alexey Kirpichnikov (SKB Kontur)</b> and <b>Viktor Grishchenko (Citrea)</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64f/4e3/d08/64f4e3d087994a3687517d96e058e624.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Last year, 1,200 participants gathered from the Yekaterinburg, Perm, Ufa, Chelyabinsk, Kurgan, Izhevsk, Omsk, Tyumen and Moscow.</i> </h6><br><br><h2>  <b>I want to speak at DUMP-2017</b> </h2><br>  Program directors wrote appeals to speakers in which they described topics that are of interest to us. <br><br><h3>  Fronttalks </h3><br>  Over the past year, so many different changes have occurred in the frontend, as there have not been for many years.  For example, Samsung Internet has become a leader among browsers.  And the Grid specification, which celebrated the fifth anniversary, was suddenly approved and will soon appear in all browsers.  We will talk about this and many other things related to the front-end in our section. <br><br>  We are waiting for reports: <br><br>  - about new technologies and how you apply them in the production code; <br>  - about your experiments and their results; <br>  - client-side tests and how to check the layout in all browsers automatically; <br>  - about node.js; <br>  - o React, Angular, or maybe even Vue; <br>  - and in general about everything that can be done using the JavaScript language, as well as using the layout and browser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e86/684/083/e866840834d84b429bcad8dccf384097.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Web evangelist at Opera Software (at that time), Web Standards project manager Vadim Makeev talked about grid last year</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Serverside </h3><br>  In the Serverside section this year we will talk about an important and difficult topic: how to strike a balance between ‚Äúwork, do not touch‚Äù and temptation to dig into the project a new magic tool that promises universal happiness.  How to avoid technology zoo without losing in speed and quality of development and product.  How to live in a zoo, if the unity of technology was unattainable.  How to choose the appropriate technology for a specific task and the existing project ecosystem. <br><br>  We understand that there will be more people willing to listen to this than those who want to share their experience, but we do not lose hope to hear some cool stories. <br><br>  If you have another fiery theme for the ServerSide section, write too.  Immediately do not run out :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b0/eed/048/8b0eed048d5941c4982080d3db6ed434.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Last year, for the first time, a gene appeared at DAMP-e.</i>  <i>Director of Postgres Professional, Member of the PostgreSQL Foundation Oleg Bartunov</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Science </h3><br>  Technology is developing at a breakneck pace.  Now, to stay in place, you need to run twice as fast.  Therefore, in 2017, we decided to work ahead of the curve - to add high technologies to the DUMP program and to please the geeks.  Meet the return of the Science section to our conference. <br><br>  The scientific section DUMP-2017 is a quiet backwater for geeks when there is one bootstrap, docker and microservices around.  Hole for speakers: here you can talk about your favorite topic, which you dig in your free time from the routine.  Or about a topic about which you are writing your dissertation for the third year, and you can‚Äôt wait to share it with anyone.  Or about your pet machine learning project.  And the main thing is that in our section there is no upper limit on the degree of the topic‚Äôs upwardness.  We want listeners to have a great brain! <br><br>  Do you want to tell about new theoretical results in blockchain mathematics or explain the proof of the correctness of the new algorithm of distributed consensus?  Run to us!  We accept applications for reports from the field of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">formal sciences</a> .  The requirement for speakers is the ability to explain complex things in a clear language.  We will discuss the topic of the report, as long as your eyes are burning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9b/251/923/a9b2519234574614b0f6c1703b9b6650.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Already <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/section/34/">in Science 2017 program</a></i> : MTproto protocol, Dijkstra algorithm, cryptocurrency, multidimensional indices in RDBMS </h6><br><br><h3>  Devops </h3><br>  The DevOps section debuted in 2016 remains with us in 2017 as well.  But we don‚Äôt want to arrange an ‚Äúadmin‚Äù or ‚Äúarchitect‚Äù section - it‚Äôs boring and it‚Äôs been there more than once. <br><br>  DevOps is about the approach.  About the team.  About agreements between different development teams.  About "all - the code."  About the fact that ‚Äúinfrastructure as a service‚Äù is easy and completely done by hand.  About the fact that ChatOps is not only a beautiful trinket, but also the cornerstone of amazing changes. <br><br>  In general, DevOps is an organizational methodology, devops-engineers from a million vacancies actually do not exist, and admins can also be programmers. <br><br>  If what I have written here seems to you to be at least a little adequate and you have something to say about this - send topics and theses of speeches, let's teach everyone to live correctly :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/d77/1e2/06ed771e23fa43a19fe6fc9239a59eda.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Leading 2GIS developer Denis Yakovlev (Novosibirsk) told last year about infrastructure automation at 2GIS</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Mobile </h3><br>  This year we will try to cover the latest trends in the technologies of the most popular mobile platforms. <br><br>  We invited real gurus who will talk about new features in RxJava2, React Native and Redux, features of outsourcing, difficulties in testing client-server applications and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96f/9fc/f4a/96f9fcf4ab474ec2aca69b33b57b645b.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Denis Neklyudov, Android development expert, Google Developer Expert, told DUMP-2016 how to write tests on Android.</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Management </h3><br>  We are looking for people who have succeeded: <br><br>  1. To hire interns (to agitate, to include in the production process, to hire).  In a situation of acute shortage of experienced personnel - you have to go to universities and look for staff "for growth" there.  If you have succeeded in this, we will be glad to hear about your experience. <br><br>  2. Manage a distributed development team.  The labor market of programmers is smoothly migrating to the remote last 5 years, probably, although not as actively as expected.  In remote projects, a lot of things do not work in the same way as in the office, it is necessary to organize the process more clearly, and to force communication, since they do not go through themselves in the smoking rooms and at dinner and much more.  If you have a successful experience in managing a distributed development team, come speak. <br><br>  3. Interesting stories about the life cycle of your product: hypothesis testing, pivots, experiments, the evolution of ideas and unexpected conclusions.  If you manage an IT project, there are probably many such stories in your arsenal, the conclusions of which can be useful for the IT community. <br><br>  4. And finally, we want to talk about psychology this year.  How can a manager avoid psychological burnout?  How to remain an authority for developers, losing the "craft" qualification?  Or maybe you can not lose it?  These and other questions are in our ‚Äúpsychological‚Äù block of the management section of DAMP. <br><br>  We are ready to consider applications for reports and other topics.  If you have a unique experience that you want to share, and ideas that are worth spreading are burning in your heart - write to us! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e2/a82/2ea/7e2a822ea84e423d94092a3cc0e02290.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Boris Dyakonov, Head of Point, Vice-President of Otkritie Bank, spoke last year about the pros and cons of the traditional approach to metrics and kpi</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Design </h3><br>  This year we want to add to the section of horizontal knowledge - to call people from close industries who will bring additional techniques from their subject industry and expand the designer's palette.  If you work in directing, game design, political technologies, psychology, advertising, pedagogy, architecture, urban planning and want to speak, submit an application. <br><br>  The program already has a gorgeous staff: Yuri Vetrov (Mail.Ru Group, Moscow), Denis Kortunov (Acronis, Moscow), Denis Bashev (freelancer, curator at the School of Design HSE, Moscow), Oleg Chulakov (Oleg Chulakov studio, Rostov-on -Donu), Ksenia Ilinykh and Ekaterina Mokhova (SKB Kontur, Ekaterinburg).  Join now! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/302/4b1/b15/3024b1b151f844eeb098aad97871ff1c.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>Yaroslav Shuvaev, product owner, Alfa Mobile at Alfa Bank, curator of the UX &amp; UI Intensives at IU, told in the last year section how to plan and implement improvements to the user experience of the product under flexible production conditions.</i> </h6><br><br><h3>  Testing </h3><br>  Let's talk about the simple actions of the tester: <br><br>  - institution of bugs, <br>  - communication with colleagues, <br>  - drawing up mepok, <br>  - inventing scenarios. <br><br>  But this time we will take a look at these simple actions from the other side: <br><br>  - how they are performed by cool specialists intelligently and consciously, <br>  - as experts from routine do not routine, <br>  - as the routine of one tester can be the discovery of a new world for another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c84/706/632/c847066326574f508e8bcb2b70cc9c92.jpg"><br><h6>  <i>The head of the Parallels automatic testing team, Vasily Nikishin (Tallinn), told at DAMP-2016 how to create a self-testing team in unusual conditions</i> </h6><br><br>  If you want to speak, <a href="http://dump-conf.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_campaign%3D3.02%26utm_medium%3Dpost">write to</a> us.  Any format is possible: sectional report (40 min), blitz report (10-20 minutes), master class.  Applications are accepted until February 20. <br><br>  If you have not seen any topic in the list, but you want to speak with her, write anyway.  Perhaps the program committee will decide that the report will be super useful and will be included in the program. <br><br><h2>  <b>I want to become a sponsor</b> </h2><br>  We are looking for sponsors and partners for whom the love and respect of thousands of IT professionals are important.  Who <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p4hjx53ojgzj7jf/DUMP2017.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">cares</a> , look <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/p4hjx53ojgzj7jf/DUMP2017.pdf%3Fdl%3D0">beautiful file with details</a> .
