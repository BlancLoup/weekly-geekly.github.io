  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 best trends in the business world that will make it possible to succeed in 2016</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For decades, I have watched trends in modern business both from the front row and from the backstage.  And now, for the third year in a row, I share with you my observations on the main areas of development that the leading companies adopt in order to achieve even greater success.  In some cases, I designate only emerging trends.  In others, I talk about already established trends, which, however, have not yet become mainstream.  I recognize some business management schemes in the process of interaction with participants of events at which I speak as a speaker.  Others notice in the process of working with a variety of companies.  At the end of the article, I gave a link to my forecasts regarding the 2015 trends.  In the same article, I will continue to talk about what trends in the business world will become the engines of success in 2016. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1. Successful companies will focus on customer relationships.</b> <br>  I often talk with experts in a particular field.  Among such experts are <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> and <a href="http://crowdfundinghacks.com/">Clay Heber</a> .  So, from these conversations, I concluded that we live in an era of "economics of relations".  In an era when ties and relationships are more valuable than industrial assets.  This means that the most valuable companies will be busy building links between the seller and the buyer, between the user and the content.  If you disagree with this argument, let's look at the facts: <br><ol><li>  Uber is the largest taxi company in the world.  At the same time, the company itself does not have a single own vehicle.  It just drives the drivers and passengers. </li><li>  AirBnB is the world's largest provider of accommodation services, not owning a single residential property. </li><li>  Facebook is the largest media company, although it does not create content. </li><li>  According to experts, crowdfunding companies, such as Kickstarter and IndiGoGo, will overtake venture funds, although they do not own the funds to invest. </li></ol><br><br>  If before it was enough to sell the product and make a profit, now for buyers the important role played by the possibility of combining with like-minded people in order to extract greater profits in the long term.  During successful conferences, communities are created that continue to exist even after events cease to exist.  If you want to create something that will pass the test of time, you need to combine your customers with each other and connect them to a valuable resource that will offer them more than buying goods or services.  We will talk about this type of interaction at the Remarkable Growth Experience conference, which will be held in 2016.

      <b>2. Energetic companies will no longer complain about the shortcomings of the two thousand generation and will begin to attract its representatives to work</b> <br>  According to the Census Bureau, the largest group of citizens is currently young people aged 20 and over (80 million people).  This group, which is often referred to as the two thousandth generation, represents the largest segment of buyers and workers.  In the near future, it will also become the largest segment of business owners.  From 1947 to 2010, the largest segment was formed from representatives of the generation of the post-war population explosion ‚Äî the baby boom generation. <br>  Brad Zollosi, author of the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Leadership-Woodstock-Wikipedia-Multigenerational-Management/dp/1608320553">Liquid Leadership</a> (Flexible Leadership) and an expert in the field of leadership training, says: ‚ÄúThe representatives of the two thousandth generation are eager to work in companies that they could be proud of.  They want to buy products of companies for which their creations are of great importance.  Companies need to start taking such people into their ranks, and not turn their backs on them, because members of the baby boom generation will soon begin to retire.  In the niche of top management there is a gap that we have never seen before.  Since, for demographic reasons, the representatives of generation ‚ÄúX‚Äù are much smaller than the representatives of the two thousand generation, who do you think will become the dominant force fighting for high positions?  Undoubtedly, they will be representatives of the two thousandth generation. ‚Äù <br><br>  If you are considering the possibility of hiring a representative of the two thousandth generation, you need to change your approach.  Kim Cole, co-founder of <a href="http://www.thesaleszone.com/">TheSalesZone.com</a> , has vast experience in finding uncommon sales managers and talented managers.  Kim believes that it is very important for the younger generation to have a clear idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe prospects for future growth and future role in the organization.  The aspirations of young people often go beyond their abilities.  If you tell them how you help your employees develop their professional skills in order to move up the career ladder, you can find really talented employees, and they, in turn, will help you attract other like-minded people.  As an example of the question asked in the interview for representatives of the two thousandth generation, Cole cited: ‚ÄúWhat kind of problems, in your opinion, could you manage on your own, and what influence, in your opinion, will you have in five years?‚Äù <br><br>  <b>3. Innovative companies will invest in training and attracting remote employees.</b> <br>  As more and more companies use the remote access strategy, it is easy to predict what will happen in the field of personnel development and training.  The most successful companies will focus on the use of electronic tools for training, monitoring and admonishing team members whose location will not matter.  These means and tools will allow each member of the group to learn according to their own schedule and receive the necessary assistance, whether it is a question of technical issues, the choice of strategy or tactics. <br>  This kind of career growth will cause great interest among employees, and will also attract more representatives of the two thousandth, who appreciate the development of skills.  Electronic tools will not only be used for training.  They will be used to test concepts, provide additional explanations, and will also be used to monitor and report on progress to justify investments.  Such tools will allow you to meet your employees and customers where they want to find you.  Most people continue to learn, going beyond the usual patterns.  They strive to constantly expand their knowledge, including through video seminars.  Such users become participants of the seminars like <a href="http://www.growmyrevenue.com/business-cast/">Grow My Revenue Business Cast</a> .  They continue to receive new knowledge while in the classroom or on the road. <br><br>  <b>4. Successful companies take note of a management strategy built on the strengths of each individual employee.</b> <br>  Over the years, employees, in their reports, reported to management on flaws and flaws and helped companies correct mistakes.  In 2016, the management method based on identifying and using the strengths of employees is increasingly being applied.  Despite the fact that a person can learn almost everything, anything, we demonstrate great success and performance when we do what we really like in the area in which we can demonstrate our professionalism.  According to <a href="http://pinchyourselfcareers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/engagement-boosts-productivity.pdf">Gallup Research</a> , employee productivity increases by 21% if the latter are passionate about the work process.  Lisa Cummings, executive director of <a href="http://www.leadthroughstrengths.com/">LeadThroughStrengths.com</a> , advises: ‚ÄúGive your employees the opportunity to demonstrate their strengths.  Employees who can realize their strengths every day are 6 times more active than their colleagues.  As a manager, you simply must invest in the talents of your subordinates.  If you follow this advice, you will see how productivity will increase and how your employees become more active. ‚Äù <br>  Cummings gives a real-life example: ‚ÄúIn a familiar situation, the manager would say to the introvert employee‚Äú get out of your shell and start interacting with people. ‚Äù  In the case of management based on the strengths of the individual, the manager would prefer to have the employee achieve great results using his uniqueness.  For example, introverts tend to succeed in one-on-one relationships.  Therefore, instead of sending such an employee to work on a stand during the exhibition, assign him to take care of his five most important clients. ‚Äù <br>  You do not need to be Nostradamus to predict that you will be able to achieve greater results in less time if you focus on the strengths of the individual. <br><br>  <b>5. In the consumer goods market there will be a drop in the rate of return.</b>  <b>The increase in value added will be achieved through services</b> <br>  The mere ability to deliver goods or services will not allow you to compete successfully in the market.  There were times when delivery of goods from the online store took a whole week, and ordinary stores could offer customers an excellent alternative.  When the time of delivery of goods from the online store was reduced to several days, it became more difficult to compete.  Free round-the-clock delivery has hit even harder the competitive possibilities of regular stores.  Not so long ago, I experienced what the urgent delivery of Amazon Prime NOW was.  I needed an adapter for my computer.  I could go to the nearest electronics store, but Amazon was faster, cheaper, and more convenient.  I ordered an adapter, before lunch with a client.  By the time I returned back to the hotel, the adapter was already waiting for me.  His delivery, however, did not cost me a cent. <br><br>  Successful companies will still differ from each other, even if they still offer consumer goods, because they have different experiences and use different techniques.  You might think that Amazon and other online retailers are "killing a small business."  If you are accustomed to counting on profits only because you have goods in stock, you may encounter difficulties.  Amazon actually teaches buyers to purchase products from faceless middlemen.  And it is this habit of buyers that opens up new opportunities for you to work in the market, where you can assign buyers a price for the services you offer, especially since thanks to Amazon and other similar companies, buyers do not feel discomfort when purchasing goods remotely.  Even if you are having trouble selling to the local market, your narrow specialization may open up opportunities that go far beyond neighboring markets.  Today, with virtually no financial investments, you can sell your experience and talents anywhere in the world. <br>  Susan Friedman wrote a book whose title <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Riches-Niches-Make-Small-Market/dp/1564149307">‚ÄúThe Riches Are In the Niches‚Äù</a> (Wealth is hidden in every niche) became a common phrase.  In today's world, large companies will need the size and logistical capabilities of Amazon to compete.  But local companies can compete in small markets, if they occupy a narrow niche.  If you run a niche business on the Internet, the narrow specialization of a small company will be able to attract the attention of ideal buyers from around the world.  You just need to be sure that you have a product or service that customers can easily acquire and build trust. <br><br>  <b>6. In order to increase profits, managers will invest in the corporate culture of after-sales service.</b> <br>  NY's best selling author, Jay Bayer, says: ‚ÄúGlobally, we spend 500 billion dollars a year on marketing, and only 9 billion on after-sales service.  And this is despite the fact that we know that maintaining the customer base is the surest way to increase profits.  Smart companies began to realize that the level of customer satisfaction with the quality of service and after-sales service IS a new marketing.  According to Walker's research, by 2020, quality of service will mean more to buyers of the B2B sector than price. ‚ÄùBayer was expertly covered this topic in his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hug-Your-Haters-Complaints-Customers/dp/1101980672/">Hug Your Haters</a> ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hug-Your-Haters-Complaints-Customers/dp/1101980672/">Hug Your</a> Envious). <br>  The fastest way to grow a company is NOT to lose existing customers.  After-sales customer service has become a fascinating sport.  Successful companies understand that customer complaints in the network spread faster than fire.  Zappos became a legend because it invested a large amount of money in after-sales customer service.  She proved that the client is ready to pay for high-quality service. <br>  According to Robert Richman, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Culture-Blueprint-High-Performance-Workplace/dp/0692274774">The Culture Blueprint</a> ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Culture-Blueprint-High-Performance-Workplace/dp/0692274774">Culture</a> Development Program): ‚ÄúYou cannot demand from people to be cultural.  The best companies build culture from the inside.  A great culture is built by engaging the team in a meaningful discussion process, not by issuing orders. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>7. Leading companies will offer not only solutions, but also real, measurable results</b> <br>  Customers are tired of investing in solutions that do not bring the desired results.  Leading companies will strive to use an approach that will guarantee every client the success of any project.  Increased customer satisfaction will lead to an increase in the number of repeat requests. <br>  Price is important only when the seller ADDs it important.  As soon as your clients see that a good, tangible result is more important to you than the competition, the price for them will no longer be of paramount importance.  The more companies focus on measurable results, the more problems arise for vendors positioning themselves as low-cost service providers.  As Seth Godin says: ‚ÄúPrice competition is a race of concessions that you can definitely win.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>8. Creative companies will strive to attract the attention of customers and employees through entertainment and games.</b> <br>  <a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/en/cl/31966/how-does-digital-affect-canadian-attention-spans">According to a study conducted by Microsoft</a> , the average person‚Äôs attention span is 8 seconds.  In 2000, this value was 12 seconds.  For comparison, scientists measured the attention span of a goldfish, which was 9 seconds.  Research has shown that changes in human behavior were caused, in particular, by the advent of smartphones and other mobile devices.  If we agree that the generation of the two thousandth represents the largest segment of buyers and workers, then it is time for us to start thinking about how to attract and retain the attention of such consumers. <br>  One of the ways that will help attract the attention of buyers and which is used by creative companies is the integration of games into the life process.  It doesn't matter if the company uses electronic or traditional games to attract customers.  The idea is to turn every action into a fun and exciting process.  Admit it honestly, do you like doing something fun or boring more?  If we talk about the area in which I work, then we would have had to work for years to make the teams feel like role-playing games that promote the development of sales skills.  Few teams would be able to go through such training to the end.  Instead of role-playing games, we decided to use <a href="http://www.growmyrevenue.com/store/samesideimprov/">Same Side Improv</a> - a game that allows teams to beat real customer conversations.  My clients often tell me: ‚ÄúWe have seen how they laugh and have a great time.  We don‚Äôt care how they study, it‚Äôs just important that they can achieve great results. ‚ÄùNow the teams we work with exercise weekly and the results speak for themselves.  All we did was turn the learning process into fun. <br><br>  <b>9. Successful companies will try to integrate content marketing into the sales process as deeply as possible.</b> <br>  Suppose you want to make a purchase.  How much information you deserve, you will find yourself, and what you get from the seller?  Buyers appreciate honesty and objectivity.  If in the sales process the buyer suddenly ceases to perform actions, then something went wrong.  Today this means that the buyer conducted his "investigation" and found some important information for him.  You have two options: 1) Or, you yourself generate valuable, objective content to help the user in his search, 2) Or you allow your buyer to draw information from third-party sources. <br>  Smart companies will implement honest content to help the user make a decision.  And this does not mean that they should demonstrate only those areas in which they are really the best, but also objectively recognize that they are not strong in some issues.  Marcus Sheridan, the founder of <a href="http://www.thesaleslion.com/">TheSalesLion.com</a> , is one of the largest experts in the field of content marketing.  The pages of his site are a storehouse of knowledge that will allow to achieve the best results in the area we are talking about.  According to Marcus: ‚ÄúSuccessful companies can be considered the best teachers in the field in which they work.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>10. High-growth companies will invest in the development of sales skills / problem solving for employees who are not engaged in sales.</b> <br>  Professionals, income-generating, are divided into three main categories: those who take orders, those who sell, and narrow specialists.  It doesn't matter who you think you can be.  It is important who you would like to deal with, whether you are a buyer in need of a solution.  If you are no different from most people, you will want to chat with a specialist.  This means that the seller must play a different role.  Buyers do not have to deal with a dashing, mediocre seller with familiarity. <br>  Conversely, a specialist can organize a conference for which the buyer will willingly pay.  However, such an expert does not always have the skills sufficient to conduct a complex purchase transaction.  Managing the sales process today requires the same skills that are needed for project management - great attention must be paid to the details and systematic work.  Companies with rapid growth prospects will invest in developing skills that will help their experts manage the process to help clients solve more problems.  Such experts will act as trusted advisors.  Given that these experts combine different responsibilities, leading companies will develop a consistent, simple methodology that anyone can adopt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299878/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299878/</a></p>
