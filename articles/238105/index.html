  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Detailed review of Apple iOS 8</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c5/b22/467/3c5b224679c4437494736a9acb446649.png"></div><br><br>  About a week ago, Apple launched an iOS update to version 8 on a number of devices: iPhones from 4s and above, as well as all iPad models except the first.  And if the previous version of iOS was a new milestone in the evolution of Apple products, then iOS 8 was just a further development of previously laid ideas.  The size of the update is 1.1 GB.  Let's take a closer look at what's new in the latest version of the operating system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Menu </h1>  The Manager of running applications now displays frequently used contacts, with the possibility of making a call or sending SMS.  The loading speed of the menu was significantly optimized.  Also returned the function of displaying the photo of the called contact - photocall, and the image is now stretched to full screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adb/655/e31/adb655e311b14bfab81eff41db1e03f7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ec/abe/0fb/4ecabe0fb6ff40278a101cb10f40be44.jpg">

Unfortunately, the Russian language is not yet supported, so you have to type the text in the old manner.  Also, it became possible to install third-party keyboards as separate applications.  This feature will please those who for some reason do not fit the standard iOS virtual keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e31/419/c57/e31419c57be949ffadef80b1a8db2a93.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/b94/195/45fb94195d104548812dd14a81984d2d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/822/5de/4a2/8225de4a227d43c782c09a3cd62c0b32.jpg"><br><br>  Also, right from the typed message, you can select the command to create a photo or audio file and send it to the addressee.  There was an opportunity for group chats, with the exchange of photo and video files.  To save the smartphone battery and your own nerves, you can turn off notifications of new messages in group chats.  Also now available is the option to automatically delete old messages in the correspondence, with the ability to customize the time interval. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc6/344/89e/dc634489e95748eaabe13d6e4aa5edeb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/971/c99/0d7/971c990d71e14ac19cf9795bdef05b99.jpg"><br><br><h1>  post office </h1>  If, during the process of typing a letter, you go to another mail folder and return, you will not have to start all over again, the unfinished letter will be loaded in the state in which you left it.  Very convenient, and do not have to worry about not saved text.  Also in the mail client now supports gestures to mark letters, delete and mark as unread.  The calendar now automatically loads information about events mentioned in incoming letters.  And the Mail Drop feature now allows you to send emails with attachments up to 5 GB, which by default will be downloaded to iCloud with the appropriate link sent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11f/c90/f2a/11fc90f2acae4a18aa795dd92b1f159f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/0c6/16f/9ab0c616f7dc4dbc90d79a191f224e8c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/18b/491/742/18b491742dae4b7a8d6611f08aeaa03f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  sports and health </h1>  Caring for a healthy body with the help of the registration of various activities in fashion today.  Apple did not stand aside, having implemented the HealthKit application.  It supports not only Apple Watch smart watches, but also any third-party gadgets, primarily fitness bracelets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cd/d1d/585/0cdd1d5858a94db4bd93068c1a67dcaf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9e/b8b/1c0/c9eb8b1c0e2e4f24aa520aae44d2cc1c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f7a/2dc/dcd/f7a2dcdcdd20498cb6a8d187fdb42204.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Camera </h1>  Another tribute to fashion was the introduction of the timelapse function in a photo application.  Now you can shoot some long-term events, viewing them in an accelerated mode.  Exposure control appeared with simultaneous focusing on a specific part of the image.  Also, you can now take pictures on a timer, and on an iPad with a Retina display - shoot panoramas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcf/76d/39f/fcf76d39ffc040c58ac2063177b54679.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa4/78b/69f/aa478b69f14d4941a9ebd1b7e0a7388a.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Weather </h1>  There are few changes here, just a little more data is output, and the weather forecast is now loaded not from Yahoo, but from the Weather Channel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b12/0f1/f04/b120f1f045c24a86a0e4f980993a23ee.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dff/0bc/7f9/dff0bc7f9d6e4059a7f7f98e80788475.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a82/071/7b0/a820717b05ac492784d7bd20b23a1839.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Notifications and Widgets </h1>  Despite years of resistance, Apple still gave up and introduced support for widgets.  You can download them in the app store.  Also, you can now write a response to a message directly from the notification menu, without wasting time moving to the appropriate application.  There is also a very convenient feature to turn off notifications from a specific application, this can be done with just one touch.  Of the minor changes, we can note the absence of the ‚ÄúMissed‚Äù tab in the notification menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba5/4ec/392/ba54ec3922534fbf9a5ab839b9c40e27.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b93/add/ad5/b93addad59454606821390d1fccef4fe.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d5/917/56d/7d591756db524a36a725c11a00a94aba.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/a10/f90/5aba10f90e534f7ea9195626e68c7eaa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbe/50c/3cd/bbe50c3cdec84a42bc4284d3a6b5c256.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab9/d09/3ec/ab9d093ec1f5449d89997026e301dbd8.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Search </h1>  Unfortunately, Apple has still not fixed the glitch with the twitching of the Spotlight application on the first launch.  Although you quickly get used to it and then you just stop noticing.  Search for information is now possible not only inside the phone, but also on the Internet and third-party applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d9/619/fc0/8d9619fc021a4a51b1e95001f04a52fd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/7c8/c43/7a77c8c4352e4f8dad9f69cd980a2e18.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fb/23e/76d/3fb23e76d5be454d97f10bddda4bf9ff.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Family Access </h1>  Having created a virtual group of up to 6 people, you can share applications, photos and information about your location within it.  With parental accounts, you can limit the ability to purchase applications.  When a child tries to buy an application, the parent receives a request to confirm or reject this operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50d/5d2/aec/50d5d2aeccfb4301b06d4b95f14ec434.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/857/51e/d70/85751ed70b834d71b5ac69d16d8b11bb.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Siri </h1>  The virtual assistant has become even smarter and now knows how to recognize the songs being played.  Also, to start Siri is not necessary to press a button, it responds to the voice.  Another innovation is the function of displaying the words you utter on the screen.  Russian language is not supported. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ea/be9/6ad/7eabe96ad7d54842aa20c35320c2f04f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b56/429/ffe/b56429ffefd54726a670afe8f3b22ce9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/318/4e0/19c/3184e019c63c4595807e51d4cccf6c34.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f56/f65/327/f56f653279cb4c4cb1c9d4744bd24c20.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Safari </h1>  Only the iPad version has been updated, now there is a function for viewing open pages in the form of tabs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/529/fa4/12f/529fa412fcdc4ff99715063d413514b0.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Notes </h1>  Inserting images into text messages is now supported. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e62/f5d/606/e62f5d606a6a426bb17f680a5e29ac3b.jpg"><br><br><h1>  A photo </h1> There was a function to save deleted photos in the last 30 days, a kind of photo basket.  So if you decide that you have got a bit excited about some photo, then you can restore it.  Now you can search for images, while only by location or date of shooting.  Also now there is a special section for the most beautiful photos that you yourself mark.  If before the photo stream from a smartphone and tablet was limited to 1000 images, which came as a general list, now the number of photos and videos is limited only by the iCloud volume limit that you set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/9f2/d72/7aa9f2d72fa348a3ad3c1adad89d3ef4.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Applications </h1>  Now you can increase the capabilities of the system with the help of third-party plug-ins and extensions.  For example, share images not only through a standard application. <br><br>  AppStore has been slightly reworked, and the search for useful applications, depending on the location of users, began to work better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48b/47d/268/48b47d26826d41109fd60eb55e027041.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/002/138/b02/002138b0206047d2a5e9567442257cb0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/188/467/fc5/188467fc57b84f57aca9f9ff0f5237af.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c3/476/d4c/4c3476d4c0094a98a1b62bf80a72d549.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Payments </h1>  Apple began promoting its own contactless payment system using NFC.  To dispel user concerns, the principle of maximum security is put in the forefront.  In particular, a fingerprint scanner on a smartphone acts as an additional level of protection.  Also, you will not have to carry a bank card with you; it will be enough to enter its data once into the Passbook application.  Apple swears it will not collect this information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b54/f24/25f/b54f2425fbe04d75ba19d2d840c3c8fe.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Cloud </h1>  If you do not have enough free 5 GB of iCloud cloud storage, you can purchase a monthly subscription by expanding the available volume to 1 TB.  However, buying, for example, 20 GB of storage, you lose free 5 GB. <br><br>  In Cloud Drive you can now store any files, not just photos, videos and documents.  Access to the repository is also possible through the Windows client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c51/0a4/f16/c510a4f1638e40a38349b2b9171f3648.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee1/3e9/29c/ee13e929c9de4020a2f9d3a31e2208fb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c71/126/373/c711263732a6425d84962d8b9272fbcf.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Mac + iOS </h1>  A bunch of these two systems has become even closer, almost merging into some kind of single work space.  For example, on one device, incoming calls of another device are now displayed, and by starting to type text on Mac, you can continue to do this on iOS, regardless of whether it is a smartphone or a tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aaf/3ba/88e/aaf3ba88e9be42138e35d81ee44044e8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d0/fbf/373/3d0fbf373974441fb9761fce7cfcf97c.jpg"><br><br><h1>  For developers </h1>  Now you can create sets of applications.  The programs themselves can now access the Touch ID, and some of the benefits and functions of your development can be illustrated not only by screenshots, but also by videos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3df/289/3d3/3df2893d357f4dab8e01facbceed6283.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/630/002/f81/630002f81f724a45a45f02953ad8e112.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Duration of work </h1>  In the settings, you can now view information about which applications consume the most battery power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b99/063/748/b99063748c764961967440440161a1a8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e2/e33/abf/5e2e33abf96d47a7b9829493b8101326.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/883/7c8/376/8837c83769a14f1dac7808dc594cdb72.jpg"><br><br>  We were alarmed that some users of beta versions reported a significant decrease in the duration of work when switching to iOS 8. We conducted our own comparative testing on two iPhone 5s, running iOS 8 and iOS 7.1.2.  The minimum screen brightness was set and Real Racing 3 game was launched. Within an hour, a smartphone with iOS 8 lost 23% of its charge, and with iOS 7 it lost 33%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/012/8b9/0ce/0128b90ceccd4fd2a210a176274f503f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b07/343/359/b073433590584ffd8afe691a0542b0c5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c7/10e/f68/0c710ef680424a6282bd82a87a5d0587.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38d/a27/f0d/38da27f0d74d4cbebbe88a8f0a934d42.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1>  Most of all we are interested in the stability and security of the system when using third-party extensions.  Alas, due to the recent scandal with iCloud, trust in this function may be undermined, because Apple products, among other things, have always been famous for their high level of data protection.  Well, apparently, Apple cannot independently satisfy all the needs of the growing army of its users, and was forced to open the opportunity to change the functionality of the system with the help of other people's plug-ins. <br><br>  We especially liked the in-depth integration of the Apple ecosystem with the ‚Äúinterpenetration‚Äù of various functions, the modified email client with the function of restoring incomplete emails, and the ability to use third-party applications for data exchange. <br><br>  Among the shortcomings can be noted the Apple Pay payment service that is useless in the Russian context.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not allow the use of NFC-module for any other tasks.  Widgets are available exclusively in the notification center.  Also, the average duration of work is very small. <br><br>  Alas, but the upgrade to iOS 8 carries additional difficulties for users.  When wireless update requires a lot of free space in the device.  Also, the new iCloud Drive cloud application turned out to be incompatible with the iCloud desktop application, which is a unique feature of OS X Yosemite.  After the update, iPhone 4s starts to work very slowly, and the number of unstable applications running <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2014/09/23/crittercism-offers-some-interesting-statistics-about-ios-8s-cra/">under iOS 8 is 78% more compared to iOS 7</a> . <br><br>  Also the other day there was an ugly story with an upgrade to version 8.0.1.  It was designed to fix numerous problems with application crashes, a glitch with switching to a standard keyboard when entering a password, inaccessibility of the gallery for some applications, and a critical HealthKit error.  Criticality was expressed in the fact that all applications that support this new service were simply not allowed in the App Store. <br><br>  However, the installation of the update resulted in a massive loss of the cellular signal and the inability of the TouchID.  Most often, these problems occurred with owners of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.  As a result, after only 1.5 hours, the update <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/238035/">was withdrawn by the manufacturer</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238105/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238105/</a></p>
