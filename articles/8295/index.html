  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Offline: Notes of the old virtual</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><b>Monday</b></i> <br>  The family pinged until the full DDOS - I had to go to Belarus to visit relatives.  Going to the train.  Laptop with you, but no internet.  Around full offline.  Feeling a little ill at ease.  To calm down, I decided to imagine that I was like Jacques-Yves Cousteau, only not under water, but offline.  It gets easier ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Offline is a very strange thing.  First, it is very big.  Highly.  And you can only navigate through it very slowly, and somehow ... linearly.  Here I am going on a train now, and I see far, across the field, a wood.  But I can‚Äôt get there - although it‚Äôs interesting to me.  Wrong it somehow, and terribly uncomfortable. <br><br>  * * * <br>  Surprised the trees.  They are very different.  Branches, leaves, needles ... How much effort put the designer - and why?  Unclear.  But beautiful.  I respect you. <br><br>  * * * <br>  Well done offline designers water.  Looks very naturalistic, delays.  It is good that the traffic is practically anlim, otherwise it would have cost a pretty penny. <br>  UPD: The sky is also cool, but this will not surprise us.

      <i><b>Tuesday</b></i> <br>  There are people who live offline CONSTANTLY! <br>  What are they doing there?  Riddle ... <br><br>  <i><b>Wednesday</b></i> <br>  Strange offline approach to construction.  They clearly lack a good CMS here - you need to tell them what they are suffering.  The tasks are typical, and every time they give birth to an elephant. <br><br>  * * * <br>  Surprised animals.  There are many different.  About some, I even remember being called.  I do not know many.  Surprisingly, despite the lack of intelligence, they actively surf offline.  What are they looking for there? <br><br>  UPD: Birds finally kamikaze real.  In 3D move without problems.  I envy. <br><br>  UPD2: Surprised butterflies - small, but there too. <br><br>  <i><b>Thursday</b></i> <br>  Offline is a lot of trash.  Where the moderators are looking is not clear.  Not only that the processing of all these flying yellow packets and scraps of newspapers certainly strains the server - and so it looks unattractive.  Even it is a pity for the designers - they tried, they sprinkled grass, trees - and then they threw in pieces of paper from the ice cream and all for the tail of the dog. <br><br>  UPD: Ice cream is delicious ... cold ... <br><br>  * * * <br>  I caught a glimpse of off-line hackers ‚Äî poked tubes into a birch tree, plastic bottles on them ‚Äî and juice was parsed. <br>  I wonder what adult hackers are here? <br><br>  <i><b>Friday</b></i> <br>  Everything is very unreasonable offline with traffic - a lot of communications, mostly of two kinds - pipes and wires, a different traffic goes through all of them, and a lot of these pipes and wires are wound, and they often go in parallel.  No optimization.  Do not they see this, or what? <br><br>  * * * <br>  In terms of advertising, offline is lagging far behind - mostly there are multi-format banner grids, with a very bad context.  Text ads run out of control, normal context insertion options are rare.  Google is not on them.  From the exceptions, the attendants at the train station were pleased: "the apartment is near by the day."  May because when they want.  They would have to screw the system of certificates of trust and a user rating - that would be the most. <br><br>  * * * <br>  Specifically, we got lunch breaks - not, well, in fact, as it is possible - the user comes to you, and you do not have nifiga.  What a service, damn it. <br>  The wacky custom of not working at night is generally something that I cannot write about calmly. <br><br>  <i><b>Saturday</b></i> <br>  Today I saw moderators.  It's funny that they are immediately visible offline - they are in such a gray form and they hang clubs on their sides.  We need to think about how to port an idea to us - it may be interesting to succeed.  Immediately obvious - moder next, do not want to break anything. <br>  I haven‚Äôt come up with their work so far, but they say that it doesn‚Äôt differ much from online - for minor violations they can kick up to 72 hours for a hearing, and for larger violations - a ban from 15 days to life.  Hard. <br><br>  <i><b>Sunday</b></i> <br>  Yesterday I laughed a lot - I saw the TV.  This is such a box as a monitor, only more.  There is no sistemnik.  And the devil shows that.  You can‚Äôt affect this in any way, just switch channels - and there‚Äôs another feature that means.  He spoke with knowledgeable people - they assure that sometimes they show something cool.  Please - well, show me.  They do not, wait, I have to look at the program.  I looked into this program - a language unfamiliar, but fairly obvious, all in Russian.  How their coders cannot compose a normal program on it is a mystery ... <br><br>  <i><b>Monday</b></i> <br>  What really annoys offline is that you don‚Äôt have time for everything.  And a little gape, he didn‚Äôt turn his head in the wrong place - that's all, that‚Äôs.  The second time you do not scroll.  It is wrong, it turns out unfair.  The house isn‚Äôt the way - I wasn‚Äôt there for a week, but it‚Äôs not scary - I‚Äôll make it up for 20 hours, I‚Äôll reply to the letters, I‚Äôll review the RSS, I‚Äôll guide you to Habr√©.  Everything's under control. <br><br>  Good at home ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8295/</a></p>
