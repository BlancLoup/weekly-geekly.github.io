  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lie Recognition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Even in ancient times, there were methods for exposing liars.  For example, in ancient China, a suspect had to pick up a handful of dry rice in his mouth and listen to the accusation.  If the rice remained dry, then the accused is lying, his salivation is suspended for fear of exposure. <br><br>  Currently, there are several varieties of "lie detectors," based on measurements of the pulse, sweating, salivation and fluctuations in the voice.  First, a person is asked a series of simple questions to which he must answer truthfully ‚Äî setting up the detector, then proceed directly to interrogation.  In case a person is lying, as a rule, due to even the smallest excitement and tension, the parameters listed above will differ from those taken as nominal ones (as a result of adjustment).  Of course, with the help of these devices it is absolutely impossible to answer the question whether a person is lying, anyway it is impossible (for example, there are specially trained people who can ‚Äúdeceive‚Äù detectors). <br><br>  But in life, during important negotiations, as, however, in everyday life it is also often necessary to know whether your interlocutor is lying or not without the use of detectors.  I want to give a few tips based on my own experience, books I have read and movies watched. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <ul><li>  A person who lies is more likely to repeat the same story to you with the same words (at least those moments in which he lied).  A person who speaks to you sincerely, retelling the story will use new words and turns.  Too smooth speech can be a sign that a person has learned his lies beforehand. </li><li>  Try to ask direct questions so that their formulation would in turn raise questions with the interlocutor if the answer is yes.  For example, "I was told that you are flying to Cyprus."  a person who really does not fly to Cyprus in most cases will immediately notice that he does not fly to Cyprus (eg. ‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt even want to, and who told you such nonsense?‚Äù).  A person who is going to lie that he is not flying will often ask the question ‚ÄúWho said?‚Äù Without giving an answer to yours. </li><li>  When talking, follow the hands of the interlocutor.  Scratching parts of the head - ears, nose, neck - a sign of lies.  Most often this happens when a person has difficulty finding a plausible one.  This is a natural reaction.  (This item applies more to long conversations and big lies). </li><li>  If a person looks away, it is likely that he is hiding something.  Something insignificant (this ‚Äúgesture‚Äù means that the interlocutor did not even foresee that he would have to lie in this). </li></ul><br>  Pocket detectors also appear.  Not so long ago, the Israeli company Trustech developed a handheld lie detector called Handy Truster.  The palm-sized device analyzes the parameters of a person‚Äôs voice and compares it with a sample: the voice of the same person telling the truth.  The setup procedure takes about 30 seconds, after which you can begin to incriminate the interlocutor in a lie.  Handy Truster costs about $ 50 and can connect to a mobile phone.  A small LCD display shows an apple, which is reduced (bitten off) according to how big the device registers.  According to the creators, he defines a lie in eight cases out of ten. <br><br>  The first public test of the device took place during the pre-election television debates of Al Gore and George W. Bush.  According to the device, during the transfer Bush lied 57 times, and Gore only 23. In particular, the device was rated as a false statement by Bush: "Each of us must love children from the bottom of our hearts and from the bottom of our hearts."  As for Gore, his statement: ‚ÄúWe will continue to support Israel‚Äù - Truster regarded as true, and then the phrase: ‚ÄúAnd also to establish cooperation with Arab countries‚Äù ‚Äîas a lie. <br><br>  There are also programs ‚Äî lie detectors for PDAs and smartphones.  On my iPhone, I tested the Agile Lie Detector.  The program is able to recognize the voltage in the voice and displays some numerical factor, comparing which with the nominal (obtained during the adjustment), you can begin to recognize false.  Maybe I was doing something wrong, but my program showed meager results (however, perhaps it is more designed for American voices). <br><br>  For dessert, I will tell another interesting fact: <br><br>  In a person speaking a notorious lie, blood rushes around the eyes and the skin around the eyes becomes red.  These smallest specks can not be noticed with the naked eye, but special thermal scanning equipment detects them unmistakably.  I read that on the basis of this fact they were going to make a lie detector (James Levine's research from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51541/</a></p>
