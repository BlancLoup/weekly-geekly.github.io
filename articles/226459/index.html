There is a mailbox, but this is not email.  Instead of user names, there are ‚Äúcamp names‚Äù.  Status updates are updates to records on miniature ‚Äúblackboard‚Äù boards that are worn around the neck.  The only allowed technology is the camp historical digital camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a20/6ae/322/a206ae3227d60b9361c495afd26032a5.jpg" alt="image">

      Camp co-founder Levi Felix says that the goal of the camp is to give people a break from the daily ‚Äúdigital‚Äù interruptions of their lives. <br>  ‚ÄúWe live in a world where the average person spends 8 to 12 hours‚Äú on the screen. ‚Äù  Our tourists spend an average of 13 hours on environmental surveys, ‚Äùsaid Felix.  "Therefore, when you can come and simply disconnect for a long period of time, play, create and explore, interact with other people, not because you earn a living or, not because this is your position, your colleagues, then an incredible feeling. " <br>  Grounded camp is surrounded by sequoias and is located in the Anderson Valley, Camp Navarro, Northern California.  When tourists first arrive at the camp, enthusiastic counselors greet them with applause and hugs.  Tourists are offered homemade cookies with almond milk and, also, a choice of nicknames is offered.  The camp has signs that remind tourists to leave all their everyday technologies and live in the present.  Tourists can even make a haircut under a tree. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94e/44c/2eb/94e44c2eb63df5677c1e125c84954a91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even before the check-in registration, tourists hand over a paper bag containing all their electronics.  Most vacationers bring their phones.  Some also take their tablets and laptops with them.  Packages with valuables remain in storage and are blocked during the whole weekend.  In case of an emergency, the camp receives calls and emails and answers them. <br>  A new camper who flew in from Washington, DC, fought the urge to take a photo after she sent her Galaxy Note 2 in a paper bag.  ‚ÄúI hope I won't rip my skin off and look for it everywhere,‚Äù she said.  "I just really want to start living a moment, and not live constantly in the desire to capture this moment and show it to everyone." <br>  So that vacationers can have fun without their technology, Grounded camp offers workshops, trainings on all possible topics, ranging from yoga to archery, from cooking truffles to hip-hop dancing and sticking fire with sticks.  Also there are traditional summer camp activities, such as ‚Äúflag seizure‚Äù, swimming, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c88/722/ca8/c88722ca8a0496586207ec307392b657.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The cost of pleasure is $ 570, it includes accommodation in the room, outdoor activities and a balanced, exquisite food.  The camp exists for the second year and has increased from one season to three, in each season 250 guests are settled.  Felix says that 40 percent of holidaymakers from last year come back again.  This year, he said, there are people flying from 32 states and 5 countries, in the age range from 19 to 81 years. <br>  Resting, nicknamed "Love Handles", who lives in San Francisco, has returned for a second year.  According to him, last year, after he returned from the camp, he became better in contact with other people.  ‚ÄúWhen you live in San Francisco, you see people every day, and you do not interact with them.  You do not recognize people on the street, "he explained.  ‚ÄúEverything changed when I returned.  I was much more open and ready to talk to people, even with those whom I happened to meet. ‚Äù <br>  Inspiration about such a digital detox clinic came from a life-threatening situation.  Felix said that several years ago he worked so hard (he was the vice president of a tech company in Los Angeles) that he did not understand that he was sick.  At that time, he had to go to the hospital and spend three days in the intensive care unit after doctors discovered a ‚Äútear‚Äù in his esophagus.  After fearing about his health, he decided to take some time off and eventually realized that other people would also like to get a temporary recharge.  And, of course, when Felix talks about recharging, he does not mean a battery.  ‚ÄúMy goal for campers is to give them a sense of charge, to give them a new sense of self, a sense of new meaning.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06d/0ca/5ee/06d0ca5ee0b55046f43c00e8a5306709.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Grounded camp definitely seeks to solve the world problem, taking us in more "simple" times.  The founders do not hate technology and do not ask people to leave them forever.  This is digital detoxification, after all, not digital rehabilitation.  And, unequivocally, that soon after returning, vacationers connect with their new friends from the camp on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. <br><br>  Translation and article prepared by the <a href="http://telebreeze.com/">Telebreeze Team</a> <br>  Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TelebreezeCorp">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TelebreezeCor">Twitter page</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226459/</a></p>
