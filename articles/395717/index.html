The reason was the injection of new filters to me, so to speak, that there was an information guide.  Well, about everything in order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/dcc/f31/8f2dccf3149b47a4a68dd2e9fb2de639.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For almost the entire year, the Tion <a href="https://tion.ru/product/breezer/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dreferal%26utm_campaign%3Ddihalt2"><b>O2 breather</b></a> was continuously on.  More precisely, it turns on my timer during the day and turns off for the night, anyway there is nobody in the office at night.  And I forgot about its existence practically.  It works and works, as the climatic equipment should work - quietly and imperceptibly.  I didn‚Äôt need to open the windows and air out.  In general, I had already forgotten when I opened them, except for washing the glass and only that.  There is no noise, and I no longer perceive the rustle of the fan of the breather.

      <b>‚ñåFilters</b> <br>  They say that the first coarse F7 filter can be vacuumed and prolong its life, at least a bit more efficiency.  I have never shot them, never cleaned them, and generally I take them out and photograph them for the first time.  Though I live near a busy road, but I live high and dust is not to say that it will take me a lot.  Although about the dust below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e86/e51/283/e86e51283e374332a3c5b6530a54a7b2.png" width="100%"><br><br>  The HEPA filter looks the same as it was, although, if you look at the lumen, you can see that it turned gray from snow-white and there were streaks and clots of dirt.  Somewhere inside the filter.  As for the AK filter, I will not say anything, as it was black, it remained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e5/986/979/3e5986979111473588ea14dc8dfcf4c3.png" width="100%"><br>  No, this is not the result of living with the breather.  This is a different cat, in its natural appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/bcb/2e8/baabcb2e8c024aaca3a5cd01cb08013b.png" width="100%"><br><br>  <b>‚ñåDust</b> <br>  She was a little before, but she was.  The main thing that disappeared from the apartment with the installation of the breather is abrasive street dust.  Previously, it happened, you wipe the dust with a finger from something, and she, just like sand, scrapes, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe window sill.  And now, if the dust is, then soft, home :) <br><br>  <b>Smells</b> <br>  I began to notice them, leaving the house.  Well, that is, from the series: I went out, turned the corner ... oh, and now the trucks are turning and solarium is smoking!  Oh, today NMU again (unfavorable meterological conditions, read the metallurgists again dropped something from the heart).  At home it is not felt, it used to happen when the windows are open. <br><br>  <b> Gnus</b> <br>  This spring, whether the weather is favorable, or if something happened, but a cloud of some nasty midges has formed here, this has never happened before in such quantities.  Small biting midge, so small that it looks like a tiny dot.  And bites, you bastard, so that all in blisters and scratching for half a day.  Mosquito net for her, that the gate shop, walk in a crowd.  If I used to air the second half of the apartment, opening the windows facing the courtyard, to the forest, then this spring they were fraught with opening.  I also started to turn on the fumigator because of a small child.  I am very sorry that there is no second breather to the other half of the apartment.  He saved himself by opening all the doors wide, and breather stuck into the turbo mode.  Badly poor, but it saved - in the morning there was no feeling of stuffiness in the apartment (or rather, the feeling of incredible freshness when going out). <br><br>  <b>‚ñåWinter operation</b> <br>  In the last article there were many questions about how there is in the winter?  And will not it be frozen?  Do not ruin the heating?  In general, throughout the winter the breather worked normally, that is, switching on the timer during the day and turning off at night.  He worked at 1 or 2 speeds, that is, in a quiet working mode for 1-2 people (in the last article, look at the charts, understand the approximate efficiency of the device). <br><br>  So, I did not turn on the heating once.  In general, simply by setting the temperature of the heater on at a minimum equal to the shutdown threshold -25C.  There were frosts up to -30, these days the breather did not work, it has at least -25 (but I have the old version, now the breather works up to -40C, which is more important for a cold climate).  And in the ordinary winter -10 ...- 20 there was no condensate, especially looked.  I even turned on for a couple of hours for the third mode, it was about -18 outside, but I didn‚Äôt notice any unpleasant effects.  The apartment did not freeze when working on the 1-2 mode and had little effect on the tangible temperature in the room.  Although the room is angular and the battery here fries not so hot.  In general, in the winter he did not float me either.  He worked himself and worked. <br><br>  We remove the suitcase from the wall, look into the pipe ... There is no mold or any traces of moisture, leaks, or anything else in the pipe or around it.  Just a little street dust. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49b/198/b5f/49b198b5f2c246069c44dd9a1eb4a44c.png" width="100%"><br><br>  <b>‚ñåGlitches and jambs</b> <br>  Where do without them. <br><br>  Incredibly infuriated all the time (and continue, yes), only two points: <br><br>  1) The breather interface, or rather the fact that the temperature is barely visible, as it is in a tiny font, and watching the temperature on the breather is a nice thing - it will show the outside temperature much more accurately than any window thermometer.  It is not affected by the sun's rays, because  he measures it in a channel, in a running stream.  And such valuable infa is barely visible.  Why do I have a full-time clock there?  So near the breather, I also had a stool settled in, stand on it and watch the temperature outside.  And cho, convenient :) <br>  But this is all a matter of the past.  Tion hears its users (at least me;)), and in the new version of the breather they changed the screen.  Now there is a hefty outboard temperature indicator, a fan power indicator and mode icons.  The power cord, however, still sadly sticks out from the side, like some kind of iron.  But here I understand them: remaking the mold is not a new screen to order.  Absolutely other money.  Someday it will finish. <br><br>  2) About the clock.  Well, how can you manage to make watches in the 21st century, which run away by 15 minutes in 2-3 months?  AS?  Even the most dumb Chinese quartz will not give such an error.  There is a timer on the clock there, and taking into account the fact that the breather is a thing from the ‚Äúturned on and forgot about it‚Äù series, then in a year time will crawl away by an hour.  Or is it not a bug, but a feature?  So that the clock does not translate?  If you are a perfectionist and do not tolerate something wrong, for example, being on one more watch, then shoot at once. <br><br>  3) An inconvenient moment was detected in the timer processing algorithm.  He is here at the events.  That is, it is time to turn on - he turned on.  It is time to turn off - turned off.  Everything seemed logical.  But what if the event comes when the breather is turned off?  Electricity is over, for example.  The event will be missed and after switching on the power, the breather doesn‚Äôt remember that, say, we‚Äôre having a working time, we must turn on!  Although the clock and settings it remembers in non-volatile memory. <br><br>  Also sometimes gave an error closing flaps.  More precisely, he ceased to respond to management and spat error code "EU 5", which in the manual says that the breather time to pass on the experiences in the service center.  I wrote to tech support and in a few minutes I was told that this is an error of closing the damper actuator and, in principle, is treated by resetting through power reset.  Either she froze, or wedged her, but it happened that her breather could not open / close correctly and fell out with an error.  I had to turn on and off the toggle switch.  After that, the flap took the desired position and the error disappeared.  It happened two or three times during the winter, and not even in the cold even, but on an ordinary day. <br><br>  <b>Brain</b> <br>  Now about the info guide.  So that was, what else to tell, I threw a couple of new filters.  One is the previously known F7, and the second is a reinforced absorption / catalytic filter.  HEPA superfiltration is unnecessary for me here, but an extra ember would not hurt.  Put it in place of HEPA. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b65/d0d/83b/b65d0d83b55548fa9ef3772ad3131b54.png" width="100%"><br><br>  And recently there was a new version of the breather: MAC.  Now the device is synchronized with the <a href="https://tion.ru/product/magicair/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dreferal%26utm_campaign%3Ddihalt2">MagicAir</a> gadget, which collects data on the microclimate (temperature, humidity and CO2), and the breather automatically controls these parameters.  Work can be monitored on the smartphone screen.  I was called to the presentation, but she was in Moscow, and I had to go far from Chelyabinsk very far.  I used to be heavy on the rise, but with the completion of the family, in general ... Magomed will wait for the mountain :) <br><br>  <b>‚ñåIt</b> <br>  The general impression of the device for the year - how did I live without it?  Especially felt now in his workshop, where he closed the window stuffy, opened - noisy.  Although there put, but there I myself something in this spirit simpler skolhozhu from improvised trash :) <br><br> <a href="http://tion.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dreferal%26utm_campaign%3Ddihalt2"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/e93/9ec/d63e939ecaf9431e882ca9333a92449a.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395717/</a></p>
