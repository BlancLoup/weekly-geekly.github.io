  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mackintosh without a mouse</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The article will be more interesting makovodam, especially beginners.  I hope that someone will come in handy.  There will be a second part about text input, if you like this one. <br><br>  A computer mouse is such a handy device for tapping into different interface elements, but you can also tap into them without the help of a mouse.  By the way, sometimes it is much more convenient than moving your hand from the keyboard to the mouse and back.  It is enough to remember the necessary key combinations and teach yourself to use them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To start, climb into System Preferences ‚Üí Keyboard &amp; Mouse and select the Keyboard Shortcuts tab.  There at the bottom there is a wonderful thing called Full keyboard access, so, there you need to break into the All controls fad.  For those who have a Russified system: there shouldn't be any questions about the translation, everything is clear, everything is bourgeois (it happened;) Close the settings and go ahead! <br>  All Apple players know that there is a menu bar in Macs, one for all and one for one :) It‚Äôs very simple to get into it from the keyboard: Ctrl + F2 (Ctrl, not Cmd (!), Then you can use the intuitive arrow keys (‚Üê ‚Üí ‚Üë ‚Üì), but how to choose the necessary menu item - not for me to explain to you, Enter (Return,) or a space - for you to decide. <br><br><h4>  Finder </h4><br>  A handy thing, in my opinion, is even more convenient than the Windows Explorer, especially the Columns View mode.  Well, the fact that there can be wielded by arrows - everyone knows.  Open a file - Cmd + O, but not everyone knows that you can open a file through Cmd + ‚Üì, which is much more convenient (for me personally). <br>  Cmd + i - information about the file: how many bytes it takes, what kind of crap it is and everything.  If you select several files with the Cmd key and apply this key combination, then there will be a beautiful sight from a dozen windows, you can avoid this by pressing Ctrl + Cmd + i - the system will show summary information about the selected files. <br>  I do not like the icon on the file - no question.  Kopipast help you.  We do Cmd + i on the file from which we want to steal the picture, just tap on the file to which we want to apply the picture, tap on the icon (top left) on the source, cmd + c, go to the window with the destination file, tap on it the same window location - and Cmd + v, voila.  This was possible to do in System 7.5.1 (I don‚Äôt know earlier versions).  By the way, graphic editors can also be suitable for such copy-paste.

    <h4>  What else? </h4><br>  Well, close the window is Cmd + w, close the program - Cmd + q, move between programs - Cmd + Tab, between windows in the current program - Cmd + [(works for those who have a Mac keyboard, there is a square bracket next to the left shifta - this is it, it doesn‚Äôt work on the empty keyboard, or I just don‚Äôt know how. <b>OPA:</b> I know how - in the Keyboard Shortcuts we search and replace such a thing as ‚ÄúMove focus to next window in active application‚Äù with the combination we need, I I put in Cmd + ¬ß, to the left of the number 1) <br>  Not tired?  Not?  Then take a screenshot.  Shift + Cmd + 3 - the entire screen, Shift + Cmd + 4 - select the desired piece, just select, and no keys need to be jammed.  All screenshots will appear on your desktop under the name ‚ÄúPicture #‚Äù, where # is the sequence number of the screenshot. <br><br><h4>  Dialog boxes </h4><br>  There is such a key - Tab.  Well, tyrka it in the dialog boxes.  The controls are great dancing.  We chose the button - pyshch on the space (exactly the space, this is important! Enter will press the blue button, not the gray one with the blue contour). <br><br><h4>  Few amenities </h4><br>  F9 - will show all open windows.  F10 - will highlight the working window.  F11 - will show / hide the desktop.  F12 - Dashboard.  F8 - Spaces, a good thing, if enabled, but it is not clear why (I personally almost never use it).  About Spaces wrote so that he did not understand what he wrote.  Cmd + Backspace - file deletion, Shift + Cmd + Backspace - clears the recycle bin, but only if you are in the Finder.  You can get to the Finder via Cmd + Tab or Ctrl + F3 (go to the Dock, there‚Äôs the Finder always on the left).  Cmd ++ and Cmd + - - usually increase / decrease font and other things and often work with an additional keyboard, but Alt + Cmd ++ and Alt + Cmd + - work as a screen magnifier. <br><br><h4>  For the future </h4><br>  In the next article, if we do not zaminusyut karma, we will learn to work with the text by means of the system, and almost without using the mouse and any programs.  Believe me, this is an exciting experience. <br><br>  PS Everything written works for the system, but is not guaranteed for third-party programs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37701/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37701/</a></p>
