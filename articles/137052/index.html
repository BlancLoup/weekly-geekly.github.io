  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LitTime.ru - ribbon of book novelties</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, friends.  It seems to be worth taking a pretentious note and talk about your mega-project, but it does not work.  I just want to tell you about my project, which I worked for almost 3 years (I will leave the story for later).  More precisely, about his first finished stage - the tape of books published in various publishing houses.  I am writing because it may already be useful to some of you.  So, <a href="http://littime.ru/">LitTime.ru</a> <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/20120127/yB2gMsGT.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  At the present time on the site you will find news feed on books published in the largest publishing houses (AST, Eksmo, Alpha-book, Alphabet, etc.).  Books carry the maximum amount of information a publisher gives (not all printers indicate an ISBN, for example) and can be found.  For ease of viewing, we created a filter by genre, with the ability to cut off books-reissues (for example, if you read only in electronic form, then reprints may not be interesting for you).  For registered users, the filter is saved; when you come to the site, you can only see what is interesting for you. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Also, so that you do not forget the book that interests you, we have created a list of ‚ÄúI will read‚Äù (located in your personal account).  For example, I read fiction and non-fiction in turn, so it can sometimes take a month or more when I get to the book I am interested in.  And if there are several?  A list can help. <br><br>  On the main page there are buttons "I will read." <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/20120127/hSg16kMA.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you click on the button, the book will be entered in the list we need.  Logging in to your personal account, you will see it. <br><br><img src="http://s2.ipicture.ru/uploads/20120127/6SjW35QE.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Clicking on the button "Read", you remove the book from the list. <br><br>  Also, for the convenience of those who order books via the Internet, we display links to description and order pages in paper and digital book stores: Ozon.ru, My-shop.ru, Read.ru and LitRes.ru.  You can find them by going to the page describing the book. <br><br>  That's all that our site offers today.  LitTime will evolve unceasingly, and I hope that the current functionality could be useful to someone, it will increase very soon. <br><br><h4>  Where we will develop </h4><br>  The next step in our development will be the bibliographies of the authors.  Everyone is interested in knowing everything that the interested author wrote, in what order (mandatory or not) to read his cycles, to see the most popular and highly-rated works.  This is the next step of our project. <br>  And then ... Plans are great, but we will begin to implement them as much as we can.  Now there are three of us - a programmer, a marketer and a content manager. <br><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  I brought this section to the end, because it will not be interesting for everyone.  Here I will touch upon the history of the project, I will try to share some experience. <br><br>  I first thought about the project in early 2009, when I was writing a diploma.  No, he didn‚Äôt become my topic then, he only began to develop gradually in his head.  I realized that the Web does not have that site that would help my passion - reading - the way I wanted it.  That is not the necessary functionality, it is limited, then locked in the framework of genre ghettos. <br><br>  As a programmer from me is awful, I decided to look for a partner.  With the first, we were engaged in a project for a little more than six months, almost finished ... but he had to go to another city for family reasons, leaving school.  As a result, ‚Äúfrom there‚Äù he was unable to continue working on the project.  Then we parted, I got a job (before that I entered the content into that part of the site that the programmer managed to write). <br>  The second partner was my friend.  But if at first he lacked qualifications, but there was motivation, then in a bad year, when there were no results, she was blown away.  In the end, I lost more time ... <br>  My good friend introduced me to the third programmer.  He was interested in the idea, but bearing in mind previous experience, we agreed not on a partnership, but on payment for development and administration.  And in the end, he became my friend and partner.  Responsible person to whom the project is interesting not only as a part-time job, without which I could not do it. <br><br>  Now the work is organized like this: from my ideas, money, general management and public relations by all partisan means;  programmer development and all technical issues;  content manager deals with the input of information on the site for a fee.  Such a startup without a garage :-) <br><br>  Total, on the project to the current state took almost 3 years.  And could be enough for less than one.  What were my mistakes?  Not well versed in people and in the degree of motivation, I guess.  Maybe almost no luck. <br>  But, nevertheless, the project is in front of you, it is the result of our work, 3 years of travel for me personally!  And then it will only grow! <br><br><h4>  In custody </h4><br>  Once again I want to thank you for reading the article, visiting the site.  I really hope that he was useful to you.  I will be glad to your comments and ideas. <br>  I also want to offer you my <a href="https://twitter.com/">twitter</a> - in it you will learn about the release of the most interesting books, literary news, receive links to the interviews. <br><br>  With gratitude, Alexey Skrebnev. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> On the site, especially for the presentation on Habr√©, we hid the ‚ÄúEaster egg‚Äù.  No, we will not give prizes to the finder, but I hope we will give a smile) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137052/</a></p>
