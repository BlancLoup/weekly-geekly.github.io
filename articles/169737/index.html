Total</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, I wrote a short <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/169081/">note</a> with a survey about donate's fate as a way of financing writing.  It's time to take stock. <br><br>  Short.  The story with Liters for the week did not end with anything.  The contract has a clause on the automatic renewal of the contract.  Also, it has clause 2.7 ‚ÄúThe agency undertakes to pay the Author a remuneration in accordance with clause 1.1.3 of the Agreement‚Äù  According to our data, no payment has been made for the last 4 years.  On the letter with this information, the liters did not respond in any way.  Books continue to be sold (a total of 72 works). <br><br>  UPDATE: after this note, Lithuania has contacted us asking for the transfer details.

Of these, 90 transferred a thank-you payment (for which they were deeply grateful and sincere thanks from Svyatoslav Loginov and from me personally).  This is 0.17% of the audience.  The average payment was slightly more than 300 rubles. <br><br>  Thus, in order to provide income from thank-you payments in the amount of 30,000 rubles (a little less than the average salary in St. Petersburg), it is necessary, in addition to writing directly, to write articles asking for donation, which 650,000 smart, educated people will read per year. . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Despite the rather disappointing statistics, 49% of all respondents answered that they believe in donate as a means of financing writing.  What is surprising and I was able to convince.  Yes, not here and not now, but I agree - this is possible.  But first things first. <br><br>  In the very structure of ‚Äúdonate‚Äù two rather different entities are hidden. <br><br>  The first - patronage, characterized by significant payments from those for whom the author has become something important in life.  There are quite a few such people, but for them it‚Äôs not just a payment for a book, for them it‚Äôs first of all a personal thanks to the author.  For example, out of 90 people, 20 transferred the amount to more than 500 rubles, and 5 - more than 1000. By the standards of the cost of e-books, this is more than the complete works. <br><br>  The second part is closest, in essence, to tips.  This is a deferred payment, the size of which depends on the quality of service.  And here a difficult moment arises - tips as a way to pay someone's labor require a social contract.  Namely: <br><br>  <b>1. Everyone understands what it costs</b> <br><br>  In the US, on many checks, it is immediately stated how many tips should be paid to make 15%, 18%, or 20%.  It's very simple - 15% is normal service, 18% is good, 20% is outstanding.  Pay more - splurge.  Paying less is indecent.  The amount of the minimum payment is generally understandable - as much as the product is in the store.  If you like it - you pay a little more. <br><br>  <b>2. Payment is a natural, normal behavior.</b> <br><br>  At the same time, 15% is paid not when you like it, but when there are no things that are not clearly liked.  That is, if you have not poured the soup on your knees and a fly has not swum into the coffee - pay. <br><br>  I started to read - I read it to the end, it seems it was not disgusting - pay.  This thank-you payment is made not when you are admired, but when it was not a ‚Äúdismal fertilizer‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>3. Society has coercive tools for "renegades"</b> <br><br>  Every time you have to pay, the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">prisoner's</a> standard <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D1%2587%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">dilemma</a> works.  To pay for what you can get for free is irrational.  After all, there are a lot of places where to spend this money.  And as a result, the whole society suffers - the writers do not write, and readers are deprived of the legitimate opportunity to make their own decisions about whether or not the work turned out to be worthy. <br><br>  While the egoists are few, the losses from them are not noticeable.  But if there are too many of them, a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">broken window theory</a> works.  It is very difficult to be good if everything is bad around.  It is trite not profitable.  To prevent this from happening, society usually uses sanctions against egoists.  From public contempt, to prohibitions and compulsions.  I downloaded 20 movies, did not pay for one - get a ban on ip.  Something like this.  In the case of a tip, the user knows that if you don‚Äôt pay, you don‚Äôt pay the second, and then you find a comb in a borscht or a girl looks at you like a miser. <br><br>  If these three things appear in our society, donate will become not just a topic of conversation, but a real way to finance the creation of high-quality creative works. <br><br>  In addition, there are a number of technical parameters that can help the development of donate: <br><br>  1. Informational propaganda.  First of all inside the works of art themselves.  In the middle of the novel is a tie-in - ‚Äúabout the benefits of donate‚Äù with the indication of details. <br>  2. Convenience of payments.  But we must admit that modern systems (PayPal, Webmoney, Skrill, Yandex.Money, Qiwi) close 95% of all possible payments, as they allow paying not only with virtual money, but also with ordinary cards, providing a high level of security and convenience of payments.  Objectively speaking, payment by the donate button is no more difficult (and in general, even easier) than buying from an electronic store.  So this item is rapidly losing its relevance. <br><br>  Well, the last thought - the money received by a person - is an assessment of its utility by society.  I understand that we do not have a perfect world, and there are a lot of distortions (theft, corruption, lack of information and other delights of an imperfect market).  But in general, if an eminent writer earns as a janitor, then his work is just as valuable to society. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/169737/">https://habr.com/ru/post/169737/</a></p>
