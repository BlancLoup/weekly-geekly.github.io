      We at MadRobots, of course, follow this trend with interest.  Here you can find the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/raznoe/ostrich-pillow-podushka-straus/">acclaimed Ostrich Pillow pillow</a> .  And today we decided to collect in one post the most interesting new high-tech clothing, some of which in the future may even save your life.  If you came across other curious "smart things", share the findings in the comments. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  A shirt that knows all about your health </h2><br>  Intel is developing wearable technology based on its new mini-computer Edison in partnership with <a href="http://www.aiqsmartclothing.com/">AiQ Smart Clothing</a> .  This Taiwanese company has been experimenting with interweaving stainless steel into yarn since 2009. <br><br>  Over the five years of operation, AiQ has released several products from high-tech textiles.  <b>The BioMan shirt</b> (something similar just showed Brian Krzhanich), perhaps the most interesting achievement of the company.  It connects to the phone via Bluetooth, continuously monitors your breathing, heartbeat and body temperature.  It is important that in this shirt you can sweat, knead it, and then throw it into the washing machine.  She will continue to work. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-agrPZvz2bQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhidgn94Kh1qBdNi8oO5M0Oi44TNlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If you rarely engage in sports, you can limit yourself to <b>winter gloves from AIQ</b> for working with touch screens (although it is difficult to surprise with this).  There is heated clothing.  Jackets with LEDs.  And - for the most cautious - clothing that protects against electromagnetic and radioactive radiation. <br><br>  Many will say that the appearance of clothing AIQ leaves much to be desired.  Yes, while "smart clothes" is far from high fashion.  But it eliminates the need to hang around the wrists and other parts of the body with additional gadgets. <br><br>  In this case, you can look at the offers of other manufacturers.  For example, the company <a href="http://www.hexoskin.com/en">Hexoskin</a> with offices in Canada and the United States supplies similar clothing with built-in sensors to professional athletes and even astronauts.  You can buy it in the usual online store. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjcfHGaZ18Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgddo1weYI2tl5Djr5UDzbnUicmGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the summer of 2014, another manufacturer will start selling biometrics - <a href="http://www.omsignal.com/">Omsignal</a> . <br><br><h2>  Usb jacket </h2><br>  Experiments on clothing and put the company named.  Well-known manufacturer of tourist clothing Columbia uses <b>Omni-Heat Electric</b> technology in their jackets, gloves and boots. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DVMCcZ8X3qE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLIsuunjFLBLFvv4yid3YiZtti2A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The jacket has two batteries, which take place near the chest.  "Heaters" are made in the form of thin flexible wire, so that the appearance does not spoil and does not interfere with wearing.  Charging jacket with USB cable.  Moreover, and this is a nice bonus for travelers, the jacket can share the charge with other devices via the same USB.  Columbia claims that the charge lasts for six hours.  Prices for these jackets in Russia vary from 6 to 30 thousand rubles. <br><br>  However, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/04/columbia-omni-heat-circuit-breaker-softshell-electric-heated-j/">judging by the reviews</a> , the clothes are a bit heavy, they are not recharging as fast as we would like, and even with the cold, even with the heating, a slight shiver from the cold can not be avoided will help and at a minus 32 x).  Another of the drawbacks - not the most successful location of the sensor on and control the power of heating.  Columbia positioned it on the chest, and when a scarf is tied or in sports equipment, it is not so easy to find a small sensor. <br><br><h2>  Bedding for reading biometrics </h2><br>  A large Japanese telecom operator NTT Docomo, together with Toray, are also preparing to release a line of "smart clothes" under the brand Hitoe.  The company plans to release not only clothes, but also <b>bed linen, reading biometrics during sleep</b> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/C12Dq4zM-Ww%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuHknd6iGIkisfH8hcgVTKZV-HDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Suit for monitoring 22 muscle groups </h2><br>  If it is important for you to observe the individual muscles of your body, then pay attention to the clothes <a href="https://www.liveathos.com/">Athos</a> .  The company was founded by two graduates of the Canadian University of Waterloo.

For delivery, of course, have to pay.  For a smaller budget, about $ 100, in the second half of 2014 you will be able to buy <a href="http://footlogger.com/">FootLoggers</a> <b>insoles</b> . <br><br>  Insert them into your familiar shoes, go about your business (batteries last for 24 hours), then take out and put on ShoeStation.  This docking device charges the insoles and collects the accumulated data via Bluetooth.

They track your equipment and notice injuries.  The algorithm is being finalized, and soon the socks will even be able to warn you that you can fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b56/2b6/0fc/b562b60fc676667c64f11f5741d94ccc.png"><br><br>  Doctors use these socks to identify the complications of diabetes in patients.  The sensor continuously transmits data to a mobile device, and doctors can promptly notice and prevent diabetic foot ulcers.  Similar tests are already being conducted. <br><br><h2>  Bra, diagnosing breast disease </h2><br>  Heapsylon does not stop at this and is preparing to begin testing a <a href="http://medcitynews.com/2014/03/bra-to-detect-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-vs-smart-sock-to-detect-diabetes-complications-earlier/">bra</a> in the second half of 2014 <a href="http://medcitynews.com/2014/03/bra-to-detect-early-signs-of-breast-cancer-vs-smart-sock-to-detect-diabetes-complications-earlier/">, which warns women about the possibility of breast cancer</a> using thermodynamic sensors and analyzing the circadian rhythm.  Recent studies have linked these parameters with changes in the metabolism of breast cells. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98e/123/dce/98e123dcebc266a39b8bab8718b071e7.png"><br><br><h2>  Pajamas saving in a dream </h2><br>  For those who suffer from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%258D_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5">sleep apnea,</a> Heapsylon plans to release <b>pajamas.</b>  <b>She will notice a breathing disorder in time</b> and give an alarm.  Experts see the next step in the development of technology in the analysis of the chemical composition of your body.  Clothing <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229634.300-clothes-with-hidden-sensors-act-as-an-alwayson-doctor.html">will take blood tests, sweat, tears and even urine</a> . <br><br><h2>  Wi-Fi fabric transmitter </h2><br>  Every year, experts around the world create new fabrics with amazing technical properties.  For example, <b>researchers at Leuven Catholic University and the University of Malaysia Perlis</b> said in early 2014 that they made a dual-frequency (2.45 and 5.4 GHz) Wi-Fi transmitter completely made of cloth using metamaterials.  The shielding layer minimizes interference with the human body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec7/a32/228/ec7a32228a612d36c788bb4445651a26.png"><br><br><h2>  Suit gadget for listening to music and distributing the Internet </h2><br>  <b>Dutch designer Borr Ackersdijk</b> has long been experimenting with the creation of fabric on a 3D printer.  And at the March festival, SXSW drew attention to himself with his BB.Suit suit made from a mixture of cotton and synthetic fibers, as well as copper thread.  The result was a wearable gadget with GPS, Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth built right into the fabric. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/CziqwrmBKMw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgSJLc473Dgb_T7Qq3MgZ1Z4Tve3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  While there are only two instances of BB.Suit, which will probably remain the prototype.  However, Akkersdijk plans to develop technology and engage in mass production of "smart clothes". <br><br><h2>  T-shirt that does not get dirty </h2><br>  A young entrepreneur Amir Patel invented <b>T-shirts, from which sweat, water, sauces and other liquids roll off, leaving no trace</b> .  Hydrophobic technologies help to achieve this effect.  Liquid molecules bounce off tissue due to microscopic silica particles that create an air barrier at the surface of the garment.  To start production under the brand name Silic Patel <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/741186545/a-shirt-that-cleans-itself">turned</a> to the participants of Kickstarter and did not regret.  I wanted to collect $ 20 thousand, in the end I received about $ 300 thousand. Good news for bachelors: such T-shirts can be worn without washing much longer than usual, because bacteria need moisture to multiply bacteria, but Patel products do not accumulate it.  Wash this fabric after all possible.  "Protective" properties remain even after 80 washes. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rOwBPVUXU4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjH8iuUjeQj6omBAUflM0DFKL9syg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Jacket that warms when necessary </h2><br>  Experimenting with fabric at the University of Texas at Dallas.  Scientists <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140220-artificial-muscle-fishing-line-thread-materials-science/">twisted polyethylene fishing line and nylon thread into a fiber</a> capable of supporting a weight of 1 ton and delivering a torque comparable in power to a jet engine.  Moreover, the fiber is compressed and decompressed depending on the temperature.  Researchers plan to build in new fiber in clothes, so that in <b>cold weather your jacket will keep warm, and in the heat, on the contrary, it will cool</b> . <br><br>  While the main "smart clothes" are often ridiculous in appearance, not too comfortable and, of course, too expensive.  But perhaps in a few years we will look back and wonder how you could wear such silly clothes that we wear now. <br><br>  By the way, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/madrobots/blog/214965/">smart washing machine is</a> already at your service. <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/227485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/227485/</a></p>
