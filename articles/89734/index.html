  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fur audio headphones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It seemed that spring had come behind the window and my wife and I decided to change our wardrobe for a more appropriate one.  Rummaging through the mezzanines, I stumbled upon my last year‚Äôs present ‚Äî an audio-fur headset. <br><br>  Last year, if you remember, it was a very warm winter and we almost all the time went in autumn clothes.  Moreover, I dragged a rather warm cap, but my wife went bare-headed. <br><br>  Concerned about the safety of my favorite ears, I was going to buy ordinary fur headphones, but discussing a gift with <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kujallah/" class="user_link">Kujallah</a> , I had the idea to embed the speakers in them.

      And indeed, the shape of the fur "ears" is very similar to the usual.  And why should the place be idle? <br><br><img src="http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/6316/head.jpg"><br><br>  Under the cut there is a small story about how I turned ordinary Koss into a warm headdress. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, the idea itself seemed so obvious to me that at first I was going to find such ears in the store.  Honestly rummaged through the ruins, and found only Ritmix RH-509. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/76f/67c/28d76f67cdbf31b1d19cbc995b007b2b.jpg"><br><br>  They looked terribly scary, and they were afraid of pink fur and plastic in the picture. <br><br>  In general, having scratched my head, I decided to make a gift myself.  Here you need to immediately make a reservation - the world is full of good audiophile headphones that completely cover the ears.  But I wanted it to be first of all a headdress, and the music became a pleasant addition. <br><br>  In general, it is said - done, especially since there were no particular problems foreseen.  It was necessary only to take suitable headphones and sheathe them with fur. <br><br>  The most obvious was to get a bluetooth headset. <br>  <strong>Pros:</strong> <br>  - can be used as a telephone headset <br>  - You can switch tracks directly from the headphones. <br>  - There are no wires again. <br>  <strong>Minuses:</strong> <br>  - in the cold batteries quickly sit down <br>  - it is necessary to provide a hole in the fur for charging <br>  - The sound quality of wireless headphones is inferior to traditional <br>  - for the same money in fur, you can roll up headphones of a higher class <br><br>  Having weighed everything, I decided to make fur ‚Äúears‚Äù from traditional headphones.  Naturally, the question immediately arose of cutting the wires.  I speak naturally, because, I repeat, I wanted to have a hat. <br><br>  In the end, the store bought KOSS Stratus' ears (I didn‚Äôt take anything expensive, I just wanted to work out the technology) and 3.5 mom-dad minijack. <br><br>  The headphone cable was cut off and mini-soldered soldered.  The result is autonomous headphones and a removable cord.  The socket on the headphones is stuck on a double-sided tape and placed <u>above</u> one of the speakers so that the wire is as inconspicuous as possible.  Let me clarify this idea: in principle, the wire with the socket could be put behind the ‚Äúear‚Äù, but then the ‚Äúears‚Äù would be visually different from each other.  And so, if you connect the angled plug, the wire is hidden in the hair and invisible (especially if the girl has long hair). <br><br><img src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/1687/koss1.jpg"><br><br>  After soldering, the headphones were transferred to the studio, where they sheathed them for 280 rubles (the price included the material). <br><br><img src="http://img709.imageshack.us/img709/6637/koss2.jpg"><br><br>  So, I present the faithful's bundle.  Ears are unpacked, put on the head.  While my wife is spinning in front of the mirror, I quietly plug in the sound ... Oh, how much enthusiasm! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cca/cdc/578/ccacdc578ad76c425c94385207a448df.jpg"><br>  <i>(in the pictures, not an angled plug is specially inserted, so that you can better see where the socket is)</i> <br><br>  Of course, hand on heart, the sound of "ears" turned out to be average.  But I gained experience and now I can rivet something a class higher :) The most important thing I was afraid of was that the fur would drown out the sound.  In practice, it turned out that it even softens the average sound quality, besides, it improves sound insulation from street noise. <br><br>  <i>Ps I would like to express my gratitude to the user <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/kujallah/" class="user_link">Kujallah</a> , who submitted this idea and helped in the implementation.</i>  <i>If you suddenly decide that you want to add to this post, do not forget about it, because this and his merit, too.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89734/</a></p>
