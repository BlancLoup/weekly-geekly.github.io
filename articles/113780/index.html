Naturally, almost everyone wants to earn on them one way or another. <br><br>  In this case, people are not afraid of routine work or time-consuming.  Most of them want the minimum investment and expect to somehow make money on site content. <br><br>  They know enough about what methods of advertising to use, but the main question that torments them is how to make a website?

      I decided to briefly show how to quickly select a suitable topic and evaluate the competition for such a site, without touching the design, without understanding the intricacies of search engine optimization, usability, text size and presentation, selection of engines and other things. <br><br>  All this is undoubtedly important, but only after the first step - the choice of the subject of the project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/502d311b/f41abf0c/0a7a081a/b0bfc343.jpg"><h4>  Or maybe not to strain? </h4><br>  You can of course, especially not bathe, and make a project with a large number of pages and information collected on the basis of volume considerations.  For example, any regular reference list.  Can. <br><br>  But only if you have a task to earn only, and not to make a project for which the soul lies, there will be a lot of problems. <br><br>  Information needs to be kept up to date.  Imagine a directory with tens of thousands of addresses and phone numbers.  You can ignore this, but in this case your resource will lose the trust of visitors after some time, and for the independent development of the site you need a growing core of regular users. <br><br>  Among other things, such projects usually have a very vague audience, i.e.  Low quality.  Therefore, advertising on them works very poorly, and therefore the profit will be less. <br><br>  Let me remind you once again that we are talking about a project that we want to monetize using content. <br><br><h4>  Conditions </h4>  <b>So, in order for our project to make a profit, its theme should:</b> <br>  1. Be close to you.  Ideally, the one you understand.  Or you want to understand. <br>  2. Be narrow enough to work well advertising. <br>  3. It must be expensive, so that every action of your visitors cost as much as possible (click on contextual advertising, view banner). <br>  4. Have a small number of competitors. <br>  5. Be popular. <br><br>  <b>And two more important conditions for the site itself.</b>  <b>He must:</b> <br>  1. Have a good attendance with a relatively small volume. <br>  2. To be useful for people to get regular visitors and develop independently in the future. <br><br>  It is important for us to find a compromise between these conditions. <br><br>  <b>Be useful</b> <br>  You make a personal project, so you should submit information as your own experience.  Based on this, most of the materials on the site should be written by you, and therefore the topic should either be close to your professional activity or hobby. <br><br>  Another option: choose a theme that has not yet been mastered on the Internet (for example, a new car model club). <br><br>  As a result, you will have a list of several topics under the heading "I understand." <br><br>  <b>Narrow niche</b> <br>  Becoming popular in a small area is much easier than in the global one.  For example, if you like to cook or prefer a particular kitchen, it is better to choose one product or group.  Let's say bread or beer. <br><br>  So you have another list of topics.  Headline "Niche". <br><br>  <b>Cost and competition</b> <br>  One of the ways to make money on a content site is contextual advertising, so you should find out the cost of a click in your topic by keywords.  Most likely, Google Adsense will stand on your site, so you should check the price for the transition in it. <br><br>  Select keywords based on the two lists ‚ÄúI understand‚Äù and ‚ÄúNish‚Äù, which you have obtained above. <br><br>  By the way, to make a list, you can go back and choose the most expensive words, from which you can make a list of topics that you could do. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in open access I found data for Adsense only for 2009: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Key phrase </th><th>  Cost per click </th></tr><tr><td>  data recovery </td><td>  $ 15.38 </td></tr><tr><td>  data recovery after formatting </td><td>  $ 12.30 </td></tr><tr><td>  blacksmith equipment </td><td>  $ 11.35 </td></tr><tr><td>  hard drive recovery </td><td>  $ 9.88 </td></tr><tr><td>  format recovery </td><td>  $ 9.68 </td></tr><tr><td>  flower delivery Vladivostok </td><td>  $ 8.94 </td></tr><tr><td>  forex exchange </td><td>  $ 8.43 </td></tr><tr><td>  a growth hormone </td><td>  $ 8.13 </td></tr><tr><td>  international flower delivery </td><td>  $ 7.60 </td></tr><tr><td>  sexology </td><td>  $ 7.23 </td></tr><tr><td>  gonorrhea </td><td>  $ 6.89 </td></tr><tr><td>  recover deleted files </td><td>  $ 6.84 </td></tr><tr><td>  forex brokers </td><td>  $ 6.82 </td></tr><tr><td>  forex trading </td><td>  $ 6.77 </td></tr><tr><td>  psychological counseling </td><td>  $ 6.75 </td></tr><tr><td>  hard drive recovery </td><td>  $ 6.75 </td></tr><tr><td>  shirts </td><td>  $ 6.73 </td></tr><tr><td>  treatment of thrombophlebitis </td><td>  $ 6.71 </td></tr><tr><td>  boiler </td><td>  $ 6.60 </td></tr><tr><td>  scoliosis treatment </td><td>  $ 6.50 </td></tr><tr><td>  psychology of influence </td><td>  $ 6.45 </td></tr><tr><td>  hard disk recovery </td><td>  $ 6.41 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  To provide more relevant information, I turned to the managers of the service <a href="http://webeffector.ru/">webeffector.ru</a> and after brief negotiations they kindly agreed to provide their statistics of the most expensive key phrases in search engine optimization at the beginning of February 2011. <br><br>  The table shows the budgets for the promotion on request for Moscow and the region for the first position: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Key phrase </th><th>  Promotional budget, rub. </th></tr><tr><td>  news </td><td>  234600.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  window </td><td>  89350.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  baby clothes </td><td>  53700.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  plastic windows </td><td>  52900.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  wardrobes </td><td>  52750.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  download movies </td><td>  49500.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  office furniture </td><td>  43350.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  cabinets </td><td>  39850.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  recipes </td><td>  38450.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  steel doors </td><td>  37450.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  Laptop Repair </td><td>  36050.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  balcony glazing </td><td>  35700.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  ceramic tile </td><td>  35600.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  website development </td><td>  35600.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  office rent </td><td>  33700.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  buy a diploma </td><td>  32800.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  website promotion </td><td>  32700.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  Refilling cartridges </td><td>  31250.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  renovation of apartments </td><td>  29800.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  air conditioners </td><td>  29650.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  brick </td><td>  29500.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  games </td><td>  28550.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  music </td><td>  28500.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  flower delivery </td><td>  27550.00 </td></tr><tr><td>  toilet cabins </td><td>  25300.00 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  These are the most expensive 25 queries on WebEffector statistics.  It is clear that there are few topics in it that would be worth doing, so I advise you to look at the full list of requests with prices and predicted traffic: <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/5629403001/top_keys_webeffector.xls.html">http://narod.ru/disk/5629403001/top_keys_webeffector.xls.html</a> <br><br>  Alternatively, you can use the <a href="http://www.begun.ru/begun/research/">Runner‚Äôs research</a> in this area or <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Direct</a> statistics. <br><br>  Based on data from these systems, statistics on search queries, you will receive data on the popularity in the subject. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18323add/0df22f2c/9ee9a34c/e78f9ced.jpg">  Competition "by eye" is easy to assess.  Enter the main key phrases from the list in Google or Yandex and see the number of pages that participate in the search.  Add these numbers to your tables with the names of topics. <br><br>  By the way, there are additional options for assessing the demand for information on your topic and competition.  For example, I strongly advise <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/rating/ru/">LiveInternet rating</a> . <br><br>  Enter the key phrase and see the attendance of projects for the current day: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/25a27710/e911e00f/9d4a006e/312021d8.jpg"><br><br>  In the lines where in the right column is a white square, site statistics are open.  You can, for example, view the sources of visitors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a9bc1669/a4649fc3/f83c97b0/bbfea5af.png"><br><br>  In order to understand whether we will pull the project, which is noted in the rating, it is worth seeing how big and ‚Äúfat‚Äù the site is in front of us. <br><br>  <b>For this we estimate:</b> <br><ul><li>  number of pages indexed for Google request allinurl: site.ru// site: site.ru) </li><li>  the approximate number of external links that Yahoo will show us (linkdomain request: site.ru -site: site.ru) </li><li>  whois domain age. </li></ul><br>  If we see that we can achieve the same indicators for the year, then this is what we need.  As experience shows, just a year passes before such projects start generating revenue. <br><br>  As a result, comparing the resulting lists, you can choose 2-3 areas that suit you best. <br><br>  Why not give examples?  Because it may take more than one day to search for such a list of topics.  Although‚Ä¶ <br><br>  I love fresh bread, and you?  I am even ready to try to bake it myself.  All you need is a homemade bread maker, recipes and a little time.  On average, a good machine costs about 4,000 rubles.  I think this is a small amount to start a startup. <br><br>  It is quite possible to devote 2-3 days a week to making bread using a new recipe and fix the whole process on a camera or a camera.  In a few months you will have a couple of hundred exclusive materials. <br><br>  By the way, one of the top sites in this category has about 4,000 visitors per day with an age of about 2 years and a volume of several hundred pages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113780/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113780/</a></p>
