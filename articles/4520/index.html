  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Orthodox activists want "Runet Award"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the course of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù vote of the <a href="http://www.premiaruneta.ru/">‚ÄúRunet Prize‚Äù</a> in the top ten leaders at the moment - 5 sites of Orthodox subjects.  The leaders were made by their own visitors, or rather, by their small part, participating in the <a href="http://www.mrezha.ru/action/">action ‚ÄúSupport Your</a> Own <a href="http://www.mrezha.ru/action/">‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  The Runet Prize, which has been going on for years, is widely known among the networked public.  The Regional Public Center for Internet Technologies ( <a href="http://www.rocit.ru/">ROCIT</a> ) assumed the main concerns for the organization, the organizing committee is headed by Mikhail Seslavinsky, the head of the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications, for the most part included representatives of government and public organizations close to them. <br><br>  In addition to the expert council, which will select the winners in the main award nominations, there is also a ‚Äúpopular‚Äù vote, which is intended to reveal the favorites through the votes of ordinary Internet users.  It is the democratic nature of this part of the award that causes an increased interest in it from the network public.

      However, the same democracy has led to the fact that in an attempt to achieve better results, some nominees organize entire campaigns, using an imperfect mechanism for counting votes.  Each visitor of a <a href="http://www.premiaruneta.ru/narod/premium/">special page</a> can choose a favorite not just once, but as many times as desired (but only once in 12 hours).  The creators of the Orthodox sites took advantage of this: on a <a href="http://www.mrezha.ru/action/">special page they</a> published a call for visitors to support ‚Äútheir own‚Äù;  even banners have been prepared for the action, administrators of Orthodox forums are agitating visitors to take part in the action.  As a result, at the moment in the top ten of the ‚ÄúRunet Award‚Äù there are all 5 ‚Äúpromoted‚Äù sites. <br><br>  For such results, you do not need to have high-quality content and design, just a community that has developed around the site.  Taking into account that the number of votes from one IP is not limited, 100-200 people who have constant access to the Internet will be able to ‚Äúgive‚Äù their favorite resource popularity, more precisely, its visibility in the eyes of others.  It is worth noting that in addition to Orthodox resources, the remaining places in the top ten were taken by websites of online games, which also have good opportunities to mobilize the community resource that has developed around it.  The winner of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù vote of 2005 - the site <a href="http://mozilla-russia.org/">mozilla-russia.org</a> - is still in third place. <br><br>  Much lower results show sites, the real popularity and attendance of which is higher than the "leaders".  Among them are club portals, online media, the <a href="http://pedsovet.org/">All-Russian Internet Pedagogical Council</a> and many others.  The peculiarity of many reputable and high-quality resources is that their visitors almost do not have free time for daily voting: they come to the Internet for the sake of obtaining information necessary for work and business. <br><br>  The results of the Runet Prize will be announced on November 29 at a special ceremony, which will be broadcasted by the TVC channel. <br><br>  In addition to the ‚ÄúRunet Prize‚Äù, the contest <a href="http://2006.goldensite.ru/nominations.aspx">‚ÄúGolden Site 2006‚Äù is</a> held on the Internet, and Alex Exler became the head of the expert council.  In the regions there are also similar contests, for example, <a href="http://tatnet.tatar.info/">‚ÄúStars of Tatnet‚Äù</a> in Tatarstan. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4520/</a></p>
