Therefore, today I will share with you the experience of deploying the classic "backup software" <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/351/0b3/fb8/3510b3fb86ab4eb39810b4087d115fcb.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Why all this?</b> </h4><br>  NetWorker makes life easier in the first place for those who "have already started to make backups."  NetWorker makes the backup process centralized and automated.  But in order for all this to work, and you don’t have to touch anything, you have to tinker with all the subtleties of setting up systems and creating backup tasks (Task for creating a backup).  Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to acquire NetWorker for use in large and complex infrastructures. <br><habracut><br><h5>  <b>A bit of history</b> </h5><br>  NetWorker was developed in 1988 by Legato, and the first version was released on the Enterprise Solutions market in 1990. The software was then called Legato NetWorker, but in 2003 EMC bought Legato, and now it is EMC NetWorker (despite the fact that legato still present in the code) <br><br><h4>  <b>How it all works</b> </h4><br>  NetWorker works according to the server-client scheme.  That is, a NetWorker server is installed on a dedicated host that is involved in backups, and a NetWorker client is installed on the hosts whose data we want to save. <br>  NetWorker stores backups on the media you provide to it, be it a storage system, VTL, any tape library, or a dedicated ball (CIFS, NFS).  NetWorker, in principle, is configured to work with all the devices that are on your SAN storage network and LAN network.  In addition, NetWorker can work at the application level, be it VMware, MS SQL, Oracle, Exchange, etc., you just need to install the appropriate module. <br><br><h5>  <b>Licensing</b> </h5><br>  When acquiring NetWorker, you need to be well aware that we will use it, since NetWorker is very strictly licensed. <br>  A list of what is most often licensed: <br>  · Number of clients (physical, virtual, working via NDMP protocol), <br>  · The number of storage nodes - Storage Node, <br>  · The amount of data stored on disk devices <br>  · Number of tape libraries - autochangers, <br>  · Various modules (Mod for Microsoft Applications Windows, for Databases and Appliacations, for SAP, etc.)

      Alternatively, you can simply license the total amount of data to be protected. <br><br><h4>  <b>Installation process</b> </h4><br>  First, let's look at what you need to work with NetWorker: <br>  1. Server or virtual machine (VM) with a pre-installed OS, that is, NetWorker is an application and is installed as a program in the OS.  In our case, this will be a VM on an IBM Flex System with Win2008R2 on board.  On it we will put NetWorker Server.  (a configured DNS is required or you will have to write a lot of things in hosts) <br>  2. If we want to make a system with a distributed load, then we need at least one more server.  We will not use it.  But if used, then on it then NetWorker Storage node would be put. <br>  3. A place to store backups.  We will use the available DD160 using the DD Boost protocol. <br>  4. Clients themselves: hosts with applications, databases, virtual machines, computers or laptops users. <br><br>  NetWorker runs on all Linux, Unix, and Windows-like operating systems as a service, and the easiest way is to install on Windows. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7f/ef8/e16/c7fef8e16ba343578e780feecffc360f.png"><br><br>  If you do not go into the jungle of the installer, then the deployment process of Server NetWorker takes place in 22 mouse clicks on the word "next" or OK and, in general, you must agree with all the default policies. <br>  But in fact, you need to grasp it, as there will be a stage where you need to create a NetWorker administrator account. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">22 clicks:</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><br>  The installer is a link to the .exe file, which is acquired by the integrator during the installation.  An archive with all the necessary files to deploy NetWorker takes a little more than 200 MB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/c28/ff7/129c28ff7d4e4679b5f03e14c84de756.png"><br><br>  English, OK (1) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d56/f75/3db/d56f753db4434d3ead42a98b3d21e429.png"><br><br>  Next (2) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/323/e63/b22/323e63b22d60423bba7e282614825212.png"><br><br>  Enter the server credentials.
