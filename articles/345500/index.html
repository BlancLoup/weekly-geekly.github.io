It is based on the use of software capable of independently, without the participation of the designer, generating three-dimensional models that meet the specified conditions.  In fact, in the ‚Äúman-machine‚Äù system, creative functions are transferred to the computer, and it copes with them perfectly.

      UPD: If you are interested in technology, then on January 25 at 14:00 Moscow time, Siemens PLM Software will hold a webinar with a demonstration of generative design technology.  We invite you to register: <a href="http://cad-expert.ru/meropriyatiya/vebinary/generativnyy-dizayn/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dnew_tech_web">cad-expert.ru/meropriyatiya/vebinary/generativnyy-dizayn/?utm_source=habr&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=new_tech_web</a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This technology is already beginning to be used as the main tool for computer-aided design.  The reason for this is the growth of computational capabilities and the extremely rapid development of 3D printing, a technology fully capable of producing parts and objects developed with the help of a new tool. <br><br>  Today, the cost of 3D printing and the price of 3D printers have already dropped to a level that allows us to talk about industrial production based on them.  With regard to the capabilities of the tandem "generative design - additive technologies", they are such that a number of analysts call their use only as another industrial revolution. <br><br>  Looking at at least a few objects modeled with the help of generative design and embodied by additive technologies (Fig. 1-3), it is not difficult to believe in this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/wy/dp/ubwydp_8im0ejkal71dvejqhu_y.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1.

Design element of the sewing machine Bernina (red color).</i>  <i>Form optimized</i> <br><br>  Authors of review publications talk about four directions of generative design: <br><ul><li>  form synthesis; </li><li>  optimization of surfaces and structures of three-dimensional lattices; </li><li>  optimization of topology (in accordance with the specified parameters, all unnecessary is removed); </li><li>  trabecular structures (the generative design accurately scales and distributes tiny pores in all solid materials, creates surface roughness). </li></ul><br>  Today‚Äôs even if small experience proves that the development of these areas brings with it revolutionary changes in architecture, engineering, furniture, sports shoes and much more.  For practical application in the design of the leading manufacturers of software for CAD developed software packages in the form of individual applications. <br><br>  Specialized software for generative design has a high capacity and can be used in various industries.  It has many advantages, but no less promising are applications embedded in the CAD functionality.  Such solutions will allow designers to get results quickly and at a qualitatively new level, but at the same time remaining in their modeling system.  Siemens PLM Software offered its own version of this functionality. <br><br><h3>  Generative Modeling in Solid Edge ST10 </h3>  For engineering, topology optimization is of particular interest - it brings an instant effect in the form of saving materials and energy resources, as well as increasing productivity.  It is this kind of generative design that is implemented in Solid Edge ST10. <br><br>  Topological optimization is the search for the optimal shape of the part under the specified conditions of fixing and loading.  We emphasize that the optimal form in this case is considered to be the one providing the least weight. <br><br>  In Solid Edge ST10, when you start a generative design, the designer indicates the area within which the part will be formed.  To do this, set its approximate form.  It fixes the location of fasteners;  indicates areas that should not change, and the load.  Next, using the dialog box that opens, the designer sets the percentage of weight loss, the safety factor for strength. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ed/zd/9u/edzd9ujlzcnhron0dvgnh2zfs70.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>4. Topological optimization in Solid Edge ST10.</i>  <i>With the help of generative modeling, a part with a minimum mass is created that meets the initial strength requirements and mounting scheme</i> <br><br>  In the same window, another important parameter of the generative modeling is set - the time of the program.  The accuracy of the resulting model depends on it, since it is he who limits the number of iterations. <br><br>  The solution obtained as a result of topological optimization has a facet appearance.  You can immediately send it to 3D printing, but the functionality of Solid Edge ST10 is not limited to this.  In the tenth version, Convergent Modeling technology is used for the first time: BREP and a facet representation are combined in one model, which makes it possible to edit a generative design product. <br><br>  Upon completion of the optimization process, work on the part can be continued.  No actions related to the ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù translation of the grid into an accurate representation are required.  The constructor can add and remove some elements; Boolean operations can be performed;  if work is underway on the assembly, then the subtraction of the body of one part from the other is possible, etc.  The grid view is constantly updated. <br><br>  Thus, Solid Edge ST10 not only provides the application of a qualitatively new technology of generative modeling, but also offers a convenient opportunity to modify the result. <br><br>  Computer optimization of the topology gives amazing and completely unusual geometry options.  It allows you to reduce the weight of products without compromising the strength characteristics, optimize material consumption, respectively, reducing the cost of the product.  However, with all this, the question immediately arises about the manufacturability of the product. <br><br>  Indeed, even a cursory glance at the optimized model (Fig. 4) is enough to make sure that traditional methods of metal cutting and pressure are not applicable here.  The only thing you can count on is casting, the technology is very energy-intensive and problematic from the point of view of ecology.  Is there any point in this optimization and in what is the revolutionary solid edge of the ST10? <br><br>  The answer to this question is unambiguous and positive.  Topological optimization is an undoubted step forward, and Solid Edge ST10 is a breakthrough computer-aided design system.  To discard the last doubts, it is enough to go through a simple logical chain: <br><ol><li>  within the next decade, 3D printing will increase its capabilities and become massively available; </li><li>  generative design gives the best solutions, but they require exactly 3D printing; </li><li>  The use of generative design and 3D printing will qualitatively change the products of engineering, construction and other industries, but CAD systems are needed to ensure their integration into the normal design process. </li></ol><br>  Siemens PLM Software has created such a CAD system for mechanical engineering - Solid Edge ST10.  This is the first CAD system that gives the opportunity to take full advantage of the advantages of generative design and additive technologies. <br><br>  Already, it is possible to make a well-founded forecast that production without the best digital modeling and 3D printing technologies is doomed to lose in the competition.  In such circumstances, the use of topological optimization is not even an advantage, but rather a condition for the survival of companies. <br><br>  This can be supplemented by another argument in favor of topological optimization.  The fact is that it gives the best option for the given conditions, and this option is always interesting and useful for the developer - even in the absence of the possibility of its implementation.  Let the ideal can not be achieved, but you can get closer to it, creating models for traditional technologies.  To this end, the Solid Edge ST10 has one of the most efficient design arsenals in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345500/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345500/</a></p>
