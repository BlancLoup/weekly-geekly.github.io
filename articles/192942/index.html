I will celebrate and. <br><br>  On the occasion of a professional holiday, I would like to share with Habravchana a story about my small culinary project, which I managed to realize just the day before.  I think the name of the post has already become clear that this is a cocktail for the programmer.  It seems that up to this point no one has ever tried to combine IT and mixology, which is why I have some hope for the success of my undertaking.

      It all started with this: my wife is fond of cooking and has a small culinary blog.  Last year, on my birthday, she invited a real bartender from the bar startup project BARADOM.net to visit us in the kitchen.  From the moment of my acquaintance with Artyom (the bartender who turned my birthday into a home bar party), I had an idea: to find recipes (or invent myself) cocktails that would fit into the IT theme. <br><br>  The result of several days of active correspondence with Artyom was such a small cocktail card: <br><br><ul><li>  Ruby </li><li>  Python </li><li>  Severe Perl </li><li>  JMP (aka Assembler) </li><li>  Profit! </li><li>  Epic fail </li><li>  Memory leak </li></ul><br><br>  Under the cut recipes and photos of cocktails that we made in our kitchen.  And, yes, I‚Äôm publishing this post not for a reason, not on Friday, but a little earlier. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Warning! </h4><br><br>  Gentlemen, at the beginning of my story, I ask you to pay attention to this: in this post I will tell readers about what was happening in my kitchen and what happened in the end.  I do not set a goal and in no way imply advertising of alcohol or alcohol-containing products. <br><br>  Just in case, I warn you that <i>drinking alcohol can be harmful to your health</i> .  In this post I just share cocktail recipes and photos.  All information is presented for informational purposes only. <br><br><h4>  About a meeting </h4><br><br>  Artyom is quite a busy person.  I had to be pretty nervous before we agreed on the final date for his arrival.  Postponing the preparation of cocktails until the next day the programmer really did not want to.  Of course, we expected that everyone could prepare our cocktails and, in general, I could cope on my own, but firstly I don‚Äôt have as much experience as Artyom, but I would like everything to work out as good as possible.  And secondly, Artyom had to bring some of the ingredients with me, since my home bar is quite small. <br><br>  And so, ice, lemons, limes, oranges and juices were prepared in advance, Artyom came to visit and work began to boil in the kitchen. <br><br><h4>  Ruby </h4><br>  The first cocktail we made was Ruby, of course.  I myself have long been identifying myself as a Rubist camp, although lately JS (CoffeeScript) has had to deal more and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/b87/91d/d9ab8791dff93a03020fc96faf408c48.jpg" alt="Ruby" title="Ruby"><br><br>  It's pretty simple.  It took us the preparation (hereafter all in grams): <br><br>  - 20 coconut Malibu liqueur <br>  - 20 Lychee liqueur <br>  - 40 cognac or brandy <br>  - 150 cherry juice <br>  - lemon <br>  - ice <br><br>  What they did: they added the main ingredients to a tall glass filled with ice.  Added lemon juice (to taste).  Thoroughly mixed to "fogging" the glass.  Decorated with a slice of orange and cocktail cherries.  The drink turned out quite sweet, fragrant, refreshing.  The ruby-red color of the cocktail fits perfectly with the logo of the ruby ‚Äã‚Äãlanguage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c50/c74/b1b/c50c74b1bad7a7a785c5055eaeb6a0aa.jpg" alt="Ruby" title="Ruby"><br><br><h4>  Python </h4><br>  Python.  Here we took the color of green python as a basis.  And it seems it turned out quite well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a81/043/540/a81043540b546fe94fd3f8228c1be439.jpg" alt="Python" title="Python"><br><br>  For the preparation we needed: <br><br>  - 50 rum light <br>  - 30 mint liqueur <br>  - 30 pineapple juice <br>  - juice 1/2 lemon <br>  - sprite <br><br>  What we did: we beat the main ingredients in a shaker with ice.  All were poured into a glass and dolili 7up (or sprite), decorated glass with a slice of lime.  Cocktail should be quickly served to guests - beautiful foam quickly settles.  The drink turned out to be refreshing, with a pleasant pineapple flavor.  Loved my wife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b2/170/619/8b21706197f93ffde4f8f1d7cb9c444b.jpg" alt="Python" title="Python"><br><br><h4>  Severe Perl </h4><br>  In our view, Perl is a very harsh language.  Associative series: ‚Äúdry‚Äù, ‚Äúhardy‚Äù, ‚Äúcamel‚Äù, ‚Äúdesert‚Äù.  probably therefore the basis of the cocktail was dry and harsh gin. <br><br>  For the preparation we needed: <br><br>  - 30 gin <br>  - 20 vermouth rosso <br>  - 20 lemon juice <br>  - 10 sugar syrup <br><br>  What they did: slightly beat up the main ingredients with a shaker with ice.  Strain into a glass.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581">Decorated with Physalis</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/122/4c2/773/1224c27737964d566311aae4fae37829.jpg" alt=" Perl" title="Severe Perl"><br><br>  I only realized on the second day that the cocktail was a good match for the mascot of the Perl language.  Artyom probably planned it, but for me it was rather a surprise.  No, well, it seems the truth turned out in the subject. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/335/a14/7a8/335a147a8eff811aa6cf6470c84181bd.jpg" alt=" Perl" title="Severe Perl"><br><br><h4>  Jmp </h4><br>  I really wanted to do something related to the assembler.  I do not know why.  Just a whim.  And frankly, I did not have a single idea on this.  I began to look at the assembler commands and for some reason I stopped at the transition operator JMP.  And Artem almost instantly offered to make a shot: <br><br>  - 20 <b>J</b> agermeister (herbal liqueur) <br>  - 20 <b>M</b> idori (melon liqueur) + Lime <br>  - 20 <b>P</b> each (Peach syrup) <br><br>  What they did: with a bar spoon they put layers of syrup, melon liqueur with a small amount of lime juice and herbal liqueur in a high shot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e40/2f5/004/e402f5004acdd7ad9f7d834fed1dc6f1.jpg" alt="image" title="Jmp"><br><br><h4>  Profit! </h4><br>  Profit!  in our opinion should be sweet, intoxicating, airy.  This is how we saw this cocktail. <br><br>  For the preparation we needed: <br><br>  - 20 cream liqueur <br>  - 20 blackcurrant liqueur <br>  - 20 triple sec (strong, sweet orange liqueur) <br>  - whipped cream <br>  - cocoa powder <br><br>  What they did: the main ingredients were mixed in a shaker, decorated with whipped cream, sprinkled with cocoa powder (it is better to use a fine sieve), decorated with a cherry.  Cocktail turned out moderately sweet and very interesting to taste. <br><br>  <b>Profit!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/962/c3f/122/962c3f12264c8baf7c00d7f5c2322905.jpg" alt="Profit!" title="Profit!"><br><br><h4>  Epic fail </h4><br>  Epic Fail, he is Epic Fail.  Angry and merciless.  You will not notice how it comes, and if it does, then Epic Fail is inevitable. <br><br>  For the preparation we needed: <br><br>  - 50 vodka.  connecting people <br>  - 100 coke <br>  - 1/2 lemon <br>  - ice <br><br>  What they did: the main ingredients were added to the glass with ice.  Thoroughly mixed up to "fogging" the glass.  Decorated with lemon. <br><br>  As planned, ice, lemon and cola completely hide the taste of strong alcohol.  If you overdo it with the use, then a real Epic failure can happen.  Be extremely careful if you decide to try something like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56f/3dc/235/56f3dc2353b0f845a3e8c29512f68dd7.jpg" alt="Epic Fail" title="Epic fail"><br><br><h4>  Memory leak </h4><br>  A memory leak is guaranteed if you bust through this drink.  Everything can be so bad that you have to force the garbage collector to start ... and not a fact that will help.  In such cases, some prefer to press reset immediately. <br><br>  In order to reproduce the memory leak, we needed: <br><br>  - 50 tequila <br>  - 50 rum light <br>  - 50 triple sec (strong, sweet orange liqueur) <br>  - 50 kahlua coffee liqueur <br>  - lime <br>  - cola <br><br>  What they did: All the ingredients were poured into a glass filled with ice with slices of lime, mixed thoroughly.  Decorated with a slice of lime.  It turned out delicious and stunning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e8/159/0bf/6e81590bfa8295c4129415063b9ffde7.jpg" alt="Memory leak" title="Memory leak"><br><br><h5>  Well done! </h5><br>  Everything seems to be on it.  That idea, which for a long time did not leave me, was realized.  In my opinion everything turned out well.  Perhaps one of you is keen on cooking or mixology and one day will try to repeat our experience.  We wish you good luck! <br><br><h5>  Staff </h5><br>  My cocktail idea would not have found its realization if great people hadn‚Äôt helped me.  And for that they are very grateful. <br><br>  Worked in the kitchen: <br>  Mixing and shaking: <a href="http://vk.com/baradomanet">Artem aka "Salatych ‚òÖ Ahtyng</a> . <a href="http://vk.com/baradomanet">"</a> <br>  Photo, the mistress of the kitchen: <a href="http://open-cook.ru/">Anna Nechaeva</a> . <br>  Idea, text, tasting, <s>hangover</s> : <a href="https://github.com/the-teacher">Ilya "Zayko" Zykin</a> . <br><br><h4>  return EXIT_SUCCESS; </h4><br>  At the end of the post, I would like to once again congratulate my colleagues on the upcoming professional holiday. <br>  More interesting tasks and elegant solutions for you! <br>  Happy holiday!
