Although, basically it was about the way done from the idea to the final product.  Own experience was described and possible obstacles that might arise on the way to developing your own product were affected.  Now it‚Äôs worthwhile to dwell separately on the <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/10965.Abonentskoe-oborudovanie/17862.IPTV-pristavki/19916.UHD200">4K IPTV</a> set-top box <a href="http://shop.nag.ru/catalog/10965.Abonentskoe-oborudovanie/17862.IPTV-pristavki/19916.UHD200">Vermax UHD200</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Client equipment is now calculated in millions of models for every taste, color and functionality.  But today we will stop our eyes on our new product, the development of which took us several years of ups and downs. <br><br>  This is what the device looks like.

For example, the thickness of the coin in the photograph is 24.9 mm. <br><br>  Packed box here in this box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16a/bd8/d94/16abd8d94eee4de6af2db24db3f9a6b5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console is based on the Amlogic S905 platform with the Quad Core Cortex-A53 2.0GHz installed and the Mali-450 Penta Core GPU graphics core.  It has 1GB RAM and 8GB eMMC ROM.  Therefore, the price is 49 dollars. <br><br>  For comparison, the price of similar equipment from competitors is significantly higher. <br><br>  For example, Rostelecom uses a MAG-250 class prefix (in some regions SmartLabs SML482) based on an STi7105 processor with 256 MB of RAM and a semi-arc flash.  They cost 3,590 rubles - about $ 62 at the current rate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ea/3a2/8f4/3ea3a28f4c47430ab876e3b0a3324bd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Prefixes ‚ÄúDom.RU‚Äù cost 2000 rubles <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ba/d55/b23/6bad55b237d545d9b408b897b3370bcb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù also sells on its website a device called ‚ÄúTV set-top box with the function of recording and rewinding the air‚Äù for 7950 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e32/dde/5cf/e32dde5cf7b4485886396d7d9e466343.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Naturally, there are other competitors in the face of Apple TV, Google Chromecast, the once fashionable Dune HD or the now popular Xiaomi MI Box.  But here we will not dwell on them. <br><br>  Vermax HD is unique in that it is intended for the organization of IP-TV services on the networks of broadband access providers or for OTT services.  In addition to the low price, the device has a number of technological advantages. <br><br>  Let's sort them in order. <br><br><h3>  <b>Iron</b> </h3><br><br>  Vermax HD - a compact device in size little more than a pack of cigarettes.  Powered by Cortex-A53 mobile processor with four cores at 2 GHz frequency.  Processing 4K graphics allows 450th accelerator with five cores at 750 MHz frequency.  By the way at the moment - this is the most profitable IP-TV set-top box with 4K graphics on the Russian market. <br><br>  In general, this is an ordinary box for a TV of small dimensions, which is unlikely to catch your eyes when you spoil the interior of an elegant home with your appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bce/d1a/2a3/bced1a2a3c29431b9da6a6b3556d7d28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The shawl of the console looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d7/ab5/777/5d7ab5777a2e4d47ba5602873f4d9ba4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the left corner is an infrared sensor for the remote.  The board has two USB 2.0 ports, an AV-out, an HDMI-connector and a slot for a microSD card, as well as a 5 volt input.  By the way, HDMI is installed version 2.0 with support for HDCP2.2 and HDMI-CEC. <br><br>  CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) is a wired serial bus for remote control of electronic home appliances.  Here it is hidden in HDMI.  Today, CEC can support most consumer audio-video devices and allows you to control one device from another.  In other words, the console can be used to control the TV through the console. <br><br>  The console console can be taught to command other devices.  Instructions on how to teach the remote language is on the remote control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f5/317/c6c/2f5317c6c30646eaa4c458ca7d8bb1df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The remote looks like this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/949/6f4/e77/9496f4e776724f64b06cb02cabf21a11.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next to the "Off" button are three buttons that are responsible for interacting with other devices.  There is also a mouse mode when the cursor moves around the screen using the arrows: <br><br>  There is another option for the remote. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a8/9ac/c56/4a89acc5628c41ffb668471e8aed6db4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The console is more advanced, and on its reverse side is the keyboard for typing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22f/4d3/c82/22f4d3c82c4b41d393bc41b1121e5958.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, Wi-Fi works on the console, and other devices can be connected to USB drives.  The console can serve as a computer with access to the network and other buns. <br><br><h3>  <b>BY</b> </h3><br>  The console is running Android version 5.1.  He is LolliPop.  This version has a special ‚Äúbig screen‚Äù support library.  Android TV Input Framework has much more extensive functionality than previous versions.  This includes the processing of video streams with a direct appeal to the hardware support graphics, as well as the rapid inclusion of the console (3-5 seconds). <br><br>  A little practical part. <br><br>  Installation user feedback takes about five minutes.  Connecting all the cords, start the console.  Fast download <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bde/7eb/b10/bde7ebb102f546b8ae9c87169a2f79b4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, connect the Wi-Fi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/206/c20/a0c/206c20a0c54b469d8a7f478cc4be0cea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the settings available screen resolution for this TV. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/587/709/866/587709866ba7460f8b7445285b6ada8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7e/50d/42d/d7e50d42d68f4d30a69be0dbb5635fc7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  You can check the firmware version <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd7/9f9/64a/fd79f964a4894581bed8d0474b12159c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The installation of the console itself took about three to five minutes with all the settings.  Agree - this is a bit. <br><br>  <b>Service</b> <br><br>  The main service on the console is OTT-TV ‚ÄúSmotreshka‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bc/e12/c7f/9bce12c7f7354a6c99cdc520726fa0d9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/efc/a12/021/efca1202140543ddb135d6ce6a5c3029.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Smotreshka supports two ways of delivering a signal to the end user.  Access can be purchased directly from the supplier and watch television on the networks of any operator, or buy TV in a package with Internet access.  Television is available even on LTE. <br><br>  When ‚ÄúSmotreshka‚Äù has loaded, authorization is required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/038/7dd/01d/0387dd01deea48de825421fb23a9f5cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After we get to the main screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d2/748/585/9d274858575c4075a22d1e42498939cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Convenient interface, but if the tiles immediately showed what goes through the channels in miniature it would be just magical.  However, this is not bad, especially when compared with competitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/965/6f8/68c/9656f868c2164a7b97c8b92b6c0b9d44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dom.ru has everything mixed up: exchange rates, his own advertising, weather, traffic jams and much more, which cause his eyes to drift apart, unable to catch the focus. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRostelecom‚Äù is not too different: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/520/345/bac5203454b14e89b7ec9112c7f97283.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here they sell a lot of paid content that the user will acquire several times by accidentally clicking ‚ÄúOK‚Äù.  Many users have repeatedly complained that they ‚Äúbought the film‚Äù, although they did not.  Often with the remote just playing a child. <br><br>  There are such examples of the main screens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/808/a0d/79a/808a0d79ad294b2fae40bf12a145b93b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  People with poor eyesight will find it difficult to distinguish between the names of the channels. <br><br>  In ‚ÄúSmothreshka‚Äù everything is a little different.  For example, the organization of transfers in time shifting looks good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a54/1d1/25a/a541d125a2564b4cb41c130296451e43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, the channels viewed will often be displayed at the top of the list, and those viewed will rarely drown in the ‚Äúdepths‚Äù of the screen. <br><br>  In general, the solution is perfect mass consumer.  The operator can also deliver the product under his brand as client equipment for the IP-TV service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402437/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402437/</a></p>
