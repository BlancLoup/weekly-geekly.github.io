      In the future, we all need the ability to use information architecture schemes not only as initial presentations, but also as a final description of the case placed in a portfolio on third-party resources, so that the requirements for image quality are created with a future basis and imply adaptability to different tasks and style . <br><br>  The persistent beliefs and all sorts of particularly compelling arguments that such a scheme in the TK must necessarily be preceded by a detailed analysis and optimization of the customer's business processes;  As well, listing the rules for their decomposition into IDEF0, UML, or whatever is beyond the scope of this essay.  Simply put, if your product, designer and designer are engaged only in the fact that they are verbatim in writing and visually endless edits from the customer, without having the slightest opportunity to influence the logic and concept of the project itself (and business), they will soon be prepared another article "Free cash or why you left McDonald‚Äôs for nothing". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a3/d4a/c1c/3a3d4ac1cfb5e321f77bce2f117c097b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For all the other two and a half people who, in their daily work, have a real, rather than ephemeral, opportunity to influence the formation of the logic and principles of interaction of the system with the user and the owner, we continue: <br><br>  <b>Declaration of intent</b> <br><br>  After it was no longer possible to tolerate the careless attitude of some of the performers of the Technical Assignments to the design and design of the so-called schemes with a list of pages and sections, it was decided to make a clear and understandable guide to drawing information system information system diagrams. <br><br>  As you understand, such schemes of the internal logic of the project are needed not just for internal analytics, they are viewed by the customer.  And the customer also claims the correctness and correctness of logic, the clarity of the concept and the perfect selection of colors. <br><br>  This article should set a precedent for creating a unified guideline, in order to bring scattered daubing to a single common denominator. <br><br>  The unified format will make it possible to use intelligently designed information architecture schemes for creating any sites, including government ones, and also simplify the process of migration to new versions of sites. <br><br>  <b>rules</b> <br><br>  To comply with all these conditions - strict rules will be introduced: <br><br><ul><li>  All pages and sections on the diagram are made in the form of rectangles with the aspect ratio of any squares should be 1: 1 (square) </li><li>  The permissible block size varies from the maximum (512 by 512 pixels) to the minimum allowed for use (32 by 32 pixels) </li><li>  The general scheme with all branches should fit in a circle without losing important details. </li><li>  Explanatory text inside the block should not occupy more than 80% of the height of the square </li><li>  Possible fonts for signatures: Helvetica, Roboto. </li><li>  The background can be any.  There is no need to make it homogeneous or transparent, a gradient or even a photo in HD quality is allowed. </li><li>  It is unacceptable to impose arrows links to each other. </li><li>  Each described business process should visually transmit naturalness, confidence, positive and open attitude. </li><li>  It is important to make any scheme available for the maximum number of people, including those with mental limitations, using special software and technologies for browsing websites. </li></ul><br><br>  It is also proposed today, on a voluntary basis, to connect to our development team of an application for iPhones for fast and high-quality drawing of any information architecture schemes for typical sites and mobile applications. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274717/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274717/</a></p>
