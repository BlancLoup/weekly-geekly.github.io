This sets, in turn, the direction for the development of intelligent systems for management and monitoring at the physical level of structured cabling systems (SCS).  They are often called interactive control systems or cable infrastructure management systems.  Speaking of today, they pay attention to such systems of an increasing number of customers who, in turn, want to see a more manageable and practical SCS.  In more detail, the customers who choose such systems are financial institutions, data centers, government agencies, factories and enterprises with a high degree of automation.  As for large data centers, in such projects, customers as ‚Äúby itself‚Äù imply the use of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù systems. <br><br>  What does this system implement, and in general, what is its purpose?  More details under the cut. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Symantec, more than a quarter of data center downtime is connected precisely with changes in cable connections (human factor).  Cable infrastructure includes almost 70% of network failures.  Based on these factors and given the high cost of data center downtime, there is a need for automation and accuracy in the processes.  On top of that, operating expenses (documenting changes in infrastructure).  Here, just not a complete and short range of issues that can help solve the implemented intellectual monitoring system. <br>  Such products as PatchView from RiT Technologies, iPatch from Commscope, MIIM from Molex Premise Networks, PanView iQ from Panduit, and of course i-TRACS from iTracs (its technologies are used in systems by Mapmon from Siemon, LANsense from Nexans).  Until recently, TE connectivity's AMPTRAC, was offered exclusively with IM (Infrastructure Manager by iTracs) software.  Since 2011, AMPTRAC is offered with the new Infrastructure Configuration Manager (ICM) software, developed directly by TE Connectivity.  IM support ceased in 2012.

      Today we consider the intelligent AMPTRAC system from SCS TE connectivity.  This system allows you to create SCS with automated control at the physical level.  The whole system consists of two subsystems - AMP NETCONNECT in the field of passive equipment (represented by AMPTRAC components, as well as Quareo) and Infrastructure Configuration Manager (ICM) in the field of software.  As for the components of Quareo, we consider them in the following review. <br><br>  The overall architecture of the intelligent AMPTRAC system is depicted in (Fig. 1) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/aed/69f/19c/aed69f19cb0a05226e16dfe730f0edc7.jpg"><br>  Fig.  1 AMPTRAC architecture <br><br>  And so, consider how the system will work as an assembly (already mounted Figure 1). <br>  This fully automated system to optimize maintenance, inventory, and accurate documentation helps to prevent costly problems.  AMPTRAC is an easily-configured hardware system that is connected to ICM software and can be integrated into both new and existing LANs.  ICM allows you to optimize network monitoring and security by providing the ability to actively respond to any changes in switching due to unauthorized actions.  AMPTRAC hardware combined with ICM software closes the existing gap between local network management and physical level management. <br><br>  The monitoring of the state of the ports by the AMPTRAC system is based on the closure of an additional electrical circuit when the ports are connected by patch-code (with a special 9th ‚Äã‚Äãcontact, shown earlier in (Fig. 6). Each port of the switching panel or active equipment is equipped with a contact pad, which is connected to the analyzer. The protective caps of both standard patch cord plugs (both copper and fiber optic) are integrated by one electrical contact-sensor, which are connected by a special electrical conductor  When connecting ports with a switching cord, contact sensors of the cord rest on the panel‚Äôs contact pads and close the electrical circuit between them.This is the sign that the analyzer constantly polls the status of the ports, recognizes the connected ports and automatically updates the corresponding database on the server. and document all movements, additions and changes, the so-called (MACs- Moves, Adds and Changes) occurring in local networks. <br>  I want to note that AMPTRAC hardware is completely isolated from the SCS and does not affect the transmission of data through its channels. <br>  Compatibility of AMPTRAC with SMNP-means provides monitoring of both physical and logical (between IP-addresses) connections in the network. <br>  Physically, the AMPTRAC system can be supplied as a completely ready (integrated) solution for new installations, or as a set to be installed over existing cable infrastructure (Retrofit-Solution). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/035/107/7df/0351077dfad3f2c37d9bba5fc7cf90e4.png"><br>  Fig.  2 <br><br>  Now we will consider from what components the system consists. <br><br>  1) AMPTRAC - analyzer (presented in Fig. 3).  The task of this analyzer is to monitor and control connections between contact sensors, as well as add updated information to the software database (ICM).  The analyzer can be programmed with both Master and Slave.  It should be noted that communication with the database server occurs directly or through the Master Analyzer.  On the front side there is a 4-line graphic LCD display for interactive access to the database.  Next to the display, 2 10 / 100BaseTx ports were placed for connecting to a LAN and connecting the analyzers to each other along a chain. <br>  With a body depth of just 165 mm and a height of 1U, the analyzer allows you to control up to 1152 ports.  Up to 195 individual analyzers can be connected together in such a way providing more than 65520 controlled ports in one zone.  As can be seen from Figure 1 (the back of the analyzer) 48-jack RJ-45 connectors are located, they are used to connect scanning modules. <br>  * Comes with Infrastructure Configuration Manager (ICM) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f02/838/031/f02838031995ba01bafaa89a65560fae.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/858/c44/4e9/858c444e946835221262ebc291e51908.png"><br>  Fig.3 AMPTRAC analyzer <br><br>  Let us consider in more detail the front panel of the AMPTRAC analyzer (Fig. 1a). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c4f/3bf/6f6/c4f3bf6f6caf0085dfb1d8866610fb5e.png"><br>  Fig.  3a Analyzer front panel <br><br>  Speaker acts as a buzzer to correctly configure the analyzer.  Four line display with 40 characters displays information from the server about the configuration, malfunctions, changes.  Buttons located on the left side are used to navigate the menu system and activate or deactivate settings.  The buttons on the right side are used to enter information (port name, IP address).  Three Ethernet ports are also installed, two are installed on the rear panel of the device and one on the front panel.  These ports can be used to connect to other analyzers.  These LAN ports work as a 3-port switch and can support auto-negotiation, Auto MDI / MDI-X. <br>  On the front panel of the analyzer there are 4 indication LEDs: <br>  - LAN 2 - indicates the status of LAN 2 port located on the back of the device; <br>  - LAN 3 - indicates the status of the LAN 3 port located on the back of the device; <br>  - ‚ÄúStatus‚Äù LED - indicates that the Master analyzer is connected to the server or the slave analyzer is connected to the Master analyzer; <br>  - the power indicator indicates the level of alternating current supplied to the unit. <br>  A standard USB port is provided for connecting the analyzer with a supported device. <br>  2) AMPTRAC - I / O cables.  They are used to collect information about switching, each port of the switching panel and switch is equipped with a contact pad (sensor).  I / O cables are designed to connect sensors of switching panels, switches and other network devices to AMPTRAC analyzers (Fig. 4). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/577/1b4/403/5771b4403d9b457482590a02318496e4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/48c/405/d06/48c405d06492ee33ca138c2f02aa33e3.png"><br>  Fig.  4 I / O cable <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ac0/090/602/ac009060252dbd7d1f5294b63d9202a2.png"><br>  Fig.  4a <br><br>  On the one hand, the cable has a connector for connecting to the pads of the patch panel, and on the other hand, an RJ-45 connector for connecting with a standard patch cord Cat.  5E or 6 to the analyzer (Fig.4a). <br>  3) AMPTRAC - switching panels.  The panels are available in two versions: - ready (already with the presence of corresponding contacts (Fig. 5a), including the last generation ‚Äî Quick-Fit panels (Fig. 5b), and panels that can later be ‚Äúpumped‚Äù under the full-featured AMPTRAC ( fig.5c). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/920/d8a/318/920d8a318c36b25abbdbc1b42987694a.png"><br>  Fig.  5a AMPTRAC Patch Panels (Turnkey Solutions) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6d9/95a/f64/6d995af6492c092b0af27793bd2dff9e.png"><br>  Fig.  5b Quick-Fit Patch Panels (19 "/ 1U Patch Panel with 4 seats for Quick-Fit Modules and Cassettes) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c21/43f/2b5/c2143f2b5360d1dee085cf3bfee687f5.png"><br>  Fig.  5c AMPTRAC Patch Panels (Dial Pad) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/452/3d0/363/4523d036300e048fa650f724e4222b3f.png"><br>  Fig.  5g Patch Panel Connected I / O Cables <br><br>  I want to pay more attention to the Quick-Fit panels.  We can say that this is a more practical solution, since it is possible to mount each individual cassette (6 modules each and 4 cassettes in the patch panel).  19 "/ 1U keypad with 4 seats for modules and Quick-Fit cassettes. Available in both straight and angled design with rear cable support for fixing various types of cables. <br>  4) AMPTRAC - patch cords.  It can be said that they are no different from standard patch cords, except for the presence of an additional ‚Äú9th‚Äù conductor, which is needed to close the circuit between the sensors (see details in Figure 6); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c75/2d2/95b/c752d295b36728ec9e61c8c5f7669c0f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/752/849/74d/75284974d4d45088240617aa30b1ec1e.png"><br>  Fig.  6 Patch Cords <br><br>  5) AMPTRAC - touch pads.  They are self-adhesive strips with contact sensors (Fig. 7); <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/46b/951/b7c/46b951b7c0feaf4a0ac88aac10008f6f.png"><br>  Fig.  7 Touch Pad <br><br>  With overlays, everything is very simple; they are glued to the front panel of the switch.  Such labels are commercially available for most switch models (CISCO 4000 and 6000; CISCO 3500 and 4548; CISCO 2950; CISCO 3500 Fiber Uplink Ports; CISCO GBIC; CISCO 2950; EXTREME Summit 48i; NORTEL BAYSTACK 450-24T; CISCO MT-RJ 6000 NORTEL BAYSTACK 470-48T; Generic Fiber Uplink Ports; EXTREME Summit 1i &amp; 5i and Alpine 3808; ALCATEL 6648 Fiber Uplink Ports; CISCO 6148; NORTEL BAYSTACK 5520; ALCATEL OmniSwitch OS6624; NORTEL PASSPORT 888; Procurve J8702A &amp; 3500yl).  As the manufacturer says, it is also possible to manufacture touch pads on order. <br><br>  6) Infrastructure Configuration Manager (ICM) is a software tool that receives information from analyzers and maintains the relevance of the network infrastructure database (Fig. 8).  As you know, any equipment that is not cool, it would not have advantages, if not supported by no less cool software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/da2/517/b9e/da2517b9e32975e8c71b3cb214ab3cc3.png"><br>  Fig.  8 Window environment <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/a67/5b4/8ca/a675b48cae56c867ef3ed938c51ede3e.png"><br>  Fig.  8a Architectural plans <br><br>  Based on Infrastructure Configuration Manager (ICM) software, a slim, tree-like, intuitive cable system structure is formed.  So, on the loaded architectural plans of the object, the placement of the SCS elements (jobs, etc.) is displayed (Fig. 8a).  Cabinets / racks and patch panels located in them are presented in the software window in a photographic image.  Each analyzed channel is drawn in detail with maximum visualization.  You can easily and quickly find the required subscriber, panel port, sockets, etc., and immediately see the visualized information about all the details of the cable channel in which the desired element is located. <br>  The generated database describing the SCS is automatically maintained by the system, all changes on the switching panels and all connections to the sockets are tracked.  At any time, the operator sees the real state of the switching and the connected equipment.  The event log records all changes on the patch panels connected to outlets at workplaces. <br>  I also want to note that it is possible to set up an alert for unauthorized changes, which the software will inform via e-mail or sms.  When forming orders for performing switching tasks, the program generates an exact sequence of operations and tracks their performance.  Not a few important feature of AMPTRAC software is virtualization support (working with the database from any access point, web interface).  In addition to the above, there is the possibility of generating a variety of reports: according to the state of switching, by events ... In the event of a power outage, it is unlikely, but still ... automatic resynchronization will start. <br>  I also note that the ICM software is maximally adapted and open for integration into a centralized object management system based on software such as HP OpenView, IBM-Tivoli NetView, and others. <br><br>  7) AMPTRAC server.  That is, the computer on which the ICM software is installed.  For normal software operation, the server must meet the following characteristics: <br>  - Processor: Dual Core 2 GHz or higher (x64); <br>  - RAM, at least 8 GB; <br>  - free disk space: 20 GB; <br>  - network connection - 1 GB network card; <br>  - Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit), or Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and above (64-bit version); <br><br>  Summarizing all the above, let's summarize. <br>  By automating the monitoring of the status of SCS ports, costly and time-consuming manual administration of the cable system is excluded.  This, in turn, reduces operating costs, speeds up the maintenance of users when moving and adding jobs, reduces network downtime during repair work and ensures greater safety. <br><br>  In connection with the entry of ADC-KRONE into TE Connectivity, the Quareo product family appeared in the range of solutions of the Enterprise Network division.  Quareo technology opens up new possibilities for monitoring and managing connections in the SCS. <br>  This is a new decision, officially presented to the international community in May 2011.  Consider the features of the Quareo product family in more detail in the following review. <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197078/</a></p>
