    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The festival "Maha-Upaya-Party 2.0" is a unique experiment, during which the boundaries between work and rest, clear and creative, formal and informal, are essentially erased, turning into one big process - Life. <br><br>  As part of the experiment, several Moscow companies that for 5 years created a management system operating on the principle of a living organism, will fully transport their teams and business processes to nature, to the forest where they will work, relax, study and communicate for two weeks. <br><br>  The festival will be completely self-organizing: each participant in the Mah-Upaya-Pat 2.0 will be able to organize what he wants in the form that is close to him - from training to a theatrical performance. <br><br>  The organizers of Maha-Upaya-Pat are people who are convinced that the division into ‚Äúwork‚Äù and ‚Äúlife‚Äù: ‚Äúthis is for business‚Äù and ‚Äúthis is for the soul‚Äù is wrong and inefficient, and their combination is a difficult but worthy task. . <br><br>  Among them are the owners and top managers of businesses, employees, freelancers, students, specialists and musicians. <br><br>  In the program Maha-Upaya-Pat 2.0: <br>  Discussions and lively experience of creating non-robotic companies <br>  Meetings with investors and successful managers <br>  Dull Children's Day <br>  Open Air Concerts, Improvisations and Jams <br>  Informal communication on business and personal topics <br>  Business trainings, conferences <br>  Martial arts, yoga, practice <br>  Shooting video clips, mini-movies <br>  Tea ceremonies <br>  Brainstorming <br>  Field kitchen <br>  ‚ÄúHard acquaintance‚Äù <br>  Much more! <br><br>  <strong>What is important is not what is being done, but <em>who is</em> doing it!</strong> <br><br>  The main component of the Festival is the atmosphere that active participants and organizers bring with them.  What is important for us is not what will happen at the festival, but who will do it.  Forms do not matter and can be any if there is a Person behind them who is not afraid to be what he is and is ready to act from this. <br><br>  The Maha-Upaya-Pat Festival is a living organism that takes on different incarnations every year, depending only on who comes to the Festival and who takes the initiative to be its organizer. <br><br>  Maha-Upaya-Party 2.0 is already the 3rd festival held in this spirit, this year the main concept is ‚Äúwe are moving to live at the festival‚Äù. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>Location</strong> <br><br>  Maha-Upaya Party 2.0 will be held from August 15 to August 31 in the Ethno Village, located <br>  100 km from Moscow.  The work of the companies will be organized in a huge 500-meter area, set in a forest environment: <br><br>  All participants have access to the Internet, three meals a day, showers and accommodation in a yurt camp, tents or hunting lodges. <br><br>  We invite to the Festival all who are interested in the issues of self-realization and combining the Cause and Soul, life without divisions, life without compromise! <br></td><td><img src="http://radio.nadprof.ru/direct/images/sphere_small.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  <strong>We invite</strong> <br><br>  <em>Companies</em> - take part in the experiment and send a team or part of it to work for the Festival.
