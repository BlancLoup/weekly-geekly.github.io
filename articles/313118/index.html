  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Introduction to Labtech - we automate the work of a system administrator</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello colleagues.  We want to tell you a little introductory information about the RMM (remote monitoring and management) system, which can be useful in the work of a system administrator and help optimize the costs of IT department staff in companies of any size.  Thanks to Labtech, one IT professional can serve a large number of jobs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/523/f26/a96523f2602c40fb8f3e078790c2b881.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The main advantage of Labtech is to reduce the number of incidents and reaction time to them.  The solution involves installing a small agent on the target system, which sends messages to the server and the current state of the system.  After installation, the agent performs a complete inventory of the system (software and hardware) and then monitors all changes and sends them to the head server.  The database created on the server accumulates information about the incidents and the administrator's actions to eliminate them.  On the basis of this information, automatic procedures for their elimination can be created for frequently repeated incidents.  In addition, in order to prevent any failures, the agent performs timely software updates, including anti-virus, monitors key parameters and much more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/232/734/d5c232734c204d1fa85ec207148ad148.png" alt="image">
