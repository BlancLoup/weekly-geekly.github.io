  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big update: Evernote for Windows and Mac got links to notes, copies of notes and more.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We made a combined release of new versions of Evernote for Windows and Evernote for Mac with a number of features that our users have repeatedly requested.  All features described below are available for both platforms, unless otherwise noted. <br><br>  <strong>To install the latest version:</strong> <br><ul><li>  check for updates; </li><li>  download Evernote for Mac from the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote/id406056744%3Fmt%3D12">Mac App Store</a> or from <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/get.php%3Ffile%3DEvernoteMac">the Evernote website</a> ; </li><li>  Download Evernote for Windows <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/download/get.php%3Ffile%3DWin">here</a> . </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Links to notes </h3><br>  Not so often a single opportunity can significantly improve the work with Evernote for all users.  It is possible that at first glance it did not seem so to you, but references to notes can definitely be attributed to the number of such significant innovations.  As you may have guessed, this feature will allow you to link notes, located in various places.  To create a link, right-click on a note and select <i>Copy link to note</i> or find it in the <i>Note</i> menu.  After that, the link will be placed on the clipboard. <br><br>  You can insert this link almost anywhere - in other notes, calendars, to-do lists, other applications, etc. By clicking on this link, a note will always open.  If you press it while holding the Shift key in Windows or CMD on a Mac, the note will open in a separate window.  We have already added support for links to notes in the web interface, as well as Evernote versions for iOS and Android, so you can feel free to open links in these clients and get to the right place.

      Links to notes also work in joint notebooks, allowing authors to compile tables of contents and manuals for navigating notes. <br><br><img title="windowsmac_notelinks" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2df/10b/ed8/2df10bed8575ff181645cf7a8488e43e.png" width="640" height="231"><br><br>  <strong>Create links for multiple notes</strong> <br>  You can select several notes, click on the right mouse button and select the item <i>Copy link to note</i> .  When inserting you will receive a list of links.  This feature will be very useful when you compile a bibliography, table of contents or a list of quotes. <br><br>  <strong>Link Benefits</strong> <br>  Have you ever wanted to create a reminder for a particular note?  Now you have this opportunity, just paste the link to the note into your calendar application.  At the right time, a reminder will appear on the screen along with the link, and you just have to click on it to open the note. <br><br>  But that's not all, we hope that links to notes will open up many new great features and ideas for our developer community.  It will come at an opportune time for <a href="http://blog.evernote.com/ru/2011/05/24/etc-and-developers-competition/">the developer competition</a> now under way. <br><br><h3>  Copies of notes </h3><br>  Now you have the opportunity to make copies of any notes and place them in the right places.  You can make a duplicate note in the current notepad or place it in another one, as well as copy the note from the shared notebook to your own account and vice versa (if allowed by the owner of the notebook). <br><br>  To copy a note, right-click on it and select <i>Copy Note</i> (Windows) or <i>Copy to Notepad</i> (Mac) from the context menu. <br><img title="windowsmac_copy-notes" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/348/b12/646/348b126462f5ab3ca69b23f5cfc380ad.png" width="640" height="232"><br><br>  <strong>Creating templates</strong> <br>  The copy function opens up the possibility of creating note templates.  If you already have a note with a specific recording format that is perfect, for example, for storing accounting information, you can simply copy it.  In the window that appears, you can specify whether to save for a copy of the label and the date of creation / change from the original notes. <br><br>  To do this: <br><ul><li>  <strong>in Windows:</strong> after right-clicking a note, open the <i>Copy Note</i> submenu and select <i>Notepad ...</i> ; </li><li>  <strong>Mac:</strong> Click the right mouse button, scroll to the bottom of the list of notebooks and hover over <i>Options</i> . </li></ul><br><h3>  Fragment View Mode </h3><br>  In this update, the mixed viewing mode has given way to more information-rich fragments.  Fragments allow you to display the maximum amount of useful information about each note without opening it.  If the note contains only text, then the full width of the text will be displayed on the corresponding fragment in the list.  If there are images and text in the note, text with a thumbnail will be displayed on the fragment.  For notes containing only images, a large thumbnail and caption will be shown.  This view mode not only allows you to get more information about the contents of the notes, but also makes it easier to navigate through them. <br><br><img title="windowsmac_snippets2" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/555/20e/79c/55520e79c760230497b0851f223258d1.png" width="640" height="232"><br><br><h3>  History of viewed notes: Back / Forward buttons </h3><br>  Navigating your Evernote account just got easier.  We added convenient Back / Forward buttons that allow you to navigate through recently viewed notes.  This feature extends to viewed notes, made search queries, visited notebooks, and more. <br><br>  Pressing and holding one of the arrows, similarly to the same buttons in the browser, you will see a list of items that can be accessed without bothering yourself with unnecessary clicks. <br><br>  Back / Forward buttons also greatly simplify navigation through links to notes.  If you are viewing the note in a separate window and clicking on such a link, the corresponding note will open in the same window.  To return to the previous note, you just need to click on the Back button. <br><br><h3>  Menu ‚ÄúNote‚Äù </h3><br>  All functions associated with the notes are now moved to the new corresponding menu item.  There you can copy or move the note, share it and much more. <br><br><h3>  Windows: other improvements </h3><br>  The following are some of the features that were implemented only in the update for Windows.  Options only for Mac on the way. <br><br>  <strong>New data export options</strong> <br>  Combining the function of links to notes with the ability to export notes to HTML, we can now offer you the export of notes as separate web pages with a table of contents file.  Thus, as a result of export, you can get a practically full-fledged site.  To try out the new version, select the notes you want to save to HTML, right-click and go to <i>Export Notes</i> .  Then select the option <i>Export as multiple web pages</i> . <br><br>  <strong>Additional improvements</strong> <br><ul><li>  <strong>Drag and drop.</strong>  Now you can drag text and images from the note to the desktop and into other applications. </li><li>  <strong>Disable PDF preview.</strong>  You can right-click on the PDF file in the note so that it appears as a regular attachment. </li><li>  <strong>Improved handling of text styles.</strong>  We improved the handling of font styles. </li></ul><br><h3>  Mac: VoiceOver support </h3><br>  We have improved Evernote compatibility with Apple VoiceOver features.  You can activate VoiceOver via System Preferences&gt; Sharing. <br><br><h3>  To be continued </h3><br>  These updates for Windows and Mac add many great features that make Evernote better for users and open up new opportunities for developers with our API.
