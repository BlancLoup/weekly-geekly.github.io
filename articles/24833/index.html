Everybody notices this!  But no one does anything to ensure that at least it does not happen again! <br><br>  April 19 was declared the Day of Frequency in Omsk.  I think similar events were held in other cities.  The day has passed for a long time, and the result is not visible everywhere.  Purely only in the central streets of the city, on the outskirts, where I live, there is still an unpleasant picture with tons of garbage on lawns, in courtyards, and roads. <br><br>  I remember the whole class went to school on Saturdays and cleaned the territories that we were allocated, I wouldn‚Äôt say that at least someone liked it, but apparently it was then that I began to understand that it was bad to litter, that is, these activities turned out to be useful, I think not me one  The result of such ‚Äúoutings‚Äù was obvious, the next day the city just glistened.  The benches were painted, the courtyards cleaned, the trees whitewashed.  School I finished a long time.  But every year I notice that the day is not as fruitful as before, maybe the schoolchildren did not clean them up :) maybe the city does not allocate enough money for cleaning, but what we have now doesn‚Äôt suit me.

      And the matter is not even that sometimes our problems are indifferent to our state, but the matter is probably in ourselves.  Sometimes people who have traveled in Germany are surprised, who, telling you how wonderful and clean there are, go along with you, throwing seeds and packs of potato chips right on the street, the wind simply lifts these packs and hangs them beautifully in the trees). <br><br>  I know the problems of many cities, including Moscow, when you walk along the main streets and there are no bins!  I will not brag about it, but I will say, for example, that I never throw garbage, if there are no garbage bins nearby, I will put a pack of chips, for example, in a bag and, if possible, throw it away. <br><br>  People!  Envy the purity of other countries!  Start with yourself!  How long can you live in the garbage? <br><br>  Off [Recently decided to watch TV and got on an interesting news report.  In some of the Russian cities imposed huge fines (from 2000 to 5000 r) for a discarded cigarette butt!  It is interesting to look at this city in a year or two.] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24833/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24833/</a></p>
