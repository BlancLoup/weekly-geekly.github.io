The unsuccessful creation of a project called Newton in the early 2000s, Steve immediately got the idea to create such a device that would have a multi-touch display, and which would have no keyboard. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of the creation of the iPhone has a close relationship with the creation of the previously well-known iPod player.  After Jobs got a prototype of such a device, he immediately got the idea that it was possible to create a mobile phone that could easily blow up the market in a short period of time.  But before this breakthrough, the company had been going for several years.  At first, projects were developed that were immediately frozen or required some refinement.  According to Steve Jobs, there comes a period that only a certain circle of people needs a personal computer.  It is possible to draw an analogy with the agrarian business, because all of its cars are trucks that were widely used on farms.  It is also the case with PCs, which have become in our time a kind of truck, because technology does not stand still and progress is always needed. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe head of the company was to combine the three main devices: a player, a pocket personal computer (PDA) and a mobile phone.  After all, this step made the future iPhone so necessary and popular for the buyer.  Steve gave people what they wanted.  Having the creation of such a product was put forward in 2004, such phones were expected to compete with smartphones and even outperform them in all respects.

      The first step in creating an iPhone was a project called Purple 1, but it was unsuccessful.  The second stage was the stage during which a mobile phone called Motorola ROKR was created, which subsequently hit the market in 2005.  This device was considered a player into which the iTunes player was integrated.  But after a while, due to unsuccessful design and very poor functionality, this product was recognized as the failure of the year and the project had to be frozen. <br><br>  But Steve Jobs was not going to give up.  In 2005, he began to cooperate with the cellular company Cingular, making a statement that his company intends to release its own device.  The development of the new iPhone was strictly classified.  Engineers who did different jobs had no right to communicate with each other.  This project is called "Purple 2". <br><br>  In the meantime, when the Jobs team is engaged in its secret project, December 18, 2006 leaves the CISCO VoIP phone.  And many have already begun to take shape the view that Apple will not create its masterpiece.  But the engineers continued to work, tirelessly in the hope that they would succeed in releasing at least a similar phone by the deadline. <br><br>  January 9, 2007, Apple announced the release of the phone, which they called the iPhone.  Why ask the name was exactly that?  Where did this prefix i come from?  Following the popularity of the iPod player, Steve Jobs decided to use the prefix "i" in his title as well.  But with this title came some difficulties.  The fact is that the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù brand was registered in 1996 by Infogear, the rights to which were later acquired by cisco.  And immediately after the release of Steve Jobs, cisco sues for misappropriating the name.  But later in December 2007, both companies compromised and began to use this brand together. <br><br>  The first-generation iPhone was present at MacWorld in January 2007, and already in June of the same year it appeared in stores.  The back panel was aluminum-based, and in the bottom of the case was a plastic cover that covered Bluetooth and GSM.  According to all forecasts, the new smartphone was able to combine several gadgets into one product.  But there were several drawbacks, for example, he lacked 3G support, and therefore had to use less high-speed EDGE technology.  This shortcoming has been greatly criticized.  At the time of sales, the iPhone could be purchased for $ 499 - 4 GB of memory, and $ 599 cost with an 8 GB internal memory card. <br><br>  Steve Jobs and his team took into account all the criticism and wishes from the public and began to think how to solve the problem with high-speed Internet.  After some time, the second generation of iPhone smartphones comes out, which had an addition in its name - 3G.  Also, this device has received GPS support and the use of Google maps.  In its kit, the new device had a new operating system - iPhone OS 2.0.  Its design was slightly modified, the back cover, which was previously made of metal, was replaced with a plastic one.  The price was also reduced: for $ 199 you could buy a device with 8GB of memory and for $ 299 you could buy it with 16GB of internal memory.  iPhone has spread in 70 countries around the world just a few months. <br><br>  At a conference called WWDC 7 in June 2010, the iPhone 4 was put up. The price has decreased to $ 199 and $ 299 (with a contract) for models 16 and 32 GB of internal memory, respectively. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118734/</a></p>
