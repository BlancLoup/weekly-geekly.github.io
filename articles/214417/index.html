The time has come to answer for words, and we will begin with the most popular and frequently used component of any corporate SaaS-service - CRM.  Bitrix24 is far from being exhausted by this functionality, but the CRM component, as one would expect, enjoys the special attention of employees.  In this article, we will outline the main features of the implementation of CRM elements in this product, and with what to compare it and in whose favor - see for yourself, here you have complete freedom of action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/676/1c5/378/6761c53780ee485caaa41680e6c63987.jpg"><br><br>  The sales process can vary greatly depending on the industry in which your company operates.  Of course, no one knows better than you exactly how managers should react to requests, with what probability leads are converted into transactions, and what do you do.  Does the company provide consulting services?  Supports an online store with the ability to receive orders by phone?  Maybe you do and promote sites? <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Whatever you do, surely this is a noble cause worthy of the highest quality tools.  Improvements everywhere and always there is a place, and the well-known proverb, opposing the best to the good, was invented by inert conservatives.  You may already be configured to automatically transfer order data to the responsible manager, generate bills and other processes, but what about contacts that have not turned into a deal?  Not in Excel to take them into account, right?  Are you able to track the effectiveness of phone calls and business correspondence without losing in endless journals and conversations?  There are many questions, and the main reason for their occurrence is the disunity of the solutions used.  Fortunately, this ailment is curable. <br><br>  Available recipe called <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/features/crm.php%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Db24_030314">Bitriks24</a> almost universal, has no contraindications and side effects.  Moreover, he was tested on living employees, and during the testing period no one was hurt! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8c/950/290/c8c9502905694281bedebc7efaec322a.png"><br><br>  And if a website or online store is built on the 1C-Bitrix platform (which is very likely in our realities), then the use of Bitrix24 for collaboration, which is called, ‚Äúthe doctor prescribed‚Äù.  It is enough to configure the import of data from the connected online store, adjust the basic business processes, and the work of the system administrator ends there.  But no, do not forget about the other side of the coin - integration with 1C: Enterprise products.  If these words evoke certain associations, it makes sense to go to the appropriate section of settings.  If there is a compatible version of the deployed product, the probability to get current lists of invoices and the catalog of products offered tends to be 100%, so there is something to fight for.  And now is the time to reward yourself with a well-deserved rest.  As the saying goes, the sun rises, IT specialists fall asleep, managers wake up ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19c/7ac/76e/19c7ac76ed8141d89efe36516be07b96.png"><br><br>  The staff of the sales department, in fact, comes all ready.  For example, orders and transactions in excess of a certain amount can be automatically taken over by a corporate account manager, and all applications from a representative of Vektor LLC are placed directly on the desk of the head of the department.  It is enough to arm yourself with the authority of the portal administrator and set up several business processes.  It is important that visual editing is supported using standard flowcharts - familiar and understandable. <br><br>  Before you pour another cup of coffee, the administrator must check the access rights to CRM.  They may differ from general privileges that apply to individual accounts.  In particular, ordinary managers can be allowed to edit the list of products and add new positions as the nomenclature changes.  Why, the usefulness of this distinction is hard to overestimate.  You do not want half of the users on the site to have administrator status (which, among other things, is absolutely unacceptable from a security point of view), but at the same time the head of sales did not run to the IT department every five minutes with a regular request to edit the product list or change the parameters of the transaction? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/61f/c28/96761fc286874600a155c804a79cb2b5.png"><br><br>  There are several basic access rights and user groups, for a start it should be enough.  However, no one bothers to add arbitrary roles with detailed privileges and assign them to a new group, if only the changes would be beneficial to the cause. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/798/cc8/c4b/798cc8c4b40441babdba87dcb00043f5.png"><br><br>  In all this magnificence, the possibility of integration with the company's mail servers is lost, but in vain.  In the end, how long does it take to open an email client, find the right recipient or insert an address in the appropriate field, find an account and write a couple of meaningless phrases in the body of the letter?  ‚ÄúMinute deal!‚Äù - you will say.  That's the way it is, but the working day of an experienced manager selling a demanded product literally breaks into thousands of fragments because of such trifles.  Letters are forgotten in drafts, accounts are made with errors, something simply does not reach processing ... As a result, everyone is dissatisfied - potential and existing customers, bosses and, of course, the manager himself, who has not grown an extra pair of hands at his leisure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f7/84e/348/5f784e3489e8424a91f253b7fd321b5d.png"><br><br>  Bitrix24, fortunately, does not produce gene mutations, but knows firsthand about the productivity of work.  It is enough to specify the parameters of the mail server in the account settings, and you can communicate directly from CRM!  Generated an account in a few clicks, selecting products and services from the catalog, decided on the company and counterparty and immediately sent the invoice in PDF format to the right person!  It would seem that everything is very simple and obvious, but just such solutions make it possible in the aggregate to work better, faster and more qualitatively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/385/b42/05d/385b4205d84f42f39b69f72ea097732c.png"><br><br>  Suppose the use of Bitrix24 promises a manager unearthly benefits and complete comfort, but what about the manager?  His job is not only to sell to individual clients, but also to keep records, control the activities of subordinates and report to the board of directors (if any).  We think that you yourself roughly or even accurately represent what makes up the list of duties of the employee occupying this position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d1/c94/1eb/9d1c941eb1ae4de9af9dfb8bf0ae8bf4.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/848/21b/672/84821b6722134f69bc0425fa560990a0.png"><br><br>  From the use of a system, a person does not get less responsibilities, rather the opposite.  Another thing is that a properly selected tool allows you to easily manage routine tasks and track progress in all areas of activity, without ‚Äúpulling‚Äù employees and not preventing them from carrying out assigned tasks.  Of course, this requires serious involvement with the condition that, say, Bitrix24 is the only officially recognized way of communication in the company.  No messages on Skype or other instant messengers are considered as a guide to action and are simply ignored.  And so that the transition to a system of this type was not so boring, the developers came up with an activity index that visually reflects the distribution of actions for each individual employee, and for the company as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/391/a62/1a1391a620834dd0962dee4d03b2a4f1.png"><br><br>  Added a lead?  Did you manage to convert it into a deal, automatically transferring all contact information to one click?  Billed, generated PDF and noted that the data went to the client?  Updated contact information and indicated how you know this person?  Yes, you're just great, like you! <br><br>  At the hearing, it can be perceived wildly, but believe me - familiar to most people on social networks, a tape of activity conducted separately by CRM will allow all employees involved in the process not only to follow how things are going, but also to support each other in good endeavors, to give valuable comments and advice.  And what could be better than coordinated teamwork? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62c/f93/670/62cf9367017245dabe16e02ce4746f4d.png"><br><br>  In the following articles - work with reports and business processes, interaction with applications and other services, performance evaluation and planning of working time!  It is hard to believe, but Bitrix24 is capable of all this and much more.  Evaluate the system yourself by trying the free version with a limit of 12 employees on <a href="http://www.bitrix24.ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Db24_030314">bitrix24.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/214417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/214417/</a></p>
