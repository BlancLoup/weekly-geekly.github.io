I offer to everyone attention 8 tips for a freelancer who can drastically turn their eyes on self-PR, development of a distant career, and, at least, will help in further self-development.  As we all see from practice, the performer‚Äôs professionalism does not always play a key role.  Let‚Äôs throw away the chance by getting some practical advice from the capitalists! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can be the most talented performer, but this will not get richer.  First of all, you need a customer who is <b>ready to pay</b> .  For this, every free-lancer needs good self-PR.  Let potential customers know about yourself, give them a chance to <i>‚Äúbuy yourself</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  About whom the employer does not know, he will not get a job. <br>  <b>Truly talented freelancers are talented in everything.</b>  They win customers letting the world know about themselves and their abilities. <br><br>  How often do we hear: <i>Oh, where is your portfolio?</i>  <i>Who can recommend your work?</i>  <i>What journals published your work?</i>  All this is due to lack of information.  A good manager is rather not a person, but a creature of all opinions about himself.  So let's take a look at all the advice to a freelancer who will help get a good job by adapting "foreign tips" to the post-Soviet realities.

      <b>1.</b> Personal contact.  Personal contact is very important, because it allows you to offer your services <b>to the right people</b> .  On the Internet, omnipotent algorithms do not allow to select the target audience with the accuracy that we can have in real life. <br><blockquote>  For example, if my friend's father owns a cafe, why not become the creator of the site for this cafe? </blockquote><br><br>  2. Prepare the speech.  In my seven years of experience in copywriting, it was not uncommon that a client who unexpectedly went on Skype did not receive a worthy offer, considering me an ordinary executor.  Now I have always ‚Äútxt‚Äù at hand ‚Äî a file with a welcome speech, offer of services and other things. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Always carry a business card with you.  Make it very simple and inexpensive, but the benefits will bring a lot.  My classmate, whom I met by chance a year ago, talked with me for a long time and turned out to be a good web designer.  Three months later I received a huge order for the development of large sites, but could not remember the name of his company.  And if I had his business card ... Therefore, hand out business cards to potential customers (paper, email to mail). <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Charity.  Maybe abroad it is very popular, implies free donation for the benefit of children, etc.  This is not quite so with us.  You can create a platform for public authorities, utilities, well, in general, to do a job on the ball.  However, hang your logo, name, significantly promoting your brand (both personal and shopping).  Writing articles on the Megamind is, by and large, also free PR for many corporations.  But don't get it wrong with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">product placement</a> . <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Attend themed events.  If an optimizer gathers in your city, it is logical for a good copywriter to promote their services among these masses.  During a coffee break, catch your prey one by one and offer your services in an unobtrusive manner. <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Join any club organization.  Often these circles are hotbeds of advertising for many customers.  For example, on the stock exchange of Advego content, many have ‚Äúwhite lists of authors‚Äù, allowing them to go there.  And then exchange this list.  Try to enter a talented group of such writers, and then everything will go self-propelled. <br><br>  <b>7.</b> Hold seminars.  Great experience allows me to give advice with a bias on personal experience.  So why shouldn't I speak at a local seminar, even if it‚Äôs not so popular?  Often, this video then wanders to YouTube and brings a good advertising <a href="http://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">profit</a> . <br><br>  <b>8.</b> Forums should love you.  I posted so many comments on the forums that I am a respectable guest on many of them.  On my site every day, conversions from these forums make up about 40% of the audience.  Good advertising, free.  Not to mention that raises the authority of the author. <br><br>  There are many tips, so wait for the sequel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285870/</a></p>
