  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NOT target audience</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It would seem that there is no more system-forming concept in the world than the target audience.  But after double elaboration of expert ‚Äúten thousand hours‚Äù in the profession today, the definition of Central Asia looks more and more vague.  After analyzing about a hundred metrics, I came to the conclusion that the most reasonable approach is to single out a single, non-target audience common to all existing and future projects at once ‚Äî these are insolvent children of preschool age.  Everything.  The remaining segments and categories of people can and will buy or use the services of any information systems with a proper hike. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/315/8ec/310/3158ec310f3f53d958a165cf3cf7e350.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Without losing connections with reality, let us proceed immediately to life examples, namely, to our torment when trying to standardize the analysis and promotion of a sanatorium with a curative water and billiards.  Any young fragile mind here will immediately tell me that Central Asia is the only one in all sanatoriums - they are retired.  And it will be wrong.  In fact, this service was bought by everyone: the pensioners themselves, their children or even grandchildren, and also trade union workers of companies, besides men and women, hipsters and collective farmers, lawyers and designers, and in general everything.  Only children of preschool age did not buy vouchers, so they alone had to be allocated to the only non-target audience.

      Children's online store - another example of the difficulties out of the blue.  Goods are for children, and parents and grandmothers, and even children's organizations, must buy them.  So again, the target audience here is everything except for.  in fact, the children themselves, for whom the designer had previously done a few thousand dollars.  picking out unicorns, giraffes and hippos.  The perfect hit in Anti-CA. <br><br>  Do you think apartment renovation sites and offices are simpler?  In fact, it is even worse, because more than two thirds of all traffic there were young and proactive women, and how to convince a businessman to take all the brutal drills and complex price calculators for horoscopes at a stroke?  Yes, by the way about horoscopes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6bc/291/d4a/6bc291d4a066eb9478e4e6a6cce53485.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  More and more contemporary user experience studies remind me of astrology, where, based on the month in which Napoleon or Alexander the Great was born, conclusions are drawn about the behavior of a billion more people born in the same month.  And this is terrible, because there is nothing more inaccurate and approximate, when the forecast about the behavior of a particular person is automatically shifted to the entire chosen set of people with a similar sign of gender, age or social status. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3b9/9c4/921/3b99c4921198f8fd3896d7e01025d1e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not only does the division of people into such categories by themselves, followed by labeling, smacks of eugenics, so this approach does not work even with a single studied subject.  Imagine, now he is at home at a loving father - and tomorrow, in the working smoking room, is already the famous Petya-matershinnik;  yesterday he was a successful manager - and today Verka Serdyuchka at corporate party;  yesterday they were brutal men - and today they are Wachowski sisters.  And How?  How to work with it?  Wait until new features are introduced in Yandex.Metrica for the segmentation of gender: transsexuals, transgender people, transvestites, dominants, submissives and a dozen more names?  Well, to segment - so to segment, the analyst is obliged not to catch up with the trends of modern culture - but to overtake them, isn't it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8f7/818/b73/8f7818b73a9e3889ea99542299690ef7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As usual, the purpose of this text, (as well as all the others) is not to declare one's point of view, but to designate the abundance of unresolved issues, turning a blind eye to which it is impossible to consider yourself a professional in the field of target and non-target audiences. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299276/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299276/</a></p>
