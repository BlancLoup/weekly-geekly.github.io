    <h4>  Background of 3D food printers </h4><br><h5>  Imagine Machine </h5><br>  3D food printing is one of the most desirable applications for 3D printers. <br>  In early 2012, <b>Essential Dynamics</b> announced the world's first food 3D printer <a href="http://www.theimaginemachine.com/en/">Imagine Machine</a> .  The printer went on sale in 2012 at a price of $ 3,000. Now the manufacturer's website is available the second generation of food 3D printers at a price of $ 3,795 (approximately 135,000 rubles). <br>  Video of the printing process by the 3D Imagine Machine printer: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sGbvTMYEa04%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhihjUy679PsluwJ0XCFHMBDV_d9ig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Chock Edge Creator V1 </h5><br>  In the spring of 2012, British scientists from Exeter University announced that they had managed to create the world's first chocolate 3D printer.  The complexity of chocolate layered printing lies in the fact that chocolate does not have time to cool down and subsequent layers prevent the formation of a 3D figure.  Scientists from the English county of Devonshire (Exeter University is located there) have developed a technology of layered printing chocolate and called it CHOCALM.  On the basis of this technology was developed printer <a href="https://chocedge.com/choc-creator-v1.php">Chock Edge Creator V1</a> .  In the fall of 2013, he went on sale and is available on the official website at a price of 2,888 British pounds (approximately 170,000 rubles). <br>  By the way, we in Madrobots purchased this printer model and realized that it is rather difficult to print chocolate in layers with its help.  But mayonnaise on sausage manages to print real works of art. <br>  Exeter University Chocolate Printer Demonstration: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIFi8but3Vw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjueG7iXnrtH8ARRMw3dY03UbHnkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Foodini </h5><br>  The project has been developed since 2012 by a team from Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãSpain. <br>  In the fall of 2013, the founders of the project presented a prototype printer to the public and began a search for venture financing.  The <a href="http://naturalmachines.com/">naturalmachines.com</a> website was created, the world's leading media outlets wrote about the project, and about 400 pre-orders were collected from the USA, China, and Russia. <br><br><h4>  Project Description Foodini </h4><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Foodini project is to inspire more people to eat healthy, homemade food made from fresh ingredients.  Usually, cooking takes a lot of time, so people prefer the convenience of convenience foods and frozen meals to cooking. <br>  The task of the printer is not to automate the entire cooking process, but to perform repetitive routine operations per person (such as making dumplings or creating a tin cookie). <br>  Project video for Kickstarter campaign: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPngd9NkX3A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi4iDb3Ae2oRROb4OEKyeQsMXrpNA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Foodini printer printing technology - FDM (layered overlay material). <br>  The printer pushes liquid material onto the printing platform.  Foodini is equipped with 5 capsules for five different ingredients, and each of the ingredients can be squeezed out with different pressure and temperature.  You can prepare ingredients for printing using a conventional hand blender - grind necessary food to a pasty state and put the resulting mass into a capsule. <br>  The printed dish can be consumed immediately after production, if you have made a fruit dessert;  bake in the oven if you type pizza or cookies and cook if you type dumplings or pasta. <br><br>  At Kickstarter, there is a campaign to raise funds for the development of the first batch of Foodini 3D printers. <br>  The production of the printer is planned to be adjusted by January 2015. <br>  Those who are ready to invest their money and wait almost a year can <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/456763017/designed-for-healthy-eating-foodini-a-3d-food-prin">order Foodini for $ 999</a> (approximately 36,000 rubles). <br><br>  There are several videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NaturalMachines/videos">Youtube's Natural Machines channel</a> , which demonstrate the printing process and its final product. <br><br>  For example, pizza printing: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7Gb-X1DGmk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjqVB3uxsMry2PT0EmBuCSA6Qsdjg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Or the well-known dish Fish and Fried Potatoes (Fish &amp; Chips): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4YsIZbzLuU8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5vIxPpL9DMfesflrkmkBfTdVbvA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Examples of dishes printed on Foodini </h5><br>  Pizza after printing and in front of the oven (cheese is applied manually): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fe/55e/498/3fe55e49853a59caa649373b7b36c488.jpg"><br><br>  Pizza after the oven: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18e/313/28a/18e31328af6e7add422fa93fd8ef59e2.jpg"><br><br>  Spinach Dinosaurs: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3be/8d3/252/3be8d3252f7f62f0552fc2d912c9da3a.jpg"><br><br>  Meat burgers: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6dd/b5d/cf6/6ddb5dcf687051a76163ab2b66425f88.jpg"><br><br>  Fish and fried potatoes (fish and chips): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c0e/f14/9b0/c0ef149b005b786d08a77e028ba1b26e.jpg"><br><br>  More photos of the printed dishes are available <a href="http://www.naturalmachines.com/">on the Natural Machines website</a> . <br><br><h4>  Foodini online platform </h4><br>  Foodini has a built-in touch display on the front panel.  The Foodini application allows you to access the online community, where you can find proven recipes, videos and other materials to help you understand the printing process. <br>  Users will be able to set the printing program by selecting a recipe directly from the application, as well as create a list of selected recipes and get the ingredients necessary for printing a dish. <br>  The recipe site for Foodini will also be available as an app for iOS and Android. <br><br>  For engineers and developers, Natural Machines will open an API for developing their own recipe applications. <br>  For example, to create a configurator for perfect ravioli / ravioli. <br><br>  Screenshot of the Foodini application with a selection of recipes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20b/9a4/b72/20b9a4b72eed76301308d2a7de3d2459.png"><br><br>  After the user has selected a recipe, the printer will show which ingredients to add to the capsules and in what order. <br><br><h4>  Foodini Printer Iron </h4><br><h5>  Printer Preliminary Technical Specifications: </h5><br><ul><li>  Dimensions: 43.8 cm W x 43.0 cm D x 43.0 cm H </li><li>  Size of the print area: 25.0 cm W x 16.5 cm D x 12.0 cm H </li><li>  Weight: 10.4 kg </li><li>  Touchpad: 7 inch running Android OC </li><li>  Internet connection support: Wi-Fi module </li><li>  Swivel glass platform: diameter 26 cm </li><li>  Capsules: up to 5 capsules can be loaded into Foodini at the same time.

If you are interested in learning something else, write your question in the comments, we will try to ask it to Emilio in the near future.  He responds fairly quickly, so you can count on the answer. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : Does your team have relevant experience required to develop such a project? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : The founders of the project are engineers and marketers.  Our team has engineers, designers, software developers, food technologists and nutritionists. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : What technology do you use in Foodini? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : We have developed a set of technologies and systems, including a new extruder mechanism, a capsule replacement system, and more.  I can not disclose the details, because right now we are patent the technology developed.  The basis of the printing technology used in Foodini is FDM. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : How Foodini differs from existing solutions in the food printer market.  For example, from Imagine Machine? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : <br>  Essential Dynamics Printer is actually a 3D printer that uses food as print material.  We have developed a household appliance, which (as it happens), uses 3D printing technology. <br>  In general, we are distinguished by a complex of systems, plus a user interface and software. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : How do you see the near future of 3D food printers? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : <br>  We see our 3D printer as a closer incarnation of the Star Trek replicator idea.  We believe that it will be used not only in the domestic sphere, but also play an important role in medicine. <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : Who is the target audience of Foodini?  Who is interested in buying your printer? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : <br>  We believe that we have created a truly household appliance and the main buyers of Foodini will be ordinary people for home cooking, as well as B2B customers (restaurants, pastry shops, catering companies). <br><br>  <b>Madrobots</b> : What scenarios for using Foodini do you imagine? <br>  <b>Emilio</b> : <br>  Foodini is designed to help people cook at home using fresh ingredients, without preservatives or chemical additives, as opposed to convenience food. <br>  Our device takes care of all the cooking work (for example, making ravioli can take 2 hours and another half an hour to set the table and the consequences of cooking. With Foodini, the whole process takes only 10 minutes and there is no need to clean it).  In addition, Foodini will allow you to create dishes that can not be made by hand and we work with several chefs with Michelin star owners (stars from the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CA%25F0%25E0%25F1%25ED%25FB%25E9_%25E3%25E8%25E4_%25CC%25E8%25F8%25EB%25E5%25ED">most authoritative restaurant guide in the world</a> ) to develop similar recipes. <br><br>  Madrobots will be the official distributor of Natural Machines in Russia.  If in production there will be no special overlays, in February, 2015, the printer can be bought in Russia. <br><br>  You can support the project on Kickstarter or submit an application on the Madrobots website.  The application on our site does not oblige to anything, we just notify you about the start of sales of Foodini in Russia. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/456763017/designed-for-healthy-eating-foodini-a-3d-food-prin">Support Foodini on Kickstarter (and pre-order a $ 999 printer).</a> <br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/3d/organicheskiy-3d-printer-foodini/">Leave a request on the Madrobots website (priced at 49,990 rubles).</a> <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217243/</a></p>
