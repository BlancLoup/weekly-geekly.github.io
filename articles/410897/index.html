    <h2>  Doomsday soundtrack </h2><br>  In 2015, a former intern for CNN, one of the largest TV channels in the United States and the world, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/06/cnn-end-of-the-world_n_6422738.html">‚Äúpoured‚Äù a</a> strange recording onto the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/06/cnn-end-of-the-world_n_6422738.html">Internet</a> ‚Äî a military band played a mournful tune for a minute. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JnfAr_YSxs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  She attracted everyone's attention, because the video tape with this record was written "to show when the end of the world will be confirmed."  The exact date of recording is unknown, but, apparently, the video was made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/06/cnn-apocalypse-video-nearer-my-god-to-thee">around the early 80s</a> . <br><br>  According to some assumptions, the recording may be related to the statement of Ted Turner, the founder of the round-the-clock news channel CNN.  Launching the world's first 24-hour news broadcast, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jan/06/cnn-apocalypse-video-nearer-my-god-to-thee">said</a> : ‚ÄúWe will go on the air on June 1 and will not stop until the very end of the world.  When it comes, we will tell about it, play "Nearer, My God, to Thee" and set off. " <br><br>  <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/06/cnn-end-of-the-world_n_6422738.html">There is also a theory</a> that this melody was played by the orchestra on the sinking Titanic. <br><br><h2>  Silence music </h2><br>  In 1952, avant-garde composer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B6,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">John Cage</a> wrote a three-part composition 4‚Ä≤33 ‚Ä≥ (read as "four minutes, thirty-three seconds" or simply "four thirty-three").  In her score, the only indication for a musician is not to make a single sound intentionally.  The composition can be performed on any instrument or instruments, in a classical or jazz orchestra, reworked into rap or dubstep. <br><br>  <a href="https://youtu.be/81EQ16UqhZg">Here it</a> is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. <br><br>  She is in the rock treatment of Frank Zappa: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5QGRhIe4Ro" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãJohn Cage is that any sounds can become music - including the sounds that we associate with silence, a pause.  The only sounds in this composition are the ambient noise that the spectators and artists themselves accidentally emit: the creaking of chairs, coughing, the rustling of clothes.  Due to this (according to Cage's idea), a person begins to listen more attentively and more consciously, without relying on the familiar sound aesthetics. <br><br><h2>  The oldest melody on earth </h2><br>  This is probably the oldest musical composition created by man (and has survived to the present day).  This midi version, of course, does not give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow the anthem could actually sound - the melody on the tablet is given in the most general terms and there is no exact indication of the rhythm in which it should be played. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Brvy4BbK2ZQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2014/07/the-oldest-song-in-the-world.html">This is a ritual hymn</a> , which is more than 3,400 years old - in the 50s it was found on one of several clay tablets dating from the 14th century BC. <br><br>  The cuneiform deciphered on the tablet in 1972 ‚Äî Anne Draffkorn Kilmer of the University of California did it.  In the first half of the plate notes are <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ask-history/what-is-the-oldest-known-piece-of-music">recorded musical composition</a> , the second - instructions on how best to play it on an instrument resembling a nine-string lyre. <br><br>  The Hurritan hymn to the goddess Nikkal in the arrangement of the composer Michael Levy for a solo lyre: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBhB9gRnIHE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Since then, the melody has been played on various instruments, from the lyre to the synthesizer.  As in fact, it sounded, nobody knows, because the rhythmic structure of the composition remains unknown. <br><br>  This discovery gave rise to many others - for example, if the transcript of the record is correct, then the seven-seven diatonic scale, which underlies the modern musical harmony, already existed.  Accordingly, the musical notation, which we use now, in one form or another was known to the ancient Sumerians.  Previously it was believed that the modern diatonic scale appeared a thousand years later. <br><br><h2>  The world's largest musical instrument </h2><br>  The Great Stalacpipe Organ is located in the Luray Caves in the USA.  It was created by mathematician Leland W. Sprinkle in the mid-50s ‚Äî he processed hundreds of stones and attached a hammer to each one, which he connected with wires from a console specially created for this organ from the Klann Organ Supply Company.  The game of this organ is audible throughout the cave - about 14 square kilometers. <br><br>  The sound of the organ is somewhat similar to a xylophone.  The natural sound background of the cave - the hum and drops of water hitting stones and water surface - is also part of the music that creates an otherworldly atmosphere.  For example, this is how the Moonlight Sonata sounds like a cave organ: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HsKUUn29tSs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h2>  Singing roads </h2><br>  In the world there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_road">eight singing roads</a> - in Denmark, Japan, South Korea, USA, Ukraine, Taiwan, China and San Marino. <br><br>  They act according to a similar principle - due to the application of special convex markers or grooves, the road or its segments cause vibration, which is transmitted through the wheels to the car body and sounds like a melody.  To recognize it, you need to go at a certain speed. <br><br>  So sounds one of the musical sections of the road in Japan: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AF9DYjkHXAE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The first musical road, Asphaltphone (Asphaltophone), was created by Danish artists in 1995 - they applied two parallel strips of convex markers of different shapes to the coating at certain intervals.  In Japan, this idea came by chance - one of the workers of the bulldozer made several grooves in the asphalt and realized that, depending on the depth of the grooves and their length, the body of the car could produce sounds of different tonality. <br><br>  In South Korea, the musical road operates according to a similar principle, but it has another goal - it does not entertain tourists, but is designed to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Webcast/story%3Fid%3D3931873%26page%3D1">distract</a> drivers and prevent them from falling asleep at the wheel.  Usually those and other roads (with markers and grooves) sound best at a certain speed - about 40-50 km / h. <br><br>  Even more similar stories (and completely different, but also related to the world of sounds) can be found in Sam Harnett and Chris Hoff's <a href="https://soundcloud.com/worldaccordingtosound/tracks">World According to Sound</a> micro Podcast. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Interesting about the sound from our "World Hi-Fi":</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5589.html">Tools that did not become mainstream: a wheel lira, a harp and a musical saw</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5556.html">You never dreamed of, or 5 unusual versions of well-known songs</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5452.html">Friday format: How digital money ‚Äúsounds‚Äù</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4960.html">Journey inside the body</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5557.html">"Wall": remember the legendary album Pink Floyd</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5118.html">"Hear past the ears": unusual ways of perceiving sound</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5293.html">Rain, clank armor and liquid metal: how sound is created for the movie</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/410897/">https://habr.com/ru/post/410897/</a></p>
