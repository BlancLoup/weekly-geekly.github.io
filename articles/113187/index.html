Because this buyer is ready to give money to the store. <br>  And he expects a proper attitude. <br><br>  And how unpleasant it is when a shop treats you like an annoying fly that you want to get rid of quickly.  Just bring the goods, take the money and quickly dump.

      It would seem that any online store is created in order to <b>sell</b> .  In order to earn money that the buyer pays for the goods. <br><br>  However, in reality, there are very few online stores that treat a customer not as a cashier in a grocery store in the distant 80-90s, but so that this client wants to use the services of this store in the future, plus he should recommend shop to your friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will give a few examples.  The names of the stores basically do not call. <br><br>  1. Decided to try Arduino.  Found a store specializing in this subject. <br>  Made an order through the site.  2 days silence.  No call, no letter. <br>  I thought that the site was dead and made an order in another store.  From there I got a call and I arranged the next day. <br>  On the third day at work, I sit in a meeting, a call.  I pick up the phone, and from there, in an impudent tone - ‚ÄúHello?  This courier, I will be with you in 20 minutes. ‚Äù <br>  ... <br>  He didn‚Äôt even try to apologize, didn‚Äôt introduce himself, didn‚Äôt warn in advance that he would come today, just put before the fact.  For some reason I thought it was a courier calling from the second store.  Spravshivayu "and what shop?".  He thought hard, then rustled pieces of paper, somewhere apparently read and called the name of the very first store, which was silent for 3 days.  I swore and went to meet.  In the second store order canceled. <br><br>  2. I was looking for a keyboard.  In the market found several stores.  Chose from them the best rated with a reasonable price.  Ordered through the site. <br>  An hour later, a polite girl called me, clarified the order, cost, date and time of delivery, asked if there was a need for delivery. <br>  On the day of the order in the morning came the text message ‚ÄúYour courier Alexander.  You will have it in 2 hours. ‚Äù  After 2 hours came the courier, I paid. <br><br>  Where do you think I will make a purchase next time without hesitation?  What shop will I recommend to friends? <br>  What store will I write a large detailed positive feedback? <br><br>  Dear owners of online stores, fight for the customer, win it, make him unobtrusive signs of attention.  It will pay off many times when it comes to you once or twice or ten times, it will bring friends and acquaintances with you, leave feedback on specialized sites, etc. <br><br>  If you accept the order through the site, send him an automatic letter, but ALWAYS call the customer to confirm the order, cost, position, availability and delivery.  This will not only show attention to the customer, but also save him and, most importantly, his time and money, if on the day when the courier wants to come without warning, the buyer suddenly does not have the right amount with him or he doesn‚Äôt have it at all. <br>  With these simple actions you will significantly increase the conversion of your store, because  courier will only leave for confirmed addresses.  Of course, there are cases when confirmed orders fly at the last moment, but this is already the cost of production. <br><br>  In addition, any small change brought as a gift to the order (whether it is a branded pen, a discount card, a calendar card or a catalog of goods) will significantly increase the degree of user satisfaction from your purchase.  And who knows, maybe in the evening this buyer will open this catalog and there he will see what interests him.  And again, he will order this product from you, and will not look for other stores, because he already knows your service, he knows you, he trusts you. <br><br>  There was a case: I ordered it from an online tire store.  I don‚Äôt remember the details of the order, but what I remember for a long time is that when the courier arrived, he put on white gloves, packed each tire into an individual package, brought the tires into the apartment and handed me a discount card with a check by 5%, corporate calendar and pen.  And all this was accompanied by good and polite communication. <br><br>  I was amazed.  Never before have I come across a similar service.  And it pounded into my memory for a long time.  Since then, I have repeatedly made purchases from them and have always been satisfied with the quality of service. <br><br>  Sale - this is not only the fact of making an order and delivery by courier.  This is the whole story of winning customer loyalty to the store.  And it begins with a call from a polite and courteous manager to the buyer to confirm the order and clarify details, followed by the order tracking manager and completes all the quality and punctual work of the courier.  And gifts, a thing, though not mandatory, but this is the same cherry in the cake, which finally fixes a positive impression of purchase in your store. <br><br>  Moreover, if the cake itself (service) turned out to be moldy, then no cherry would help him. <br><br>  By caring for customers today, you provide yourself with customers in the future. <br><br>  I wish high sales good online shopping <br>  and good stores to all customers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113187/</a></p>
