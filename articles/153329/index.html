We promised you to consider the following types of resources: <br><br><ol><li>  Information resource </li><li>  Selling resource </li><li>  Resource accompanying your project </li><li>  All options or a combination of any of the two above. </li></ol><br>  And today it was the turn to talk about the second type of resource, namely, the selling resource. <a name="habracut"></a>  As last time, we will touch on three aspects:

    <ol><li>  Lead collection optimization - you can already register on your site.  But to encourage users to do this more often - and there is an optimization of the collection of leads.  To do this, there are techniques that we continue to share with you today. </li><li>  Optimization of the sales funnel - from the moment of registration until the moment of purchase your client <br>  goes through a certain sequence of actions and states that <br>  are called "sales funnel."  Make it so that the client rolls over it like a five year old. <br>  the kid is trumpet in the aqua park - with enthusiasm and songs - our task. </li><li>  Chains of automatic distribution - imply a well-thought-out strategy for letters that the client begins to receive from the day of registration.  As a rule, it is encrypted in the form x + 1, x + 7, x + 14.  Where x = day of registration.  Mailing chains are an important part of the sales funnel. </li></ol><br>  Selling sites - this is the element of e-commerce.  To be more precise - e-trade and e-marketing.  Since I had to talk about it, e-commerce is an economic sphere ‚Äúin general‚Äù, which, in addition to the two elements listed above, that is, online commerce and online marketing itself, includes electronic capital flow, electronic money and various other market manifestations. , migrated to online.  So, this topic is still very big and controversial.  And it is controversial because the same method can work for one resource and be useless for another.  Most often, you also need to think through a combination of elements in order to achieve the desired result.  Therefore, we apologize in advance to the reader for the rather superficial nature of our article.  However, we hope it will still be useful.  So. <br><br><h4>  Selling resource </h4><br>  Your goal is to sell.  To put it more broadly, collect leads and run them through a sales funnel.  Neither the news nor the informative component should go on their own.  You are not engaged in the spread of brand awareness (brand awareness) or its promotion (PR).  Your goal is sales.  You can be: <br><br><ol><li>  Online store </li><li>  Software maker selling on-premise over the Internet </li><li>  Service provider selling services via the Internet (like <a href="http://unisender.com/ru">Unisender</a> ) </li></ol><br><h5>  Lead collection optimization for you: </h5><br><ol><li>  Make a purchase, use the service or download the trial version of the product is impossible without registration. </li><li>  Conveniently customize your purchase using various payment methods.  The client can leave the site without registering, without finding a payment method that is familiar to him. </li><li>  Offer a monthly payment for a service or service.  The client can more easily decide on the first purchase, if the payment is broken monthly. </li><li>  Make the registration process as simple and easy as possible, ‚Äúpay and roll.‚Äù  Collect only the mail and the name - then specify everything else. </li><li>  Make extensive use of advertising on search engines and on various resources.  Use the right keywords and queries.  If you sell something, and at the same time you are engaged in catching the lead only on your site, it means that you are doing something wrong. </li><li>  Clients who will come to your website from external resources should fall on well-designed grounding pages.  If a person is looking for shoes, and you land it on the page of summer shoes - you have lost it, and you spent your budget on advertising.  Think over the strategy of ‚Äúsearch keywords‚Äù - ‚Äúadvertisement / banner‚Äù - ‚Äúgrounding page‚Äù.  Make a lot of grounding pages - it will be good for both organic search and lead conversion (turning a site visitor into a lead).  Check to <br>  the pages worked - if they had a high bounce rate (clicked and left) - change the page. </li><li>  Every time test, what is the return on advertising here or there.  Where it is small - find a way to increase returns or immediately leave the resource.  Save the budget - you still need it.  Look for a marketer who bargains for each of your advertising worthless, knocking out the best conditions for placement. </li><li>  You can use the techniques offered by us in the previous post for an information resource, however - do not get carried away.  Remember that if you set a goal - "selling resource", you must strictly follow it, not being distracted by games and gingerbread.  If any other method that you add to the list can help sell by 3%, and by 70% help in issuing (SEO optimization), it means that you are not selling, but doing work <br>  for your SEO specialist. </li></ol><br><h5>  Sales Funnel Optimization: </h5><br><ol><li>  Quick and easy registration </li><li>  ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button within one mouse scroll step </li><li>  One page - one action.  Do not do a lot of cross-references of one selling page. <br>  on the other. </li><li>  Convenient interface checkout. </li><li>  Working phone or chat support.  Quick response.  Goodwill </li><li>  Discount calculator inside the checkout interface. </li><li>  Chains of letters are sent only on a segmented base and lead the customer to a new purchase.  If they do not lead him to this - change tactics, change leads, change advertising platforms. </li></ol><br><h5>  Automatic Email Chains: </h5><br><ol><li>  After a single purchase, many stores are ready to litter mail and telephone with daily assortment letters and tips in the style of "perhaps you will be interested."  Immediately not.  This is a good recipe for losing leads. </li><li>  Segment customers - who made one purchase recently, made one purchase a long time ago and at a meeting, made more than one purchase, make purchases regularly.  Think of a chain - content, regularity, depending on these indicators.  Regularly adjust, depending on the reaction of customers.  The purpose of the chain varies greatly depending on the segment - to drive the customer away through the sales funnel or ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù the cold leader so that the sales department has already worked with him. </li><li>  Ideally, your every newsletter should be a sale.  However, if you keep all this in your head, you can lose people.  Inform about the assortment and discounts, be necessary - use other tips that we gave you in previous posts for the compilation of mailings.  Once again: it all depends on the segment.  The segment of regular customers can really make a purchase after each mailing, therefore the mailing should be appropriate for them.  The ‚Äúcold‚Äù segment, to which you are very violet, your newsletters can ‚Äústir up‚Äù or, on professional slang, ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù, in order to transfer it to the sales department. </li><li>  Make mailing event, about stocks and sales. </li><li>  Do mailings rarely, briefly.  Your goal is not to create a super-beautiful letter, but to make a sale. </li><li>  Buttons and links inside the letter, the grounding page - everything is subject to the same goal: what you are selling. </li></ol><br><h5>  Operation check </h5><br>  Being engaged in the selling site, constantly check what you have going on with the marketing budget spent on advertising.  This is done simply: you spent on the announcement of rubles.  A person has come to you.  It gave F leads.  It is enough just to calculate how much 1 lead cost you and how wisely you spent the money.  And the second point - check how many people come to your site, which pages attract attention, how effectively visitors turn into leads.  This must be done constantly, because constancy is one of the important engines of success in business.  Therefore, excuse me for repeating this too often in this paragraph - constantly check how things are going and constantly take steps to increase the effect of your efforts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153329/</a></p>
