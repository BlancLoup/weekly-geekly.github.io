  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[Female look] Review Highscreen Omega Prime Mini: a smartphone with five colorful panels included</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the past couple of years, I have always been amazed at how smartphone manufacturers chase down the cores and gigahertz of processors and other very specific parameters.  At the same time, completely ignoring the maiden part of the consumer market, which wants to present itself with a woman‚Äôs beloved (or feminine?) Smartphone.  What comes to mind is the mini-line La Fleur from Samsung.  But when 7,000 rubles (~ $ 218) are demanded for the Samsung Galaxy S Duos La Fleur, and beside them on the shelf there are not very design reject models of B-brands for 4,000 rubles (~ $ 125) with similar (or even better) characteristics , certain thoughts will not get off.  In general, being a girl interested in mobile themes, I could not get past the new Highscreen Omega Prime Mini.  For those who regularly complain about the lack of information to kata, I present: 4.3 inches, qHD, Qualcomm MSM8225Q, five excellent multi-colored interchangeable panels in the kit and a price of 7,490 rubles (~ $ 234). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1b/90d/2df/c1b90d2df0e27a69f9f30f21adbe4f75.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I will allow myself some more girlish lyrics, so if you want to ‚Äúimmediately to the point‚Äù, skip this paragraph with bold.  So, I was always saddened by announcements of smartphones, where a picture was attached with a photo of a model in different color cases.  You look at such a placer-rainbow and rejoice, at first.  Then in the harsh reality you choose a single color, and if you find alternative covers, then with great difficulty.  At best, if the model is from a major manufacturer and in addition is interesting to third-party suppliers of the very covers.  Alas, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcomplete assorted panels has not received wide distribution - except for the Sony Ericsson Xperia X10 mini, nothing particularly worthy and you will not remember.  1998 and the Nokia 5110 do not count - because we are talking about a set of "out of the box."  Earlier, I saw Highscreen models from the Highscreen Omega Prime and the XL ending with black / white / light green covers in the kit, but the diagonal is 4.7 or 5.3 inches, respectively, which does not appeal to me very much.  Although, judging by my observations, many girls find it convenient to have a conversation, holding the smartphone by the ear with two hands.

    <h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The box of eco-friendly recycled cardboard is small but high.  Immediately it is clear that here "not everything is so simple."  A headset, a microUSB cable, a charging unit, an instruction manual and a guarantee are nothing special, both in terms of set and quality (rather, this refers to the headset). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/148/bfa/267/148bfa267b559359751dec61c7a38edf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b28/c89/74a/b28c8974a0df7e7ad947c7ede8c5163a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08b/81d/367/08b81d3679f95c0414de1f13d95b36ae.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sockets </h4><br>  Saying about all the covers in general will not work, which is good, there is a complete order with a variety of not only colors, but also surface textures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7e/b77/fe9/a7eb77fe94898a2640c85022cb4f3452.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab9/c50/54c/ab9c5054cc3a93660891aa8b7193708d.jpg"><br><br>  I already wrote in the announcement that I was somewhat alarmed - three out of five panels were made by applying paint (as I understand it, in a couple of layers) on white plastic.  After almost a week and a half, this fact does not bother me anymore, because the coating is of high quality, there are no hints of a tendency to "peeling". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/814/7d8/7db/8147d87dbceecb7c549e6a108c92bc09.jpg"><br><br>  Two of these three covers, red and orange, are additionally covered with a glossy layer, which also has a positive effect on protection against "peeling". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f0b/514/85a/f0b51485a3b5d8295ca975f20f345d03.jpg"><br><br>  In general, I liked these glossy covers most of all: the colors are very juicy, with such willy-nilly you will not allow yourself to use inferior nail polish.  With the red cover, I was so drawn to stick the Ferrari emblem, because it would look very harmonious here (well, or ‚Äúharmoniously‚Äù). <br><br>  Matte blue cover looks no less cool, but I did not like the "deep" traces of stains after operation.  The situation is better than soft-plastic, but still. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/489/e1b/3e4/489e1b3e4be9cf74567eda00cd242cc9.jpg"><br><br>  In terms of practicality and aesthetics, my favorite is the white cap.  Because instead of the usual white surface there is a wonderful matte pearl finish.  Overflow in the light - my respect, five points.  Plus, marcos are the lowest of all five alternatives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/183/85d/006/18385d0060818f02329798b8bfe26b15.jpg"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt really say anything about the black panel, there is no soft touch plastic, there are some questions about the march. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/edb/e42/618/edbe426186772d46a799025a31e5743f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Design and controls </h4><br>  In my opinion, a 4.3-inch diagonal seems optimal for a not-too-large smartphone.  On the 4-inch Highscreen Spark I was not very comfortable to ‚Äúsurf‚Äù, and the 4.5-inch Highscreen Omega Q still seemed large.  In terms of numbers, dimensions look like this: 126.3 x 62.9 x 7.8 mm and 107 grams of weight.  I summarize, the smartphone has a thin profile, and in terms of weight it does not seem to be a feather at all, although the palm is not heavy.  That is, when a smartphone with 4.7-5 inches weighs about 120 grams, it seems to me to be too toy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a1/b85/135/4a1b85135c8c8dd262b625b97e5cef7b.jpg"><br><br>  I had serious concerns about the quality of the assembly, I mean, the fit of the covers under the case.  In Highscreen Omega Prime creaks and backlash were attached in the kit, which I really did not want to find in the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini.  The disappointment did not come, the panels are very tightly fitted and in no way prone to making extraneous sounds or reeling.  At first, I was embarrassed by the complete absence of recesses for prying covers.  It turned out that they are not needed, the panels are perfectly hooked and easily removed on absolutely any part that you will meet infrequently.  With grief, I remember a nail broken in an unequal fight with a Highscreen Alpha R cover. <br><br>  A set of sensors and other elements from the front side is standard, although there was still room for one zest.  Instead of another variation on the theme of the three icons under the screen, there is only a small circle and two points on either side of it.  Yes, yes, just like in Highscreen Boost 2. It looks <s>stylish</s> outside the box, I really liked it.  The backlight could be brighter, but I like it even more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/fe5/0b3/0e5fe50b3d73705be0cf20afc8cdf86f.jpg"><br><br>  The location of the buttons is the best possible.  I do not know from what considerations in smartphones of any diagonal (especially 5-inch) the power button is placed on top.  In Highscreen Omega Prime Mini, the keys are positioned on the sides and at such a height that they are ‚Äúunder the fingers‚Äù of both right-handers and left-handers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/512/f54/7fe/512f547fe0c9c7f2fe7ebd29ce090f3c.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom we see a microphone, at the top - audio output and microUSB connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/354/ee9/77e/354ee977e74d62e40b705d9464adcac3.jpg"><br><br>  The lens on the back side did not bulge much, with a concise flash circle, they form an externally aesthetic pair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cc/8f2/7f9/5cc8f27f94e54ff0005345482e1c66c5.jpg"><br><br>  Under the lid is the pain and grief of the smartphone - a non-removable battery.  How it was possible to make a non-removable battery in a powerful smartphone with a battery capacity of 1,600 mAh for me is not clear.  Although this is better than the situation with Highscreen Omega Prime, which, with a removable battery of the same capacity, was ‚Äúpuffed out‚Äù for a Qualcomm MSM8225Q with a 4.5-inch screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92e/7cf/b73/92e7cfb7362c9d270d07a55eb4e34c91.jpg"><br><br>  MicroSIM card slots - two, otherwise it was difficult to expect.  On the left is a slot for a memory card.  I did not immediately understand that the card does not need power in a perfectly sized cavity, but slide it down under the sticker. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  At 4.3 inches with qHD, we get 256 PPI, all just like in the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini.  Grain in the eye does not catch, but zoom when surfing the web can not be avoided, even if only because of the size of the display.  The screen cover is glass, of course, not Gorilla Glass.  I note that by default a ‚Äúworking‚Äù protective film is stuck to the surface. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt have any complaints about the IPS matrix, it‚Äôs obviously not the cheapest model.  There is no strong interchange of colors, at large angles of inclination only the brightness drops a little.  Not enough oledophobnogo coating, but I met and much more dirty screens of smartphones.  The light sensor is not buggy, I was silent with its decisions a couple of times.  It's great that in the ‚ÄúSleep mode‚Äù settings tab there is the ‚ÄúNever‚Äù item, for some reason it is absent in many smartphones. <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  On the front 2 Mp module, I think, it is not worthwhile to dwell in detail.  And I am not keen on video calls or ‚Äúvisual‚Äù Skype calls.  From the rear it was possible to assume the presence of a 5 megapixel module without autofocus, but nothing happened.  There are 8 megapixels and autofocus.  The quality of the pictures is not even depressing at all and is somewhere above the level of Instagram cameras, whose annoying pixelation is attempted to be hidden by program filters.  Even the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini macro shot is more or less possible, and when looking at the color rendition I didn‚Äôt have the urge to do color correction in Photoshop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/200/66d/042/20066d042ee1fe393d1bc8b301d7a713.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/a66/876/6e7a668761e04f1d7d8751cb9f1e1f42.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecf/aed/304/ecfaed304d69c340f0f328ec4d5a3f1e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81b/880/390/81b880390d635a90e24d6785d754420e.jpg"><br><br>  The shooting application is the standard for Android 4.1, multi-touch zoom is not supported, but on the panel on the right you can get quick access to flash, exposure, white balance and scenario presets of parameters.  In general, if a lady likes to get high-quality photos in front of a mirror, there is more than a wide scope for improving pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b01/d2c/ac9/b01d2cac9002c523fcf8bfb9cf19d67c.png"><br><br><h4>  Performance and system </h4><br>  4 Qualcomm MSM8225Q cores with 1.2 GHz, Adreno 203, 1 GB of RAM and 4 GB of ROM - this is the hardware platform of the smartphone.  Girls will not understand this, because there is enough performance for ‚Äúcontact users‚Äù and 2D kazualok with interest.  This is me to the fact that there is no problem with stability, smoothness and speed.  In general, in this regard, I liked the Qualcomm MSM8225Q even on previous Highscreen smartphones.  Now that I didn‚Äôt like it, the most budget-friendly 4-core in the Snapdragon S4 line doesn‚Äôt color the model much from the point of view of geeks.  Although there is nothing to curse Highscreen Omega Prime Mini for, after all, a budget smartphone is a budget processor.  In addition, Highscreen still benefits.  Because American Qualcomm instead of Chinese MediaTek is +10 to charisma and -20 comments mentioning Aliexpress. <br><br>  In analyzing the results of benchmarks, I'm not strong, see for yourself what happened with the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15c/d2a/ab0/15cd2aab0ead4bcaf0cc5c7e3d08ac8f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5af/538/f1e/5af538f1ec9399c95ce440ace817b8fa.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aab/060/5bc/aab0605bcdf394d9dccd06e7471ced9e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e83/e43/7f7/e83e437f780fa9950b850b0b71fb1a56.png"><br><br>  But with the games at the smartphone, everything is so wonderful that they even slow down Plants vs.  Zombies 2 smartphones on MTK6589 with Full HD displays will be envied.  The logic at first glance is absent here, because Adreno 203 in theory should be limited to something like Angry Birds, and not ‚Äúblame‚Äù under 35 FPS in Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour.  It's simple - in demanding 3D-games, shader effects are automatically cut down, and the graphics accelerator very quietly prevents the frame rate from dropping to 20 units.  How bad does the graphics look like?  Yes, not really, high PPI "pulls" the picture, on the same Highscreen Omega Q with a larger diagonal (and the same resolution) do not look so beautiful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cae/d09/b44/caed09b444840ffe6a221b7401bbb16c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/b68/971/680b689719f56aea520289800dc273f2.png"><br><br>  Alas, the same interface, which has been slightly modified, as in Highscreen Omega Prime, is not here.  Android 4.1.2 in its pure form, only with Hangouts, a file manager and dedicated shortcuts for activating an access point and running an equalizer.  I would especially note only the 4Sync cloud service client, for the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini, 20 GB of space is issued in a special order instead of the standard 15.  Last week on the Vobis website (owner of Highscreen) I noticed that now something like a card with 64 GB on 4Sync for one year is attached to smartphones.  Personally, I don‚Äôt need such wealth, but if you often exchange ‚Äúheavy‚Äù content, such a ‚Äúbun‚Äù from Highscreen will not hurt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/641/623/1e8/6416231e8c5a585815331edfe14bf3a9.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22f/b50/61d/22fb5061d45190b4ccca547375506dca.png"><br><br><h4>  Autonomous work </h4><br>  341 points in AnTutu Tester - to put it mildly, not the most impressive result.  In everyday work, the smartphone reached the end of the evening if the task set was limited to 40 minutes of music, up to 30 minutes of calls and half an hour of 3G web surfing.  Plus, periodically up to half an hour over Wi-Fi, I go online at work.  I will not complain about the autonomy of the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini, as I have been carrying keys with the SmartPower 2600 mAh (A5) for 600 rubles (~ $ 19) for a couple of months.  A portable miniature battery plus a short cable - and no problem.  For men, this may not be the solution, but the girls carry their smartphones in bags, so nothing prevents the model ‚Äúat rest‚Äù from charging.  And - yes, on ‚ÄúAli‚Äù a similar portable outlet costs something like $ 5-6.  But I am in trouble with orders from China, therefore I overpay at exorbitant prices to save time and nerves :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a3/259/ef6/9a3259ef646bad865dd4bfddf20a8b66.png"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  4 GB of memory - this may not be enough, the battery is 1 600 mAh - there is a reason to run from the outlet to the outlet (which I successfully avoided).  Qualcomm MSM8225Q - and therefore, problems with playing Full HD video.  I don‚Äôt want to bring in the advantages of things like a normal screen, quite a decent camera, high-quality build and other things, without them a female audience is generally difficult to conquer.  Although by and large, the smartphone is bisexual, there are no clumsy appliqu√©s, flowers, even the pink cover is gone.  But when I look at the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini, I can safely imagine it organically looking in my hands, and I will equally recommend the model to my friends.  Because I don‚Äôt see a single brand of such ‚Äúcare for the beautiful‚Äù with a lot of caps, and these caps are of a very high level. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202458/</a></p>
