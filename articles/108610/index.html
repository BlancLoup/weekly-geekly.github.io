The publication does not disclose its informants, but rather confidently reports that Google has offered $ 4 billion to the current owners of the Twitter service.  It is worth recalling that earlier this year a similar proposal had already been made, but then it was about the amount of about 2.5 billion.  The Twitter management responded then that there could be no question of selling a service for such a ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù amount.  Well, in the light of the ever-growing popularity of the microblogging service, this amount may indeed seem ridiculous. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Just about two years ago, the same Google offered several hundred million dollars, and the prospects for the service were then much more vague than today.  At that time, no one understood how Twitter was going to become profitable, and the resource management did not say anything intelligible about it, getting off with rather vague promises.  Of course, without the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmonetization, without the 500 million users that Twitter has now, there could be no question about billions of dollars.

      By the way, then, two years ago, some experts believed that Twitter was at the peak of popularity, and soon this popularity would begin to fade.  The management quickly found a way out - contracts were immediately signed with Google and Microsoft, according to which Twitter was definitely integrated into Google and Bing.  It is interesting that corporations not only did not take money from Twitter, but also paid about 16 million dollars each. <br><br>  In principle, there is nothing impossible for Google at the moment - the corporation has significant free funds (about 25-30 billion dollars), which the management of the company wants to spend with profit for itself, forcing the money to work, as is customary.  In addition to Twitter, Google also plans to acquire services such as Groupon, a joint shopping service, and Foursquare, which is gaining momentum with geoservice with the function of evaluating bars, restaurants, hotels, cinema and other places. <br><br>  Well, if all three purchases are made, then you can really say that the corporation ‚Äúowns the world‚Äù, more precisely, a very significant part of the Internet sphere.  Let's see what happens.  It's time to buy popcorn. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-offered-to-buy-twitter-for-25-4-billion-sources-2010-11">businessinsider</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108610/</a></p>
