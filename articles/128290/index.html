After futile attempts to transfer to another similar salon, she ran across the same rake.  When we began to compare the facts, I understood what scheme these offices used to get hold of free laboring hands.  By simple calculations, we realized where to go to work, and everything turned out. <br><br>  Based on personal observations, I made my own conclusion about the work of this uncomplicated scheme, according to which even serious companies simply impudently exploit naive and gullible girls and boys, feeding them with a bright rainbow promise.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Everything is just beginning and is unlikely to ever end :) </h4><br>  Any young specialist with a bunch of ambitions and lofty views wants to immediately get a prestigious company in a good position.  Yeah  A representative of a subsidiary or an intelligent psychologist in the central office will quickly roll up such a character and make it sit in front of the monitor without interruption for 8-9 hours a day, sweep the whole day or ride around the city offering services.  In a word, he will surely be told that ‚Äúof course, you will become a master, but you must first go through a probationary period!‚Äù.  ("Wow! Come on, bl ... b ???" Sorry - it was breaking out) <br>  Tetechka or uncle with a clever look in a beautiful suit begins to tell our character how the promotion and blah blah blah happens.  Our hero has no practice, and therefore, he needs to be tightened up at special courses that are only in this company.  In short, our hero, thus, suppress his self-esteem, so that later it would be easier to manipulate and mist his eyes, if only he honestly plowed to the office and sincerely believed in faith ... <br><br><h4>  The scheme of the organization of free work </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c7/893/e87/5c7893e87783883792baa6037808c0eb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  So let's look at the scheme.  Everything is very simple: an intelligent and cunning employer who knows how to count profits very well hires young and naive talents for a ‚Äúpromising‚Äù job, of which there are a dime a dozen for this position - yeah.  If you take, for example, my wife, then the salon, from which she successfully dumped, and it is even more profitable to keep beautiful young chicks with sweepers, so that they twirl in front of customers and bring tea, coffee and <strike>dance</strike> .  I am exaggerating: the fact is that the assistant wizard must also do the dirty work, and since there is much more in the ratio of such work, a ‚Äúsweeper‚Äù comes out as a constant.  There will not be the same hair to clean a big guy or an aunt with the same dimensions - not impressionable, and he himself has failed to do it.  Young and naive talent goes to the courses, passes exams, but something is not right ... ‚ÄúYes, there will be a lot of mistakes, it will not work, wait another half a year!‚Äù.  And so year after year the salon has a very respectable appearance (especially from the street through huge glass you can see, watch who walks past the premium and luxury classes), spending much less money than contain, for example, 3-4 masters of 70-100 thousand rubles salary + interest.  It is much cheaper to carry a group of young talents on courses, cheap in terms of their structure, so that they, feeding on ‚Äúprospectives‚Äù and meager wages, continue to honestly continue to plow. <br><br><h4>  How it all ends </h4><br>  If you are a smart and competent comrade, and take everything from life, you will rise, learn, but the further chances of getting a high position are almost zero, since the office has completely different goals.  Well, or just dump or not work with such an office.  And nobody wants to keep competitors - they won't let you in, I mean those who have been sitting in their places for a long time.  Such things probably happen in the design industry (no matter which segment).  Swearing and quarreling with the hacker in the process and at the end (and God forbid you entered into a clumsy contract or did not enter into it at all) are perfectly normal things when you begin to resist and demand, falling under such a scheme.  You are not the first - you are not the last.  Your place will quickly take the same ambitious, which you were until recently. <br>  A big city, a huge number of people who want to succeed, so the traffic of such characters is provided - not you, but different. <br>  With such a stream and organization of work, such young talents are hack-catchers with a kind of small battery with a very cheap, but high-quality and fresh directed charge.  While the charge is fresh, full of energy and looks into a bright future, the owner of this charge, absorbing the rainbow gruel, spends its precious time, exchanging it for vague courses and a penny reward.  Poyuzali, feeding with cheap and low-quality current, and thrown out later. <br><br><h4>  Reasonable Mind </h4><br>  It is clear that somehow you need to identify a similar scheme.  So, it is not so difficult - just ask the question: ‚ÄúCould you show me some living examples that became masters for a certain time (for example, 1 year), working first as an assistant not on recommendation (or <a href="https://habr.com/blogs/freelance/127749/">as an acquaintance</a> )?‚Äù .  If they start to play up, give vague answers, offer to read the site and other nonsense, you can safely turn around and leave.  The cap already hints that in our country this way it is accepted: freebies, cheap streaming young work, basically a very mediocre attitude towards young personnel, wage delay, zero business ethics, and so on, so you need to go down to the ground and ... <br>  In other words, you need to be more diplomatic when applying for a job.  After all, all these beginnings are, of course, investments in oneself, and then they should be justified later.  Otherwise you will owe yourself, this is wrong.  Therefore, you just need to count, communicating with the sane employer, and not just another freeloader, to sketch an action plan, and all the statements of the personnel specialist or representative should be supported by concrete evidence. <br><br>  By the way, about the courses with education, I thought up something interesting for a long time, what the story will be about in the next issues.  I remember about other posts.  All will be.  It quickly matured here, so I decided to post it. <br>  Before communication. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128290/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128290/</a></p>
