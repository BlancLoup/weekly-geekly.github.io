  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Megaphone breaks in half: the second SIP-client - "Megaphone-Connect"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The secret service under the Queen reported that six months ago, the Megafon-Connect client was being developed, which is used in the <a href="http://samara.megafon.ru/services/440/">My Globus</a> <strong>regional service</strong> (Megafon-Volga region).  The release took place a couple of days ago, here is the <a href="http://www.volga.megafon.ru/news/10538/">official news</a> . <br>  Imagine there may be <strong>two different</strong> SIP clients in MegaFon.  At the same time. <br>  On the background of the fact that Megafon from July 1, 2009 merged into one single JSC, it is not entirely clear why the company has two customers and where the management is looking (in general, if it is centralized).  While you think about it, I‚Äôm criticizing the client here, which, by the way, can be downloaded from <a title="Megafon Connect Client" href="">this link</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Distribution weighs 2.7 MB.  Oh, that's not a 22.4 MB Multifone. <br>  When installing, KIS told me that the program does not have a digital signature and it has a high hazard rating.  Well, so be it, you have to trust the program from the Megafon site.  But the lack of a digital signature (that of Connect, that of Multifon) is a bad tone. <br>  The program was quickly installed and quickly started. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f80/7f3/145/f807f31452d5d8334d7cd2886f705b90.png"><br>  No prompts, what name, phone number and password should I enter, no.  Here it is not clear whether this is a registration, or whether I should have everything already.  But, in fact, everything is already there: the password here is the PUK1 from the SIM card.  Registration in the service "My Globe" occurs after you send "ip" to number 000818 (this is a regional short number for SMS, available only from the Megafon-Volga network).  Name - any.  Mysterious fields of input - in them Punto does not want to change the layout, whatever you do.  Along with the message about the connection of the My Globus service, another SMS falls - about the connection of the ‚Äú <a href="http://samara.megafon.ru/services/393/">Message Manager</a> ‚Äù service.  Initially, it is positioned to send SMS / MMS / FAX from Microsoft Outlook with payment from the current mobile account.  In this case, it seems that the sending of SMS messages in the client is ensured through this service. <br>  After entering the program, it <strong>suddenly</strong> wants to be updated again, although the distribution kit has just been downloaded from the official site: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d85/513/3aa/d855133aa5a74080ff6f83e0a022d24b.png"><br>  As you can see, the final distribution is already 3.2 MB. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd6/835/8d6/fd68358d65a0cc2f7d48dc26317ef350.png"><br>  As a result, the update was loaded, but it was not installed.  I left the client and re-entered, but the version remained the same.  Manually looking for where the update was downloaded and installed itself was the last thing I wanted. <br>  Let's look at the main window: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f74/246/949/f74246949f310d1070763c5b7dcb2a45.png"><br>  In principle, everything is nice and clear, except for the places that I have marked with questions.  The radio signal icon indicates that I have wi-fi or WiMax enabled, but this is not the case.  The icon with the message shows ‚Äúthe current state of connection to the SMS service of Megaphone‚Äù.  It is not entirely clear what the state is now.  An icon with an eye - a switch for updating the balance and checking the connection to the network - firstly, partially duplicates the first one, and secondly, it is not clear why someone wants to turn off balance updates.  The information at the bottom of the window is about 39 MB of incoming traffic and 10 MB of outgoing is incorrect - the program simply reads all traffic through the network connection that it uses. <br>  Of course, you could bring screenshots of other windows, but believe me, nothing worthwhile, especially not many. <br><br>  The program has less functionality: at least, there are no video calls.  Unfortunately, for some reason I can not call - when you press the call button, nothing happens - but you send an SMS to yourself.  SMS Writing Window (as seen, bad end line break): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/507/32e/557/50732e557da4a73638a6f9461c0a4971.png"><br>  SMS came from a number starting at 501, and then - a 10-digit number starting at eight.  Strange system, not for humans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9f3/db5/cc5/9f3db5cc559c274641e2e791e55021a7.png"><br>  The program settings are poor, there is no help, the window about the program does not give anything: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49b/e0a/86b/49be0a86bb6e746b9af32fd956353220.png"><br>  <strong>Cost:</strong> <br><blockquote>  Until September 1, 2009, the connection to the My Globus service is free of charge. <br>  Charging of outgoing calls occurs according to the cost of outgoing calls to your tariff plan, on which the My Globus service is connected.  Tariffing of outgoing SMS messages occurs according to the Message Manager service. <br>  The cost of sending messages from a personal computer when using the service: <br><ul><li>  SMS message - 1 rub .; </li><li>  MMS message - 3 rub. </li></ul></blockquote><br>  <strong>Verdict</strong> : the functionality is poor, again, you can use it, but there‚Äôs no special meaning - there are no advantages over the same Multifon. <br>  <strong>Some details of the development of Megaphone customers</strong> <br>  According to some rumors, ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/telecom/65976/" title="Multiphone">Multifon</a> ‚Äù is part of the IN-platform inTelegent, bought by MegaFon to provide convergent services back in 2007.  The platform itself is still not really integrated into the network, and according to some data, the supplier‚Äôs company no longer exists in nature ( <a href="http://www.intelegentnetworks.com/">www.intelegentnetworks.com</a> ). <br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/bartman/" class="user_link">BArtMan</a> corrects me: this company is <a href="http://www.teligent.ru/">Devoteam Telecom</a> . <blockquote>  They were recently bought by a large French cartel, but three or four years ago, these guys won a project in Megafon only because of the presence of a large development team in Russia. </blockquote><br>  Thus, the refinement of the client to the existing realities of the market is significantly hampered, with which, apparently, the poor functionality of the client is connected. <br>  The hasty publication of a client on the company's website seems to be directly related to the rush that has risen around Mr. Yermakov‚Äôs presentation on the situation with VoIP in Russia. <br>  Perhaps Megafon Connect was developed under the same platform, although there are enough differences.  I am sure we will see an interesting development of this story. <br>  I will be very grateful if Megaphone staff somehow comment on the situation.

      <strong>UPD:</strong> curiosity took over, and I reinstalled Megaphone-Connect: this time it was updated. <br>  Call here "it seems you can already do it" - the button works, but when you try to call any number, the invariable message appears: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/853/0ab/81a/8530ab81ab43f5351221ccb36621d9fa.png"><br><br>  A new feature has appeared - email checking: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a60/145/c45/a60145c4589fe8f1cfc20dc941001c52.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91b/e2e/a79/91be2ea79a65911f2fd3517fa02ff5a9.png"><br>  I entered my settings (by the way, popular servers can be selected from the list), and for some reason the program started downloading <strong>all my messages</strong> from the server, even with the Spam folder (this is not the final result yet): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02c/137/959/02c137959071fa29926c2a799e00e87a.png"><br>  Strange program. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66007/</a></p>
