We have released a new book of an extraordinary person - <a href="http://www.goldenkrishna.com/">Golden Krishna</a> , currently working in Google. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/303344/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81c/771/699/81c771699a044313b61b96ab6fddc606.jpg" align="left" alt="image"></a>  The author of this book makes us take a critical look at the annoying on-screen world and demonstrates how to create advanced technologies without digital interfaces. <br><br>  In his clever, harsh and often hilarious, critical manner, Golden suggests amazing ideas that allow one to step out of the screen plane and achieve only fruitful innovations with the help of just three principles.  If you are working in the engineering field or simply fear the imminent domination of gadgets, this book will be interesting and informative for you.  You will see for yourself that you can and should do without traditional interfaces.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Books in the 21st century have long been a relic of the past.  Every technology book buyer should be aware of this, especially since my book is not at all like the Great American Romance.  It is about theory in technology.  About interfaces.  Do you already regret buying it? <br><br>  Well, maybe you bought the book because it is an expanded version of one of the most popular design articles in the last 10 years.  You probably heard my abstracts at the South by Southwest conference, sometimes called the best for the year.  And, probably, you just did not see about such comments on the Internet: <br><br>  <b>"He's just a clown."</b> <br><br>  This is a real comment on the Internet about me, and you know, perhaps to some extent I am a clown.  Not only because of my love for polka-dot patterns, but also because I'm standing here, I explain that the BEST INTERFACE IS BLA-BLA-BLA, and even strictly speaking, I incorrectly use the word ‚Äúinterface‚Äù. <br><br>  The common meaning of the word ‚Äú <i>interface</i> ‚Äù has been transformed from its vocabulary definition (way of interacting with some things, such as a door knob) into an abbreviated name of the <i>graphical user interface</i> (a rectangle with buttons and icons that you see on the computer screen). <br><br>  Bookworm and lexicographers, I warn you right away: in this book, the word " <i>interface</i> " will often mean a <i>graphical user interface</i> , following a general tendency to abbreviations. <br><br>  See for yourself.  When the respected media company MIT Technology Review published an article titled ‚ÄúThe Story of Two Newspaper Interfaces,‚Äù it was not about the interface of a regular folding paper newspaper, but about the graphical user interfaces of newspaper websites. <br><br>  Another example is when the Christian Science Monitor, which has been published in print for over 100 years, published an article entitled ‚ÄúNetflix presents a new and improved interface for watching television‚Äù 2.  It was not about the remote control interface, but about the new graphical user interface, which was installed after the software update. <br><br>  Or when the Washington Post published ‚ÄúApple TV: Simplified Interface, Easy Media Access via iCloud‚Äù 3.  The article was not about a new type of interaction with equipment, but about a new type of graphical user interface. <br><br>  That, in general, is why you have never seen the billboards of the Lowe hardware store with the slogan ‚ÄúOur new door handles are a real breakthrough in interfaces!‚Äù. <br><br>  Finish with semantics.  This book is about the idea.  Call for immediate action.  One of the most revolutionary inventions in the last 50 years will bring us to trouble. <br><br>  Another real comment from the Internet: <br><br>  <b>"The name says it all."</b> <br><br>  I was hardly the first to declare this.  As you will soon see, visionary people like Mark Weiser, Alan Cooper, Don Norman noticed these ‚Äúbells‚Äù before me. <br><br>  My view of history is replete with tragic episodes, mad love, l'Amour fou.  The whole world loves graphical user interfaces, which led us to the alarming state of things: the love of digital interfaces is getting out of control.  Our obsession with them destroys the future of innovation. <br><br><h5>  UX ‚â† UI </h5><br><h5>  I make interfaces because this is my job, mate! </h5><br>  Yes <i>, we are rolling into the abyss, but we are not to blame.</i> <br><br>  Look at this job list.  No, these are not specially selected offers of small minor companies that are doomed to failure anyway.  These are the real, most recent vacancy announcements from the technological elite, successful and technically advanced businesses, from 60 Minutes to Tech Crunch. <br><br>  Lead UX / UI Designer <br>  Amazon Corporate LLC, Seattle, WA <br><br>  UI / UX Designer <br>  Apple Inc., Cupertino, California <br><br>  Head of UX &amp; UI Designer <br>  HP, Sun Valley, California <br><br>  UX / UI Developer <br>  Adobe, San Jose, California <br><br>  UI / UX Designer <br>  Samsung Telecommunications <br>  USA, San Jose, California <br><br>  UX / UI Designer Mobile <br>  applications <br><br>  Dell, Round Rock, Texas <br>  Lead UX / UI Designer <br><br>  GoPro, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, <br>  California <br><br>  UI / UX Designer <br>  Evernote, Austin, TX <br><br>  UX / UI Designer Intern <br>  Pebble, Palo Alto, California <br><br>  I know.  UI and UX are simply the notation (and not the best) of the user interface (User Interface) and the user experience (User Experience).  The recruitment managers, quite possibly, wrote all this with the best of intentions.  But the mixing of two disciplines in the search and hiring of designers played a significant role in the well-established approach to technological experiments;  Yes, and the root of the problems with the widespread screen-oriented approach to design is somewhere nearby.  As a result, we organize a huge part of our life with the help of digital interfaces that require us to touch, hit, hold with two fingers, press buttons, etc., etc., because it is for this that the authors of these interfaces were hired. <br><br>  HP President Meg Whitman states: ‚ÄúWe must continue our innovative developments‚Äù 51.  Amazon President Jeff Bezos says: ‚ÄúWe are developing innovation, building on customer needs and moving in the opposite direction.‚Äù 52  Apple President Tim Cook is convinced: "Innovation occupies an important place in the culture of Apple." <br><br>  However, when you hire someone to design a user interface (UI), you do not get any innovative solutions.  You get more of the visual part, not an improvement in user experience. <br><br>  <b>UI</b> is navigation, subnavigation, menus, drop-down lists, buttons, links, windows, rounded corners, shading, error messages, warnings, updates, checkboxes, password fields, search fields, text input fields, radio buttons, text areas, hover state, selection state, brushing animation, scrolling, mouse clicks, iconography, colors, lists, slide shows, alternative text for the image, icons, notifications, gradients, dialog boxes, carousel, OK / Cancel, etc. etc. <br><br>  <b>UX</b> is people, happiness, problem solving, understanding needs, dedication, performance, entertainment, pleasure, pleasure, soul, warmth, personality, joy, delight, excitement, bliss, euphoria, convenience, charm, magic, productivity, efficiency, and t etc., etc. <br><br>  Once we have mixed these concepts and now, instead of looking for the best, most creative, inventive and successful solutions to the problem, we rush to develop new screens, because it is for this work that we are paid money.  After seeing the problem, we immediately think about the interface.  UX is not associated with people anymore; now it is associated with rectangles with rounded corners and animated scrolling. <br><br>  The time has come when from the best minds of mankind do not require the development of science or flights into space.  Oh no, they work in megacorporations that produce screens and outrun oil companies in terms of profits54 and political influence55.  They fabricate digital billboards disguised as sites and applications that affect your eyes in the hope that you will navigate through all sorts of ads appearing on all your screens. <br><br>  According to Jeff Hammerbutcher, formerly Facebook‚Äôs manager and founder of Cloudera, ‚Äúthe best minds of my generation are looking for ways to get users to click on ads.  Very sad". <br><br>  There is a better way.  There are better ways to use the brain.  Dividing the two professions, we discover new, better functionality.  Unfortunately, some of the elite technology companies themselves complicate life. <br><br>  More information about the book can be found on <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/all/product/horoshiy-interfeys-nevidimyy-interfeys">the publisher's website.</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602153/978549602153_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549602153/978549602153_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  For Habrozhiteley 25% discount coupon - <b>The Best Interface</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303344/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303344/</a></p>
