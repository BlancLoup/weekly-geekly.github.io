      Every single day we face this endless confrontation!  Techies are constantly indignant about the stupidity or uselessness of humanities, humanitarians are trying to defend their need and attack in response.  Of course, there are people who are trying to find a compromise and prove the relevance of both.  But ... the next day everything starts again in a new way. <br><br>  Creating stereotypes and labeling is an excellent mechanism to simplify the reality, allowing not to particularly load the brain.  It is especially simple when reality seems to be dichotomous ‚Äî positive / negative, one‚Äôs own / someone‚Äôs, little / many, etc.  - our case, as you, I hope, understood, is the same. <br><br>  So, is there any meaning in the similar labels of ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù and ‚Äútechie‚Äù?  Are they helpful or vice versa dangerous? <br><br>  PS 1. Anticipating questions: I am well versed in mathematics and IT, while doing music and getting an economic education <br>  2. There are a lot of letters under the cut, so if you want, you can consider me a ‚Äútypical humanist‚Äù <br>  3. Before minus, please first argue my point of view. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The main danger lies in the fact that this text continues to reproduce the stereotype that has already been established, opposing entities.  If you stop talking about it and go about your business - the myth will dissipate and maybe these fictional idiots-humanities will become less.  All of which, I am talking about now, may seem to many not quite obvious, so let's start in order: <br><br>  It is necessary to somehow operationalize the given concepts, to define them.  But, I must say at once, you will not see a single understanding of the problem anywhere. <br><br>  <b>Techie</b> - engineer.  Has the ability to exact sciences, is rational. <br><br>  <b>Humanitarian</b> is a man of art.  Has artistic ability.  Emotional <br><br>  You can often find something like this: <br><br>  <b>Humanitarian thinking is a lack of math.</b>  If you can not solve this difur - you humanities.  The humanities are synonymous with boltology <br><br>  So the defenders of the humanities will immediately recall: <br>  <b>The techie‚Äôs mindset is the inability to express one‚Äôs thoughts.</b>  If you speak badly and cannot write a normal essay, then you are a techie. <br><br>  Looking closely at the definitions of the humanities and techies, you can see that they do not contradict each other. <br><br>  Do you think that I will now say that it is possible to combine both those and other qualities?  Yes, that's right - really possible.  But the fact is that most people manage to combine the lack of both mathematical and artistic abilities.  They cannot, either solve the equation, say or write something beautiful.  Moreover, they do not just cannot do it - they simply don‚Äôt need it.  <b>When you work as a salesman in a shop, a cleaner, a conductor, a security guard, as well as in other 70% of professions, the opposition of the humanities / techie simply does not make sense to you.</b> <br><br>  But all this can be forgiven - all these terms are mundane.  However, this thinking creeps in the academic field: <br>  In most cases, we distinguish humanities, natural and technical sciences.  Here, of course, you can already see something new, but the trace of the stereotype in question is obvious. <br>  What is so bad about this classification, you say? <br><br>  First of all, it does not meet international standards and practices, which prevents the integration of domestic science into the world academic community. <br><br>  The English word "science" in itself, without any prefixes, implies naturalness and empiricality.  It is opposed to the term ‚Äúscience‚Äù - another group of academic disciplines under the general title ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù (triad - philology, theology, philosophy).  Needless to say, in this context, the very phrase ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù is an oxymoron.  So remember!  <b>The humanities do not exist!</b>  You can hear about them only in the post-Soviet space.  In this regard, all sorts of opuses like "I resent!  How can philology and other humanitarian disciplines be considered science? ‚ÄùAre meaningless. <br><br>  Everything would be fine, but some time ago a hybrid of ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù and ‚Äúscience‚Äù - ‚Äúsocial science‚Äù appeared (which led to the fact that just ‚Äúscience‚Äù had to be renamed to ‚Äúnatural science.‚Äù The Soviet tradition does not have such a problem it was - everything ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù was pushed into the category ‚Äúhumanities.‚Äù Meanwhile, the so-called ‚Äútechnical sciences‚Äù in the West are often not considered as sciences, but are simply called ‚Äúengineering‚Äù (some truth are called ‚Äúapplied science‚Äù). <br><br>  As for the "social sciences", among them there is a very large differentiation.  For example, history and law is just at the border between ‚Äúhumanities‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial science‚Äù and often assignment to one category or another will depend on a specific study.  There are such disciplines as economics, which often use a rather complex mathematical apparatus (which, however, rarely take place at the institute), which rather accurately allows one to predict certain phenomena. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion: the</b> division of people into groups of humanities / techies by type of thinking is stupid. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77589/</a></p>
