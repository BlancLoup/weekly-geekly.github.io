  <section class="page js-page"><h1>20 methods for sorting search results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When searching for search results, the task of the search engine is to ensure the maximum match of the words in the search query with the words found on one or another web page or in the text of the links leading to it. <br><br>  Ranking in the search results mostly depends on the indexing of text on the pages of sites, the text of links leading to these pages, as well as on the importance of the site, calculated on the basis of the number of referring pages. <br><br>  However, before being shown in the search results, sites can be rearranged depending on a particular factor.  Here are some of them: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>1. Filtering duplicate (or close to this) content</b> <br><br>  Search engines do not like pages with the same content to overflow with search results, so similar pages can be filtered. <br><br>  <b>2. Removing several relevant pages from the same site from the search results</b> <br><br>  It is not so rare that several pages of the same site are immediately relevant to a search query.  In this case, the search engine can show a link to another page from the same site immediately after the link to the most relevant page, or simply provide an additional link "More results from this site."  It happens that additional results are not displayed at all. <br><br>  <b>3. Personal interests of the user</b> <br><br>  The search engine can rebuild the search results depending on past results and other activity on the Internet of a particular user.  This kind of ranking change is used in the so-called ‚Äúpersonalized search‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>4. The interconnectedness of sites</b> <br><br>  The search engine can rebuild sites depending on the number and quality of links between them. <br><br>  <b>5. Sort by user location</b> <br><br>  It is possible that the user would prefer to see in the search results those sites that are located in his region of residence.  Sometimes users themselves turn on the option to search for sites only from a specific country, sometimes the search engine tries to independently determine the location of the user based on his IP. <br><br>  <b>6. Request language</b> <br><br>  Options restrictions on languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan be set by the user in the browser or through the settings of the search engine;  Sometimes the search engine itself selects the language of the search results depending on the search query, settings, or characteristics of the search results. <br><br>  <b>7. Demographic characteristics</b> <br><br>  When using this method for ranking results, a search engine can take into account such parameters as dislocation, demographic information, information about the groups to which the user belongs. <br><br>  <b>8. Chronological data</b> <br><br>  Sites can be sorted according to the time of creating and modifying pages, the age of links to them, and many other time parameters. <br><br>  <b>9. Thematic similarity</b> <br><br>  Headings, stop words and other text-related parameters are taken into account. <br><br>  <b>10. User interest in commercial information</b> <br><br>  For example, <a href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>  <a href="http://mindset.research.yahoo.com/">Mindset</a> allows the user to sort the search results independently, depending on whether he wants to see information of a commercial or more informative, non-commercial nature. <br><br>  <b>11. The site has a mobile version</b> <br><br>  Microsoft's search can filter out those sites that cannot be displayed on mobile devices (for example, PDAs). <br><br>  <b>12. Accessibility for people with disabilities</b> <br><br>  Google recently launched a <a href="http://labs.google.com/accessible/">specialized search</a> that ranks sites according to their availability for people with disabilities. <br><br>  <b>13. User Attitudes</b> <br><br>  Google can sort pages depending on whether users like them or not. <br><br>  <b>14. Advanced search options and text similarity.</b> <br><br>  Google can rank search results by news, based on the processing and automatic addition of additional parameters to the search query, as well as on the similarity of documents. <br><br>  <b>15. User behavior</b> <br><br>  <b>16. Community Approval</b> <br><br>  The method is based on the opinion of social groups, users of social networks, etc. <br><br>  <b>17. Excess information</b> <br><br>  Filter out redundant information that is cluttering the search results. <br><br>  <b>18. News stories</b> <br><br>  The IBM method allows you to convert search results into news stories that will be revealed on sites that appear in search results. <br><br>  <b>19. Evaluation of relevance based on blog posts, news, etc.</b> <br><br>  The result of the search depends on where the blogs and forums exactly refer to in a given period of time.  Priority is given to the site that has the most current information at the moment. <br><br>  <b>20. Relevance (time factor) and use</b> <br><br>  This method is close to the combination of the previous two.  It involves the grouping of concepts taking into account how they evolved over time and how people influenced these changes. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Remember that the search results that you see are not always the same as other users see. <br><br>  Of course, this is not a complete list of methods for changing the ranking of sites in search results, but the author tried to make it as representative as possible.  Some methods are already in use, some are under development, some will be used in the future, some will never be implemented. <br><br>  Is it possible to make sure that your site holds good positions, even when users are given differently sorted search results?  Will you be able to check your position when using search engines of all methods? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30860/</a></p>
