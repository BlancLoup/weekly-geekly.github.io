Reviews come out irregularly, and the editor is tired of scolding every week about another article not sent to him.  I pulled myself together and surveyed what the blogosphere had said over the past month.  So immediately warn you, the text smells like mold and stale dust.  Not recommended for reading for people with pronounced allergies.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  <strong>Well, well, without him</strong> <br><br>  What do I like Eurovision?  I generally love all the contests.  I like to watch the competition of completely different nations, different cultures.  And I‚Äôm also wondering what they‚Äôll come up with this time, in the three minutes that the song lasts, to attract the attention of the whole of Europe.  Do not listen to great experts who justify their lack of interest in Eurovision by showing bad taste and banalism.  Caesar is Caesar's, and Eurovision is Eurovision.  No one is building this competition on a pedestal of great art, but this must be watched, because it is a cultural event of the whole continent.  And, sitting in the center of Europe (I do not assert it, but people who know geography), it is simply nonsense to turn away disgust from a normal concert.  What, you have so many cultural events in your life, that Eurovision seems to you a small concert in a bar? <br><br>  Danilko aka Serdyuchka blew us the brain as soon as we saw him with a star on his head.  And the Russian-speaking blogosphere is divided into two camps and decides whether this speech is vulgar and insulting to Russia or not.  I think Danilko is an ordinary genius.  What makes you think that a good song should definitely be serious?  The fact that you consider Danilko a transvestite without taste and voice is not his problem, but only yours.  Because it is you who suffer from lack of taste and elementary cultural education.  Regarding the ‚ÄúRush Goodbye‚Äù ... Well-known television and radio host Sergey Stillavin <a href="http://stillavinsergei.livejournal.com/28229.html">campaigns</a> for Serdyuchka not to be invited to corporate parties.  Under the slogan "I ordered Vera to the corporate party - he himself was * &amp; al to his homeland" and "Get out of the Russian scene, you bastard!".  Russians with Ukrainians have always been slightly rabid, are and will be.  Russia will proudly crush everyone with its chauvinistic grandeur, while Ukrainians are no less proud to send everyone.  You would be outraged if Serdyuchka sang Belarash Goodbye?  And me too. <br><br>  <strong>Do blogs!</strong> <br><br>  Do you have a blog?  Do you know English?  Then you should <a href="http://www.dailyblogtips.com/blogging-mistakes-final-list">go to the following link and read</a> about the most common mistakes of blogging.  Collected 48 links to articles about these errors.  Perhaps you should do their translation at your leisure.  Much attention is paid to the choice of hosting and proper SEO.  Another common point is the lack of understanding of the importance of RSS, maintaining too many blogs, proper tagging, use of media content and much more.  For any blogger - mandatory reading. <br><br>  In the meantime, Yandex has launched another toy - the ‚Äú <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/pulse">Pulse of the Blogosphere</a> ‚Äù.  With the help of graphs we are shown the frequency of mentioning a word or expression on blogs for a certain time.  On dirty.ru, a <a href="http://dirty.ru/comments/210720">flash mob was made of it</a> !  Almost hundreds of these graphs: compare love and sex, good and evil, vodka, bears and oil, Putin is ahead of Cthulhu in the frequency of references, and upyachka (we should not rule this word) even here is eating our brain.  In general, while everyone is playing, a useful application of this fun will be invented later. <br><br>  Anton Nosik <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/933907.html">reveals the secrets of the</a> SUP-kitchen about how not to promote provocateurs: ‚Äú <em>Every now and then, Top 30 of Yandex has records that you read, and it becomes embarrassing ‚Äî for the author, for LJ, for the human race ‚Äî such ... or meanness is written there. At the same time, you will look at the discussion in the comments, and it is clear that the commentators of this percent record experienced 70-80% of the same feelings when they met her. You check the links - the same way. People link with the words ‚ÄúNo, well, you must, what an abomination / nonsense / idiocy. "Meanwhile, there is the simplest way to discourage abominations / h</em>  <em>it‚Äôs idiotic and not to promote it by means of Yandex. All that needs to be done is to refer not to the vanity log entry itself, but to its cached copy in Yandex or Google</em> . I‚Äôll add that Yandex "holy watches the tag NOINDEX. Therefore, you can use them. Everything inside NOINDEX does not get into the indexing. <br><br>  And in our Palestine already make up the <a href="http://infopolicy.livejournal.com/52210.html">top 30</a> Belarusian LiveJournal users, of course, using the rating of blogs "Yandex".  Were taken 1280 Belarusian LJ-users, who wrote at least something for some one specific day (for what and why exactly, remains a mystery).  Belarusian means only that they indicated the location of Belarus.  Then check the rating of each in the rating of "Yandex" and the final sort.  The rating, of course, turned out to be quite controversial, but there is no other alternative in Belarus and bloggers were glad at least to such a sign of attention.  We are waiting for when in blog ratings decide to take into account geographic status, then we will find out the most popular blogger in Belarus.  While it is <a href="http://lipkovich.livejournal.com/">lipkovich</a> . <br><br>  In mid-May, the <a href="http://livejournal.ru/">LiveJournal.Ru</a> project started working in test mode.  This is a reference and navigation service designed to help users extract the maximum benefit and pleasure from the information richness of the Russian-language LJ.  The statement of its creators (and this is all the same SOUP) says: " <em>We want to provide regular users and occasional visitors of the LiveJournal server the opportunity to cover LiveJournal with one glance and find out what hundreds of thousands of bloggers are writing about and which records cause the greatest response from millions their readers. On the LiveJournal.Ru server you can find information flows, ratings, directories, search, and other utilities for LiveJournal, the list of which will expand over time, taking into account the wishes of readers and the development of LiveJournal</em> . " <br><br>  <strong>Sex, romance, school ...</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/carians/213764.html">A huge article</a> about sex education and modern ethics: ‚Äú <em>How does an average European decide for themselves questions of sexual propriety. For example, in broad daylight in a city park on the lawn - a couple. Is this decent or not?‚Äù The average European says: indecent! And why? The stereotypical answer is: well, the children are watching! Okay, we‚Äôll go back to the children, and now we‚Äôll change the conditions: not in broad daylight, but in the middle of a white night (somewhere in St. Petersburg or Helsinki). The children are already asleep, but the appearance is beautiful. why indecent? Stereotypical answer: it is nekr</em>  <em>As usual, passers-by are forced to look at this disgrace. Well, an additional question: should we remove everything ugly from the streets, and above all - ugly people? Let them sit at home, damn it! At this stage, the average European‚Äôs explanations will run out of explanations</em> . "  True, many statements and comparisons are very controversial.  For example, the author constantly compares our ethics with the ethics of the indigenous inhabitants of the islands of Oceania.  Although some conclusions seemed to me very interesting.  In any case - you swallow the text immediately, and then you can argue. <br><br>  " <a href="http://agent-sm-it.livejournal.com/42178.html">Note for romantic girls</a> " - a text about sex tourists in Belarus.  I think you understand - be sure to read, especially if you are a romantic girl. <br><br>  I was surprised to find out the second name of the last call - ‚ÄúPedophile Day‚Äù.  On blogs, there was a whole wave of messages, in which the authors reported that they were going to go outside on the day of the last call and collect the harvest of drunk graduates, and some of them graduates.  I do not understand such entertainment, I just excite blogs.  But on this occasion, I still find an <a href="http://kermit73.livejournal.com/654704.html">interesting message</a> .  Many photos of different years from the celebration of schoolgirls in the city of the last bell.  Many in the comments are horrified by what they have seen, others are scolded by the author for exaggerating colors, but it seems to me that this is such an entry into adulthood.  Not with fireworks and fireworks, and drunk on the fountain. <br><br>  <strong>Bronze Estonian chauvinistic dreams</strong> <br><br>  Politics is such an amusing adaptation that diligently creates the illusion of life for us.  A busy life.  Estonia (by population - 151st in the world, by territory - 129th, by GDP - 108th) transfers the burial of Soviet soldiers along with a bronze monument from the city center to a military cemetery.  Russia (by population - 8th in the world, by territory - 1st, by GDP - 9th) is outraged by this development and writing notes of protest.  Well, what about the citizens?  And citizens rage!  Citizens can now namingovatsya fill, fill each other's faces and in every possible way to show their patriotism.  I still understand Russians with Estonians - they have found a reason, but why are our compatriots boorish?  Probably boring.  I really want to shout ‚ÄúFascism will not pass!‚Äù To get into the thick of things.  And then write about it in the newspapers.  Well, at least in ours.  Is it true?  The Estonian blogger <a href="http://drive-alienn.livejournal.com/99334.html">asks</a> : ‚Äú <em>And when the Russian media doesn‚Äôt lie at all, does not distort, does not distort? Are there such bright rays in the dark kingdom? Does it objectively convey to us reports from Georgia, reports about the situation in Ukraine, about the situation in Kyrgyzstan ‚ÄúHow wonderful is everything in the super country Turkmenistan? Many people think that it‚Äôs worth watching the news and they know everything about everything. It‚Äôs not like that. They know exactly what they are told from the screen. For example, they recently approved the program on the resettlement of the Russian-speaking to the territory of Russia from the CIS countries and Pr</em>  <em>Baltic, migration policy, so to speak, well, providing them with financial assistance, everything, and where the suffering came to Russia? Of course, from Kazakhstan, from Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan. Clearly, this should be covered in the media. But the paradox is does the media cover the lonely family who decided to move from Riga to Kaliningrad. The fact that most people rushed from Asian countries are somehow silent about it. But the Baltic family is a nice thing</em> . " <br><br>  <strong>And about death</strong> <br><br>  It is from <a href="http://konkurencya.livejournal.com/7010.html">these entries that</a> I understand the significance of blogs.  The girl bought herself a motorcycle, is happy about this, talks about her meeting with the traffic cop, congratulates her in the comments to the recording, and the next day she breaks up.  And here's a record of a living person, which you read and it seems as if he himself is telling you this, and the people standing next to him seem to have no answer to the topic: " <em>Goodbye, Nadyusha ... I love, I remember ...</em> " <br><br>  <strong>The roughest Lesha of all Khaletskys</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007230601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ23, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287768/</a></p>
