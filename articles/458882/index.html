Briefly about the main thing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Public speaking is a weapon in the battle of conquering minds.  If you are not a conqueror - it is nothing to you.  Otherwise - here are the ‚Äúdrawings‚Äù of this weapon! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everyone decides for himself that the primary thing in a public speech is a presentation or a spoken text.  For example, I almost always start with a presentation, on which I ‚Äúoverlay‚Äù a text.  But I know for sure that even before the presentation and the text you should clearly know the answer to the question: ‚ÄúWhat should listeners do after the performance?‚Äù This is exactly the way!  If you do not find the answer to this question - do not bother with either the presentation or the text.  Most likely your presentation is just a formality.  A way to fill the space with sound waves for 5-10-15 minutes.  But if you clearly know the answer - immediately begin to look for words and images that can direct the listener in the direction you want. <br><br>  All the images that you pick up - this is your presentation. <br><br>  <b>Creating a presentation, you need to remember:</b> 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <ol><li>  The presentation serves as a visual channel of communication with the listener - in addition to the verbal and non-verbal - allows you to control his attention; </li><li>  Each slide of the presentation is an abstract of your presentation, submitted through a graphic channel of perception; </li><li>  The presentation actually determines what the listener will remember after your speech, what he will be interested in; </li><li>  Every moment of time on the screen should be exactly the information you are talking about - do not force the listener to study the slide instead of listening to you; </li><li>  Do not turn the slides into the full text of your speech.  Remember, a presentation is not a duplication of information, but the necessary accents in graphical form; </li><li>  To enhance the memorization of particularly important information, use graphics that provoke emotions, positive or negative, depending on the content.  Emotions increase perception and memorization; </li><li>  My experience has shown that presentations containing a thematic video are more successful. </li></ol><br>  All that you plan to say is your text.  Where to get the text?  From the head!  Just start saying what you think motivates the listener to do what you need.  In front of the mirror, on a walk, sitting in a chair, not necessarily loud, even if hardly moving his lips.  Speak your speech in and out.  Then repeat.  Then again.  In the process of repeating, the text will change - something will disappear, something will appear - this is normal.  At the very end will remain the necessary essence.  According to experience, 3 times is enough to fix and, most importantly, remember the basic skeleton of the performance.  And only after that, you can tezisno or completely write the text. <br><br>  Such training will allow you to worry less, which in itself is not a little important.  And yet, it will allow you during your speech not to go into yourself, frantically thinking over words, and not to lose contact with the audience. <br><br>  <b>Entering the hall to the listener, first of all:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Introduce yourself.  Even if you are sure that everyone in the hall knows you; </li><li>  Form the expectations of the listeners.  Unjustified expectations can ruin even the perfect performance.  Speak clearly to the audience about what you will tell and why; </li><li>  Mark the rules of the game ashore.  Tell the room when you can ask questions, how to get out, if you need to, what to do with the sound of your phone, etc .; </li></ol><br>  <b>Starting the performance, remember:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The presentation is not just for listeners.  This is a map of your performance.  She will tell you the direction if you are suddenly ‚Äúlost‚Äù. </li></ol><br>  <b>Work with the attention of the hall, do not miss it:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Do not speak too monotonously - it lulls.  Change the timbre of the voice and the speed of pronunciation of words periodically.  Do not skimp on the emotional tones of voice; </li><li>  Eye contact - periodically ‚Äúscan‚Äù the hall with a look, entering into eye contact with the audience.  Pay attention to how this technique arouses their attention to your words; </li><li>  If you have a good sense of humor - reserve a few sparkling jokes on the subject of the performance; </li><li>  Be sure to communicate with the room, ask questions.  After asking a question, show the audience how you want to get an answer - for example, by raising your hand or pointing to the person from whom you want to hear a verbal answer; </li><li>  Get moving.  Make listeners follow you when you don‚Äôt need to look at the presentation screen; </li><li>  At the same time avoid seats in the hall, postures and behavior of previous speakers, if their performance was unsuccessful and vice versa, if you want to get some glory from the previous successful speaker.  Copy luck, move away from failures; </li></ol><br>  Well, super-weapon - use the methods of polemics with yourself.  Make statements and refute them themselves, and then in polemics with yourself, and, perhaps, with a hall, prove their loyalty; <br><br>  Such simple techniques will allow your report to become your weapon in capturing the minds of your listeners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458882/</a></p>
