In previous articles there was one condition - connection to payment systems was made as an individual.  Now I decided to <strike>get out of the twilight</strike> to do everything as honestly as possible, and I want to talk about how to connect to payment systems as an IP and legal withdrawal of money earned to a bank account. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the process of connecting to payment systems as an IP is always overshadowed by the fact that in order to withdraw money (and sometimes just to go to your personal account), you need to sign an agreement and wait until it comes in paper form to the payment system. therefore, in this article in most cases I will describe only the theoretical and informational parts of cooperation with payment systems and aggregators. <br><br>  In general, in order to connect the acceptance of payments, it is necessary to exchange an agreement with the payment system, so you cannot count on a quick connection.  Plus - this agreement must be manually processed, so if you do not take into account the time spent on sending documents by Russian Post, then the connection takes from three days.  The package of documents for all is about the same, but sometimes a copy of some document certified by a notary or, for example, a fresh extract from the EGRIP may be required.

      So, the heroes of this review: WebMoney, Yandex.Cassa, PayPal, United Cash Desk (Wallet One), RBKMoney, PayMaster, RoboCassa, QIWI <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the time of writing this article, I decided to check the quality of the technical support work a bit and asked a few clarifying questions on the connection.  All questions were sent on the night from Thursday to Friday, and in the morning I began to receive answers.  I didn‚Äôt have any complaints about the quality of answers, but not everything is smooth with speed. <br><br>  I received the first answer at 11.41 from the Wallet One service: everything was explained in some detail, and I didn‚Äôt have any additional questions.  From RBKMoney, the answer came a minute later, and I have no complaints about it either.  The next answer is from PayPal.  He, in general, arranged for me, except for a completely stereotypical answer to the question of competitive advantage. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not receive any more replies on the same day.  The answer from the RoboCassy came 38 hours after the request was created, and they generally decided not to write about their advantages, but from Yandex.Cash sent an answer only on Monday, which made me very sad, but there are no complaints about the quality of the answer. <br><br>  Each service I asked about their advantages over competitors, and now I would like to publish the answers: <br><br>  <b>Wallet One</b> <br><blockquote>  - more than 100 methods of receiving payments (cards, online banking, mobile payments, cash through payment terminals, etc.) <br>  - multicurrency, the possibility of business expansion outside the Russian Federation <br>  - fast integration, help of our technical support, personal manager <br>  - development of an individual payment page with the removal of individual payment buttons, selection of optimal payment methods, as a consequence of an increase in conversion into payments <br>  ‚ÄìOwnership - more than 7 million wallets registered in the W1 system, the possibility of holding joint actions <br></blockquote><br>  <b>RBKMoney</b> <br><blockquote>  The main advantages of our service in comparison with other services include, for example, multi-acquiring, high conversion, bilateral contract, the presence of an NGO license, a twenty-four-hour support service, safety and stability. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Paypal</b> <br><blockquote>  Securing your PayPal account is our most important task.  We provide both physical and electronic protection for your data.  More than 2,000 professionals working in our company, providing protection from fraud and identity theft. <br>  PayPal supports 26 currencies.  PayPal has 152 million active users in 205 different countries. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Yandex.Cassa</b> <br><blockquote>  - the presence of many types of payments <br>  - short terms of transfer of funds to the p / s <br>  - ensuring a high level of security of confidential data <br>  - comfortable interest rates for payments <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e2/5d7/f3d/9e25d7f3d00e4508af8f21be053999d8.png"><br><br>  In the case of IP, connecting to <b>WebMoney</b> is quite simple: you need to have a <a href="http://wiki.webmoney.ru/projects/webmoney/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">personal passport of the</a> individual and ‚Äúbind‚Äù the existing WMID to the IP.  The connection happens quite quickly, after filling in the data on the site, a letter from the WebMoney employee comes with instructions and a contract.  The contract must be printed out, signed and sent by regular mail along with the rest of the documents.  From small drawbacks: the contract must be self-stitched (for a programmer this may cause slight difficulties, but a chocolate bar and any familiar girlfriend solve this problem) and make a notarial copy of one of the documents.  Otherwise, I did not have any problems, and the connection took 5 days, taking into account the delivery of documents by courier. <br><br>  After checking the documents for the specified WMID, it is possible to withdraw money to the PI account.  That is, in fact, connecting to WebMoney as an IP is no different from working as a physical.  persons, except for the need to exchange documents.  Money in the same way goes to WebMoney wallets, the withdrawal fee is completely the same - 0.8%.  Automatic payment acceptance is <a href="http://wiki.webmoney.ru/projects/webmoney/wiki/Web_Merchant_Interface">configured</a> completely in the same way - as for physical.  faces. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : low commission, fast connection <br>  <b>Cons</b> : this is not an aggregator, but a payment system, therefore only WebMoney can be accepted <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26c/b0a/1b3/26cb0a1b3bdb4b538e4feae93b8f98bc.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://kassa.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Cassa</a> - a project from Yandex.Money for receiving payments in various ways.  In addition to Yandex.Money through the Cashier, you can pay using bank cards, WebMoney, through cash salons, from the balance of a mobile phone and through the Internet banking of some banks.  After making the payment to the users, the money is transferred to the bank account on the next day.  The commission at Yandex.Cash is rather high - from 2.8% to 5%.  The percentage depends on the turnover and on the type of goods: if you sell services or digital content, the rate will be higher.  The largest percentage (5%) is obtained when paying for digital content or Yandex.Money services, and this percentage does not depend on turnover. <br><br>  As indicated on the Yandex.Cash website, you only need to provide an IP passport for the connection and usually the connection process takes no more than three days.  After that, you must provide a signed contract and exchange acts once a month.  From the ‚Äúcashier‚Äù cashier you can note the following: <br><ul><li>  Card binding: the user binds his card once and can make the following payments without re-entering data. </li><li>  Repeat payments: you can set up automatic debiting of money from the card, if the service works by subscription. </li><li>  Preauthorization: the ability to debit money not at the time of the transaction, but after some time. </li><li>  Mobile terminal: the ability to accept payments from cards via smartphone. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : the presence of interesting "buns", you only need a passport to connect <br>  <b>Cons</b> : high commission when paying via Yandex.Money, there is no mobile application <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/558/d0b/d11/558d0bd116a6413eaa4e459c6751fdbf.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://paypal.com/">PayPal</a> will be of interest to those who plan to sell products or services to foreign customers.  Just want to say that this payment system has a very large commission: from 2.9% to 3.9% + 10 rubles for each transaction.  Plus there may be fees for international payments and the domestic exchange rate is very disadvantageous.  Therefore, small payments will be extremely disadvantageous from the point of view of the commission due to the presence of a 10-ruble component.  Integration with the site at PayPal is not the easiest, but PayPal offers to use their buttons, with which everything becomes much easier.  Of the minuses of PayPal, I can also point out the lack of communication with tech support without logging in to an account (well, or I just did not find such an opportunity). <br><br>  <b>Pluses</b> : large system <br>  <b>Cons</b> : high commission + constant component of the commission <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/545/d62/dd1/545d62dd1a3d4d4c93e787538a6a96ad.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.walletone.com/ru/merchant/">Wallet One</a> is a project that I talked about in the first post, and which has changed a lot for the better since that time.  The site looks modern, so I even had a desire to register and see what was inside.  When registering, the system asks you to specify an e-mail and come up with a password.  After that you need to enter the address of your site.  It seemed to me redundant that the system asks the user to confirm both the e-mail, and the phone number, and ownership of the site.  Inside it turned out to be a pretty nice responsive design, so that owners of smartphones and tablets will not be greatly tormented.  They are also mobile and generally look good on the payment pages themselves, so customers will have no problems paying. <br><br>  You can accept payments immediately, without entering into a paper contract, but in order to withdraw money, you must already exchange paper versions of documents. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, integration with the site does not look very complicated, the usual form with the data.  Also in the settings you can choose through which systems we will accept payments.  By default, almost all systems are activated, with the exception of bank cards, WebMoney.  Yandex.Money and mobile commerce.  But it‚Äôs not so difficult to activate them, for example, for Yandex.Money, you just need to confirm that the commission will not be transferred to the client.  For their services, a single cash desk takes an average commission, for example, on commission cards at the start (at zero turnover) - 4%. <br><br>  Of the benefits I can also note the presence of a mobile application and the ability to create recurrent payments.  True, they do not connect this opportunity to everyone, but first they are interested in why this is necessary.  Another advantage when working with foreign clients is the ability to work with different currencies.  Similarly, PayMaster (about it below) there is a ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù delivery service for Moscow and St. Petersburg. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : convenient and modern site, fast connection, reasonable commission <br>  <b>Cons</b> : to connect the "big players" need to perform additional actions <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb3/0a8/432/eb30a843268c4c84b751132e73bd3bd1.gif"><br><br>  I worked as an individual with <a href="http://www.rbkmoney.com/ru">RBKMoney</a> , but at one point they said that they no longer work with individuals.  This aggregator, in addition to receiving payments through its domestic currency, offers online stores to accept payments using bank cards, Russian Post, via bank transfer, through mobile phone stores, payment terminals, via money transfer and online banking.  The set is fairly standard, but there is one big disadvantage - there is no possibility to accept payments through major players (Yandex, WebMoney, QIWI). <br><br>  However, there is a bun similar to Yandex.Kassa - you can get a reader for a smartphone with which you can receive payments offline.  The commission of this system is the same: 3.9% for any payment.  In my opinion, this is a big plus, you do not need to think that the user needs to ‚Äúslip‚Äù a cheaper payment system.  However, there are no discounts for staffing, depending on the volume of transactions.  Of the benefits, I can mention round-the-clock support via online chat. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : quite low and single commission <br>  <b>Cons</b> : there are no ‚Äúbig players‚Äù (Yandex, WebMoney, QIWI). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/912/334/931/9123349310ae4c32b6e1f549b9ba2c9e.png"><br><br>  I cooperated with <a href="http://info.paymaster.ru/">PayMaster</a> only as a client, paying through them services of other companies.  After viewing their site, I have more questions than answers.  It is proudly written on the main page that the commission starts from 2%, but, unfortunately, more detailed information is not indicated anywhere, and it can be obtained only after the application has been registered and approved by the manager. <br><br><blockquote>  Commission - from 2% to 7%.  You will learn the details after approval of your application. </blockquote><br>  Technical documentation is also available only after connection: <br><br><blockquote>  As soon as the manager approves your application, you will receive access to your PayMaster account.  In it you will learn about the settings and documentation. </blockquote><br>  To be honest, I do not fully understand this secrecy, so I did not even bother to find out the details.  From the pros, I can note that they have a rather large list of payment systems and have integration with logistics services for those who send goods to customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04f/fe1/b7d/04ffe1b7d19f4b26b173547e86b2e7c2.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://robokassa.ru/ru/">RoboCassa is</a> known for its large (up to 12%) commissions when working with them as an individual.  When working with jur.  individuals are much better, but the percentage is higher than that of competitors: at zero speed - 5% for all methods of payment, except Yandex. Money - you have to pay 7% for them.  RoboCash has a lot of payment methods: a fairly large number of Internet banks, previously unknown e-money systems, mobile operators, communication shops and various terminals. <br><br>  <b>Pros</b> : a lot of payment methods <br>  <b>Cons</b> : Commission is higher than the competition <br><br>  I will not describe QIWI in detail.  The last time I communicated with them, I was happily informed that it took about a month to connect new stores.  Technical support responded ‚Äúto back off‚Äù during the week, so I didn‚Äôt find out what the current payment system‚Äôs situation was. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257395/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257395/</a></p>
