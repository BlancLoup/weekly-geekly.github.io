  <section class="page js-page"><h1>GT03B GPS - what's inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Came by mail ordered more than a month ago, the long-awaited GPS tracker GT03B.  It was not enough internal struggle is it worth buying this thing.  It is not cheap, but where is the guarantee that it will be also "not cheap" to work ... I need a tracker.  I have many children, and I would very much like to control their movement around the city, as well as their social circle.  The device allows you to see its position on the site <a href="http://www.cootrack.com/">www.cootrack.com</a> and receive SMS messages by SMS request or in case of alarm situations when the armed mode is on.  Remembers 4 telephone numbers, interacts with them.  Understands the format of recording numbers in the form of +3753312344567. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3225dsc.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first thing that caught my eye when I opened the box was its dimensions.  For some reason, I expected significantly more.  The device seemed to me very compact.  In addition to the tracker itself, the box contains: charger, USB interface cable (also known as charging cable), battery, and instructions.  The device itself had 2 switches, a mini-USB connector, 2 LEDs and a relatively large red SOS button, which can also be illuminated from the inside with a separate LED.  Ie LEDs in the amount of 3. The device is painted with a soft-touch velvet paint that resembles rubber. <br>  Gathering the device, I put it on charge.  Until the full charge, it was not distracted by the hour 3. After that, real life began - the period of development and tuning.  I inserted an active SIM card free at that time and began to consistently, looking at the instructions, send an SMS to the device, and then carefully study its answers.  Then he checked the security functions.  It is necessary to admit that while I understood the syntax and its features - I was mistaken more than once.  The device either kept silent or sent an error code.  But all the same it is necessary to recognize that it is elementary to configure it and further it clearly works with these settings regardless of the change of the SIM card.  I tried voice only rates.  Then online tracking does not work.  I also tried only Internet tariffs - then the voice functions do not work, ie remote listening and dialing by pressing the SOS button.  However, SMS is sent and received. <br>  The device is controlled and programmed exclusively via SMS and external buttons / switches.  Any attempts to connect it to a computer fail.  A known-good USB cable from a video camera was taken (I want to emphasize its quality with this) and viewing of logs in Linux was turned on - not a single line twitched the log under any circumstances.  Ie from USB, it can only be charged.  How to control the device can be read <a href="http://www.gpstracking.co.in/pdf/GT03B%2520user%2520manual%252020110825.pdf">in the instruction manual</a> , so we will not dwell on this. <br>  The next day, the navigator, which in the evening after the experiments did not turn off and was not charged extra, was sewn into the pocket of one of the children who were going to day camp.  It is sewn so as not to get lost.  After they left, the site was opened and ... My wife could not find a place for herself with delight :).  Throughout the day, she could know exactly where the child is.  It should be noted that the device allows you to track not only by GPS, but also by GSM.  If the satellite signal disappears, the letter ‚ÄúG‚Äù (GPS) in the blue inverted ‚Äúdrop‚Äù is displayed on the map at the current point, but the letter ‚ÄúL‚Äù (LBS) in the green one.  In the case of the positioning mode on the cellular network (LBS), the accuracy drops sharply and the position can randomly roll up the map for kilometers, depending on the cell switching, but nevertheless, in general, it gives a completely digestible picture of the position. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/maplbs.jpg" alt="Lbs">

      In addition, the device reports the charge level of its battery, the time it takes to get the coordinates without being linked in my time zone, and the address that, apparently, is received from Google.  All this you can see in the screenshot.  The map can be switched to satellite imagery mode.  The tracker reports the level of charge in four discrete values: 95%, 55%, 30% (in this case it complains via low SMS that low power) and the last one sends a message like ‚ÄúI turn off because of a dead power supply‚Äù.  In the latter case, its status, of course, switches to the ‚ÄúOffline‚Äù mode and a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù of gray remains on the map.  Everything, then you can only catch the baby, dash the darn, remove the tracker and charge it again.  The first time he worked continuously less than a day.  Ie from the previous evening with the experiments of the day until the next dinner. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/mapgps.jpg" alt="GPS"><br><br>  The activation of the SOS button (hold for 3 seconds) is marked by the double triggering of the vibrator in the tracker.  Yes Yes!  There is a classic vibration motor, which is used in mobile phones and this is the only mode in which you can feel it. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3222dsc.jpg" alt="Button"><br><br>  By the way, there is also a microphone in it to listen to the surrounding space.  The microphone gain is very strong, so the sound is not pleasant because of the present level of distortion.  So, after the vibra has been triggered, the tracker sends a group alarm SMS message to the phones that you have programmed into the tracker and proceeds to the subsequent sequential dialing of these numbers until you reach at least one of them.  Mobile hysteria will last 5 minutes, then the tracker will calm down. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/mpasos.jpg" alt="SOS"><br><br>  To the question ‚Äúhow does the tracker work with the operator‚Äôs network, does it fall asleep‚Äù I will answer this way: the LEDs go to sleep and stop flashing.  Radio channel - does not fall asleep.  He works constantly.  This I found out with the help of a conventional radio.  The frequency of sending data to the server floats between 20 seconds and one minute.  Perhaps this is not a tracker that works, but the Internet via GPRS.  Maybe I measure in the open air - I would get other results. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/trackgps.jpg" alt="Track"><br><br>  That's probably all that I would like to tell you about this device.  In general, it suits me and solves my problems. <br>  What I would like to see in it, but what is not in it: buffering the received coordinates in the absence of a GSM connection, the ability to specify your server for data transfer, a capacious (longer-lived) battery. <br>  What makes him very happy: dimensions, ability to navigate GSM-honeycomb. <br><br>  Finally, some more photos for you: <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3221dsc.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3220dsc.jpg" alt="Top right - vibration motor"><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3219dsc.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3211dsc.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3216dsc.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3214dsc.jpg"><br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3226dsc.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/fdv3227dsc.jpg"><br><br>  Good luck to you :). <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Being long in one place the tracker on GPRS gives the coordinates every 3 minutes. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Unfortunately, as practice has shown, the majority of readers of my article are immature young men who saw nothing more in it than an encroachment on their personal freedom.  Ie excited personal fear and ... a clear indication that their business is far from the truth and perfection.  They, these things must be hidden.  And through hatred of their parents, and especially their care.  Probably not even conscious. <br>  The result - my karma is killed and the mass of poorly adequate posts in the comments.  It's a pity.  I was hoping for a different outcome. <br>  The technical part in general disappeared behind a wave of violent protests. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> Added photos with relative sizes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145925/</a></p>
