  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Linux in schools. Dream teacher.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This topic is a continuation of <a href="http://maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/52002/">maxh0.habrahabr.ru/blog/52002</a> <br>  Here and now I will try to give my proposal, especially since the discussion showed the interest of the community in the topic raised.  The only thing that surprised me was why everyone decided that I was waiting for help from the state.  What do you think - this is possible for a person with a nickname Makhno.  Not!  I believe in the self-organization of communities. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the discussion, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating Pedagogical Habr was voiced.  The idea is good, but it will not work now - there is no critical mass for launching a self-sustaining process.  You must first build up this mass, i.e.  Consolidate specialists interested in distributing Linux, and then attach teachers to them. <br>  Linux is an environment created by specialists for their comfortable existence.  And, in general, to use Linux at the user level is to use it for purposes other than its intended purpose.  That is why, often, the Linux user interface is lame - the creators are simply not interested in it. <br>  If we consider any solution in the field of computer technology, then its cost is composed (as a first approximation) of the cost of hardware, programs and salaries of specialists.  So Linux is optimizing exactly the third item.  But the price is determined by the market and the demand for a solution. <br>  From this it follows that Russia, as a country that has not yet produced significant amounts of either iron or programs, is interested in money spinning mainly in the third cycle, remaining inside the country.  Free Linux - an argument attracting only amateurs.  Capitalization is an important indicator of a company's health, and staff investment is often the most successful. <br>  In general, then most likely I listed the obvious things.  It now remains to explain how this relates to the School.  After all, a school is not a Mecca of IT specialists.  But this is not necessary.  The school needs a social order.  I will explain.  Now, with the transition to per capita funding, schools depend on the filling of classes, which is determined by the parents: they will give the child to this school or another.  This is the first.  And secondly, formally, all the property additionally acquired by the School, including software, is approved by the Parental Committee.  In general, parents can become an important figure determining the appearance of education.  And it is they who are interested in the fact that from children they prepare not button presses, but specialists. <br>  Based on this, we will try to determine a promotion strategy. <br>  Firstly, it is necessary to form an initiative group.  And where to form it as not on Habr√©. <br>  Second, as much as possible to consolidate all blog writers on one resource.  At least at the level of links to topics.  There are links to related resources, etc. <br>  Third, determine the real interest of the IT community in the subject.  She must be.  Many firms are interested in providing schoolchildren with a normal education. <br>  The same Infra-Resource is most likely interested in promoting Open-office, Cisco in that more people know what a router is, Yandex - in the skills of effective search among users, etc., etc. If you can form an effective opinion of the IT-community - ideally .  In principle, the authorities are also interested in such an order.  A common place has become the assertion that our educational institutions are preparing a bunch of specialists who are not needed by anyone. <br>  By this time, it would be better to prepare a draft textbook on free software taking into account the wishes formed in Section 3. Not strictly following, but according to the wishes.  Computer science includes a lot of short-term, but what you need to know. <br>  And then, with sponsorship, it becomes real to achieve the inclusion of this textbook in the federal register. <br>  Now the teacher if he wants / if he is forced by the parents of the students will be able to teach Linux at school.  All other amateur performances allowed in additional education (for example, me), but not permissible in secondary school.  Now the new standard of education <a href="http://standart.edu.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocId%3D761">standart.edu.ru/doc.aspx?DocId=761 is being</a> formed and I would like that by the time the discussion ends the community will decide what to want, what to forgive and what to demand. <br>  <b>Ps.</b>  I wrote, re-read and realized how everything is inconsistent and muddled.  In principle, this is understandable.  From my hearth the whole picture is not visible.  I am waiting for your strokes on a common canvas, but I do not welcome black color.  If it is not difficult, proceed from the fact that the same people live in Russia as everywhere else - neither worse nor better </div>
