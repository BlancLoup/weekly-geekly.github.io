The list of games is impressive: here and Bulletstorm, and Crysis 2 for a couple of Dead Space 2, EA Sports MMA, FIFA 11, Madden NFL 11, Medal of Honor and Star Wars: The Old Republic.  In order not to bother the dear reader, we took only a few of them.  Read more below. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We have already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/96466/">written</a> about the new Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit from the studio Criterion Games, but it‚Äôs impossible not to mention this game in the general review.  Returning to the origins of the series - the confrontation of police officers and violators - looks promising, and the new Need for Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãAutolog service looks too attractive.  According to official data, the American release of the novelty will take place on November 16, while the European release is scheduled for three days later - November 19.  Our readers have already appreciated the first video of the new game, but I want to review it again and again: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WBDvg2AfJz8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgAh_ZjPlMqSkBZ5LI2jTO5PyQtsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.</b>  <b>Official video from E3 2010 [HD]</b>

      One of the highlights of the press conference was the presentation of Dead Space 2. The game developers called the exact launch date of their new project: January 25 of the next year for North America and January 28 for Europe.  The protagonist of both parts of Dead Space, Isaac Clarke (Isaac Clarke) comes to grips with the new evil, whose name is "The Sprawl".  As you probably remember, after the attack of the bloodthirsty aliens, Isaac was the only survivor, so he will have to fight the next misfortune in splendid isolation. <br><br>  The developers have promised to talk in more detail about this game during today's press conference, Sony.  What is the reason for this is unknown to us, but let's hope that Visceral Games will keep its promise, we look forward to new details.  In the meantime, we present to your attention a fresh video with more than 5 minutes of gameplay: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qiBjEtqXttk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgJ9HCfhSW6LLWkMGT7mA2AAI3Xxw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Dead Space 2. Demonstration of the game from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  Naturally, Electronic Arts does not forget about Medal of Honor, the Russian release of which <a href="http://games.qip.ru/news/offline/1012/">will take place on October 14th</a> .  To the delight of fans of the game, beta testing multiplayer mode will start very soon - June 21.  Note that VIP users of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, pre-order for the Medal of Honor, access to the beta will open a little earlier - June 17. <br><br>  In addition, EA announced the launch of a new program of bonuses and awards, called <a href="http://www.gunclub.ea.com/">Gun Club</a> , at the moment announced support for Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Medal of Honor and a new addition to Battlefield: Bad Company 2 - Vietnam, which we will talk about a little later.  In the future, the "gun club" will include Battlefield Heroes and Dead Space 2. <br><br>  But back to the Medal of Honor - a new video demonstrates the gameplay footage and at the same time literally ‚Äúblows the roof off‚Äù, and some of its moments are small masterpieces: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaz7r2r_Fik%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-HLajvmKdZHrpNHom-42SLCPFyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Medal of Honor.</b>  <b>‚ÄúMultiplayer‚Äù video from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  In the press conference there was an announcement of Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam, the first large-scale addition to a great game.  Now players will be able to plunge into the atmosphere of the Vietnam War, both as an American infantryman, and as a North Vietnamese soldier.  Supplement will be released immediately on three platforms (PC, PS3 and Xbox 360) next winter. <br><br>  EA employees keep silent about the cost of BFBC2 Vietnam, but here‚Äôs the first video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgFcJ38-IOc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEhaZD_ZOn5gN3g14TBgXq6NZuIA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Battlefield: Bad Company 2 Vietnam.</b>  <b>Premiere video from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  Now a few words about Crysis 2. The game will support 3D graphics, as the USA Today newspaper wrote about these days.  During the press conference, viewers were asked to wear 3D glasses in order to fully experience the atmosphere of the game.  According to the developers, both versions - 2D and 3D - are no different, which is good news, because not everyone has the opportunity to play in the "three-dimensional universe." <br><br>  The release of Crysis 2 is <a href="http://games.qip.ru/news/offline/1116/">scheduled</a> for future autumn.  The game will be released on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC platforms.  Honestly, the video with the demonstration of the beta gameplay was a little disappointing, but judge for yourself: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDE7IrWLC9E&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgcj2U6N65ssLmjGc8VEYVtrvKpRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Crysis 2.

Fun instead of bloodthirsty ‚Äù- something like the developers from People Can Fly studio presented their new shooter Bulletstorm.  And as Cliff Bleszinski learned in his speech, the novelty will blow up the shelves of American stores on February 22 of next year.  The date of the European release has not been disclosed.  We, in turn, can only assume that the appearance of Bulletstorm in Europe will take place "traditionally" three days later. <br><br>  This project has created a real sensation, and if you have not heard about this shooter, then you are guaranteed to be pleasantly surprised.  Below is a fresh video with five minutes of amazing ‚Äúbullet storm‚Äù gameplay from the developers of the legendary Painkiller (which is noticeable): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/qLzSsvcb5J0&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxnPLPW_NIbNgH-Ohxz0n7V-9IQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Bulletstorm.</b>  <b>5 minutes of gameplay from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  Among the numerous announcements, EA Sports MMA is not lost, a new fighting game with the participation of the famous "fighters".  The cover of the future game will be adorned by Fedor Emelianenko and Randy Couture, known for their achievements in "mixed martial arts" (in common people and show business they are mistakenly called "fighting without rules").  The developers promise a revolutionary combat system and the possibility of real reporting on virtual fights. <br><br>  The game will be released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. The release of EA Sports MMA is scheduled for October 19 of this year, but for now we are watching the presentation: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASHea3tLURw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgGkymulB_eOiFS6kIWlkacKKBAlA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Story about EA Sports MMA at E3</b> <br><br>  For those who care about improving their body and spirit, Electronic Arts has prepared a multi-platform project EA Sports Active 2, which will be released on all consoles of this generation. <br><br>  However, thanks to the support of the Kinect system, previously known to us under the Natal brand, the Xbox 360 version stands alone - the developers promise us complete freedom of action, because Kinect does not assume the presence of joysticks, unlike similar systems on the Nintendo Wii and PlayStation 3 consoles. Additional exclusive EA Sports Active 2 in the Xbox 360 version will become navigation with the help of voice and gestures. <br><br>  One of the features of the new product will be monitoring of the heart.  The technology will help optimize the load on the body, reducing or increasing the intensity of the exercises.  So that the owners of PS3 and Xbox 360 have not lost interest in playing sports, they will also get a unique opportunity to download new exercises through the PSN and Xbox Live services. <br><br>  You can learn about the main features of a virtual sports club for real activities from this video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bSVuTTDQLA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHLdk_XMXfX8mo5NIRNY0mpb3P4A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>EA SPORTS Active 2.

But we will tell about them, because the exhibition continues.  We wish EA good luck and look forward to fresh details, new clips and screenshots. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96545/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96545/</a></p>
