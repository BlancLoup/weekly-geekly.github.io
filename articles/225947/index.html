The keyboard, which recognizes your typing style, maps your keystrokes, teaches your words ... This was the first application I bought for my Nexus, although it cost as much as $ 5.

      Today, we are very pleased to present you a major update for SwiftKey in the Google Play Store, which includes many new features that are a direct result of your feedback.  To celebrate this event, we give you a gift! <br><br>  The main thing users asked for was a wider range of themes, colors and designs that allow you to personalize your SwiftKey keyboard.  With today's update, we are pleased to provide you with dozens of new free and paid themes that may be available in the new SwiftKey Store.  This is a great way for us to improve the quality of design, and let everyone have the maximum opportunity to personalize SwiftKey.  In today's update, there are now 48 themes in the SwiftKey keyboard, and more are coming soon. <br><br>  Additional new features in SwiftKey Keyboard v5 include: <br><br><ul><li>  Support for over 800 emoji as well as new emoji prediction function </li><li>  Optional digital range </li><li>  Increased accuracy of Swiftkey Flow (Swype analogue) </li><li>  Improved forecasting system </li><li>  Additional languages </li><li>  ‚Ä¶ And much more </li></ul><br><br>  To get this new version of SwiftKey, go to Google Play and upgrade for free. <br><br>  In addition, from today onwards, the SwiftKey Keyboard will be completely free to download on Google Play!  We want to take this opportunity to give you a little more information and explain some of the reasons for these changes. <br><br>  We have come an incredibly long way in these past six years, from two university friends with an ambitious idea, to the most popular app on Google Play for the last two years in a row.  We founded SwiftKey to make communication on mobile devices easier for everyone, and as a company, we make every effort to achieve this goal. <br><br>  That is why today we make SwiftKey free.  We believe that this change is the best way to achieve our global vision of SwiftKey, and now we can reach a lot more people around the world without a barrier, which was the price.  However, we want to assure you that all the features of SwiftKey that you know and love will stay with you. <br><br>  As a final note, we will launch AMA Reddit to discuss the new SwiftKey keyboard (and everything you could see in it) in the near future.  We will announce the exact time and date details in the coming days, and we hope that you will take part. <br><br>  Thank you, once again, for your continued support, <br><br>  John Reynolds and Ben Medlock <br>  SwiftKey co-founders </blockquote><br>  More information <a href="http://swiftkey.com/en/blog/swiftkey-keyboard-goes-free-new-themes-emoji">on the SwiftKey blog</a> . <br><br>  Who has not tried, I highly recommend the best-selling keyboard in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.touchtype.swiftkey%26hl%3Dru">market</a> .  Moreover, it is now absolutely free and legal.  I already managed to write with the help of it at all blindly.  Many thanks to the developers, and we are waiting for the version for iOS, which is promised to be released after the official release of iOS 8. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225947/</a></p>
