In the same place, it seems to me, well studies to the programmer.  Hard deadlines and ‚Äúno one cares about your beauty‚Äù have a very positive effect on the understanding of what is <strong>needed</strong> and what <strong>we would like</strong> .  In the case of testers and programmers, the ‚Äúfactory‚Äù will also serve as a school - now many factories have to invest in training. <br><br>  It is also extremely cool to try yourself in some kind of government structure to understand that IT is never ‚Äúour everything‚Äù, then in a small, not IT-company, where the same sysadmin is more a doctor-psychologist than a builder-architect. <a name="habracut"></a>

      With PM, a clinical case: some are able to do projects, others are not.  By and large, the PM doesn‚Äôt care what to do and in what structure to work, and here the ‚Äúfactory‚Äù can just play a dirty trick on the PM.  In real life, PM is often never ‚Äúking and god‚Äù or at least ‚Äúnative father‚Äù, as often happens (and often indeed it does!) PM in a factory.  Beyond the borders of pure IT, PM is more often a ‚Äúnegotiator‚Äù who simultaneously persuades a teenage daughter to get out of the bath and not be offended by ‚Äúthis freak ... (crossed out) boy‚Äù, an overgrown son ‚Äúdo not even try to smoke‚Äù (read , finally!), wait for his wife with the arrival of his beloved mother and buying a second car for her, and at the same time solving minor problems at work such as launching a new power unit in a seismically dangerous area. <br><br>  For PM, you probably just have to try to make a couple of projects for yourself: think up an idea, find grandmas (even just borrowing from your parents or putting aside your favorite premium, which you already noticed on a GPS receiver or other gadget - the point is budget constraint), find the performers (certainly with contractors, not friends), check that it didn‚Äôt work like in the joke about the ‚Äúlighthouse and the well‚Äù (when the builders built the lighthouse and turned it over at the very beginning), assemble and launch the project and try to convince yourself that  oh it was all worth it. <br><br>  It is possible to build a house as an exercise, for example - this is for extreme sports.  That is, to persuade the parents of this case, calculate the money, find builders, find a plot, find out that such a house cannot be built on this plot, find another plot, understand that money has already depreciated by a certain percentage, take a smaller plot, find out that This area will never live, etc.  etc.  And again to convince yourself that you like this engine.  Then try the same with programmers, marketers, customers and other civilian comrades. <br><br>  By the way, the last exercise, you should try to go through any IT person. <br><br>  Why am I all this: you first need to try and see how everything happens in the industry and in a madhouse and only then make a decision in which environment you are most comfortable.  Otherwise, IT will present many unpleasant surprises. <br><br>  PS <br>  Diligently I didn‚Äôt want to start an article with the words ‚ÄúI am often asked‚Äù :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20691/</a></p>
