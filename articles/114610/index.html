  <section class="page js-page"><h1>TeX Varieties</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  I did not find any mention in the habr about xetex, lualatex which, in a brief, concise form, told about what it is.  Therefore, this idea appeared in this way: write briefly about the main spin systems.  And so we start in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  TeX </h4><br>  TeX is a computer layout system developed by American computer science professor Donald Knut for the purpose of creating a computer typography.  It includes tools for sectioning documents for working with cross-references.  Many consider TeX to be the best way to create complex mathematical formulas.  In particular, because of these opportunities, TeX is popular in academic circles, especially among mathematicians and physicists. [1] <br>  For those who want to read about the history of TeX, it is well written on Wikipedia.  After the release of TeX, various systems began to appear that simplified the use of Tex, or pursued certain goals (for example, using a programming language in a document).  Currently, the addition of TeX functionality is frozen, for this reason systems that are based on layout do not increase its functionality, but use it using their methods and capabilities.  Now you can go to the next part of the article. <br><br><h4>  LaTeX </h4><br>  LaTeX is the most popular set of macro extensions (or macro package) of the computer layout system TeX, which facilitates a set of complex documents. [2] <br>  I don‚Äôt see any reason to dwell on this point, since it is quite well covered in other sources. <br><br><h4>  XeTeX </h4><br>  The first release of XeTeX took place in 2004, the latest version appeared in September 2010.  It uses Unicode.  Allows you to use different fonts in the system, without configuring TeX fonts.  A separate interesting feature is the ability to use Russian-language commands and macros. [3] <br>  Here is an example of using XeTeX, which is built using <br>  xelatex: <br> <code>\documentclass{article} <br> \usepackage{polyglossia} <br> \newcommand{\}[2] <br> { <br>  1: #1 <br> <br>  2: #2 <br> } <br> \begin{document} <br> \fontspec{Times New Roman}{    Times New Roman} <br> <br> \fontspec{Verdana}{    Verdana} <br> <br> \{ }{ } <br> <br> \end{document} <br></code> <br><h4>  LuaTeX </h4>
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      When I wrote a coursework on statistics, I had thoughts: How can I generate <br>  the table where the pair of neighboring pillars was calculated?  Of course when I saw that <br>  there is LuaTeX immediately thought: I could write something like: <br> <code>\begin{table} <br> \directlua{ <br> a={1,2,3} <br> b={1,2,3} <br> for x = 1,3 <br> do <br> print(a[x].. " &amp; "..b[x].." &amp; ".. (a[x]+b[x]) .." \\") <br> end} <br> \end{table}</code> <br>  Unfortunately, alas, this code does not work.  This product is under development and there has not been a single stable release at the moment.  The LuaTeX Reference states that the product is not ready for production, and users cannot rely either on stability or on the fact that the current functionality will be preserved in future versions.  (It‚Äôs impossible to depend on the stability, nor on the functionality of the user.) At the current moment, for example: <br> <code>...    ... <br> \directlua{ <br> for x =1,10 <br> do <br> tex.write(x*x) <br> end <br> } <br> ...   ...</code> <br> <br><h4>  BibTex </h4><br>  BibTex allows you to separate the list of sources into a separate file (s), from directly forming it in LaTeX.  Its use is not a problem: a file with the bib extension is created, where sources are described (articles, publications, books and other types of sources).  Then two commands are written in the document: \ bibliographystyle {gost71u} \ bibliography {filename}, where it is directly indicated: in the first case, this is the design style (you can choose different design styles, for example: without sorting, by guests, sorting by the names of the authors, and others) In the second case, the name of the bib file is specified without extension. <br>  As an example, we present the design of a fictional book: <br> <code>@Book{tag_vum, <br> author={,, and ,...}, <br> title={    }, <br> publisher={  }, <br> year={12151 .  ..}, <br> address={}, <br> language={russian}, <br> }</code> <br>  In this case, the result and the sequence of output of these parameters will depend on the style specified in the corresponding variable.  When first used, gost71u encountered the problem of encoding in a bib file, as well as the problem that the initials of the author were not displayed.  The solution found on linux.org.ru.  It consisted in replacing "{vv ~} {ll} {~ jj} {~ f.}" With "{vv ~} {ll} {~ jj} {~ in the file (for example gost71u.bst). ff} ". [7]  When I was looking for a solution for an article I found an opinion on this solution: So replacing "{vv ~} {ll} {~ jj} {~ f.}" With "{vv ~} {ll} {~ jj} {~ ff}" kills converting from the author's full name in a bib file to his initials in the resulting file. [8] <br><br><h4>  Contexx </h4><br>  Unfortunately I could not find a lot of information in Russian on ConTeXt, and I see no point in writing that it is a layout system.  Therefore, if someone wants to know more about him, you can refer to the literature with numbers 9,10,11. <br><br><h4>  Omega </h4><br>  Omega is an extension for TeX that uses unicode, which was written by John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous, after freezing TeX in 1991.  It includes the new 16 bit Unicode, as well as several fonts that widely cover the alphabets.  In 2004, at the TeX Users Group conference, one of the two developers John Plaice decided to split (split) to a new project that has not yet been published, Haralambous continued to work on Omega.  LaTeX for Omega - lambda. <br>  Although the Omega project was promising, its development was slow, and the functionality was largely unstable.  A separate project was to begin with the goal of stabilizing the code and using it with e-Tex, whose name is Aleph, led by Giuseppe Bilotta.  The latex version of Aleph is called Lamed. <br>  Aleph is no longer evolving, but most of its functionality was integrated into LuaTeX, a new project funded by the University of Colorado (via the TeX Project by Idris-oriented Samawi Hamid) and NTG. The development of LuaTeX began in 2006, the first beta version in summer 2007. This is the Aleph receiver and Pdftex, using Lua as an integrated light programming language.  LuaTex is designed by Taco Hoekwater. <br>  This is a rather free translation of an article from the English Wikipedia. <br><br><h4>  Bibliography </h4><br>  [1] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX</a> - TeX article <br>  [2] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX</a> - Article about LaTeX <br>  [3] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX</a> - Becoming about Xetex <br>  [4] <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/luatex/manual/luatexref-t.pdf">www.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/luatex/manual/luatexref-t.pdf</a> - LuaTeX Reference (eng) <br>  [5] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX</a> - Article about LuaTeX (eng) <br>  [6] <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX</a> - BibTex article <br>  [7] <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/forum/general/1782585">www.linux.org.ru/forum/general/1782585</a> - A controversial solution to the problem of initials <br>  [8] <a href="http://www.linux.org.ru/news/opensource/3450354/page1">www.linux.org.ru/news/opensource/3450354/page1#comment-3452929</a> - Opinion about this solution <br>  [9] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt</a> - Article about ConTexT (eng) <br>  [10] <a href="http://offline.computerra.ru/2006/634/263569/">offline.computerra.ru/2006/634/263569</a> - Introduction to ConTEXt <br>  [11] <a href="http://sovety.blogspot.com/2008/09/context.html">sovety.blogspot.com/2008/09/context.html</a> - Introduction to ConTeXt <br>  [12] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_</a> (TEX) - Omega Article (eng) <br><br>  <b>UPDATE 1:</b> Fixed xelatex code <br>  <b>UPDATE 2:</b> Fixed translation to proposed in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114610/</a></p>
