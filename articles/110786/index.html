In profile, the apparatus is distinguished by the same curved back, for a better grip.

      On the right side - the volume rocker and the power button.  Power button / screen lock, headphone jack (I‚Äôm not tired of repeating - standard, 3.5 mm! :-) and Micro USB connector (also standard! Sony Ericsson was the first to switch to this mandatory standard for all mobile device manufacturers since 2011) . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2343fa2e/cf31a46c/8c11c413/0ff1a055.jpg"><br><br>  In terms of dimensions, this ‚Äúmiddling‚Äù is 99x54x15 mm and weighs 104 grams.  Perhaps the only difference from the ‚Äúolder‚Äù Xperia X10 and X10 mini <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/109438/">from the previous review</a> is not at all external, but tactile - the back cover is made of the usual hard plastic, not the ‚Äúrubberized‚Äù soft. <br><br><h4>  Ergonomics </h4><br>  Everything is standard, convenient, clear.  The biggest ergonomic minus is a USB connector closed with a little stick that you constantly need to pick off with a fingernail.  I think that he is at risk of tearing himself away from intensive use sooner or later - unless, of course, the excessively nervous owner or the owner of the device, who is experiencing his manicure, does not tear him off. <br><br>  It is also not very convenient to remove (or change) the cover - there are no recesses for the finger, as, for example, in the Xperia X10 mini.  But the SIM card or memory card is easy and simple to change - thanks to the normal size of the device, the insides are arranged conveniently enough, and you won't need tweezers to wield them. <br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  Externally, the image of the device is quite androgynous, its consumer orientation depends on the color of the case.  For the test, I got a previously released white device, on the official site, too, so far only the X8 is ‚Äúin white‚Äù, but there is also a ‚Äúmale‚Äù black case for sale, without any interchangeable panels.  But complete with a white phone is an additional back cover of one of the four colors - dark blue, aquamarine, pink or silver - girls will like it. <br><br>  Also included in the package are an adapter with Micro USB to USB, plug for mains supply, vacuum headphones MH810 with a remote control and a flash drive for 2 gigabytes. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  Three-inch capacitive screen resolution of 480x320 - an absolute good.  It is much more convenient to use the on-screen keyboard than on the Xperia mini, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about the lack of a sliding keyboard - just turn the device on its side ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/31f3c849/5b2da7ea/62b7f6f5/3ce1b402.jpg">  ‚Üí <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c40c5b7b/d7a5bc31/1b525ea6/e517b71a.jpg"><br><br>  ... and poking at the buttons will be no less convenient than on the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyericsson/blog/109438/">Xperia mini pro</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d0a9912d/61a086e9/804bfecf/32b74fce.jpg"><br><br>  Well, just more space for text, Internet, images and so on.  Spellchecker checks that you are typing, but you also need to check it yourself: when he lacks vocabulary, substituting the correct version that seems to him instead of the word you have typed, he can substitute you if you send in writing by inattention.  But when it comes to a commonplace typo, it saves valuable time by choosing the right option: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/621f7867/8f596fa5/55672fe1/55a86adb.jpg"><br><br>  It‚Äôs a pity that the dictionary doesn‚Äôt come in the list of synchronized services (browser, contacts, calendar) - every time you change your phone, you have to train the spell checker again or not use the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù dialing at all. <br><br><h4>  Audio </h4><br>  Like the X10, the X-eighth has a strikingly loud speaker with good sound quality.  Of course, the manner of listening to music from the phone through the speaker gives off a villager, but in the conditions of force majeure it can help out - the main thing is to remove the cap and remove the sunflower seeds - then you can pass off carefully examining the possibilities of the aesthetic apparatus. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  By default, all Xperia series phones are sold with Android 1.6 firmware, but version 2.1 is available on the official website, which can even be installed by a blonde. <br><br>  Of course, I myself am not even blond, but, to be honest, I belong to that majority of users who use only the most basic capabilities of any technology.  The Xperia X8 came in handy for me: <br><ul><li>  Email Application </li><li>  Gmail app </li><li>  Alarm clock - the standard tunes are very cool, in the morning to wake up well under them. </li><li>  The browser - the standard ‚Äúwebkit‚Äù is not bad, but, of course, it‚Äôs better to immediately put Opera Mini or the new Firefox for Android </li><li>  Radio is an unlimited number of stations you can remember.  But you can only squander them in order. </li><li>  The player is a standard, not very functional player.  The choice of playback modes - in order or randomly, there is no possibility of playing in folders. </li><li>  Google Maps with AGPS Navigation </li><li>  Facebook </li><li>  Album </li><li>  The camera - 3.2 megapixels, without flash, with the ability to shoot video at a resolution of up to 640x480 at a speed of 30 frames per second. </li><li>  The calendar </li><li>  TrackID is a favorite branded Sonyeriksson feature.  Determines the music from a fragment recorded from the radio or even from external speakers. </li></ul><br>  A full range of pre-installed applications looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a8ac9df4/7a1bf10d/58123878/68d4924a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a13297ef/c259ecbd/06093b42/056e30c2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/87683799/b52dc58b/9e97e758/f0971e6e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ab606f24/22f5af9e/ed0c3f8b/ed395929.jpg"><br><br>  From February, the Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 will come with Android 2.1 firmware pre-installed. <br><br><h4>  Toys </h4><br>  The main difference in the software, which I noticed compared to the Xperia mini models that were reviewed in the last review, was the presence of more games.  A pleasant surprise was the availability of an updated version of the Tower Bloxx game: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/08c38957/e07821a1/ace10c64/3645f7de.jpg">  ‚Üí <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/99193a63/0d25198a/37818476/7b861fbf.jpg">  ‚Üí <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/390ee815/fdf758aa/ffcb3143/33a27fb3.jpg"><br><br>  - at one time, for the construction of houses from stacked cubes, I spent a lot of hours - it delays worse than Tetris. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  A pleasant surprise was the battery.  Without additional charge, it keeps at least a day, which is very good for a smartphone on Android. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f10ffdf8/c78b8d25/89e72028/2fa6413a.jpg"><br><br>  Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 is a strong middle peasant, both in size and price.  This phone is not capable of amazing with its incredible possibilities, bright design or super-screen, but it is not designed for this either. <br><br>  The advantages of this device are evident, first of all, in the market context - a full-fledged smartphone on Android, with a navigator and a fairly large screen, a full set of standard applications and branded Sony Ericsson E-mails - Timescape, TrackID, AGPS navigator is sold at the price of a regular phone or a cheap smartphone - at a price of 8 -9 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Value for money, price for features is the main killer feature of the Sony Ericsson Xperia X8.  Optimal white balance.  This offer has no competitors - any phone can like it, but you buy it and this will faithfully serve you faithfully.  And with interchangeable color panels, you don‚Äôt miss a gift for your girlfriend for the New Year ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110786/</a></p>
