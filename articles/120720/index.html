    <h4>  Search for solutions </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The simplest example from life: for a teenager girl, the birthday of her boyfriend becomes a universal problem! <br>  With some amendments, this also applies to adult bearded system administrators, business women, office workers, housewives and loving wives. <br><br>  The first thought is to go and ask what to give.  But remember yourself.  What do you answer similar questions?  We all know the template and meaningless answers from the category ‚ÄúThe main thing is not a gift, but attention.‚Äù  And the very tradition of asking, ‚ÄúWhat should I give you?‚Äù Very much resembles an attempt to shift the responsibility for resolving one‚Äôs issue onto the shoulders of another person. <br><br><br><br><h4>  Theory of limitations </h4><br><br>  On the one hand, you always want to make a surprise by giving an unexpected and memorable gift. <br>  On the other hand, I want to give the necessary and desired thing. <br>  The third limitation is the gift-giving budget. <br><br>  But these are all trifles, compared with the utter ignorance of <em>what is necessary or would be desirable for the person to get exactly on this day</em> . <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Landed against global</strong> </h4><br><br>  It's clear that every person has global goals: ‚Äúhouse-tree-son‚Äù. <br>  But you can understand the situations when a person wants to get exactly these ‚Äúsquirrel and whistle‚Äù on this very day. <br><br>  Accidentally seen in the store "cool interesting thing" completely changes the priorities. <br>  Time!  And it was precisely this that right here and right now ... and here, on the nose holidays ... and no one knows what the person wanted. <br><br>  Write to the wishlist?  And who will read it? <br>  Send the wishlist to friends?  And where is the guarantee that budgets of friends will be enough to give what is there? <br><br>  It remains only to hope that friends will "make a miracle" :) <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>... And it turned out, as always ...</strong> </h4><br><br>  All thoughts about gifts, as a rule, result in the following result: <br><ol><li>  the guest considers how much money he is willing to spend on a gift </li><li>  goes to the nearest souvenir shop (either around the corner or found on the first page of the Internet search engine); </li><li>  buys there "beautiful something"; </li><li>  gives it to the hero of the occasion; </li><li>  considers his mission accomplished. </li></ol><br>  The culprit of the celebration can only come to terms with the inevitable need to take "surprises" and think about how big his closet is for "things for sometime." <br><br>  If this wardrobe is small or there were a lot of presents, things that have fallen into it can be donated to someone else and get into a new wardrobe ... And so on to infinity ... <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Is this all familiar?</strong> </h4><br><br>  Did you recognize yourself in some part of this post?  Can you say that your gifts are accurate?  How quickly can you choose a friend the right gift, the right here and now? <br><br><br><br><h4>  <strong>Why do I need it?</strong> </h4><br>  My colleagues and I also struggle with uncertainty before each holiday.  Also, we don‚Äôt know what our wives, friends, children, relatives really want as a gift ... maybe we are bad husbands, fathers and relatives ... but the problem does not get smaller. <br><br>  And we also got tired of it. <br>  So tired that we invented a <strong><a href="http://www.activegift.me/%3Futm_source%3Dpost_20110607%26utm_medium%3Dsmm-link%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">service to anonymously clarify the question ‚Äúwhat exactly is better to give?‚Äù</a></strong> . <br>  And we also do not always know what our future users will want.  Therefore, we are looking for the answer to this question in all available ways. <br><br>  I would appreciate <strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php%3Fsk%3Dquestion%26amp%3Bid%3D1787802768755%26amp%3Bqa_ref%3Dpt">answers in the survey</a></strong> and comments :) <br><br>  To be aware of how the solution to this problem is progressing, <br>  Follow us on Twitter: <br>  <a href="http://twitter.com/ActiveGift">Follow @ActiveGift</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ActiveGift">... like Facebook,</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.activegift.me/%3Futm_source%3Dpost_20110607%26utm_medium%3Dsmm-link%26utm_campaign%3DHabr">and log in to ActiveGift using your FB account</a> . <br><br>  As soon as we find a solution to this problem, we will inform you immediately. <br>  According to our forecasts, it will be no later than in a month. <br><br>  Thank you for reading.  :) <br><br>  Tell me plz your opinion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120720/</a></p>
