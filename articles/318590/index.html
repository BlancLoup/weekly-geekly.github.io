But keep in mind that there are thousands of old analog cameras in the world that are successfully operating.  Analogue output is in many devices (for example, in video intercoms) - all this equipment lives safely and is not going to die off in the near future. <br><br>  Is it good or bad?  The answer lies somewhere in the middle, but we, meanwhile, are able to turn any analog video surveillance system into something more modern.  Ivideon began shipping the hybrid DVR <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/videoregistrator-hikvision-ds-7204huhi-f1n/">Hikvision DS-7204HUHI-F1 / N</a> , which for short we call the sound for the Russian ear, the name "Huhi".  With its help you can simultaneously connect analog and IP cameras to our cloud service.

      Further, about the DVR itself and more globally - about the entire analog world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Where you need a hybrid DVR</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d1/6de/c8d/8d16dec8d84f4827b5cf513079b58d45.jpg"><br><br>  So, on some sites there are still analog cameras installed.  Do you need a motivation to switch to IP cameras, even considering all the scant possibilities of outdated solutions?  At first glance, the answer is obvious: the typical 704x576 resolution typical for analog cameras looks sad by modern standards.  Not to mention the possible numerous interferences. <br><br>  Reasons to leave everything unchanged for a business are: <br><br><ul><li>  picture quality is lower, but video requires less disk space, which is important in local solutions; </li><li>  the cost of cameras is lower than digital (for those who already have them, not the most relevant criterion); </li><li>  if IP cameras do not have built-in support for cloud services, then a computer may be needed for their work - the solution for analog cameras is much more compact; </li><li>  installing new cameras is a big expense for the company; </li><li>  it is necessary not only to change the cameras, but also to lay cables (ethernet / optics), install routers and switches ‚Äî take money from somewhere and invest in a project. </li></ul><br>  At one enterprise can be installed dozens of analog cameras, several DVRs connected to computers on a local network (for archives), laid hundreds of meters of cables.  Can you imagine how much money and effort you need to ‚Äúmodernize‚Äù such a system? <br><br>  However, not everything is hopeless.  Any iron can be used as long as it works, if it can be applied in conjunction with the current software. <br><br>  <b>What to do with analog cameras</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88c/d81/076/88cd8107686e4544b55b594b40ab671a.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/cf6/c45/f2dcf6c450344d94b66083de4828c3b2.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/product/videoregistrator-hikvision-ds-7204huhi-f1n/">The Hikvision DS-7204HUHI-F1 / N Hybrid DVR</a> with Ivideon firmware allows you to simultaneously connect analog and IP cameras to the service. <br><br>  You can connect 4 analog cameras and 2 IP cameras or all 6 IP cameras (up to 4 MP) when disconnecting the analog channels.  Such a number of cameras can be considered optimal for an oversized recorder.  Any combination of analog standard and high definition cameras within 4 channels are possible. <br><br>  For analog cameras at the software level, motion detection is built into the recorder.  You can connect a monitor to the recorder and watch the video locally. <br><br>  You can store data as standard in the cloud, and on the DVR itself (if there is a threat of a network break) that supports hard drives up to 6 TB.  You can combine both methods: the DVR itself and / or the hard disk can be stolen, but if you use the cloud as a backup storage, the data will remain in the cloud and will be available regardless of the situation on the site. <br><br>  This is Hikvision with all the usual settings, but in order to add it to your Ivideon account, the standard procedure for assigning a MAC address is sufficient.  All channels appear immediately, both TVI / AHD cameras and any supported IP cameras attached on the recorder itself. <br><br>  <b>Features and Users</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27a/257/1df/27a2571df53d4ba6a3887d3ac1660a41.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, this recorder solves the problem of connecting traditional analog and multi-format cameras to the cloud, and at the same time allows you to keep the previous investments in the system, as well as save when creating a new system, using the same analog cameras.  The cost of installation will be minimal, because you do not have to change the original cable at the facility. <br><br>  The second important point: hybrid archive storage.  There are cases when it is necessary to look part of the cameras purely locally, and part of the output to the cloud.  And the option with the DVR, with a bunch of interfaces and with a hard disk, in this case is very convenient. <br><br>  These two possibilities in combination with others allow us to significantly expand the number of options for building systems with a cloud connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b0/d12/b2e/7b0d12b2e749450c88bedce7c5b5687b.png"><br><br>  The solution with Huhi is a good option for those clients who have 4-6 cameras on one object, not 2-3.  You can configure hybrid storage by duplicating data from critical cameras in the cloud.  And at the same time use all Ivideon features: access via desktop and mobile applications to live video and archive (both in the cloud and local), active event notifications, embedding videos on the site, ‚Äúsharing‚Äù cameras for an unlimited number of users. <br><br>  How much of the whole thing do you need internet?  If you use the video archive <a href="https://markevich.by/raschet-videoarxiva-propusknoj-sposobnosti-seti">calculator</a> , the 4 megapixel camera generates about 4 Mbit / s, and here already 4x4 = 16 Mbit / s.  However, the numbers depend on the settings: where and how to write video, in what resolution, with what frame rate and what bitrate. <br><br>  The recorder is very easy to install: literally after opening the box, you need to remove the cover, install the hard drive, plug in the power and press power.  After that, it remains only to choose a tariff.  All settings take literally 5 minutes and you can watch the recorder channels through Ivideon. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics of the DVR</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>Model</i> : DS-7204HUHI-F1 / N <br>  <i>Number of video channels</i> : 6 <br>  <i>Video output</i> : VGA / HDMI / Analog (CVBS) <br>  <i>Number of audio channels</i> : 4 <br>  <i>Audio in / out</i> : 4 <br>  <i>PoE Power</i> : No <br>  <i>Compression format</i> : H.264, H.264 + <br>  <i>Max.</i>  <i>number of int.</i>  <i>HDD</i> : 1 <br>  <i>Power supply</i> : 12V DC <br>  <i>Operating temperatures</i> : -10 - +55 <br>  <i>Dimensions</i> : 315 √ó 242 √ó 45 mm <br>  <i>Weight</i> : 1.5 kg <br>  <i>Alarm input / output</i> : 4/1 <br>  <i>USB interface</i> : 2x USB 2.0 </blockquote><br>  As you can see, the dimensions of the recorder make it easy to arrange it even at home. <br><br>  The DVR supports analog or high-definition analog cameras (AHD and HD-TVI standards) and IP cameras using the native Hikvision or ONVIF protocol: for example, all Hikvision, Nobelic, Oco Pro, Oco Pro Lite models. <br><br>  The DVR allows you to connect 4 different camera combinations: <br><br>  1) up to 6 IP cameras 4 MP (when disconnecting all analog channels), <br>  2) any combination of standard and high-definition analog cameras (HD-TVI and AHD) within 4 channels, <br>  3) 3 IP cameras and 3 analog ones <br>  4) 4 IP cameras and 2 analog. <br><br>  Resolution and write speed: <br><br><ul><li>  HD TVI 3Mp 15 fps, 1080p 25 fps, 1080p 30 fps, 720p 25k / s, 720p 30k / s, 720p 50k / s, 720p 60 fps; </li><li>  AHD 720p 25 fps; </li><li>  WD1 25 fps </li></ul><br>  Resolution and recording speed for IP cameras: <br><br><ul><li>  2 channels 4Mp 25 fps; </li><li>  Frequency k / s - DOS.  flow: 1/16 fps ~ in real time; sub-flow: WD1 / 4CIF / 2CIF 12 fps; </li><li>  CIF / QVGA / QCIF 25 fps </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb0/ccc/271/cb0ccc271c8f48a6abd35cb229cecdb0.jpg"><br><br>  The following connectors are located on the rear panel of the recorder: <br><br><ul><li>  4 DMC connectors for connecting analog cameras; </li><li>  4 analog connectors; </li><li>  VGA, HDMI, CVBS video outputs (for connecting an external monitor); </li><li>  4/1 alarm input / output; </li><li>  network connector; </li><li>  power connector. </li></ul><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  ‚úî Connecting analog and IP cameras (simultaneously or alternating) to the Ivideon service. <br><br>  ‚úî Possibility of hybrid storage: on a hard disk up to 6 TB, in the Ivideon cloud or by combining both methods. <br><br>  ‚úî Notifications about the status of the DVR / connection. <br><br>  ‚úî Watching video anywhere: from a mobile device, via a desktop browser, locally through a monitor, from other computers installed in the local network. <br><br>  ‚úî Remote setup of cameras (channels): enable / disable camera and sound, set up security directly in your Ivideon account. <br><br>  ‚úî Automatic software update from the cloud. <br><br>  ‚úî Motion detection through Ivideon Server for analog cameras. <br><br>  ‚úî Notifications for motion / sound detection. <br><br>  ‚úî 10,990 rub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318590/</a></p>
