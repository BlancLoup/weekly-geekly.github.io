At the moment, the robot has reached level 3, in May 2018, it was tested in field conditions, covering a distance of several tens of kilometers.  Now the robot has <a href="https://smartcar.starline.ru/">covered</a> more than 2500 kilometers, having driven from St. Petersburg to Kazan. <br><br>  The drone, according to the developers, is able to navigate the road situation.  He can follow a given route, keep a distance, read the markings and signs, bypass obstacles and urgently slow down. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When driving on the highway, the robo-mobile developed a speed of about 80 km / h, improving its result at 40 km / h.  According to project managers, on the road, the system behaved stably and reliably, it coped with both the poor quality of the markup or its complete absence, and one-way traffic.

The first is holding in the lane.  Thanks to the installed sensors, sensors and cameras in the state of the vehicle to recognize the marking, ‚Äúunderstand the lane‚Äù, recognize the traffic situation.  The incoming data uses a control system that calculates the route, directing the car along it. <br><br>  As for the second mode, it allows the car to move in conditions of almost complete absence of marking, in bad weather conditions, in conditions of a large amount of interference and unforeseen factors. <br><br>  In order to move the car without interference, the developers of the company create a high-precision map of the road with waypoints - they are generated according to the principle of the GPS-navigator.  The location of the vehicle on the map is determined using a high-precision satellite navigation receiver, inertial navigation system and odometry. <br><br>  In the process of driving on the highway, the car analyzes the situation around itself, recognizes obstacles, makes decisions about its own "behavior" model.  In order for a computer system to be oriented in its surroundings, lidar, radar, a vision system are necessary. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNow the car is moving on the highway without using a road map and route planner.  If you need to change the direction of movement - at the intersection, at exits and exits from highways and other maneuvers - the system requires the intervention of the operator.  To solve this problem, during the trip we collected data to build a road map and automate these actions, ‚Äùsaid Andrei Alekseev, a project development engineer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e27/9d9/8a7/e279d98a7c5c910208a89bf202516d95.jpg"><br><br>  It should be noted that the robotic car did not work in automatic mode all the time - in order to ensure traffic safety, the operator controlled the most difficult sections of the expensive ones. <br><br>  The most difficult moments in the process of moving along the route were the recognition of the roadway and work with big data.  The project participants reported that in some areas the mobile could not correctly recognize certain areas of the roadway.  With regard to the processing of large amounts of data, due to the high load on the equipment, data processing was periodically performed insufficiently quickly. <br><br>  In general, autonomous machine control technologies are being improved literally every day, and the number of companies conducting research in this area is increasing.  One of the successful projects is <a href="https://habr.com/post/429424/">robotaxi</a> from Daimler AG and Bosch.  The project participants are confident in the capabilities of the robots so much that they decided to start the service of robotic taxis in the second half of 2019. <br><br>  At the moment, the service will work only in a specific region of San Jose, California, USA.  And the most interesting thing is that the trips will be free for passengers - thus, the company will run in their cars in the field.  Of course, the safety of these vehicles has already been raised to a fairly high level, which allows us not to worry too much about the quality of autopilot driving on public roads. <br><br>  Among domestic projects, it is possible <a href="https://habr.com/post/426589/">to distinguish the</a> launch of an unmanned taxi on the territory of Skolkovo.  The service is provided by Yandex.  Initially, a taxi will be available only for residents of the innovation center, and the order is made through the Yandex.Taxi application.  At first, travel will be free for passengers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430986/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430986/</a></p>
