If earlier a wide range of trading tools was available mainly to experienced professionals, now even a beginner can get almost any opportunities if he wishes, but not all traders use these opportunities. <br><br>  So why should a trader have a virtual server, what are its advantages?  Each trader encountered in his difficult work with the problem of a power outage or connection.  And it does not matter whether you are trading from home, from the office or from coworking - as a rule, there is one line of food and communication.  And when power is turned off in a building, the equipment installed in it is usually turned off.  And even if you work from a laptop or tablet, the battery of the mobile device will not save you. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6cd/4a9/481/6cd4a9481eadfbf6bbf4809976465169.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Losses from such failures can be significant.  Failure to close a position, especially during the release of serious news, can cost profits in a few months of work, and sometimes just reset the account.

      How to be in this situation?  Of course, you can go through duplication.  Buy a good UPS, which will power your computer for an hour, a professional router with redundant wired internet channels or ‚Äúspare‚Äù wireless access.  However, such a solution to the problem is a rather costly and difficult method.  If anyone can install a household UPS, even if they are not very well versed in technology, then not everyone can choose the right router and properly configure it. <br><br>  As a rule, setting up this equipment by a third-party specialist will cost almost the price of the device itself.  But in general, the cost of such a reservation can easily amount to 20-30 thousand rubles without taking into account subscriber payments for several communication lines and periodic replacement of batteries in the UPS. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Renting a VPS server is the key to successful trading</font> </h2><br>  There is a more modern, cost-effective solution, and more importantly, a better, more reliable and mobile solution.  This is a virtual dedicated server ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/307494/">VPS / VDS)</a> .  Those who start trading professionally, sooner or later think about how to make it more comfortable and convenient.  That is what VPS servers for traders are for. <br><br>  In the case of a virtual server, you rent some of the computer‚Äôs resources on Windows (or Linux): its hard disk capacity, processor power, RAM, etc. This computer is located in the data center of one of the hosting providers and is accessed via the Internet. <br><br>  You set the parameters of the virtual server when it is created and you can at any time increase its power in accordance with the trading activity. <br><br>  Redundant Internet channels and serviceability through a single control panel, unlimited traffic - all this will allow you to focus on key tasks. <br><br>  Remote trading Windows or Linux platform (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS) will be available around the clock from any device with Internet access (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Android), which makes mobile trading possible without installing additional trading applications. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62e/dce/72d/62edce72de87ff53cd3296fad5dae5a2.png"></div><br>  Traders can use Virtual Private Server - a virtual server in the data center of a provider - to host exchange tools, such as trading terminals (QUIK, MetaTrader, Transaq, etc.).  You can also install on a remote virtual server of the robot that will trade while you are busy with other things.  Since the speed of execution of transactions depends mainly on the broker, the time to react to price changes and decision making is important.  The robot needs only a few nanoseconds to respond to the situation. <br><br>  Automated systems are able to process orders to buy and sell at high speed, so today the largest brokerage companies, banks and hedge funds make deals mainly with the help of robots.  They speed up and simplify the process of stock trading, allow you to earn almost every participant in trading.  A trading robot is trained to trade according to a certain strategy and can do everything on its own.  It is enough to enable it on your terminal. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/896/725/b28/896725b28e47b27dc10eec8f74b6a292.png"></div><br>  You can deploy a ready-to-use VPS server, including for algorithmic trading and auto-follow, in a matter of minutes, and only a few mouse actions will be required to change its configuration for current requirements. <br><br>  A VPS server for trading often provides ready-made environments for traders. <br><br>  It can be deployed from the template offered by the hosting provider with preinstalled software for stock trading, such as MetaTrader, Transaq or QUIK.  The server will be ready to work in a couple of minutes, no need to spend time installing and configuring software tools.  All that remains is to place the required files on the server (keys / certificates, etc.) and specify the data for access to the broker's servers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a1/5b6/f3b/3a15b6f3be794dcfa68ea8ec502e8986.jpg"></div><br>  Key advantages of such a server: <br><br><ol><li>  Low cost of ownership.  One trading terminal with several advisors / robots will require a configuration costing 500-600 rubles per month. <br></li><li>  Multiple redundancy of power supply and communication lines at the data center level. <br></li><li>  Absolute mobility.  You will get access to the server from any PC, tablet, smartphone from anywhere in the world.  At the same time, the speed of interaction of the server itself with the core of the exchange / trading system does not change, which is extremely important when trading. <br></li></ol><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c4/307/aab/5c4307aab8a82df59bf9410070a8f9f5.jpg"></div><br>  Thus, the advantages of using virtual servers are the reliable provision of VPS with uninterrupted communication and power supply, its round-the-clock availability from anywhere in the world, high response times and geographical proximity to the exchange.  When renting a VPS server, you are no longer tied to one computer and can access your server, your terminal, from any computer with Internet access, no matter where you are.  Yes, and keep a lot of running terminals on your home PC is just uncomfortable. <br><br>  Power outages and the loss of Internet access are not terrible for you.  The terminal with advisers is located on the server and will work without interruption due to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/313112/">redundancy and high availability of systems in the data center</a> . <br><br>  The most up-to- <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/314024/">date and powerful equipment</a> is used as a platform for VPS, and they are running the latest versions of the licensed <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/313292/">Windows Server OS</a> , which guarantees high quality and reliability.  The stability and high speed of trading instruments guarantees a service level agreement (SLA) and financial guarantees of continuous availability. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6aa/46e/d07/6aa46ed07cb38a0d50cdb315cc627c98.jpg"></div><br>  It is also worth noting that in addition to the usual virtual servers located in the data centers of providers, some brokers offer their clients to use virtual servers directly in the data center of the Moscow Exchange.  Previously, installing the server in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/325136/">collocation</a> zone of the exchange was very expensive.  Now, every trader can contact the broker with a request to provide such a server.  It will cost 3-4 thousand rubles.  Compared to installing the server in the collocation zone, this is a very small amount. <br><br>  The virtual server in the Moscow Exchange colocation zone is the first step to high-frequency trading (HFT).  This server is recommended to use with direct connection protocols. <br><br>  VPS Features: <br><table><tbody><tr><td width="250">  Mobility <br></td><td>  Access from any computer and the ability to install any software. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  High speed <br></td><td>  Guaranteed Internet channel for access to the Stock Exchange or direct connection.  High speed and reliability of execution of applications. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Convenience <br></td><td>  The ability to choose a server of any configuration, convenience of payment and settings. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Fast start <br></td><td>  Usually the server can be obtained on the day of the order, there is a test period.  Clients can get already configured servers, which practically do not require additional actions to get started.  The setup process usually takes no more than 2 minutes. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Constant readiness <br></td><td>  You no longer need to keep your computer turned on during trading sessions and worry about the execution of trading signals when it is turned off or the connection is interrupted. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Performance <br></td><td>  Servers are located in reliable data centers and have high performance.  As a result, the slippage of transactions is significantly reduced (the time from the arrival of the trading signal to its execution by the system).  Trader does not depend on interruptions in communication. <br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <i><font color="#999999">Material from the site of the broker <a href="https://www.finam.ru/services/promo0004c/">FINAM</a></font></i> <br><br>  You can choose one of the basic configurations, or order a virtual server of the desired configuration.  Along with the basic settings for auto-follow, virtual servers allow you to install your own software (for example, TSLab or Tradematic) to launch and test trading strategies. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">VPS is just</font> </h2><br>  By connecting a VPS, you have at your disposal a remote virtual computer that functions 24 hours a day.  Working with it is no more difficult than with a home PC: in most cases you will have a familiar Windows desktop.  You can perform all the usual operations on such a virtual computer.  In fact, before you all the same Windows, as on a regular PC.  All actions, such as installing programs, copying files, etc., are performed in the same way as on your home computer. <br><br>  Installation and setup of the trading terminal will take almost as much time as with a regular PC.  No less important is the fact that the operation of the terminal and trading robots does not differ from the ‚Äúlocal‚Äù version. <br><br>  For example, to install the MetaTrader 4 terminal, you need to go to your broker‚Äôs website (or to MetaQuotes, developers of the trading platform), download the installation file and run it, then go through the usual installation steps of the program.  After starting the program after installation (if it did not start automatically), you will see the MetaTrader 4 terminal window. Then you can open a demo account and test the operation of the terminal. <br><br>  Recently, there has been a growing interest in the MT4 terminal in conjunction with Linux systems.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/obrforex/blog/281540/">For example</a> , you can install Metatrader 4 on a Linux virtual server with access via x2go. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f91/c59/379/f91c59379b3d183f97685feb92e35ad6.gif"></div><br>  You can disconnect from the VPS, while the trading terminals launched by you and any programs will continue their work.  There are unforeseen situations when, due to some force majeure circumstances, or due to the fault of the provider, the VPS server restarts.  You can make so that all the most important programs and trading terminals after the restart of the system started automatically and could continue their work.  To do this, simply drag the program shortcut to the Startup folder, via the Start menu - All Programs - Startup.  A special service like Ping Admin will allow you to always be aware of the server performance. <br><br>  Thus, using simple steps you get access to a remote desktop.  The only difference from a PC is that all your actions are transferred to the provider's server, so some delay in response to your actions is possible.  But it does not mean that the virtual server "slows down". <br><br>  Comparison of potential profits and server costs suggests the feasibility of using VPS.  A VPS server can be an excellent tool to increase trading efficiency.  This technology is actively used by traders.  At the same time, working with a virtual server will require very little effort at the first stage - to become familiar with the VPS. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">VPS Providers</font> </h2><br>  If you are configured to try this interesting service, then you should start by choosing a VPS provider.  There are a number of providers that provide VPS for rent.  VPS servers are offered directly by brokerage companies.  However, according to experts, there are still quite a few not quite conscientious ones, or companies providing insufficient quality services.  And then there may be negative impressions from working with VPS, system hangs, communication failure and trouble.  Prefer companies with experience in the market, whose services have already benefited a large number of customers who have left positive feedback. <br><br>  You should choose a tariff plan, the capabilities of which will be sufficient for stable operation of the OS and the trading terminal.  This is all the more worth considering if simultaneous operation of several trading terminals is planned.  The more trading terminals you plan to run at the same time, the more memory and CPU resources will be required for this. <br><br>  The connection speed should be high enough for the trading terminal and the desktop to work.  Some providers publish on their website examples of comparing the speed of work in different parts of the country. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfd/fc0/5a7/bfdfc05a79bc6c3617d1f2a6eb0baf58.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Material from the site of the broker <a href="https://www.finam.ru/services/promo0004c/">FINAM</a></font></i> <br><br>  Find out if there is a test mode.  It will be useful to study the service and help determine the tariff plan.  The ordering process is usually simple: you simply select the desired configuration on the website, fill out a form, pay for the order and get instructions on how to connect to your server. <br><br>  In the Russian market you can find a number of interesting proposals.  Here are some of them. <br><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.zerich.com/internet-trading/algotrading/virtual-server.html">Zerich</a> </h3><br>  The Virtual Server service allows you to run auto-followup strategies on remote computers.

Thus, a company engaged in algorithmic trading can use virtual VPS servers to optimize the cost of structure, test any strategies.  It is cheaper than buying expensive equipment.  Another model is that the consumer is a broker company that resells services to end customers.  Within these models, the service can be further divided into several options with the placement of equipment in the data center of the exchange, broker, or provider. <br><br>  Customers ordering VPS servers get the opportunity to connect to the stock exchange with their own trading robot or terminal with minimal network delays.  For example, among the clients of the hosting provider <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/">RUVDS</a> are the largest market players and hundreds of private traders who are provided with virtual servers in their own <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/313112/">data center</a> RUVDS.  The provider team employs specialists with experience in working with financial institutions and traders, as well as people from algo funds and brokerage companies, which allows the company to provide relevant infrastructure for traders' tasks.  Technical support specialists at any time are ready to provide qualified advice or assistance in resolving the problem. <br><br>  A year ago, RUVDS and a number of brokerage companies launched a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/282009/">joint project</a> that allowed customers of the largest brokers to lease virtual VPS servers on a provider‚Äôs equipment located in the colocation zone of the Moscow Exchange's data center.  Brokers' customers were able to place their trading systems and specialized software at low prices without the need to purchase their own expensive equipment, to use the technological capabilities of large dealers and funds.  Modern technologies of stock trading have become more accessible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325862/</a></p>
