  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SALI is your ~ programming language</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Why another programming language? </h2><br>  This is not exactly a programming language, or rather, this is not a programming language at all.  SALI - the language of writing applications.  The program, in the simplest case, is a sequence of commands that a computer executes sequentially.  SALI is a language in which there are no functions, methods, cycles or even executable code, so it does not allow writing programs, but applications ... <br><br>  To hell with intrigue, well under CUT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction </h2><br>  The introduction is not intended at the beginning, so that it is clear that the author is accustomed to thinking according to canons, but not standard.  This is the first of a series of articles on <s>what it‚Äôs like to be God,</s> how to create cross-platform, optimized applications, bypassing programming, using the SALI language.  This article describes the history and reasons for creating SALI.  In the second article, the syntax will be discussed in detail, and in the third, it is planned to provide the reader with the opportunity to try out <s>this crap</s> features of the new language. <br><br>  By the way, the joke about God is higher - not exactly a joke.  At the end of the 2nd article of the cycle, I will explain why.  For now ...

    <h3>  Some water in <s>Kate</s> Katya </h3><br>  I was already a student, wrote ‚Äúlabs‚Äù and ‚Äúcursors‚Äù to fellow students and felt the growing potential of a TRUE-programmer deep in my heart, somewhere very deep.  This went on until one teacher, who was giving a lecture on the theory of automata, formulated a thesis that caused cognitive dissonance in me and, in fact, marked the beginning of the formation of a new writing application ideology.  The thesis was something like <blockquote>  Here you are writing code, thinking that you are creating a program, but in fact the result is a finite state machine. </blockquote>  ‚ÄúYou have blue duct tape!‚Äù - I thought, but later I wondered why people design finite automata using an intermediate link - programming?  After all, any intermediary in the system reduces the resulting efficiency.  In any case, with the transformation of energies it works ... <br><br><h2>  Eureka! </h2><br>  Years passed, I worked as a programmer, studied new technologies and techniques, algorithms and methods for solving applied problems, and gradually, projecting this onto the ideology of the future SALI, something quite attractive appeared, at least at first glance.  Everything was thought out to the smallest detail, but one single idea was missing to make it all go. <br>  More recently, I delved into Bootstrap2 and that‚Äôs where my eureka was covered.  Later it turned out that a similar eureka of many years hovers in the depths of Excel - recalculation of the cell value using the formula, when the value of another cell participating in the formula changes.  Everything ingenious is simple, but before that I didn‚Äôt work deeply enough with Excel or Bootstrap, so I appreciated this EUREKE, for which many thanks to the people who invented this event. <br><br><h2>  The essence </h2><br>  If you, dear reader, are related to programming (otherwise you can skip this paragraph, in the next article everything will be chewed up in great detail) and know / heard about associative arrays and using them as a container of configuration data used to initialize the application, then imagine that the value by the key is described by a mathematical formula, the arguments of which can be other elements of the array, with which the built-in ability to set conditional calculations and the whole kitchen of dependencies (I like to use  use the word "correlations") is maintained by the kernel during the entire time the application is running.  If you succeed, it means that you have in some sense understood the SALI ideology. <br><br>  Now a little patience, learn the simple syntax to madness and the world will become brighter (but this is not accurate).  Patience is necessary due to the fact that the moment of beta testing is postponed due to the need to earn a main job. <br><br>  Exceptionally at will, you can help speed up the release with your programming skills and / or <s>hryvnia, dollar, euro,</s> old good old Donat (apparently there is no need to beg, so if someone really wants, will I try to restore webmoney or something? and unsubscribe in the comments).  In the meantime, enthusiastic people are considering the amount and relevance of donation, as well as the second article in the cycle, a link to which will appear here as soon as I finish it - towards the future (so that it doesn‚Äôt mean, but in some advertising it sounded quite loud and even pathetic).  Thank you for your attention, before the hub. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340464/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340464/</a></p>
