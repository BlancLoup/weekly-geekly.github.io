Five years since the release of Windows XP, five years that it took to develop and push Windows Vista into the world. <br><br>  However, Microsoft wants you to double the deadline and recall the grandiose view of Windows 95, which coincided with the update of the Office suite and ended with the biggest celebration Redmond ever saw.  I remember how the cumulus clouds in Redmond‚Äôs blue sky ominously resembled a box of Windows disks (as if Bill Gates himself had ordered them to come for the holiday) and the release of evening news with a story about people queuing up at computer stores to dawn to buy an operating system . <br><br>  According to Microsoft, the release of Windows Vista, Office 2007 and Exchange Server 2007 is an event of the same level.

      In an interview last week, Microsoft Vice President, Mike Sievert told me that the upcoming releases will be the biggest event for the high-tech industry, because for more than 10 years, Microsoft has not presented new products that would simultaneously cover the operating system. system, and office applications, and collaboration tools.  Releases, according to Sivert, "are very timely and absolutely coordinated with the course of our main customers." <br><br>  Is it so?  Is this trinity as grand as it wants us to instill Microsoft?  "All-in-one" and can not do? <br><br>  There are no questions, because of the customizable gadgets on the desktop and the powerful Windows Vista graphics engine, it looks much more attractive than Windows XP.  Improved search tools, long-awaited improvements in protection mechanisms and mobile functions, automatic synchronization of data with backup systems, and a new format for storing installation files, facilitating the introduction of the operating system in the company. <br><br>  <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/sharepoint/">Office Sharepoint Server</a> is a prominent collaboration system.  Sharepoint Server supports enterprise search with XML modules that link to databases and provides a platform for <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">wiki</a> and blogging.  The main innovation in Exchange 2007 is a unified messaging system; voice mail now comes directly to the computer. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, Microsoft has assembled an impressive software platform, which must have been updated several times during the development process (it‚Äôs unlikely in 2001 they thought about blogs and wikis).  But there is one important detail that was not there at the time of the grand presentation in 1995, and that, of course, is the Web and all that it can offer as a platform for applications.  What programs must necessarily be on a personal computer?  Maybe the Network (easily accessible from any device using a browser) is more suitable for collaboration?  Wouldn't Microsoft's offerings be proprietary in an increasingly open source world? <br><br>  Well, I do not think at all that for Microsoft there is an immediate danger of losing users of personal computers, especially corporate ones.  The director of information technology at one of the consumer goods companies told me that they, of course, would switch to new versions ‚Äî from the point of view of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Cost_of_Ownership">total cost of ownership,</a> the Windows platform has repeatedly proven its worth.  When you have thousands of personal computers and laptops around the world, some standard way of doing business is needed.  Without questions, most users migrate sooner or later. <br><br>  But what will new, younger and growing companies do?  Or those who have not lost flexibility or the desire to try something new, perhaps more simple and cheap?  And if they succeed, how quickly will the others understand this? <br><br>  The value of Microsoft technologies and products is not questioned, otherwise the company would still reign on personal computers.  Yes, all of these companies are experiencing online alternatives or open source alternatives can go back to Microsoft in search of something more standard, stable and familiar. <br><br>  And they may not return. <br><br>  In any case, I get comfortable in the chair and take an extra portion of popcorn.  A fascinating spectacle for the years ahead - look in which direction personal computers and collaboration tools will evolve. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30869/</a></p>
