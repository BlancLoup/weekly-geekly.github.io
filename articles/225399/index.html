While in the West people were already buying on the Net, this phenomenon only took root in us - in particular, because sales of cataloged products were popular in the West several decades ago, which allowed us to create an advanced logistics system before the start of the Internet -sales  Not surprisingly, ecommerce in Russia still lags far behind foreign standards. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Dimanius/tns-rif-2013">situation</a> with the penetration of the Internet is changing, and there are more and more good online stores.  ‚ÄúAudiomania‚Äù has been on the market for almost 17 years, and <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/">audiomania.ru</a> online store has been operating for 10 years, and we are sure that we understand something in online trading.

    <h4>  Online store is not a cheap business </h4><br>  Until now, quite often there is a situation where people create an online store, not really understanding the possible difficulties.  It is no secret that most online stores are created because the founders have agreements with a supplier.  Or there is a technician who can run the site.  In addition, there is a perception that the Internet is ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, that is, the creation of the site will restrict the company's main costs.  At the same time, in fact, to make potential buyers know about the new online store is not easier than offline.  Therefore, to open your website and simply declare it and hope that people will flock in droves - at least naive.  An online store is not a separate type of business; therefore, traditional retail tasks and corresponding expenses will be required. <br><br>  Moreover, the cost structure of a company that has an online store differs from traditional retail.  But this does not mean that online shopping is a cheap business.  For its full operation, we need offices, warehouses, equipment, specialized software and its support.  Without consultants, too, will be problematic.  And not so much now online stores that do not have retail space. <br><br><h4>  Attracting customers online is more expensive </h4><br>  This is a fact, therefore it is necessary to pay more attention to working with customers.  Many companies forget about the customers they have attracted in the past, and switch to new ones.  But the fact that a person bought something on the website in the past also says that he will readily return and buy more if the first experience was successful and the company has not forgotten its client in the future. <br><br>  You should always work with your audience - both before the purchase, and during and after.  And the Internet provides all the possibilities for this, and these opportunities are far from always related to advertising.  In Audi Amania, regular customers make half of the orders - we follow this ‚Äúbattle‚Äù of newbies and experienced buyers.  And it happens that the regular customers win the victory - despite the fact that the growth rate of the store audience remains. <br><br><h4>  Advertising and demand creation </h4><br>  Without advertising to survive online store is almost impossible.  However, you need to think about what, how and where to advertise.  For example, in recent years, many large (especially international) companies are transferring part of their advertising budgets from television to the Web.  This is due to the fact that almost all of the active Russian audience already has access to the Network.  Many of these people do not watch TV and "hook" them in other ways is simply impossible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f1/83d/7f4/3f183d7f406b63fe7e5e741940e5f2f8.png"><br>  <i>Employee "Audiomania"</i> <br><br>  At the same time, it is quite realistic to use ‚Äútelevision‚Äù content on the Web - you can upload videos on YouTube, create various banners, including animated ones.  The main difference between such large companies and small stores is that they are advertised in other ways.  They create demand, and do not use the already formed demand.  Online stores, however, basically ‚Äúpile up‚Äù only the already fully formed demand, work with people who are in the lowest stages of the sales funnel.  At the same time, a large number of people remain on the Web who are not going to buy anything, but perhaps would be interested in one or another group of goods. <br><br>  Most online stores do not have product training information or any other way to get it, so people search for it in other places.  As a result, the online store does not create additional value, and therefore competes only for the final price. <br><br>  At the same time, other advertising methods are considered ineffective, because traditional analytics, which consider the conversion by the last click, show very few sales from these sources.  It requires a multi-channel view of advertising, but, unfortunately, very few people think about it. <br><br><h4>  Do not reinvent the wheel </h4><br>  Another common situation is the failure of ideas ‚Äúbrought in‚Äù from abroad.  Often, entrepreneurs believe that they have brought something really useful, but later it turns out that no one needs a product or service here.  In fact, it may not be at all that the idea is bad, but that people blindly copy Western ideas and solutions that do not always work for us without adaptation. <br><br>  One more important point that you should not forget: people believe that ecommerce is a separate market or a market segment, and traditional marketing does not work here, and this is a mistake.  People in ecommerce are exactly the same as offline and subject to the usual marketing laws. <br><br><h4>  The customer is always right </h4><br>  The slogan ‚Äúthe client is always right‚Äù should be expressed in the company's work every day, it‚Äôs not just a motivating poster on the wall (the client is not always right, but to inform him about it and to prove it wrong is superfluous).  Most Russian businessmen do not fully agree with this statement.  They try to argue with a client that makes no sense.  After all, the last word always remains for him.  The client decides whether to buy here again or not. <br><br>  It is always necessary to be on the client‚Äôs side, even if, in general, he is wrong.  A simple example is the exchange and return of goods.  Most often, in order to carry out this procedure, the client must pass the goods, wait until they are sent for examination (if a breakdown has occurred), etc.  We in Audiomiania in such situations simply change the product without talking or take it and give it back.  Without any delay.  The client was already injured - he bought a thing that broke or, for some reason, did not like him.  Why make him suffer more? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/539/d98/e3c/539d98e3cb97e7a3b62c757395f36cad.png"><br>  <i>Conceptual Salon "Audimania"</i> <br><br><h4>  Own development </h4><br>  This is our experience, perhaps it will not suit everyone.  But in Audiomiania, almost all the tools used for work are created within the company.  As soon as we had the opportunity to develop ourselves, we began to do it - in 2007, before this time we had three different systems: warehouse, accounting, accounting - which were almost completely unrelated. <br><br>  Why do we do this?  It‚Äôs very simple - those customization options that give you your own tools allow you to work faster, scale easily and use staff‚Äôs capabilities more effectively.  Many companies are forced to use a larger number of employees to process fewer orders than ours - this is information from colleagues from the market.  Moreover, this applies to both the purchasing department, the warehouse, and the sales department. <br><br>  We use powerful warehouse analytics that take into account the dynamics of sales, company growth and many other factors to forecast demand.  Buyers use this system every day.  So we buy as many goods as we need in the near future.  As a result, we effectively allocate resources.  After all, not purchased "extra" product - it is free space in the warehouse for the right product.  And this is money. <br><br><h4>  "Mail of Russia" works as it can </h4><br>  In Russia, in general, there is a tradition to scold someone, thereby justifying their failures.  With regard to the field of e-commerce heard a lot of reproaches at the "Mail of Russia".  The truth is that in fact there are no problems interfering with the development of business related to Mail. <br><br>  It is necessary to understand that ‚ÄúMail of Russia‚Äù is a cheap and low-quality delivery method.  If this is taken as a fact, then more questions do not arise.  Yes, deadlines are rarely respected, but everyone knows about it.  This is not a surprise that the ‚Äú3 days delivery‚Äù is promised, but in reality the package is being shipped for a week.  Everyone understands who they are dealing with. <br><br>  In principle, people are ready to overpay for a more convenient way of delivery, or even pick up the package by self, especially if it is on the way.  The main thing is to offer different delivery options, show them on the site so that the client can choose.  We also implemented a so-called ‚Äúdelivery calculator‚Äù on the website of Audimania, with which you can roughly find out how much the order will reach your city with a specific delivery method. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Despite the fact that business in Russia, like many other things related to our country, has its own specifics, there is a certain set of practices that, when applied, are much easier to achieve success.  In e-commerce business, the main one is the understanding of who the business is for.  Much depends on the answer to this question.  Unfortunately, many work for themselves, not for the client.  And if the company works ‚Äúfor all who need the goods‚Äù or ‚Äúfor all who have money‚Äù - it goes along a dead-end path. <br><br>  Many interesting projects are closed only because their founders thought more about how to make money, and not about who it is all about.  After all, the most important thing in business is the client.  Ideally, a satisfied customer.  Once entrepreneurs understand this, many seemingly unreliable at first glance correct business decisions will come "by themselves." <br><br>  In addition, it is necessary to look at someone else's experience, both domestic and foreign - many interesting things have been invented in the world.  It is necessary to study possible moves, learn from the mistakes of others, borrow good ideas.  But at the same time, you need to understand that it is impossible to ‚Äúcopy‚Äù someone's successful business.  You need to learn from experience, mistakes, victories and, based on this knowledge, <br>  go your way. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225399/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225399/</a></p>
