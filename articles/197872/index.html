Inside just a lot of stars.  Between them, you can move and, in between times, assess the scale of the universe ‚Äî a rather beautiful picture allows it.  Control is carried out by the mouse. <br><br>  All this beauty was written on the engine THREE.js, in combination with CSS and WebGL to display text.  Information about the stars and their coordinates is taken from the base <a href="http://astronexus.com/">HYG</a> , which in turn is a compilation of the other three. <br>  According to one of the project participants, the idea was born as a side effect of the engine research.

      And, a small excerpt based on real events. <br><br><blockquote>  Quite a bit of time has passed since the end of Michael Chang ( <i>comment from a member of the Google creative team</i> ) of one of his projects.  The project was defeated, and it seemed that everything was finished.  Customers were satisfied, the target audience positively appreciated the efforts of the master, and the master himself, to be honest, was slightly proud of the result of her work.  Everything is back to square one.  However, over time, the joy of victory began to gradually give way to the frailty of life.  The habitual rhythm of the life of the deadliner demanded a new batch of coffee, but in no way a relaxed reading of the news line between the long yawns. <br>  From boredom, Michael decided to resume his experiments on the THREE.js engine.  It was impossible to call these experiences something unusual - rather, he simply explored a new instrument, like every self-respecting master who wants to develop further in his profession.  But in the case of programming, it definitely could not end with anything good. <br>  It was past midnight on the clock when a slight chill suddenly ran through the body of Michael.  The master noticed that with some changes in the scale of the scene, the output is incredibly beautiful pictures.  These pictures became even more interesting after adding additional particles.  With repeated magnification, each point of the image blurred, creating the illusion of observation through a microscope.  At a distance - the scene was like a small island in distant space.  Michael thoughtfully paced the room.  I didn't want to sleep at all.  Ideas pursued him.  Not the last role played recently passed Mass Effect. <br>  The sun barely got out of the horizon when the parser issued a piercing beep.  Master flinched.  On the dark screen, the only inscription - "Total: 119,617" - stood still.  The day has already gone right.  One hundred nineteen thousand excellent stars, along with their coordinates, lurked somewhere on the hard drive.  It remains to breathe into this pile of bytes a bit of life. </blockquote><br>  <i>The original is broken, and code pages appear instead ...</i> <br><br>  PS As it turned out, it already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158701/">was</a> .  Shit happens (: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197872/</a></p>
