And here in the LiveMarketing.ru blog a <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/2006/03/20/241">wonderful quote</a> from the novel ‚ÄúDance, dance, dance‚Äù of the same unsinkable Japanese appeared.  Quote about our needs.  Where do they come from?  What for?  Just a few paragraphs, and how accurately noticed.  Still, the Japanese have raisins! <br><br>  We do not go far, and we remain all in the same blog.  Now you need to read the article ‚Äú <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/2006/03/03/225">Blogs, money and other opportunities</a> .‚Äù  The author really rushes right between two topics - earnings through a blog and the popularity of RSS.  But we are only on hand, because it turns out two utilities in one text.  Actually, I also ask our readers the question: ‚Äú <em>What do you think about the migration of content from the web to RSS and the possibilities that the blog gives it to the author?</em>  ‚ÄùHussars, be silent!

      About technology web 2.0 does not seem to write just lazy.  All around (even saleswomen in newsstands) praise this old novelty and try to invent still unused epithets in their messages.  But the author of the blog fmm is not engaged in verbiage, and specifically <a href="http://felixm.blogspot.com/2006/03/web-2c-web-2b.html">makes us all</a> make money with the help of this technology.  No, it does not publish a working scheme, but only distributes several ideas for free.  We must take, just give. <br><br>  My grandmother, Nina Kuzminichna, played hockey very well.  Perhaps now she is not averse to chasing the puck with me, but my granddaughter has grown up and threw the stick on the mezzanine.  However, the Legco.NET blog assures me that it published <a href="http://legco.net/2006/03/17/vse_chto_vasha_babushka_xotela_nauchitsja_delat_s_ajax/">Everything your grandmother wanted to learn to do with Ajax</a> , but was embarrassed to ask.  I would not be surprised if, in the time free from hockey, Grandma learned to program in Ajax.  Even despite the lack of a computer.  The same message is a large collection of links to tutorials and articles on Ajax, divided into several headings. <br><br>  How many ways are there to communicate between people?  Well, personally, so to speak, as you see the interlocutor, well, by phone, well, by ICQ.  And, of course, by e-mail!  And Alexander Lozhechkin, especially for those who do not know, prepared the article ‚Äú <a href="http://itblogs.ru/blogs/alexander_lozhechkin_msft/archive/2006/03/15/4722.aspx">Effective communication by e-mail - 7 simple rules that can save years of working time for you and your interlocutors</a> .‚Äù  Many theses were known to me, and some were very useful.  True, I, like Alexander, do not have to answer eighty letters a day, yet correspondence takes a certain big chunk of time.  So the optimization of working with e-mail has only benefited me.  I suggest to note this business!  Sergey Pozniak and Dima Bardiyan are you with me? <br><br>  Gentlemen web page designers are so funny!  Then they use span'ami, then suddenly div'ami, then start tables (apparently from laziness) with different classes and, finally, begin to do everything in css.  I speak - magic, amusing people.  Yes, Andrei?  And one of these non-standard people is blogging with the tender name Steppenwolf's Lair.  And not just leads, but invites us to participate in the deadly war <a href="http://flack.ru/2006/03/16/div-vs-table">Div vs. Vs.</a>  <a href="http://flack.ru/2006/03/16/div-vs-table">Table</a> .  The author himself seems to be in favor of the table.  I ask everyone who understands the topic after this statement not to shake his head with disappointment, but to follow the link and read it is not so simple. <br><br>  Almost forever, our blog intruder's register talks about the <a href="http://register.intruder.ru/2006/03/14/goblin-feed/">FEED43</a> (Feed For Free) service, which allows you to create a feed (RSS) for any site.  I think I don‚Äôt need to remind you that a website without RSS is considered a move by the entire civilized world.  The latest declaration of human rights clearly states that: ‚Äú... everyone has the right to his own RSS feed, regardless of religion and skin color."  Or are you anti-globalists? <br><br>  Our compatriot Jamshid has <a href="http://jamshid.ru/k2">opened a section</a> entirely devoted to K2 on the pages of his blog.  Behind such a succinct name is a great theme for Wordpress (in this case, the (themes) theme is a skin, a template).  So all novice bloggers visit is strongly recommended.  Life will be much easier.  Although we don‚Äôt complain so, right? <br><br>  It's amazing what different differences are the heads of people.  I also thought that only brains, but no.  I, for example, have it hamsters, and the author of the blog Stranger than Fiction is exclusively <a href="http://shevtsov.fanstvo.com/2006/02/18/velosipedyi-v-moey-golove/">bicycles</a> .  Following the link you will find out the answer to the question ‚ÄúWhy reinvent the wheel?‚Äù And the mystery of ancient Egyptian bicycles.  And also about people who have forgotten how to ride a bike.  Joke, no such. <br><br>  Another blog, which is not the first time in our review (and this is a great honor!) The iConText blog.  This time, the author decided to play off three well-known search engines (hmm, not a very fresh idea).  The results of a small experiment, he shares with us.  And the results were pretty <a href="http://icontext.ru/blog/2006/03/10/relevantnost-rezultatov-poiska/">amazing</a> . <br><br>  A very small <a href="http://lie-g.livejournal.com/226421.html">selection of references</a> in the blogger Lie.  Pay special attention because the links lead to different retro-images: postcards, advertisements and illustrations.  About the beginning and middle of the last century.  Quite entertaining.  No, there is no pornography.  I regret myself. <br><br>  I think all sports fans know who Elena Isinbayeva is.  For those who still do not, I will inform you that this is the world record holder in women's high jump with a pole.  I accidentally came across an article in which journalists ask a reasonable question: ‚Äú <a href="http://pnews.livejournal.com/1836.html">Who is mr Isinbaeva?</a>  ".  This quote will help me: ‚Äú <em>Two bodyguards, accompanying Elena Isinbayeva on all trips, are actually in the staff of the NPO.</em>  <em>Khrunichev, the main Russian manufacturer of space technology</em> .  The obvious incredible near us and it not only walks, but also jumps in height with a pole!  Sergey Bubka in disbelief. <br><br>  Darwin Award, one of my favorite.  More I love only the contest "Miss Universe" for obvious reasons.  Igor Karev introduces us to the <a href="http://cheremis.livejournal.com/90954.html">winners and the winner of</a> the Darwin Prize for the 2005th year.  Just in case, I‚Äôll clarify that this prize is given to those people who in the most ridiculous way deprived themselves of the opportunity to contribute to the human gene pool, i.e.  died, leaving no offspring, or simply lost the physical ability to leave him. <br><br>  Living on credit becomes a lifestyle.  I have not yet had to take a loan from a bank, but I sincerely sympathize with the loan officers who have to communicate with people like me.  And on the following link you can read that these inspectors <a href="http://caracalla.livejournal.com/71336.html">write themselves in a notebook</a> when they listen to us.  Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. <br><br>  The girl hiding under the pseudonym Golden Fish, very vividly and in detail tells about her <a href="http://calabazza.livejournal.com/369628.html">grandfather</a> .  It is so exciting that I firmly promised to write something similar about my grandparents.  Do not worry, it will not be published in ‚ÄúKV‚Äù, the main editor.  Do not miss out on moral considerations. <br><br>  Another <a href="http://prervana.livejournal.com/615904.html">cute</a> girl <a href="http://prervana.livejournal.com/615904.html">nostalgic</a> about the pop of the late 90s (and it seems that it was just yesterday).  Although I still have her enthusiasm for the shooters, the virus and other Declov difficult to divide.  Am I so old?  By the way, I recently found out here, we'll all die someday.  What is not a reason for optimism? <br><br>  And I will finish my review with full and final pornography.  But she is unlikely to excite anyone.  Of course, under the link you can take a look at the nudity, but all the porn stars you see there have already died.  What is not just like that, and committed suicide.  Always amazed at the inexhaustible fantasy of collectors, this one collects <a href="http://o-b-vinitel.livejournal.com/2006/03/16/">dead pornstar suicides</a> . <br><br>  Your personal Khaletsky <strong>Alexey Agregator</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006120603.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ12, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288044/</a></p>
