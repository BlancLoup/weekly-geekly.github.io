      There are three of us in the department: the head and two specialists, to whom I belong.  Three serious projects plus a few small ones.  This is my starting point for growth in the PM.  Yes, yes, I really want to become a manager.  Then a little story about how I realized what I want from work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started back in school.  No, I was not a headman.  I was very strong in mathematics, easily grasped everything and got great pleasure from explaining how certain problems were solved and I watched how the people for whom I tried could continue to solve them independently.  I was not an excellent student.  I was above average (language problem).  So I made my first and informed choice of a profession - a teacher. <br><br>  The first year of my studies fascinated me with Delphi programming.  I wrote small utilities that I needed to facilitate communication with the computer.  You do not think anything, I was with you on the computer (from the moment when Resource Hacker got into the hands of me between 10 and 11 classes in the summer, then I seriously began to be interested in PC architecture and Windows structure).  The ability to independently generate tasks for solving quickly dried up, because  there was no need for them.  At this time I was fascinated by the scientific work at the department.  The real scientific work that accompanied me throughout my training. <br><br>  On the 2nd course I was introduced to Habr.  Ever since I became a community frequenter.  At the same time I began to look for interesting blogs and portals where IT-digests were.  Delphi I used less and less.  The science began to eat the lion's share of my university and not only time.  I began to present myself after 5 years among experienced scholars or teachers of our department, because then you can combine two of my favorite classes. <br><br>  My life was quietly flowing.  In the 3rd year, more precisely in the summer between the 3rd and 4th courses, I got married.  It would seem that personal life has nothing to do with work, but it played an important role in making me who I am to this day. <br><br>  In the fourth year I became interested in web-technologies.  I chose Drupal as a basis (thanks, habr!) And started to dance from it.  Gradually, trying to understand the work of the modules, I began to delve into the world of php.  There html and css quietly pulled up.  I was engaged at the level of a hobby and made business card sites for friends.  I don‚Äôt know how to draw, so all the images were drawn from Ineta.  It seems to be a shame, but neither I nor my friends claimed to use these works for commercial activities. <br><br>  The end of the 4th year was a turning point.  I‚Äôve already worked the nth number of practical hours at school, I came to understand that numerous ‚Äúreforms‚Äù turned the environment where I wanted to work for the good of society into something inexpressive and terrifying.  So before me was the problem of reorientation.  After a long thought, two roads lined up before me.  No, not yellow brick.  Where they would lead me, I did not know then.  The choice lay between the scientific work at a research institute and the world of IT.  This choice helped me to make my beloved, forcing all the same to figure out what I like most of all, apart from teaching. <br><br>  Since  I decided to go to the IT field, then the thesis project took a very complex and versatile.  The result of the diploma was to be the writing and publication of scientific and methodological materials for future generations of students.  It was hard.  I had four goals in front of me and there were no ways in which these tasks could be solved.  Tasks were divided into subtasks.  Some subtasks were broken down into even smaller ones, which in turn were streamlined and combined to save time and resources.  Four questions that lie even in the same plane, but far from each other.  Urgently had to pull up knowledge.  All my time was divided into 3 stages: day, evening and night - in the morning I could have a little sleep.  During the day the experiment, in the evening the processing and description of the results, at night the comparison with the previously obtained ones.  At the weekend I rested and devoted time to my family.  Everything fell out of the head on Saturday morning and was also rapidly returning on Monday.  3 more people worked with me (2 directly and 1 on their related work).  They had to delegate part of the work, otherwise I would have gone astray and everything would have failed.  I was not embarrassed that the people with whom I directly worked - the teachers of our department - are people much older than me.  We are all in the same boat.  Then I began to notice that to divide and delegate, and then to collect and process I get quite successfully.  Thus, it took 4 months from an abstract task to a concrete result (publication of 2 and preparation for publication of 2 more scientific and methodological materials with a total volume of almost 300 pages).  Almost all the tasks had to be carried out in parallel, because  I could not work every day for a particular installation.  The constant dispute with the supervisor about the research methods, the need for certain resources, the results of the work and the deadline for submitting reports has become commonplace.  The work was hard, my fellow students looked at me like an idiot, I myself sometimes felt that way, because  I was very tired, but this work brought me great moral satisfaction.  I liked to feel involved in the project, while involvement was not at the level of the executor, but at the level of the coordinator of the work.  It was important for me to know everything that happens not only in our project, but also in the projects of my colleagues, because  it was necessary to build a work plan for at least a week and coordinate it with those people who could use the equipment we needed.  It was then that I, an ambitious extrovert, and realized what I want to do. <br><br>  After graduation, I was assigned to the IT department of one of the government departments.  System administration was my responsibility (exactly how I got there - this is a separate and very long song).  Since  I always thirst for new knowledge and skills, the list of the functions I perform has quickly grown.  I was the only one in the team who wanted to upgrade the user service technology.  I had to spend a large amount of time to infect my colleagues with the thought of the gain (we are talking about reducing the time to perform a certain set of functions).  Partially modernizing the mind and approaches of the work was accomplished (the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Help Desk, which went into the testing phase of our department, started a knowledge base, new, progressive approaches to administration, creating interest in something new).  I worked in this position for 5 months - and they noticed me in the central office of our ministry.  They offered a job in the IT project management department.  I have not thought for a long time.  The difference in money did not compensate for the increase in the volume of work, but this is a completely different level and experience.  And I like my new job much more, and this is important. <br><br>  The whole idea is that the ‚Äúdeveloper-manager‚Äù chain looks unnatural, but has a right to exist.  I don‚Äôt know a manager who would immediately take the position of a manager, but I know managers who went to the developers, they just realized that it‚Äôs easier and more convenient for them to carry out assignments than to make decisions and delegate work. <br><br>  In my not many years, I tried many things: to teach, to carry out scientific work, to participate in the design of scientific equipment, to broadcast on Internet radio, to write slogans, to persuade people to buy a product, to be a developer, to be a courier and a loader, to predict and plan and much more.  All this helped to get a large number of different skills and knowledge, as well as to decide what exactly I want to do.  And for this I will strive. <br><br>  IMHO - it is impossible to become a manager from the student's bench.  You can not learn from the books.  All this can only give a basis for development and a general understanding of the things that are happening around.  In order to become a leader, you need to come to the realization of the difficulties that will arise, to be ready to shine everything and ignite your ideas in the minds of your subordinates, to be able to listen to ideas, constructively discuss and implement standing, try to maintain friendly relations, but not be afraid to assign work and punish for its failure.  Well, to encourage, of course. <br>  I really hope that this publication will help someone to solve the question of his future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165469/</a></p>
