This device is really interesting - and after all, such projects appear constantly, not individual craftsmen, but already large companies, like Electrolux, are working on them.  Rather, not only large, and that pleases - not only foreign.  Recently, it was reported that a group of Russian developers was engaged in the creation of devices that can be called "smart", and which are aimed at technology enthusiasts.  Their first device was the kettle.  Yes, we are accustomed to the electric kettle, which suddenly "wised up." <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This advanced kettle was able to take readings on the water level, its temperature, and then transmit this data over the wireless Wi-Fi network to the user.  By itself, not directly in the brain, before the teapots, even advanced ones, did not reach.  No, the user receives information on the smartphone, good, along with the kettle was created and the corresponding application that allows you to control the unit to boil water completely.

      Personally, I really liked the function of maintaining the water temperature at a constant level.  We all know how reluctant to rise from the chair / chair, and go to the kitchen to turn off the screaming kettle, which has already lost more than half of its water reserves.  If we are talking about an ordinary electric kettle, then it will shut itself off, but now the water will gradually cool down, and when we approach it, after long work, we have to boil again.  And here everything is simple - the temperature is set, say, at 64 degrees (of course, before that the water was already boiling), it means that the temperature will be maintained until the owner needs it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dc/c9a/5e8/7dcc9a5e8e7cea5a1b57c960c282202e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to this function, there are still many "chips" that allow you to make life more convenient and interesting.  For example, you can turn on the kettle directly from your smartphone a few minutes before coming home. <br><br><ul><li>  Of course, in the morning, when you install the appropriate settings, this kettle will meet you with hot water of the desired temperature. </li><li>  The kettle can "advise" what water temperature to use for different types of tea. </li><li>  The kettle can prepare water for infant formula, heating water to 38 degrees. </li><li>  Well, and the kettle will send you a message on the smartphone after it has prepared the water.  Or rather, not only on a smartphone, because there are applications for this device under Windows, Linux, Mac. </li></ul><br><br>  Here is a little more detailed description of the functions of this kettle: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/887/9d3/87d/8879d387d86bbe5a57a9748a14dcd15c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the developers, the kettle can be easily integrated into the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù home system, if you have one.  Well, if not, then this may be the first step in creating such a system. <br><br>  By the way, the price of "smart" kettle is not so great as one might think.  Buying it will cost about 100-150 US dollars.  By the way, a couple of days ago I chose a toaster in one well-known retail chain, and I saw ordinary, albeit pretty, electric kettles for the same price.  And after all, these are the most common units, they are just ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù. <br><br>  And here - a Wi-Fi module, a smartphone application, notifications, and so on and so forth. <br><br>  A spoon of tar in this whole barrel of honey can only be that there are still working prototypes of the teapot, but you can only buy it in a few months, somewhere like that.  I hope that by Christmas you can make yourself such a gift.  But so far the exact date of launching the kettle into production is unknown, unfortunately. <br><br>  And yes, I would like to finish the note with a phrase like, ‚ÄúDo you still boil?  Then we go to you, ‚Äùbut this phrase seems to have already been used by manufacturers of laundry detergent.  So do without slogans :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192980/</a></p>
