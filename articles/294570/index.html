It will happen on October 2 and 3, on the territory of Digital October, where dozens of reports will be read in three tracks of the conference and several trainings with invited Western gurus in the field of Lean-methodologies and techniques will be organized. <br><br>  To begin with, what exactly is the <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">Modern Management Methods</a> conference that we organize.  First of all, it is the assemblage point of all interested industry professionals, an opportunity to get to know the faces of colleagues and get to know them individually, listening to cutting-edge information from foreign speakers.  All of them come to Moscow with one goal: to share a history of solving real business problems, formulating a pragmatic and effective plan for changes in the company or division, based primarily on facts.

    <h2>  <font color="#f97a45">Last year</font> </h2><br>  Lean Kanban is being held by us for the second year - in 2014 we organized the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/11340/">first event</a> , which turned out to be quite successful.  The whole day at the conference, focused on a fairly narrow layer of management personnel in information technology, sounded important and interesting words on a variety of topics: from ‚ÄúAnti-Fragmentation‚Äù by Nassim Taleb, descriptions of various ways and experiences of scaling, balancing and optimizing business processes to specific examples of agile implementation -methodik on the ground.  In order not to be unfounded - <a href="http://msk14.leankanban.ru/program/">on the website of the conference in</a> 2014 you can find video reports and slides of presentations.  Last year, our conference brought together more than 350 people from 70 very diverse companies. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f97a45">And after 2 weeks</font> </h2><br>  Let's go back now.  The 2015 conference in numbers is as follows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br> <a href="http://leankanban.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3ef/20d/24b/3ef20d24b2a74005909a8cab8acdc209.png" align="left"></a> <ul><li>  More than 300 managers and business owners </li><li>  More than 30 reports of invited experts will be read. </li><li>  Key foreign speakers </li><li>  Workshops and trainings before and after the main conference tracks </li></ul><br>  In general, Modern Management Methods remains a conference on management processes and the quality of managerial decision-making under conditions of high uncertainty.  Attending the event will be primarily interesting for those who make decisions in difficult conditions and, as a result, manage risks.  Practical benefits from reports and master classes will be made not only by top managers and unit managers, but also by trainers / consultants in project and product management. <br><br>  When the situation in a business changes with great speed, and the degree of uncertainty is always high - traditional management approaches often turn out to be ineffective.  Budgets, KPIs and work plans for several years ahead, consistent with months, become irrelevant, as much as possible, by the time they are approved.  Therefore, in our opinion, it‚Äôs already a long time ago to start talking about how flexible methodologies help to organize work in such conditions and how they can be used to improve the quality of management decisions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f97a45">Speakers</font> </h2><br> <a href="http://leankanban.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bc/15b/586/3bc15b5861fe4089b46d53daa42c0d2d.png"></a> <br><br>  We have already mentioned the fact that there will be several key foreign guests at the conference.  Let's walk briefly on the topics of reports that they are preparing to read to the public. <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">David Anderson</a> is the founder and one of the main ideologists of the continuous improvement methodology - the Kanban method, and the Modern Management Framework - the management system of modern business operating in a complex environment.  At the conference, David will read a report and hold two trainings on one topic - Enterprise Services Planning. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">Mike Burrows</a> - director of the British office and chief consultant of the company David J. Anderson and Associates, has devoted most of his career to managing development teams and large IT departments of companies in various industries: aerospace, finance, energy and of course software development.  At the conference, Mike will talk about tips that will give rich food for thought to anyone who is thinking about increasing efficiency in achieving the goals of the organization. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">Patrick Steyart</a> is the founder and chief coach of Okaloa, with many years of practice in lean-agile transformations and an improvement process.  At the conference, Patrick will talk about Discovery Kanban, a special kind of system designed for organizing intellectual work processes. <br><br></li><li>  Finally, <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">Dan Greening</a> , managing director of the agile-consulting group Senex Rex, will tell the audience about the leadership patterns in Agile, but not only.  He also intends to talk about the meaning of the often forgotten practice - retrospective. </li></ol><br>  Of course, this is not all speakers / speakers - the full list can be found on the conference website in <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">the ‚ÄúSpeakers‚Äù section</a> .  At the event there will be Russian experts of considerable size, such as Andrei Kolyada - the rector of the EMAS business school, Evgeny Kobzev - the managing director of Knock, Sergey Shcherbinin from Raiffeisen Bank, Svetlana Mukhina from Luxoft, Evgeny Ovchinnikov from the pharmacological company Biotech. <br><br>  Come, learn, learn and implement.  Any specialist interested in the following range of topics is simply obliged to turn their attention to the event: <br><br><ul><li>  Kanban-system of visual management and analysis </li><li>  Beyond Budgeting - modern principles of organizing budgeting to increase the company's business flexibility </li><li>  Complexity Science - the science of complexity, an integral approach for the design of complex management systems at all levels: people, communications and technology </li><li>  Lean Applied - experience in applying lean manufacturing principles in companies based on intellectual work </li><li>  Managing Risk - risk management in a constantly changing environment </li><li>  Real Options - the innovative principle of making quality decisions </li><li>  Lean Startup - a modern approach to start and increase the chances of new products life </li><li>  Evolving Product Management - the development and evolution of the discipline of product management in the company </li></ul><br>  And for all readers of Megamind - a discount on participation of 15% for promo code <i>megamozg</i> . <br><br>  So - see <a href="http://leankanban.ru/">you</a> at LeanKanban 2015: Modern Management Methods! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294570/</a></p>
