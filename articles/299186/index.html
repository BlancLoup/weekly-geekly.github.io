The company's revenue came from just three projects: Clash of Clans, Boom Beach and Hay Day.  Net income was $ 964 million compared to $ 592 million in 2014 and revenue of $ 1.7 billion for the entire 2014. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Most of the profits came in Clash of Clans, which was released in 2012.  It is noteworthy that the leadership of Supercell does not indicate what proportion of income falls on Clash of Clans, but it is obvious that this project brings most of the profits.  In 2015, Clash of Clans was ranked first and second in the list of highest-grossing applications, which made it one of the most successful in the world.

      At the same time, over time, the company paid dividends to shareholders in the amount of $ 15.50 per share for a total of $ 669 million, and also initiated a scheme to repurchase shares from its employees in the amount of $ 128 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/766/7a5/fbe/7667a5fbeb8942edbd5a910aad362b12.jpg" width="640" alt="image"><br><br>  These financial results are especially impressive, considering that the Supercell employs only 180 people, and the studio has only three main projects.  The new game Clash Royale, which Supercell launched in 2016, now takes first place in downloads and profits on the App Store in 44 countries.  At the same time, the company noted 100 million active users of Clash Royale, so the financial results of 2016 may turn out to be significantly higher. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe financial results are great and we are proud of them.  But our real achievement is the way we see company management for people. <br><br>  Despite these financial results, we were able to keep the Supercell staff relatively small.  Now he is only 180 people and most of them know each other by name. <br><br>  We believed that if we unite the best people and create the best conditions for them, then with enough time and a little luck, they will be able to create games that millions will want to play over the years, ‚Äùsaid Supercell Ilkka Paananen . </blockquote><br><br>  A thorough approach to testing is noticeable and the launch of Clash Royale - the company stopped the development of almost 14 projects, before the release of a new game.  Many investors pay attention to such financial indicators - the Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank acquired another 22% stake in June, bringing its share to 73% with a capitalization of $ 5.5 billion. Supercell even received grants from the Finnish government in the amount of 400,000 euros, which she has repeatedly returned, paying income tax. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299186/</a></p>
