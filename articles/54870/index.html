It is necessary not to overcook and not overcook, it is necessary not to over-salt and not over-salt, it is necessary not to over-dry and not soak. <br><br>  The cunning cook did not reveal to us the secrets of his mastery, but in many respects he is right: the quality of the work is noticeable when the author does not go to extremes.

      Writing texts on the site is the same creative activity as any other.  In my opinion, everyone has his own style.  And it will be noticeable if it does not spoil the extremes. <br><br>  Here are some extremes for articles on the site: <br>  - over-dried text, very formal, <br>  - familiar text, familiar address, <br>  - the text is too long <br>  - text too short. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Formal text </h4><br>  Such texts are often found on the websites of large enterprises.  They write as if the report to the tax or higher organization.  Often they write as if they pass the test on the strength of the material: a lot of clever terms, nor any lapidarity. <br><br>  This style is also characterized by the spelling of words in capital letters, just as the word ‚ÄúORDER‚Äù used to be written on a typewriter. <br><br><h6>  Why you should not write like that? </h6><br>  The site is visited by people with different levels of knowledge of the subject, but all of them can be interested in easy, friendly presentation of the material. <br><br>  Writing words only in capital letters makes it difficult to read, creates a subconscious unpleasant feeling. <br><br><h6>  Exception to the rule </h6><br>  You can write a formal text if it is aimed at a circle of narrow specialists who deeply understand the topic.  Another such style is useful if you are trying to hide really important things behind a bunch of unimportant terms and numbers. <br><br><h4>  Family text </h4><br>  Such texts are sometimes written by people who know the joy of chats, emoticons and padonkovskogo slang.  Deciding that the Internet is a completely different culture, they are in a hurry to demonstrate their new knowledge. <br><br>  Oddly enough, but mostly familiarity manifests itself in typography and in the misuse of punctuation marks: <br>  - many exclamation marks, <br>  - out of place spaced dots, <br>  - dots from a large number of points, <br>  - dashes are placed where it is appropriate to put a colon, <br>  - dash is placed everywhere, <br>  - APPOINTMENT jumping register, <br>  - ‚ÄúE‚Äù is set and stands out where appropriate to write ‚Äúe‚Äù, <br>  - in the case and without a case, bold is used, highlighting a part of the text in a different color. <br><br><h6>  Why is it not necessary to write? </h6><br>  In essence, familiarity is the same formalism, only on the other side.  The same disrespect to the text and site visitors. <br><br>  Attention of visitors should be riveted to the meaning, and not to your deep knowledge in the chat-ICQ battles. <br><br><h6>  Exception to the rule </h6><br>  If you deliberately want to present the meaning of the article as the logic of hysterical and stupid pseudo-rebels, then write so. <br><br><h4>  Text too long </h4><br>  In high school I loved to read Victor Hugo.  I liked his logic, his pessimistic irony, his paradox.  5 years ago I tried to re-read it and could not.  The rhythm of life has accelerated so much that it became simply unbearable to read how one thought develops on 3 pages. <br><br>  Have you noticed that I left the main topic?  I switched to philology and personal preferences.  The general rhythm of the article is knocked down, there was a change of focus.  Perhaps this example is successful, but it is still from another opera. <br><br>  The length of an article is measured not only by the number of letters, but also by the number of tricks shifts.  The more different objects of attention, the harder it is to grasp the essence. <br><br><h6>  Why is it not worth writing? </h6><br>  The attention of Internet users and so very defocused, they read fluently.  Try to consider one object in one article.  If the object in question is complex, it is better to split the article into several, and correctly link them with hyperlinks. <br><br><h6>  Exception to the rule </h6><br>  Participation in the contest "Make the user forget about what the article, until he read to the middle." <br><br><h4>  Text too short </h4><br>  Brevity is the sister of talent, but not always.  Well, when summarized everything that is necessary.  It's bad when, instead of brevity, we are missed by the lack of content. <br><br>  Quite often I come across articles literally like these: <br>  - All builders already know what gas silicate blocks are, so just go to the price list page. <br>  - We have long thought that you can write about the last party, and decided that words can not describe it.  Who was, he already knows, and who was not, will not understand. <br><br><h6>  Why is it not worth writing </h6><br>  Information should be given that the user would understand that the site owner understands the question.  If you send a user to google, you show helplessness. <br><br><h6>  Exception to the rule </h6><br>  If you truly hate the owner of the site, but spit in his face does not allow education. <br><br><h4>  About extremes and details </h4><br>  Quite often we hear from young and inexperienced that it‚Äôs cool, it‚Äôs when you go to extremes, that this is the only way to make a difference, and attention to trifles is boring and not interesting to anyone.  I used to think so too.  And I remember those times with warmth. <br><br>  I wrote articles without punctuation, specifically that readers would place them at their discretion, that would completely change the meaning.  I wrote articles consisting of words from the same root.  It was the case, he repeated the same sentence, and in the end put different emoticons. <br><br>  All these experiments helped me to understand how to write is not necessary.  Creativity is generally good because it has the right to make mistakes.  So, if you have an article that doesn‚Äôt go, my advice to you is: <br><br>  - go to the extreme, play with words, draw emoticons, trim, inflate.  Write insanity.  And then with a fresh mind, throw out all the extremes and leave a solid, interesting, easy to read article. <br><br><h4>  Authorship </h4><br>  The author of the article and photos is Vadim Galkin.  When publishing the material, please give a link to my personal page: vadimgalkin.pp.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54870/</a></p>
