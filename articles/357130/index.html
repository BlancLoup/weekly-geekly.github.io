      Recall the contents of the previous series.  In 2015, the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/an-admins-foolish-errors-helped-the-fbi-unmask-child-porn-site-playpen%3Ftrk_source%3Drecommended">FBI seized a site on the Tor network that distributed child pornography</a> , and <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269702/">malware was distributed from it for two weeks</a> , able to track the real external IP address of visitors.  As a result, more than 1,300 registered users of the site were identified and criminal cases were instituted against 137 of them. <br><br>  A federal judge in the Western District of Washington, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jensen_Bryan">Robert Bryan</a> , in the <abbr title="United States v. Michaud, 3: 15-cr-05351 in W.D.Wash">criminal case of Jay Michaud,</abbr> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/271400/">demanded that the FBI disclose the source code of the exploit</a> in the interests of protection, but the FBI <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/306272980/Special-Agent-Daniel-Alfin-s-Declaration-in-Playpen-Case">refused to do so</a> .  Later, a similar request for protection was also granted by a federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_G._Doumar">Robert Doumar</a> , within the framework of the <abbr title="United States v. Darby, 2: 16-cr-00036 in E.D.Va">case of Gerald Andrew Darby</abbr> , however, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2900290-Response-in-Opposition-in-Darby.html">equally unsuccessful</a> . <br><br>  However, at the same time, there are district judges, including those in the same Eastern District of Virginia, who took a different position in similar proceedings.  In particular, on June 1, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Coke_Morgan,_Jr.">federal judge Henry Kok Morgan, Jr.,</a> in the framework of the <abbr title="United States v. Matish, 4: 16-cr-00016 in E.D.Va">case of Edward Joseph Mathesh,</abbr> also considered the defense requirement to disclose the source code of the exploit, but <a href="http://media.scmagazine.com/documents/237/alfin_deposition_usa_v_matish_59200.pdf">dismissed it</a> according to formal criteria.  And on June 23, the same judge issued a truly fateful ruling during the same proceedings. <br><br> <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joebehr/5713456350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1c/069/85d/d1c06985d4c9404183f473be80de4e9c.jpg" width="700" height="394"></a> <br>  <sub><i><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/joebehr/5713456350">The District Court of the</a> Eastern District of Virginia in Norfolk</i></sub> <br><br>  Edward Mathesh‚Äôs lawyer, Andrew Grindrod, filed a complaint about invalidation of all evidence obtained by the FBI as a result of hacking into Matish‚Äôs home computer on February 27, 2015.  Having thoroughly reviewed the complaint, Judge Morgan Jr. <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/06/23/matish_suppression_edva.pdf">arrived at the following conclusion</a> . <br><br>  Historically, the Fourth Amendment prohibited the entry of police without a warrant into physical objects, in particular, into residential premises.  However, in 1967, a federal court <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz_v._United_States">found</a> that the Fourth Amendment <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BA_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">"protects a person, not a place,"</a> and applies to any breach of privacy that satisfies two conditions: <br><ol><li>  the person <i>subjectively</i> expected to have some privacy; </li><li>  society recognizes this expectation as <i>objectively</i> reasonable. </li></ol><br>  It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">was</a> later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">specifically clarified</a> that a person <i>cannot</i> expect privacy with respect to information that he voluntarily disclosed to third parties.  The violation of such ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù by a federal agent does not require a warrant. <br><br>  Initially, Judge Morgan considered the issue of establishing the real IP address of the defendant‚Äôs computer.  The FBI has identified the IP address of Mathesh without a corresponding order, using the notorious exploit.  However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_v._Maryland">as it was established in 1979</a> , a person cannot expect privacy with respect to the telephone numbers dialed by him, since these numbers are known to third parties ‚Äî the telephone company.  By analogy, a person cannot expect privacy with respect to his IP address, since this address is already known to his Internet provider, as well as to the input node of the Tor network to which he is connected. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/219/31b/0a9/21931b0a9ddb4087b2955bbbd51de6db.png"></a> <br><br>  Then Henry Kok Morgan Jr. went further and spread the same reasoning to any data on devices connected to the Internet.  Although it was decided in 2007 in the <a href="http://itlaw.wikia.com/wiki/U.S._v._Heckenkamp">United States v. Heckenkamp</a> case that a person subjectively and objectively has the right to expect privacy of data stored on his personal computer, Judge Morgan decided that over the past 9 years, the circumstances surrounding the previous decision have changed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c7/63c/79f/4c763c79f4b448bcbf8ba8935a16b217.png" width="700" height="33"><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúIn the modern digital world, you can be sure that a computer connected to the Internet will be hacked sooner or later.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>[..] in 2016 it is unreasonable to expect that setting a password on the OS provides some practical protection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In 1998, in the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1147.ZS.html">Minnesota vs Carter</a> case, it was found that a police officer looking through a window through the cracks in the curtains did not violate the rights granted by the Fourth Amendment.</i>  <i>Similarly, FBI agents who exploit a vulnerability on an unsecured network do not violate the Fourth Amendment.</i>  <i>People using the Internet usually understand all the risks involved. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Original</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Now it seems to be a problem.</i>  <i>In fact, it‚Äôs not true that it‚Äôs not possible to connect to the Internet.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>[..] in 2016 it provides any practical protection.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thus, hacking resembles the broken blinds in <u>Carter</u> .</i>  <i>525 US at 85. Fourth Amendment rights, jd.</i>  <i>at 103 (Breyer, J., concurring), FBI agents who do not violate the Fourth Amendment.</i>  <i>It is not a problem. computer.</i>  <i>People who traverse the Internet ordinarily understand the risk associated with doing so.</i> </div></div></blockquote> Thus, the data stored on the device connected to the Internet, according to the court, are not currently private. <br><br>  Thus, Judge Morgan Jr. legitimized the use of <i>any</i> exploits to extract <i>any</i> information from <i>any</i> computer on the Internet.  Without a warrant.  But this is not the end.  A direct consequence of such a verdict is the legalization of <i>any</i> data removal in <i>general</i> , if the device on which they are located had an Internet connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/cad/e1a/81ecade1a2294992ba97afa2c9ae9844.png" width="700" height="367"><br><br>  The lawyers of the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> ) were ready to provide all possible assistance in court, and even sent Judge Morgan to <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2016/06/17/ourbrief-filed.pdf">his analysis of the</a> situation as a so-called.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae">‚ÄúFriend of justice‚Äù</a> , however, their arguments were not taken into account in the process of the proceedings.  The EFF <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/federal-court-fourth-amendment-does-not-protect-your-home-computer">hopes</a> that this decision of the court of the Eastern District of Virginia will be reviewed by the Court of Appeal, as a result of which it cannot be considered as a precedent in other similar cases. <br><br>  What, however, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/06/federal-court-fourth-amendment-does-not-protect-your-home-computer">seriously worries the</a> EFF, is the current situation in the American judicial system as a whole: the courts in cases involving unfamiliar modern technologies are inclined to make decisions for unsympathetic defendants that have long-term consequences and threaten the rights and freedoms of all US citizens.  The EFF promises to continue to monitor all such decisions regarding the Fourth Amendment, not limited to matters related to the Playpen.
