In addition, Google Health has been around for quite some time, and with a special module, it was possible to receive and analyze information about their own health.  As planned, the latter service was supposed to help residents of the United States, and after ‚Äî and the whole world ‚Äî to improve interaction with doctors, who immediately received a large amount of data on the state of human health when the patient approached them.  Unfortunately, the corporation decided to close both the first and second projects. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The fact is that these projects did not receive the degree of popularity that the developers expected.  Yes, there were quite a few people who had already started working with Google Health and / or with PowerMeter, but still the services did not work on the scale that was needed by the project initiators and developers.  However, according to Aaron Brown, senior manager of the Google Health project, some of the users of this service helped to obtain information that people could not receive earlier.

      It is worth recalling that Google Health appeared in mid-2008.  The project served as a kind of center for collecting and storing information about the health of a particular person: body weight, blood pressure, the content of various substances in urine and blood.  In addition, Google Health helped quickly access information such as prescriptions from doctors, medical information, and more. <br><br>  According to representatives of the development team, the project failed, not only because it was highly specialized (this is one of the reasons), but also because electronic systems in medicine in the US have not yet received proper distribution.  But what's the use of the details stored somewhere on the server, if the doctor you turned to still only trusts paper documents and doesn‚Äôt take Google Health seriously? <br><br>  In general, two very promising services are closing.  Sorry, very sorry.  Yes, Google Health support will be extended until January 1 of next year, and PowerMeter will be closed on September 16 of this year. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/8599247/Google-closes-Health-and-PowerMeter-services.html">telegraph.co.uk</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122736/</a></p>
