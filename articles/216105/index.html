    <h5>  NetApp E2700 to replace the E2600 </h5><br>  At the end of last year, the <a href="http://www.it-grad.ru/articles/equipment/netapp-e2700-e5500/">NetApp E-series line</a> was significantly updated, and now against the background of announced promotional discounts on the E2700, we will tell you how to solve these problems, these models can bring a tangible positive result. <br><br>  In place of the NetApp E2600 (also known as the IBM IBM DS3524 OEM, also known as the Dell PowerVault MD3), the E2700 was released, featuring a higher maximum throughput. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/343/1b8/0ea/3431b80ead60b6e09ede8d21e134833f.jpg" alt="  e2700  e2600" title="NetApp e2700 vs. NetApp e2600 comparison table"><br><br>  The distinctive features of E-series from FAS / V-series are the result of a more classical approach to storage organization.  Despite this, the following features are basic to the E-series storage system: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Snapshot (Point-in-Time) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Volume Copy <br>  ‚Ä¢ Synchronous Mirroring <br>  ‚Ä¢ Asynchronous Mirroring <br>  ‚Ä¢ SSD Drive Support <br>  ‚Ä¢ SSD Read Cache <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dynamic Disk Pools <br>  ‚Ä¢ Thin Provisioning <br>  ‚Ä¢ Storage Partitions <br>  ‚Ä¢ AutoSupport Tool <br>  ‚Ä¢ Integration with <br>  o VMware (vCenter Plug-in, VASA Provider, VAAI for SAN (native to SANtricity), vSphere) <br>  o Microsoft (SCOM Management Pack, SSMS Add-in) <br>  o Oracle (Oracle Enterprise Plug-in) <br><br><h5>  What tasks are effective NetApp E2700 </h5><br>  <b>1. Backup (minimum cost per GB required)</b> <br><br>  Having a block access, the storage system E-series implies its use in SAN or DAS mode.  Thus, most of the functionality for improving storage efficiency rests on file server or application server software. <br>  For example, backup software often has its own deduplication and application integration mechanisms.  From the same storage space is required.  And here, E-series can be more profitable in terms of ‚ÄúGB space per dollar‚Äù or ‚ÄúMB / s throughput per dollar.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>2. Video surveillance and media content (high bandwidth required)</b> <br><br>  HDTV content brings tangible revenues, but with the increase in picture quality, tangible problems arise - high throughput of the entire infrastructure and huge disk space are required (don't forget about the archives). <br>  Note that such tools as caching and tiring, which have proven themselves in solving traditional problems, do not work for streaming video. <br><br>  The specifics of working with such data can be described as follows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High bandwidth: HDTV: 8-30 Mbit / s, by 2015. UHDTV - 24 Gbit / s <br>  ‚Ä¢ Huge amount of data: 1 hour of uncompressed UHDTV video - 25TB !!! <br>  ‚Ä¢ Multiple distributed access to real-time data for all types of OS - for processing video material. <br><br>  In addition, when using HD camcorders of resolution and long-term storage of video archives, there are several significant limitations and operating conditions.  For example, if we use disk space collected on the basis of a RAID controller with internal server disks, we have several points of failure, difficulty of expanding disk space, difficulties with the rapid replacement of failed equipment, etc. <br><br>  At the same time, the nature of the load is such that the use of universal RAID controllers does not allow obtaining the maximum possible performance even from a large number of hard drives.  Here the described storage system can come to the rescue. <br><br>  The pre-installed SANtricity software is specially optimized for streaming loading and allows you to squeeze the maximum out of hard drives.  Recommendations for using NetApp storage for media content are shown in the figure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/927/e9e/d6b/927e9ed6b878c1dc6732eb8b203f26ad.png" alt="    NetApp     " title="Recommendations for using NetApp storage for media content"><br><br>  <b>3. NetApp FAS-series does not pass under the budget</b> <br><br>  You can also consider the E-series, when the FAS system (including the younger series FAS2220 / 2240) do not pass due to budget constraints.  Just for such situations, NetApp offers a promotional program within which you can purchase E2700 storage systems at <a href="http://www.it-grad.ru/kompaniya/novosti/2014/skidki-na-netapp-e2700/">special prices</a> . <br><br><h5>  Cool discounts on purchases </h5><br>  Special prices, as part of a promotional program, allow you to purchase storage systems equipped with 12 NL-SAS disks.  The differences are in the volume of disks, the number of controllers and the availability of interface cards for connection via SAS, FC, iSCSI. <br>  Willing to call interested prices in a <a href="http://www.it-grad.ru/kompaniya/novosti/2014/skidki-na-netapp-e2700/">personal order</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88e/81f/a8c/88e81fa8c568680e941c1a176688b137.jpg" alt="  NetApp e " title="Variants of NetApp e Series Bundles"><br><br>  The basic storage option is with one controller and two SAS 12 Gb / s ports for direct connection to servers. <br>  Alternative options allow you to connect multiple servers.  The connection is made via the existing FC or Ethernet SAN infrastructure.  The most commonly used fault-tolerant storage options with two controllers.  Each controller carries one of the following expansion cards (Host Interface Card, HIC): <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 10 Gbps iSCSI ports.  Note that unlike FAS, the card has not SPF + ports, but RJ45; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 2 16 Gbps Fiber Channel ports.  These bundles come with 8 Gbps transceivers. <br><br>  Each of these delivery options can be completed with 12 2TB or 4TB disks, as well as SAS 600GB, 900GB and 1200GB disks. <br><br>  Naturally, all options allow further expansion.  Three types of disk shelves are available, including 60-density high-density shelves: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ DE1600 for 12 disks 3.5 ‚Äù, shelf height 2U; <br>  ‚Ä¢ DE5600 for 24 discs 2.5 ‚Äù, shelf height 2U; <br>  ‚Ä¢ DE6600 for 60 disks 3.5 ‚Äùor 2.5‚Äù, shelf height 4U; <br><br>  For single-controller configurations, you can subsequently purchase a second controller and interface cards. <br><br><h5>  OEM supply differences </h5><br>  In the case of delivery through NetApp, all of the above functionality is already included in the basic E-Series.  Unlike OEM suppliers does not require separate licensing: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Automatic caching on SSDs Intelligent Cache Tiering; <br>  ‚Ä¢ snapshots; <br>  ‚Ä¢ data replication to a remote storage system. <br><br>  Unlike OEM partners for NetApp E-series, there is no separately purchased Turbo performance option, which is responsible for removing software performance limits. <br><br><h5>  Results of comprehensive testing of E-series </h5><br>  Together with one of our customers, we conducted a comprehensive test of the 12-disk version of the E-series storage system.  The obtained results were compared with the characteristics of hard drives in the server and with inexpensive storage systems from another manufacturer of a similar configuration. <br>  In the near future we will make and publish a separate detailed review of this testing.  Here are some comparative data. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bc/e7a/8cb/2bce7a8cb8f81e5f5b33d456c93495ed.jpg" alt="   " title="Comparative data load NetApp storage with storage from other vendors"><br><br>  As can be seen from the table, the storage system was tested on loads of various profiles, since  it was necessary to understand what is the effectiveness in various situations.  Thanks to the optimization of the architecture, system software, the storage system showed very good results in the test.  On streaming operations, the storage system showed itself to be extremely positive. <br><br>  Note that these tangible results were achieved with a very small number of disks.  With increasing disks, the indicators should still increase, because  the controller resource load did not exceed several tens of percent. <br><br>  P.S.  In April we will hold one webinar and one seminar in St. Petersburg (April 10), where the topic of E-series will be covered in detail.
