This tragedy was written by Baruch Sadogursky ( <a href="https://twitter.com/jbaruch">@jbaruch</a> ) and Leonid Igolnik ( <a href="https://twitter.com/ligolnik">@ligolnik</a> ).  If we are talking about DevOps on a large scale, what is this if not a tragedy? <br><br>  This article is marked by the severity of realism, depicts the reality of a large development of the most pointed, like a clot of internal contradictions.  It reveals the deepest conflicts of reality in an extremely intense and saturated form, which acquires the value of an artistic symbol.

      And now we finish playing in Belinsky and welcome to the cat!  There is text and video.  Hostages do not take! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bc/073/ef6/4bc073ef625bc17e8cadb4e140741d8f.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HiPSp2xf0yo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  As is known, the Greeks adored Venn diagrams.  And we will show you as many as three - and all about DevOps. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ba/84d/023/8ba84d023b5cef08fea52c0eb8d9f036.png"></div><br>  There is a traditional description of DevOps - this is the intersection of the Operations, Development and QA areas.  Historically, it is interesting that QA was added there later. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc3/6fe/e4b/cc36fee4b8859f6aa1a6bc4022da8ed8.png"></div><br>  But today we will talk about something else - the intersection of technology, process and people.  That it is necessary to make with all these three components that DevOps has turned out. <br><br>  Now compare two more charts: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c7/17e/51b/5c717e51b4a7f81568cca2b4a21d06e3.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cba/6aa/681/cba6aa6814080dd706d501379fd6b769.png"></div><br>  Sometimes it happens. <br><br><h2>  Pentagon Inc. </h2><br>  We begin the story with a mythical company called Pentagon, which deals with credit card transactions. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/960/fb1/ecd/960fb1ecd0ab0375d36422b83ea70b1f.png"></div><br><h2>  Act I - Firefighters </h2><br>  <b>People</b>  The company is just starting its work, it has three engineers.  All three came from the same company from the defense industry.  The guys are smart enough, so they have everything: JavaScript, Node, React, Docker, microservices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/680/329/fa5/680329fa57f5d1312cca1ddabbf07da7.png"></div><br>  <b>Process</b>  What can the process look like when there are three people on the team?  Kanban: or on a blackboard with paper, or in Trello.  Guys are intelligent and understand that QA is needed from the very beginning, so TDD, unit &amp; integration tests.  No ops, all root. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/338/e62/ca8/338e62ca813186f9d4f75c9c7850d0d7.png"></div><br>  <b>Tools</b> .  Accordingly, for three people who are just raising something: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">JIRA</a> , <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> , <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI,</a> and so on. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c38/1d0/5f3/c381d05f3b696e53eb7605cee236f8a5.png"></div><br>  Talk about how these people live on this beautiful stack.  First, as in good startups - we are sawing, sawing the product and waiting for the first client. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de6/ce3/3ee/de6ce33ee2fc31b4976fb34cf35f07d3.png"></div><br>  Unexpectedly, a miracle happened - one organization that organizes the best conferences in the post-Soviet space decided to trust these guys and make their transactions through them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/756/cf7/884/756cf788431c9acbddd0867b410ff7b8.png"></div><br>  What does a real startup do when it gets its first client?  Marks!  And somewhere around three in the morning, when everything is in a <i>special</i> condition, the customer calls and says that nothing is working. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/cac/a34/33acaca34c589fb2f9726b6b786bd456.png"></div><br>  Of course, first of all, panic! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c7/aad/13f/6c7aad13f38a4334b20aa42e83fb0669.png"></div><br>  The next step is to fight!  Look logs, for example. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b92/1b9/e84/b921b9e8486af23eac9307a9bc098ade.png"></div><br>  We watched, watched, it turned out that one of our three heroes, Vasya, having come home after the celebration, committed his little idea.  We remember that after the commit and passed tests, everything flies into production. <br><br>  Well, who among us did not fill up the production?  We will not blame Vasya.  Roll back to the previous commit.  It is not going to!  For some reason, there is not enough library, called left-pad. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/003/31d/228/00331d228e5f404fabf9d451f4fcb458.png"></div><br>  For those who do not know what happened with the left-pad, we tell.  So, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">on March 23, 2016 half of the Internet broke</a> .  In general, the left-pad module in JavaScript simply inserts spaces in the left part of the lines.  And half of the Internet directly or transitively depended on this module.  The author of the left-pad somehow managed to quarrel with the owners of the central repository npm, so he just walked away from them, taking all his developments.  npm is generally a mysterious system: not only do they check when you add a new module for downloading, they also check all the old modules. <br><br>  Thus, the fight against fire continues.  And the problems are the same all the time. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b0/99e/9a4/9b099e9a4a0c778833a6364e448cf6e1.png"></div><br><h2>  Act II - Fire Alarm Installers </h2><br>  Company news: they raised money, found an investor, hired 27 people, one of them with an ops background.  There are 100 customers and even tech support. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa3/8be/280/aa38be28050b80d59f5f0a750a51964c.png"></div><br>  The process, accordingly, should also receive an upgrade.  There was a normal Scrum, exploratory testing.  We realized that NoOps does not exist at all, because there are Ops (if the serverless architecture is, then the server is still there, it is simply not yours).  Since it was wrong to wake the whole team at night, the attendant (developer on call) appeared. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/773/5b2/4a3/7735b24a34ed17aff93056b0b1ba0d06.png"></div><br>  Accordingly, the set of tools has expanded.  At least Knowledge Base has appeared, as now there is a person on duty, and he needs to look for information somewhere.  Another new <a href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">feature</a> is <a href="https://jfrog.com/artifactory/">JFrog Artifactory</a> : a system that allows you to store what was deposited yesterday, so that you can easily roll back (the lesson with the left-pad was not in vain), and not rebuild everything anew.  Put a system for collecting logs and search for them.  <a href="https://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom was</a> added - a fabulous monitoring-system: you give it a url, and it tells you whether it works or fell. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f2/f0b/780/2f2f0b7807b5a55f1db5f00334665209.png"></div><br>  So, at this stage again raised money.  So we celebrate.  Friday, three in the morning, the customer calls.  Something doesn't work: Visa and MasterCard pass, but American Express does not. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9cc/126/b95/9cc126b951fd68f4c8ad149bb35a125a.png"></div><br>  And how does the support react first when the customer calls at three in the morning?  Panic! <br><br>  Then call the attendant.  Guess who's on duty?  Of course, Vasya!  Guess what condition Vasya?  M-yes.  But Vasya takes himself in hand, looks at what the support sent him, and says that he is suspiciously familiar with all this and he has already done this.  Therefore, Vasya just takes and repairs.  Everyone is going to sleep.  On Monday, debriefing begins. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce8/37f/6c3/ce837f6c3dc377e624c9a5e36a036a02.png"></div><br>  Here is an example of a specific document that we produce for the knowledge base, so that if something happens again, it can be quickly found.  In addition, it is sometimes shown to customers: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/16f/2ff/e5b/16f2ffe5b393327e272bbb6ad5e7d382.png"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4aa/c6b/3f7/4aac6b3f7865042215beaab302044b54.png"></div><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35a/999/ab3/35a999ab3c206c70daf6cf283aea9901.png"></div><br>  The document displays the main headers, reasons, characteristics, list of events.  Be sure to indicate the symptoms, given a technical description of what is broken and how to fix it.  The most important part of the document is the key reason why something fell. <br><br>  In the case of Vasya, our logs are full.  You need to clear it from credit card transactions, and in addition, increase its size.  For example, at 42! <br><br>  This process is very good for internal continuous improvement and it guarantees the installation of the very "smoke detectors".  The second reason why this document is important is the report to the client.  Some services, after they "lay" for a while, publish the reasons for this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98b/f0b/f06/98bf0bf065b0ab0e89f647d1e30a5d02.png"></div><br>  Sometimes the problem is so catastrophic that it‚Äôs not worth talking about. <br><br>  In GitLab <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/">in February 2017</a> , a person deleted a database on production.  Here is the analysis that GitLab posted: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/86f/316/cc7/86f316cc72fc835ec9c70b4e899578a5.png"></div><br>  So, somewhere there is a backup, only no one knows where.  Then backups were found, but they were empty.  Yes, there is a base dump.  But it was made in a different version of postgres, so it does not fit.  We have a snapshot disc, but they don't have a database.  Replication from S3 also did not work due to lack of data. <br><br>  Thus, five different techniques for backing up data did not work.  We think that it is impossible to publish this, since no one will trust them anything more.  But, depending on how to tell about it, the client can forgive.  True, only once. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e87/a11/666/e87a116665920da5ca80aeb50f401ace.png"></div><br>  By the way, the guy who did it got a promotion.  In addition, he changed his status in twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/yorickpeterse">Database (removal) Specialist at GitLab</a> . <br><br><h2>  Act III - Culmination </h2><br>  So what happens in our company?  They raised money again, hired a bunch of people - now we have five ops engineers and one person who is engaged in performance.  There is a main architect.  A customer success team has emerged covering all industries that may require support.  They are inhibited so that the rest of the team can continue to work.  Often in such a team there is a group that can build relationships with ops or support, and periodically there must be thrown engineers on the scrum, or on the sprint, or for a month.  The company has grown, a lawyer, financial director has appeared.  The customer base has grown to 1000. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/881/2ed/407/8812ed4076e23ea48b543da6c8e99ca8.png"></div><br>  As the team grows, the development process has to change. <br><br>  A <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/">SAFE</a> appeared - a framework that explains what to do with scrum when there are many teams or development centers - more than one.  The number of processes that are present in Safe can kill a horse, but if only all of them are taken at once.  If you pick up only those pieces that are required at this stage of the company's development, then everything should be fine. <br><br>  System testing appears when large teams have certain needs or if you have a huge system from which to build something.  Individual scrum teams can test their systems well, but someone must be responsible for the fact that the entire system must assemble into production. <br><br>  What can you say about the Ops Team?  As we said, there are two options for doing DevOps.  The first is on the book and on the instructions Netflix, Google and Twitter.  The second is in real life, where not all engineers can be trusted with root in production. <br><br>  Escalation path is an important concept that allows you to solve any problem at a given time, because at the end of the escalation path there is a mobile phone of the general director, after a call to which all problems disappear within 5 hours and 58 minutes. <br><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Organization_Controls">SOC II</a> - a set of standards that the vendor provides to the client.  These standards confirm that the firm has certain security solutions, approaches to the division of work. <br><br>  Backlog - a list of problems that need to be addressed to improve the system.  Usually, the chief architect becomes the backlog manager, who should look at the needs of the system and the needs of the product and prioritize these tasks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/591/80a/96e/59180a96eb47b9e670d3f955f3f7a96d.png"></div><br>  Tools, of course, also improved. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cf/835/982/5cf835982ba36b2da678259f31e96e38.png"></div><br>  There is more news.  Vasya was promoted.  He is now a VP of Engineering. <br><br>  Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays pass - nothing comes.  Everything is working.  All are shocked.  Monday comes, a lawyer comes to Vasya and says that he was at a law conference and heard about the LGPL 2.2.  Vasya has no idea if they have the LGPL 2.2. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e5/e0a/559/3e5e0a559cb9b199778572bae3a04a34.png"></div><br>  People worked for a long time, and then they found the LGPL 2.2.  Need to cut out.  But it is cut out by a healthy piece of the system, and nobody has canceled the release tomorrow.  Well, nothing coped with this. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b55/1bf/f30/b551bff304f35ed67eea7416b69f2fa3.png"></div><br>  The financial director comes to Vasya: <br><br><ul><li>  How much money do you need for servers and production?  Making a budget for next year ... </li><li>  42 - says Vasya. </li></ul><br>  Solved this problem. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/562/af8/242/562af8242f72cf1094aa4cf5a51f8612.png"></div><br>  They come to Vasya and say that there is a potential client, but he is afraid that we have never had such a large-scale customer, and he wants to be convinced that it will be good.  From the story we know that at this stage everyone died. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/465/452/f51/465452f5152eb464a0909aa9e689b17b.png"></div><br>  But since we must necessarily have a happy end, we attached it to the Greek tragedy. <br><br><h2>  Epilogue - Proactive Improvement </h2><br>  Now we will tell about the last stage of scaling DevOps - Proactive Improvement.  This is about fire prevention. <br><br>  No change happens to people.  But with the process - very much so. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/384/104/7d2/3841047d2285ebd11985c3849f2bf4ab.png"></div><br>  Since we have a Performance Engineer, it should somehow monitor the system.  Appeared License and security management.  Proactive Performance - now we carefully look at where the key indicators are moving, and fix things before the huge fire begins.  When scaling a product, it is desirable to have something that says: if you want to have microservice, then it should at least have standard monitoring, logs, and so on. <br><br>  Accordingly, there are tools that support all of this.  For example, the tool for license and security monitoring is <a href="https://jfrog.com/xray/">JFrog Xray</a> .  <a href="https://www.blazemeter.com/">Blazemeter</a> - since now there is proactive performance, you need to somehow generate load.  There are things like Service Virtualization, which allows you to use mock objects for remote APIs, because not every vendor you work with can provide a test API. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e92/2ce/7fc/e922ce7fc772e3669f6840179a293499.png"></div><br><h2>  Parsing </h2><br>  Let us examine some of the events of the previous acts. <br><br>  Remember the case when Vasily planned to budget a finger to the sky?  In the work on one of our products, we wanted to figure out what resources are spent on.  Having grouped everything that was in the backlog, we got the following diagram: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a7/97e/659/7a797e6591707a52e9d2bd8f5a9dd2ee.png"></div><br><br>  We mistakenly thought that we spend 80% on Big Feature A - in fact, it takes only 13%.  At the same time, as much as 34% goes to Keep the lights on - the things that need to be done in products: fix bugs, update libraries, and so on. <br><br>  In fact, there is only one objective metric of product quality: customer satisfaction, which is expressed in appeals to support. <br><br>  The second example.  Crashed all criticality defects: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a77/f9c/b3f/a77f9cb3f22211d467de577bd4c47209.png"></div><br>  65% of tickets belong to the first levels of criticality.  Is this a nightmare? <br><br>  Now take the same data and look at them from a different angle. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a02/a54/fd4/a02a54fd40fbb3b87a3b9671a88b54e7.png"></div><br>  The diagram now reflects the situation after the debriefing.  It turned out that 52% of the tickets were closed by the engineer using the information provided, that is, he wrote to the support of what they did not know.  Only about 20% of the tickets were closed with some kind of code change.  Thus, it turns out that R &amp; D is not to blame at all.  Not even support is to blame.  In fact, we did not have enough training - and Vasya, like VP of engineering, having looked at how much time he was spending on all sorts of nonsense, sent a bunch of engineers to train a support. <br><br>  The guys corrected the documentation in narrow places, corrected the logs.  As a result, the piece that a lot of developer time spent on has disappeared. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  At all stages, from fire extinguishing to installing alarm systems and proactive problem solving, there are many processes, people, specialists, approaches, tools that need to be installed.  All this can not be done in one day.  In addition, some things are not needed at some stages of development. <br><br>  It is important to understand that in people, in the processes and in the bodies, some improvements are constantly needed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f78/1d9/7fb/f781d97fb6978069d544cde85c341586.png"></div><br>  What exactly needs to be improved, we will be helped to find out the very figures we were talking about.  Only on the basis of these data can you make the right decisions about where to invest time and what to move forward. <br><br>  And do not forget the two fundamental principles of DevOps: <br><br><ul><li>  You build it - you own it. <br></li><li>  Pain is instructional. <br></li></ul><br><blockquote>  Already next Sunday, Baruch and Leonid will <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/4p7krgxh7omyqq0gummoy6/">give a</a> talk on <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/4p7krgxh7omyqq0gummoy6/">‚Äú#DataDrivenDevOps‚Äù</a> at DevOops 2018 in St. Petersburg.
