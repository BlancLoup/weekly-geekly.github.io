      The first streamers were programmers from our team, as well as some of the game developers who have already streamed on other platforms, agreed to become pioneers.  <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/videos/%3Fq%3DWhilke%257C">Whilke</a> , <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/videos/%3Fq%3Dmoatdd">moatdd</a> and many other streamers brought along spectators who had previously watched their streams on other platforms.  We received a lot of support from communities like <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/03/12/livecoding-tv/">Mashable</a> , <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/03/13/watching-live-streams-of-people-coding-is-now-officially-a-thing/">Venturebeat</a> and <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/livecoding-tv-programmierer-im-echtzeit-video-a-1023434.html">Spiegel</a> . <br><br>  The main problem was the simultaneous attraction of streamers and viewers.  To solve it, we created alerts for those who subscribed to a specific channel or category of programming.  Here we miscalculated a little, as soon as the number of streamers grew, those who subscribed to certain categories began to receive a huge number of notifications.  The problem was partially solved by expanding the number of categories that cover all sorts of languages, libraries, etc.  which made it possible to choose a narrower area. <br><br>  Initially, the service was intended solely for learning as a place where students can learn from experienced programmers, but over time <a href="http://www.liveedu.tv/">LiveEdu.tv</a> became similar to a social network for programmers, where people not only learn from each other, but also communicate, discuss projects, organize contests and meetings.  The service often introduces and unites people speaking the same language, having a similar field of activity and place of residence. <br><br>  Everyone can be a streamer from expert to student.  In order not to skip streams on topics of interest to you, the profile provides for setting notifications.  Alert rules are very flexible: you first select a category (for example, <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/android/">Android</a> or <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/learn/c-cplusplus/">C ++</a> ), and then optionally narrow the circle by choosing the complexity and language of the broadcast.  Also, you can find the stream of interest in the <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/schedule/">schedule</a> .  In the <a href="https://www.liveedu.tv/videos/">‚Äúvideo‚Äù</a> section you can find records of streams, filter them by complexity, language and programming category. <br><br>  It is possible to hire a streamer for the project.  This fully optional feature does not mean regular hiring - the service plays the role of something in between a freelancer exchange and a reality show.  Customer offer to see how the developer will perform this work.  Streamer can specify in the channel settings the cost of an hour.  A button appears in its profile. When clicked, anyone interested can select the type of stream (private or public) and describe the work that needs to be done.  After making the necessary amount for the specified number of hours, the money will be deposited with the service.  The tape drive will contact the customer for further details.  Then he will perform the requested, broadcast process in the network and the customer will be able to observe the process.  At the end of the work, <a href="http://liveedu.tv/">LiveEdu.tv</a> will transfer the funds to the streamer. <br><br>  Since the founding of <a href="http://www.livecoding.tv/">Livecoding.tv</a> in 2015, more than 1,000,000 users have visited the service.  The names of the LiveCoding site imply that the themes of the streams will be about programming, but after a while more and more people are interested in whether it is possible to broadcast IT-related content.  Therefore, it was decided to extend the categories of <a href="http://www.livecoding.tv/">Livecoding.tv</a> from programming to design, engineering and other areas closely related to the world of IT.  In connection with the addition of new categories, <a href="http://www.livecoding.tv/">Livecoding.tv</a> will soon be renamed to <a href="http://blog.livecoding.tv/rebranding-livecoding-liveedu/">LiveEdu.tv</a> . <br><br>  In the near future, together with the new name, the site will acquire a new design, where the <a href="http://roadmap.liveedu.tv/">wishes of users</a> will be taken into account. <br><br> <a href="http://blog.liveedu.tv/rebranding-livecoding-liveedu/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/11d/b2c/81711db2c8cd46d8b5f92bdcea8efe82.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="https://vk.com/liveeduofficial">Official community in VK</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318498/</a></p>
