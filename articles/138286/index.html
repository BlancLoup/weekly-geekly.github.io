  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How PDF format is no longer associated with a log</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i><b>Prologue</b></i> <br><br>  As part of the campaign, new professional workflow programs were brought to work ‚Äî corporate professional versions.  They give us programs - we give them our private and public opinion.  Putting them, by the way, instead of not quite licensed versions of the same programs from Adobe.  Accordingly, the tasks that are assigned to the programs are to work with PDF (convert them differently, etc.), scan documents and recognize characters.  I was put to deal with this software - suddenly everything is in Chinese, and in general. <br><br>  <b><i>Acts one, two and three</i></b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      I'm used to the fact that PDF is like an area with the least entropy, only for documents.  With him, apart from the conversion, nothing particularly can be done, and this, for example, allows you to transfer to PDF any information, in the immutability of which you can be more or less confident.  So, in tatters my ideas. <br>  So, I made a number of interesting conclusions for myself: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  That PDF can be converted to any format and in such a indirect way to change, already in the form of Doc, Xls, and so on, this will not surprise anyone.  This <a href="http://nuance.com/products/pdf-converter7/index.htm">PDF Converter</a> , of course, can (one of the 3 programs that gave the test). <br><br>  - The function ‚ÄúDrag-n-Drop‚Äù (in Russian ‚Äúdragging‚Äù) in the PDF Converter program tore the template at the root.  For example: you need to add 5 pages of the text of the Word to the 20 pages of the PDF, in the middle of the text.  Solution: take and drag.  This is so easy. <br><br>  - From the same place: <br>  You have a paper form.  And we need the same form, but electronic and fillable.  Solution: take and scan your PDF to PDF Converter and it automatically turns into a fill-in PDF form that you can fill out, save, send by mail, etc. <br><br>  - Do I need to correct the bug that has occurred, or should I put a note, or download a picture?  Just open the PDF in the program and fix, install, download.  As with .doc absolutely. <br><br>  - Need to find a specific document, or something in a specific document?  Converter has a utility, Looks-Like-Search (from Google), which helps to find keywords in PDF, and also to find a document on the contained keywords, phrases. <br><br>  The last thing that pleased this program is that formatting with any conversions to any supported formats is faithfully observed. <br><br>  It was a pdf converter.  The second program is called <a href="http://nuance.com/for-business/by-product/omnipage/index.htm">OmniPage</a> .  It is, nominally, for scanning documents and character recognition.  In fact, it can also be somewhat more: <br><br>  OmniPage: <br>  - Recognizes very well, no joke.  There is no need to do any intermediate saving of the paper document - it immediately saves the recognized (text, image, hieroglyphs, in short, the file) in the selected format, for example, Word.  Saving time on the face. <br><br>  - Task: you need to collect certain data from a large number of forms / forms / documents, for example, phone numbers of employees.  The program will automatically do it for you if you specify the selection criteria (phone / initials / address / date of the contract / organization, etc.).  The selected data will be saved in Xls, the format can also be changed manually. <br><br>  - You can upload and recognize files from DropBox, EverNote, SharePoint and some other data storage services that are not so popular in Russia. <br><br>  - I liked it very much: creating audio files from electronic and paper documents.  Those.  along with character recognition, Text-to-Speech (Text-to-Speech) technology is used.  The speech quality is perfect, that is, if there are no grammatical errors in the document, or if it is not about quantizing the fields (although there may be such a dictionary in the local database), then in one click you receive from the document an audio track with the dictated electronic but quite pleasant and even intonated voice. <br><br>  - From prosaic: scans with one click, quickly converts and recognizes.  The program is convenient when working with a large number of documents. <br><br>  The third solution is <a href="http://nuance.com/for-business/by-product/paperport/index.htm">PaperPort</a> .  A classic file manager with a focus on cloud services (GDocs, SilverLight, etc.), so that documents can be accessed from anywhere, for example with iPad.  It is very useful if there is a large number of scanning devices in the office - it centralizes and considerably simplifies the workflow. <br><br>  These 3 programs are from Nuance, so are the product links to their website.  We are selling them through Softline. <br><br>  <i><b>Epilogue</b></i> <br><br>  Before that, I worked with similar applications from ABBYY and Adobe - in many respects it is similar, so I tried to mention functions that can be partially or completely called ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know why Nuance was chosen specifically in our case, but I suspect that it‚Äôs about the price of a corporate license. <br><br>  Products, of course, claim to well-defined competition with unknown solutions from companies on ‚ÄúA‚Äù, however, contrary to initial skepticism, they turned out to be verbal and with industry twist.  In general, unexpectedly high quality, from where I did not expect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138286/</a></p>
