  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Networking, workshops and round tables for IT specialists: how to organize?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It has long been in the West, and more recently in our country in Russia, communities of developers and IT specialists began to appear.  Often their informal meetings are held in various coworkings and open spaces.  They meet about once every two weeks and discuss the latest news and trends in the high-tech world. <br><br>  We will talk about three types of such meetings: networking, workshops and round tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/357/f0c/489/357f0c489d2369c9ed941c7d7df74950.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Networking or ‚Äúget-togethers‚Äù</b> are the most informal meetings where participants gather to get to know each other and share the projects they lead.  At such meetings, guests are offered refreshments and snacks (sometimes light alcohol with pizza).  They are useful for those who want to find people to implement their project, to learn a lot about the IT field, or to ask advice from more experienced participants. <br><br>  <b>The workshop</b> is a collective learning event, the participants of which gain new knowledge and skills in the process of dynamic group work.  Such events are useful for young professionals who want to learn new things in practice.  The organizers are trying to give each participant a special attention, because the reputation of their company depends on it. <br><br>  <b>Round tables</b> or expert evenings are the rarest, but also the most useful events.  Experts from well-known companies are invited to such meetings so that they can answer questions or share interesting case studies.  After completing a series of questions - answers, participants either disperse or begin to get to know each other, making new useful acquaintances. <br><br>  Despite the fact that such events are increasingly being held, the organizers are funds and small and medium-sized businesses.  They are not looking for regular members, but for new clients for themselves.  It is understandable, until recently, to hold a full-fledged event was worth good money. <br><br>  The situation began to change with the advent of various sites where ordinary users can tell about the upcoming event.  They are happy not only to place in their section of the necessary information about the upcoming meeting, but also make a distribution to their users in your city. <br><br>  YavGroup went further.  YavGroup is a Community of people with the same interests.  Any user can open their own Interest Group for free and hold amateur meetings and events.  If you are familiar with the American analogue meetup, then it will be easier for you to understand the essence of this site. <br><br>  Now YavGroup is waiting for the first users who want to open their Group for free and hold amateur meetings and, possibly, official events in the future.  <b>‚ÄúDevelopers of iOs and Android applications‚Äù, ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù, ‚ÄúTech startups‚Äù, ‚ÄúJQuery Developers‚Äù, ‚ÄúAgile and Growth Hacking Specialists‚Äù, ‚ÄúBusiness Networking‚Äù, ‚ÄúMaterial Design Specialists‚Äù - this is a small list of possible groups that participants can open.</b>  Moreover, those groups that open before the rest will be able to recruit more participants for their events. <br><br>  Having organized your community, you will meet not only new friends, but you will be in the center of the life of specialists in your field, receiving all the relevant news at events.  After a while you will be able to invite experts from their large companies to share their experience with your participants.  Round tables will take your group to a new level. <br><br>  Some users tend to underestimate the benefits of such events, explaining that nothing sensible can be there.  However, this is not quite true.  Although the entire responsibility for holding the meeting lies with the organizer, the participants themselves should try to extract maximum opportunities.  In other words, participants should be active, and not just sit and listen to the speaker or have fun with friends aside, as is the case in most business events. <br><br>  The organizers should also make sure that each of the guests feels comfortable: for example, distribute disposable badges, where participants write their names, introduce them to each other, help them find partners and much more. <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/20214/">Under this link you can read the article that you need to organize your small event.</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://yavgruppe.ru/">And then, create your own group of meetings and organize the first event - YavGroup.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298472/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298472/</a></p>
