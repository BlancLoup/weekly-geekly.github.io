  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five principles for creating a secure "connected" car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As the era of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù mobile technologies begins, the interaction between smartphones and cars will only expand, and networking will take a fresh look at car keys, creating alternative and additional options for using traditional key fobs.  Remotely open, close the doors, start the engine, find the nearest car for hire - just a few convenient features provided by the new generation of ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù keys, however, the risks associated with the actions of hackers and other intruders are growing.  How to protect users and owners of "connected" cars? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/794/cf2/531/794cf253129f428eb3731c09dae2850d.jpg" width="100%"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A modern virtual car key (Virtual Car Key, VCK), which allows you to open and lock a car through a mobile application, can provide additional convenience as well as enhanced security by using an additional authentication factor, such as biometrics - in particular, applications can use fingerprint scanning fingers to provide access to the car.  By considering the interaction between the car and the smartphone at the design stage, we can further improve security and improve user experience. <br><br>  In order to best protect cars and passengers in the future, we have developed 5 basic principles when creating safety solutions for a connected car.  Following these principles, automobile and transport services will be able to offer their users solutions that will be resistant to hacker attacks.

    <h3>  1. Confidence </h3><br>  If virtual car keys (VCK) are destined to become more widespread, then users need to be confident in the security of their applications.  Therefore, today, developers are faced with the task of providing the same sense of confidence that users have when they open a car with an ordinary physical key.  To achieve this sensation, it is necessary to make security measures as noticeable as possible. <br><br>  In this case, the use of biometric technologies will be very useful.  <b>Users need to be constantly reminded that they are protected</b> - through security icons, symbols, alerts, or using the user recognition system. <br><br>  Openness is an important quality in any successful security solution;  digital security concerns everyone, not just a few cybertech experts. <br><br>  Here it is important to inform consumers that the most appropriate safety technology is used to protect them.  You need to tell them exactly how they can provide security at the proper level.  ‚ÄúDigital hygiene‚Äù is critical in this case. <br><br><h3>  2. Convenience </h3><br>  We are all aware of the importance of security issues, but equally important is the creation of an optimal user experience.  If the authentication processes are complex and time consuming, this can be a big obstacle to getting connected cars and virtual car keys into everyday use. <br><br>  Manufacturers need to focus on designing an integrated, integrated user experience with a connected car that uses <b>real-time solutions</b> to connect the car, authenticate users, and account for driving preferences. <br><br><h3>  3. Partnership </h3><br>  A new era of mobility will inevitably affect many different stakeholders.  Today, interaction is more important than ever - <b>automakers must join hands with</b> mobile phone <b>developers</b> , security solution providers, entertainment and information service providers, and mobile phone operators to improve user experience. <br><br><h3>  4. Integration </h3><br>  In a new mobile era, when more and more data is being transferred between smartphones and cars, security issues will be of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/319366/">paramount importance</a> .  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãattacks are carried out through the weakest link in the chain, and since hackers are becoming more savvy and sophisticated, security must be laid in the very early stages of design, <b>‚Äúpatching holes‚Äù is unlikely to be appropriate</b> . <br><br><h3>  5. Support </h3><br>  When building security solutions, it is important to take into account the life cycle of the car, as well as services deployed on smartphones and mobile devices.  To effectively counter the threat, we must invest in security checks in real time and in solutions that are able <b>to adapt to new conditions</b> . <br><br>  Following these five principles, developers will be able to successfully prepare for the onset of a new era of mobility and ensure that security measures do not adversely affect user experience. <br><br>  Unlike traditional keys, virtual keys provide access to the car and start the engine with the ability to untie users - because of its virtuality.  With proper practical implementation, with proper initialization of keys and their storage, this technology has a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/317668/">great future</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326402/</a></p>
