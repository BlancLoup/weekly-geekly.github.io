And no matter how cool, only a small part of the project requires us to be creative, in-depth analysis, rapid communication.  Even if you are lucky, and on your project it will all be / is / was, yet all the hard, routine work will come one day.  And now the eyes are not so brightly lit, and more and more often we make coffee breaks and read favorite blogs.  And then already tea is something tasteless, and some blogs are boring.  And you want something that sort of ... "then, whether a new constitution, then, whether stellate sturgeon under horseradish" <br>  All this is understandable, but what do I suggest, you ask?  I want to share known to me recipes for the resurrection of inspiration and I propose to jointly supplement this topic with new ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My main advice can be titled with a quote from one of my colleagues: <b>‚ÄúEvery person should have some kind of hobby, a class different from work.‚Äù</b> I'd add <b>that it‚Äôs important that the results of this activity are tangible, otherwise it turns out (subconsciously) like dead time</b> .  And this occupation does not need to specifically invent and attract by the ears.  What kind of activity is like you?  Only you know this!  But it‚Äôs possible that this weakness didn‚Äôt allow itself for so long, that they have already forgotten how it is with you :-) Let's sort out who has something and share it, and someone can look and understand - yes this is what I want!

      <b>Recipe 1.</b> Draw, and draw boldly, draw only what you want, and do not throw it away! <br><br>  When I want ‚Äúsomething like this,‚Äù I unconsciously begin to draw.  But the drawings on the pieces of paper are thrown away or they protrude to the table in the side table.  But once in sight, the old damaged discs and acrylic paints turned out to be.  Since then I have been painting cupboards or mugs themselves, or whatever I think of it and give it to friends.  It is much more positive than throwing labor into the trash.  It should be noted that I, of course, not an artist, and it turns out very amateur, but this is a reflection of my personality, and friends like to receive as a gift not a stamped in China little garbage, but a little thing with a soul. <br><br>  <b>Recipe 2.</b> (+ <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/sigizmund/" class="user_link">sigizmund</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/hazzard/" class="user_link">Hazzard</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/mrmager/" class="user_link">mrmager</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/lliamah/" class="user_link">LLIAMAH</a> ) Run, roll, swim, dance.  Strain your mortal body to exhaustion, and then gladly say "poo-pooh, how good!" <br><br>  The recipe, of course, for the most courageous and strong-willed of us :-) But the more pleasant it is to realize that we are one of the most.  And the results of such a rest will certainly not fall!  Like chatting with a friend who had ‚Äúagula mlyavasts and abyakavasts yes zhytstsya‚Äù we came across exactly this recipe for him.  And for him this was nothing new, just forgotten old.  When he remembered that he had not run for a long time, he immediately cheered up.  And the next day, having run, he was already full of optimism! <br><br>  <b>Recipe 3.</b> Write.  Articles, poems and prose, novels, and even ... questions. <br><br>  Literary creativity is multifaceted and often manifests itself quite unexpectedly.  From here surgeons who write poems, teachers who compose fantasy, and a lot more of this ... <br><br>  Want something original?  For example, many of us read quite a lot, and very interesting facts often come across.  You can just wonder, smile and go on.  And you can ... write questions for the game "What?  Where?  When? ‚ÄùOr‚Äú Brain Ring ‚Äù.  The point is not as simple as it seems.  You can say - art - fascinating and addictive.  Questions should not be too complicated or too simple, and the answers should be elegant and beautiful.  Examples of good questions can be found in the key phrase ‚Äúthe base of questions, what and when‚Äù.  Perhaps soon you will be like a drug addict looking for new relevant information for questions.  By the way, there are many places where good questions will be accepted with gratitude and even materially expressed.  After all, we remember that labor brings more satisfaction if its fruits are not thrown away, but bring joy to people. <br><br>  <b>Recipe 4.</b> (from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/pixoid/" class="user_link">pixoid</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/demitsuri/" class="user_link">demitsuri</a> and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/bambr/" class="user_link">Bambr</a> ) Cook.  Peel, cut, boil, fry.  Feed your loved ones. <br><br>  Of course, we are not talking about daily cooking of shop dumplings :-) It's about real art. <br>  Imagine: retire in the kitchen, enjoy solitude, peace and quiet.  Imagine how to feast on this and surprise others.  mmm ... it seems that something delicious, delicious, fragrant.  Why, at least potatoes fry with a ruddy crust or something :-) Somewhere near, water rushes or pan puffs, and under these lulling sounds your hands are doing something, and thoughts fly away ... <br><br>  <b>Recipe 5</b> .  (from <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/kavkazec/" class="user_link">kavkazec</a> , <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/jc_piligrim/" class="user_link">JC_Piligrim</a> and <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/avanti/" class="user_link">Avanti</a> ) Play the guitar, piano or even violin. <br><br>  It turns out that among IT professionals there are a lot of great musicians. <br>  Some Kaspersky Lab employees play jazz at their leisure (BriefLove group). <br>  At least half the folk-rock teams of The Dartz are involved in administration and programming. <br><br>  Great helps to distract and "refresh" the head.  And in the case of, for example, a drum set - also to support the form. <br><br>  And by the way, remember Sherlock Holmes? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82454/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82454/</a></p>
