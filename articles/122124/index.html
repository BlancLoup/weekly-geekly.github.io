Perhaps someone will be useful. <br><br>  I was faced with a question: how can I find a person on Facebook if I only have his e-mail address?  The banal answer ‚Äúto ask him himself‚Äù is deliberately not accepted, because in 99 percent of cases it is recommended to search by name and surname.  Facebook has a hard time with this, especially for widespread Ivanovs and Petrovs :) <br><br>  As a result, requires a small "dance with a tambourine."

    <a name="habracut"></a>  So, the source of your friend's e-mail may be your email client address book or an e-mail from a business card.  Consider both options.  More precisely, suppose that you need to select friends first from the already existing address book, and also to learn how to add friends afterwards individually, via their well-known e-mail, for example, from a business card. <br><br>  In the event that you correspond with a friend at least once, then modern postal services automatically place their e-mail in your address book.  As a result, after some time, your address book accumulates people who deserve an invitation to Facebook, and this import can be fully automated. <br><br>  In my case, the mail service was Google Mail.  I decided to try to import contacts into Facebook from it, as well as create a separate account where I would add contacts from business cards and then start importing them into Facebook from them.  This know-how would allow people to search on Facebook via e-mail, which he ‚Äúofficially‚Äù is not able to do. <br><br>  As you know, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/subconsciousness/25498/">Facebook is not friendly with Google</a> and one of the ‚Äúfi‚Äù is the refusal of facebook-a to import contacts from google mail.  When you try to enter an e-mail address in the <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gmail/" class="user_link">gmail</a> domain in the "Your email address" field, Facebook immediately displays the message "at least at the time of this writing and months earlier and definitely worked about a year ago). <br><br>  It would seem that there is always a ‚Äúfallback‚Äù, export contacts from google mail to a file, and feed a file to Facebook.  No matter how, on all three possible export formats, Facebook ‚Äúhangs‚Äù (as of the day this article was written).  It was tested on two browsers under Mac OS and in IE8 under Windows. <br><br>  The next thing that comes to mind is to create a mailbox on some other service, find contacts there, import a file with contacts from Google, or, if that service can do so, give it direct access to Google mail for independent import of contacts. <br><br>  Note that Facebook ‚Äúknows‚Äù about more mail services than presented on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/">Find Friends</a> page.  But let's start with those that are allocated there in separate blocks: <br><br>  1. <b><a href="http://mail.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Mail</a></b> .  A box to get pretty quickly, there are convenient contacts, BUT!  no import.  Moreover, in the help of Yandex it is <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/neomail/%3Fid%3D1111470">indicated</a> that there is an import: " <i>On the address book page of the web interface, click on the" Import "button</i> . There is no such button there, I suspect that" no longer exists. " <br><br>  2. <b><a href="http://mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo.Mail</a></b> .  Technically, there is an import, direct from Gmail, but in my case I failed.  It gives an error, and it does not depend on the size of the imported data. <br><br>  3. <b><a href="http://mail.ru/">Mail.ru.</a></b>  Facebook recognized the mail, imports the contacts, but here‚Äôs an ambush: there is a limit on the number of contacts in the mail.ru itself - 1000 pieces.  Also, mail.ru does not know how to independently download contacts from Google.  If these restrictions do not interfere, then it is quite usable. <br><br>  4. <b><a href="http://mail.rambler.ru/">Rambler</a></b> . <b><a href="http://mail.rambler.ru/">Mail</a></b> .  Here the import of contacts was not found at all. <br><br>  5. <b><a href="http://hotmail.com/">Hotmail</a></b> .  This email service worked with a bang.  He has a full and fairly fast importer from Gmail and files, and it works as it should.  The import of almost 2000 contacts from Gmail went off well.  To add a new contact, just one email is sufficient. <br><br>  So, the result is the following: Hotmail was the most suitable for our needs.  If you have less than 1000 contacts, then Mail.ru will also work. <br><br>  What do we do next.  We create two mailboxes - one to store contacts with Google, the other - for new contacts.  The first box after importing contacts and ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù them to Facebook will be completely unnecessary, it can be deleted immediately.  Why can't I use one box for this purpose?  Because for importing contacts one by one, an empty address book is needed, and fellow developers of all the above mail services, including the Hotmail chosen by us, do not implement mass deletion of ALL contacts, and deleting them after bulk import is page-by-page very long.  It is much easier to remove the box. <br><br>  So, in the first box we transfer contacts from Gmail by importing using the appropriate Hotmail tool (his service will be actively offered by him after registration).  Then go to Facebook on the page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/">Find Friends</a> and tick the friends.  Let me remind you that Facebook displays a list of friends whose e-mails were found in the address book of the specified mail service and at the same time whose e-mails are listed in the Facebook profile. <br><br>  Then, each time you need to find someone by e-mail, we do the following.  We go into our specially created box with the name, for example, for.new.contacts@hotmail.com and add an entry to the address book.  All fields are optional, except for the e-mail, and we have it.  After that, go to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/find-friends/">Facebook contact import page</a> and enter the above address in the ‚Äúemail address‚Äù field.  Facebook finds a person by the specified e-mail, as required. <br><br>  If the form of adding a new contact and the import page to Facebook is added to the browser bookmarks, then the search for a person by e-mail turns into a simple two-step procedure and takes only a few seconds. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122124/</a></p>
