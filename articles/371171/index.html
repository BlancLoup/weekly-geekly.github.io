I remember how you separated from Habrahabr.  How thundered on the whole world.  It was all there!  From political doctors to DIY projects.  From dreams of the future to memories of the past. <br><br>  How many legs I have changed since then - already and stopped counting.  And then on you, as they say, "scored".  You have become uninteresting to your developers who have switched to new projects.  They had no time to fasten to you a holographic interface, and then all subsequent innovations.  Well, before finally turning you into abandon - also translated to HTML 3.2 and eight-bit encoding.  The argument is that ‚Äúin order for Arachne to work, one and a half oldfag will hang around here anyway.‚Äù  So it happened.  It is difficult in the middle of the twenty-second century to be a popular resource that does not use all six senses through a neural interface.

      And today I again engraved a tombstone for the legs.  Hand engraving today is a very rare and expensive service, but after all, at any feet the first and last owners are rich.  So this story is quite typical. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  I bought them from the heat, from the heat, one businessman directly from the grower.  Only three months I carried and changed.  This is how businessmen change their legs every two to three years, and this one suddenly decided to change the size from 45 to 46. According to him, ‚Äúbecause Zhirinovsky only wears such things.‚Äù  Zhirinovsky, by the way, completely changed his interests, if anyone does not know.  In the bards leaned. <br><br>  Three-month legs for the price of three-year-old were bought instantly.  Their new owner was the representative of the middle class.  Long used until they turned 35 years old.  Also quite a typical case. <br><br>  Then a poorer man bought them from him.  And here the story is more than typical: when the legs turned 60, one of them became ill with arthritis.  Then he changed it and sold it to the antique dealer, and he continued to wear the second one.  They like rogue sometimes to change legs separately.  Antiquarian connected the purchase to the supporter, cured and waited until the same fate befall the second leg.  I had to wait a year.  Then he bought it, he also cured and began to both wear. <br><br>  And in 75 feet died.  Today they will be buried and put a gravestone with my engraving. <br><br>  Well, my wife - legfri, she basically does not wear legs.  As in the twenty-first century, many people basically did not wear watches, because smartphones are there - remember?  She uses a purely mechanical wheelchair, as it is easier to maintain at home than her legs.  And jokingly he calls himself Amish, although the Amish procedure for replacing the legs does not differ from the standard one.  The only condition they put forward is that the energy for the grower is generated locally. <br><br>  Other Legfri, on the contrary, wear very high-tech bionic prostheses.  But those and others a little.  I do not know about you, but in our city the society treats them favorably.  In the worst case - for the cranks keeps, no more. <br><br>  This is the fun life that the medical staff planted on us, making the whole person immortal, except for the legs.  No one remembers whether they couldn‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt want, but they did it all.  The grave diggers union was very pleased that the profession was preserved.  Well, we, engravers, were even more delighted: the feet change owners several times - it means that there are more dates on the tombstone to write. <br><br>  And now - about why I actually came here.  I can talk about this for a very long time.  Shtihel shtihel disagree.  One thing - shpitststihhel ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371171/</a></p>
