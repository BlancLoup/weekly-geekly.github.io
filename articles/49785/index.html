      1. Interest and motivation to get a second higher education <br>  2. Search for possible options <br>  3. Possible problems <br>  4. Life issues <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I want to note that everything below is my vision of this issue.  I, of course, can be wrong about something.  :) <br><br>  Having received the first higher education in SPSUITMO, we with group mates happily burnt numerous copies of diplomas in a nearby urn.  We decided that everything!  Basta!  Free job search (who has not yet found by the time of graduation), career growth, wife, children and so on ... Each of us had concrete plans, if not for life, then for the near future for sure.  The army didn't bother the guys, since we all went through the military department.  Actually, many for the sake of this military department and went to study there. <br>  A year has passed. <br><br>  In the specialty, no one went to work, too little wages in the labor market in our profession.  We have dispersed who where.  Someone went to the car washers, someone to the sales representatives, someone got married, got married and was already waiting for children. <br><br>  I went to trade, it spun in the 2nd course.  Now I am the brightest representative of the "office plankton".  And I thought.  If one higher education gave me a military ID, then what can a second higher education give me?  Prospects?  Self-development?  New acquaintances and connections?  ...........? <br>  Began to look for information on the topic of interest. <br><br>  I live in St. Petersburg.  Universities offering a second higher education abound.  But! <br>  Almost all universities offer a second degree in the general profile.  After graduation, a person becomes ‚Äújust‚Äù an economist, marketer, lawyer, and so on ... <br>  All specialties are very blurred.  No specifics.  There is a rather narrow profile of training future specialists.  A person going to the second higher education is already at least 22 years old.  He does not want to spend another 3-4 years to get an IT-economist / marketing specialist, and then continue to improve his qualifications to a more narrow profile.  By that time he will be 27-28 years old.  Yes, the person will be young, but a few years lost.  Perhaps you would say that ‚ÄúNefig was to go for a military ticket, I would go to study where it is interesting and promising.  I would go to the army later, I would lose 2 years, but I would be educated in a good and promising profile. ‚Äù  There is a controversial situation, many will understand me.  Sometimes life first puts priorities. <br><br>  Friends, tell me what to do a year-old graduate in this situation: <br><br>  1. Go to the second highest.  Next - improve your skills. <br>  2. Search for refresher courses or retrain in another specialist <br>  3. Stay in the profession where you have been working for a long time and not engage in such drastic changes. <br>  4. Your option <br>  5. <s>And, actually, what are you talking about?</s>  :) <br><br>  PS All the above <strong>IMHO</strong> .  I will be happy to join in the discussion of this issue if there is a wish. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49785/</a></p>
