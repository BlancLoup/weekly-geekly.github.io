  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Smartphone, laptop and tablet controls the light in the apartment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Smartphones have grown firmly in our hands.  We sleep, eat, and, to be honest, we go to the toilet with our favorite gadgets.  Well, what about without a favorite tweeter?  How can you skip an important Facebook post?  And almost everyone in the house has a Wi-Fi access point, to which all home smartphones and tablets are connected. <br>  How to turn this bad habit into a useful one?  Do not just waste your time on messengers, but return to reality a little?  To adapt the smartphone to perform the necessary functions, and not just consume content and play.  How? <br>  It is known that today's smartphones can control various household appliances through applications, can be a universal remote control for anything from TV to microwave. <br>  A small lyrical digression. <br>  For nine years I managed the electricity of the capital of Belarus, when I was on a shift in the control room of electrical networks.  Could remotely enable and disable Minsk housing estates, factories, substations, electric transport, pumping stations and other objects.  Subsequently, my line of business changed, and I began to engage in information work in the energy system, but the craving for electricity management remained. <br><br>  If you think about it, the smartphone can control and electricity, at least in his apartment.  Let me remind readers how the management of electricity in my apartment " <a href="http://operby.com/evolyuciya-domashnix-tapochek-ili-umnyj-dom-svoimi-rukami.html">evolved from slippers to remotes</a> ."  So, using these remote controls (remote switches) and control units, you can control the light, without getting up from the couch, using a smartphone. <br>  It is enough to purchase a special <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/Ethernet_PR1132.html">Ethernet gateway</a> , connect it to the router via Wi-Fi, configure its presence on the network, install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.noolite">application</a> on the smartphone - and here it is!  You are the energy master of your home power grid and control electricity remotely! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a2/2b4/e73/4a22b4e733444ba667714cf05a821855.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fc/1d2/98d/0fc1d298dd52558286e4b4e865696e01.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What is the practical use of this control, other than just thrust?  There will always be those who will criticize, they say, and so we move a little, and here we don‚Äôt even need to walk to the switch, we‚Äôre quite fattened. But there are objective situations, for example, when a person is temporarily immobilized or restricted in movement. <br>  Yes, it is in this position that sick or disabled people can be found.  I felt myself when I was sick.  At night, with the temperature in the dark, when the children forgot to collect Lego and left it on the floor, with dizziness it is not so easy to get into the toilet.  And I turned on the ‚Äúlighting in the corridor‚Äù from my smartphone, it became quite comfortable.  This function really helped out.  I went to the toilet down the lighted corridor and turned off the light when I was already down. <br>  Let me remember about mother-in-law, about every mother-in-law  Most elderly people often have to get up at night at night, not only to go to the toilet, but also to take medicine.  This function is simply not replaceable, (as the mother-in-law said). <br>  I use dimmable light bulbs that tune the dim light night scenarios so that the glare doesn‚Äôt hit the eye. <br>  We were pleased with the built-in function of the gateway-timers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/479/552/e4a/479552e4a596a0bdd949c6cdcdef6265.png" alt="image"><br>  Really use these amenities every weekday.  Exactly at 6-20 o'clock the timer No. 3 (and there are only 8 of them) turns on the LED <cut>  lighting in the kitchen, it lights up the kitchen and the corridor with a light dim light, which in addition to the alarm clock says: ‚ÄúGet up, go wash and have breakfast!  Work is waiting! ‚ÄùAnd Timer # 4 turns off the backlight in the kitchen at 7-00 and says:‚Äú Have you had breakfast or not, but feet in hands - and into the parking lot, start the engine, otherwise you will be late! ‚Äù <br>  So, every weekday, two timers help the morning job! <br>  I did not forget about our smaller brothers.  Now the life support system of the aquarium also switches on by a timer, because previously they forgot to switch on aeration and light in it for a day. <br>  Lighting in the nursery is also configured according to the scenario.  At 21-30 hours the timer is triggered, and the script ‚Äúreduce lighting by 30%‚Äù means that it‚Äôs time to stop the games and lessons, but you need to brush your teeth, then ‚Äúon the potty‚Äù, and sleep.  At 22-00 hours the light in the nursery is turned off.  Of course, you can turn it on, but this is an exact release signal. <br>  Still happy with the ability to use the "disable all" function.  Now remotely, even without being at home, I can turn off or turn on the lights in all the fixtures attached to the system.  Or turn on the light, imitating its presence. <br>  To implement this function, you need to programmatically connect all sources to 1 channel.  And turn on-off all with one click. <br>  Further evolution I see the installation of control units on the sockets, or on their group.  So that you can even while on the road, but if you have the Internet, manage the power supply of the apartment.  How useful can the function be to remotely disconnect from the network an iron or a multicooker remaining in the ‚Äúheating‚Äù mode and avoid a fire in the house, right? .. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/230/055/a592300554cbbc6a682ee69d5c3a9a9d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The big advantage is that you can put each family member on your smartphone and you will have a lot of remote controls on the electrical control application for your home wiring.  Such a democracy is not always useful, it may be for children and it is not worth it to immediately issue such rights, but this already depends on the family structure of each particular household. <br>  Especially for techno-geeks who like to set up their own "smart home" on their own, or build it by brick "arduino" I will add the following.  This PR-1132 gateway has its own API, very simple and functional.  Everything is described in detail in the instructions.  So you can integrate this small and inexpensive system into more complex ones. <br>  As a result, I have to admit that the smartphone has grown even more firmly in our hand and is even more integrated into our life!  And I still control the light! </cut></div>
