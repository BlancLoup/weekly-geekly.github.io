In fact, only salary, money - no way.  But do not rush to tear the freshly signed and approved ‚ÄúRegulation on Material Incentives‚Äù into pieces - the correct answer is a bit more complicated than ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583">Maslow's pyramid</a> clearly explains why salary alone cannot motivate a person qualitatively.  Money is the foundation of human self-realization, the first two steps of the pyramid of needs.  On the next steps, although they are important, they do not have such a value as on the first two - here they almost literally mean satiety and everyday comfort. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ac/29c/c17/9ac29cc17baf2c3fe74e085a7368e35c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At a certain stage, monetary motivation stops working.  More precisely, its effectiveness is sharply reduced.  A person builds the foundation of his needs pyramid, ceases to think how to save up for some large purchase, etc.  - his life is arranged.  Money ceases to mean for him the realization of his desires, because he realized the desires that depend directly on money.  The next increase is not particularly happy, and if the company can not offer the employee anything but money, then there is a feeling of ‚Äústuck in development‚Äù, ‚Äúswamp‚Äù. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>From this, the conclusion is often made that ‚Äúmoney does not motivate‚Äù and they no longer motivate with money.</i>  <i>For example, it was so in my previous work, where at some point the management made a global decision to motivate non-materially and started ‚Äúcorporate culture‚Äù, ‚Äúplanned productivity growth‚Äù, trainings, mini-corporate events and other disco, while the salary increase was declared a moratorium on the death penalty.</i> </div></div><br><br>  When a person begins to consider his salary something natural and comfortable, he begins to think about something more.  The first question he asks himself is - do I work with those people?  Peace and harmony should reign at least within the small department in which the person works, the head of the department and the staff should respect each other and be a mountain for each other.  Then the employee will not leave the company in search of "his place", inspired by the new salary and with a raging appetite.  In such a situation, employees usually talk about ‚Äúa good team‚Äù, and managers - ‚Äúthere is a team‚Äù. <br><br>  If there is a team, i.e.  the need for belonging to a group is satisfied, then a person thinks about recognition and encouragement.  Only at this level it makes sense to apply a rich arsenal of ‚Äúnon-material motivation‚Äù, which Eychary like to offer top management as ‚Äúteam building activities‚Äù.  Events are good, but if the employee is not satisfied with his salary, then the various "recognition of merit" and corporate holidays will be an extra obligation for him and just a pain in the ass. <br><br>  On the other hand, if you are a boss and you need to motivate an employee who is satisfied with his salary and joins the team, then it may be enough just to praise him.  Do not hesitate, with other employees or in person.  Simple, but the right words spoken at the right time can work wonders.  Recognizing success, you will help a person climb another step of self-realization.  After passing this step a person does not need to be motivated further - he is in his place, in his team, recognized, respected and seeks to prove himself.  It strives to develop and achieve new successes, and all reasonable kpi are performed by it automatically.  Such a worker will turn mountains for you and hold on to his place with all his hands and feet.  The main thing is not to interfere with his work, not to demotivate, although it is quite difficult to knock out such motivated people. <br><br>  Think that's all?  As if not so.  What I have described is only one iteration of the cycle, which can be called ‚Äúself-realization at work‚Äù.  When a certain level of self-development is reached, a person will understand that he can receive more for his skills and experience.  Moreover, most often, his work is really worth the requested money.  Ideally, the process looks like this: good sn -&gt; right team -&gt; new successes -&gt; new experience and knowledge, self-study and professional growth -&gt; good sn + gain 1 -&gt; right team -&gt; new successes -&gt; new experience and knowledge, self-education and professional growth -&gt; good salary + gain1 + gain2 -&gt; the right team -&gt; new successes -&gt; ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>In reality, the cycle is sooner or later interrupted for one reason or another.</i>  <i>Here it is important for the boss to feel the moment, to understand at what level of the ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù the employee is and what he really stands for.</i>  <i>Do not hesitate to celebrate success and raise wages, raise in the position, etc.</i>  <i>Or do not hesitate to offer a peaceful separation, if the needs of the employee begin to exceed the capabilities of the company.</i>  <i>An employee needs to feel free to state his needs, desires and not be afraid to look for a new job, if the self-realization ceiling has come to the present.</i> </div></div><br><br>  In other words, the right job is the best motivation.  That work is correct, in which you can and want to prove yourself, to achieve success and recognition.  I want to prove myself at that job, where you have exhausted the possibility of motivating you with just one salary, i.e.  where the salary suits you completely. <br><br>  Proper work to you, habrarapipl. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167855/</a></p>
