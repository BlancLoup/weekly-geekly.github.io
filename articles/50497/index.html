I did not discover America, but simply put together and formulated a number of requirements that the designer must take into account in the process of designing and designing the site. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  First we think, then we do </h2><br>  This is a very simple and often violated rule.  Especially young designers. <br><br>  I highly recommend to everyone: take a pencil and paper.  Think about the tasks and idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site.  Make quick draft sketches, find the composition, approximate grid, arrangement of blocks and elements, handwriting required illustrations.  And only after that sit down at the computer. <br><br>  Such a simple move is at times more productive, saves a lot of time and helps to find more interesting solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8f/c2e/de3/c8fc2ede344ebbf168651a8020f784ab.jpg" width="600" height="385" alt="First we think, then we do"><br>  <em>An example of a quick draft and the result</em> <br><br><h2>  From big to small, from general to particular </h2><br>  This is the second simple rule.  And it is also often broken. <br><br>  Classical teaching of drawing and painting teaches: ‚ÄúMove from the larger to the smaller, from the general to the particular.  First, study the overall composition, the largest masses and volumes, the largest spots, and then refine, specify, saturate with details. ‚Äù <br><br>  This rule applies in its entirety to all aspects and genres of design. <br><br>  Think over your project, find the idea and composition, draw a series of sketches.  And then, systematically, embody these sketches, starting with the grid, the layout of blocks, elements, large color spots.  And consistently fill them with details. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/153/d57/a81/153d57a8154d5278a4cb5618b3278b89.jpg" width="600" height="240" alt="An example of step by step refinement and refinement of the layout"><br>  <em>An example of step-by-step refinement and refinement of the layout from the general to the particular.</em> <br><br>  Admittedly, I often saw <nobr>how</nobr> <s>self-taught</s> <nobr>artists,</nobr> nuggets, began to paint a portrait of a man from the eye, or from the finger of his left foot.  And more than once I have seen some designers start to draw a site with <nobr>some kind of</nobr> <nobr>one-private</nobr> icon.  And in both cases, to my surprise, an interesting result was obtained. <br><br>  But it is a long way, often requiring big adjustments and rework in the design process.  Perhaps it is applicable for creativity, but in the <nobr>design profession</nobr> , when in a certain period you need to get a good result, I believe that such an approach is unacceptable.  We need guaranteed <em>process technologies</em> to get guaranteed results in a clear time frame.  And not just <nobr>‚Äúwork out‚Äù</nobr> . <br><br>  So, to summarize: " <strong>From the biggest to the smallest, from the general to the particular</strong> ." <br><br><h2>  Modular grid </h2><br>  One of the first decisions in the process of creating a design is a modular grid.  A single frame and layout of all the main blocks and elements, passing through all pages of the site. <br><br>  Grids are simple and complex, flexible in use and not very.  It is not so important.  It is important that if you design a specific grid of modules when designing a design, please follow it.  From the first to the last page of your project.  And if in the process of drawing internal pages you have elements that do not fit into the adopted grid, it means you didn‚Äôt spend enough time designing it. <br><br>  Following a single modular grid within the project will not only increase the integrity and consistency of the perception of the site, but also greatly simplify the work of developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3b/719/ed8/a3b719ed878720d901b3fecea312fa51.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt="An example of the use of modular grid"><br>  <em>An example of the use of modular grid</em> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32e/150/fbb/32e150fbb7ce5a43567cf7055083e01f.jpg" width="600" height="270" alt="An example of the use of modular grid"><br>  <em>An example of the use of modular grid</em> <br><br><h2>  Scalability </h2><br>  Nowadays, when all users have a wide variety of monitors, it makes sense to make mostly ‚Äúrubber‚Äù sites.  Those.  sites that scale to the user's monitor resolution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31b/ebe/3c7/31bebe3c7b83872cbeeae3a55bd4dc2c.jpg" width="600" height="220" alt="Display elastic site on various monitors"><br>  <em>Display elastic site on various monitors</em> <br><br>  So, making a "rubber" design do not forget that: <br><ul><li>  The overall composition should not be disturbed at any resolution of the monitor by the visitor. </li><li>  All elements are scaled according to the size of the user's screen and font size. </li><li>  All modular grid, blocks and other horizontals are scaled in percent. </li><li>  All fonts, indents, almost all verticals are scaled in <em>em</em> .  In many cases, this even applies to the <em>border</em> . </li><li>  <strong><em>The exception</em></strong> may be only pictures.  And the fact that the hard size in <em>px</em> for many images is only a vertical limit. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <nobr>"Compression-stretching"</nobr> </h3><br>  Optimal for using the so-called <nobr>"semi-rubber",</nobr> i.e.  The site is stretched and compressed to a certain limit. <br><br><h4>  min </h4><br>  The first thing to start with is to find the minimum site compression. <br><br>  <strong><em>The minimum width of the</em></strong> site, of course, determined by the objectives of the site and its target audience.  In fact, now there are only two minimum parameters: 760 <em>px</em> and 990 <em>px</em> .  The first is optimal for corporate sites or resources designed for the most mass and disparate audience (for example, mass services: email, search, news, etc.).  The second one is suitable for image and promotion destination websites. <br><br>  We check and, if necessary, adjust, each element of the modular grid so that there are no overlaps / overlaps of elements against each other with minimal compression of the site. <br><br><h4>  max </h4><br>  <strong><em>The maximum width of the</em></strong> site may be different, but, as a rule, the recommended range for stretching is not more than <nobr>one and a half to two</nobr> times the size of the minimum compression.  This is due to the fact that when the site is stretched by more than one and a half times, the composition usually collapses. <br><br>  It is necessary to determine what will happen with the entire site, with the size of the user's monitor over the maximum width.  We decide where it will be leveled.  Right?  Left?  In the center? <br><br>  We achieve a complete view of the site and its natural transition to the environment at a resolution above the maximum.  It is unacceptable that the site on a large monitor looked like "cut off." <br><br>  We draw all the illustrations and non-repeating backgrounds from the principle ‚Äúwhoever has a bigger monitor will see more‚Äù.  Usually, the width of the illustrations is due to the width of the modular grid blocks in the <em>max</em> state. <br><br><h2>  Reserve for site growth </h2><br>  In the larger scope of tasks, if it is not a <nobr>business card site</nobr> or a <nobr>promotional site,</nobr> you need to consider that the number of pages and sections of the site can grow and change. <br><br>  Therefore: <br><br>  Navigation should be designed so that the addition of new menu items, and even more so the change in the name of the items was painless.  It is unacceptable that the addition of a new section leads to a revision of navigation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/916/4d3/33c/9164d333c9b01c2c9b25d492bf136627.png" width="600" height="230" alt="An example of a &quot;painless&quot; change / add a tree navigation of the first and second level"><br>  <em>An example of a "painless" change / add a tree navigation of the first and second level</em> <br><br>  In some cases, it is necessary to provide for the appearance / addition of information / functional blocks on the site that are painless for the appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/883/d23/932/883d23932c780164a9ba6bd6c4350f16.png" width="600" height="260" alt="An example of &quot;painless&quot; moving, changing / deleting blocks of a site"><br>  <em>An example of a ‚Äúpainless‚Äù move,</em> <em><br></em>  <em>change / delete site blocks</em> <br><br>  Given the on-screen scalability, as well as the addition of new materials to the site, it is recommended to give preference to text headers and navigation. <br><br><h2>  Font scheme </h2><br>  Most of the sites look whole and complete when building a design based on <nobr>one or three</nobr> fonts. <br><br>  <strong><em>Base font</em></strong> - the main font of the site materials. <br><br>  <em><strong>Accident</strong></em> - font for headers. <br><br>  In some cases, <em>additional fonts</em> are introduced for: <br><ul><li>  menu and navigation; </li><li>  selection blocks (important information, quotes, callouts); </li><li>  for small text, in order to improve readability. </li></ul><br><br>  The designer must plan a common overall indent / spacing size scheme for all elements on the site, a hierarchy of headings and navigation elements (for example, for a tree menu or tag cloud).  It should be solid and used on all pages of the site. <br><br>  All subsequent registration of information on the site should be based on the general scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b76/860/68a/b7686068aa8971a1cbced5a2fa20569c.png" width="600" height="290" alt="Font scheme on the example of the site ValueTech"><br>  <em>Font scheme of a simple corporate website</em> <br><br><h2>  User reaction </h2><br>  The designer must plan what will happen to the elements that react to user actions. <br><br>  Consider the typical elements. <br><br><h3>  Navigation </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a46/6cb/619/a466cb6196314b0d0ec3489d4c555771.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="Fragment of the site layout, which shows the three states of navigation"><br>  <em>Fragment of the site layout, which shows the three states of navigation: the usual menu view, the menu item with the cursor hovering, the selection of the current section.</em> <br><br>  Depending on the type and scale of the site, you need to show a number of states of the navigation point. <br><br>  Typical set: <br><ul><li>  Normal view. </li><li>  We hover over. </li><li>  We are in this section. </li><li>  We are in this section, but have gone deeper. </li><li>  We hover over the item of the parent section. </li></ul><br><br>  At the same time, the minimum set for <em>all</em> navigation elements, including switches and controls, is the normal and active view.  Those.  the minimum for all controls and navigation elements is ‚Äúon / off‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/711/755/c4d/711755c4d64cf27add78c20429994ad4.jpg" width="600" height="200" alt="Different states of the navigation item"><br>  <em>Different states of the navigation item</em> <br><br><h3>  Links </h3><br>  Links located in the text are always underlined and should be different in color from the main text. <br><br>  It is desirable, and in the navigation is necessary to provide the appearance of the link, when you hover the cursor. <br><br>  In large volumes of text and in the issuance of heterogeneous information (for example, the table of contents of articles, site maps, etc.), it is necessary to provide an appearance for the visited links.  And they also require their appearance when you hover. <br><br><h4>  Links with additional properties </h4><br>  For links that provide additional features, especially when used <em>in the text</em> , it is recommended to provide a small icon that tells the user about the additional properties of the link. <br><br>  These icons require links: <br><ul><li>  alternative data acquisition (RSS, PDA, print version) </li><li>  downloading files located on the server </li><li>  appeal to popular resources (Yandex, Google, Flickr, LJ, map services, Wikipedia, etc.) </li><li>  e-mail addresses </li><li>  opening forms </li><li>  open link in new window </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd1/9c9/5cc/cd19c95cc00455a0f0ad17a34123aa63.gif" width="600" height="249" alt="Examples of using additional icons in life"><br>  <em>Examples of the use of additional icons "in life."</em> <br><br><h3>  Pseudo-links </h3><br>  PseudoLinks, i.e.  Links that do not lead to another page, but open / hide information on the current page, without reloading it, are indicated by a dotted underline.  In all other respects, everything that is stated for normal links applies to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a3/197/e2f/6a3197e2f201d9f901cdcd5ebb572293.jpg" width="600" height="300" alt="Pseudo reference example"><br>  <em>One example of using pseudo links.</em> <br><br><h3>  Tabs </h3><br>  Tabs are a mixture of a navigation element and a control. <br><br>  For them, we take into account the state: <br><ul><li>  tab is inactive </li><li>  hover cursor (opt) </li><li>  content loader (opt) </li><li>  tab active </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec2/c4d/a38/ec2c4da3872119006627d28dc488e1c8.jpg" width="600" height="250" alt="Fragment of the site where you can see three states of tabs at once."><br>  <em>A fragment of the site on which three states of tabs are visible at once: the active tab, the cursor is hovering and the usual, inactive, state.</em> <br><br><h3>  Cursor </h3><br>  We foresee the cursor response when hovering.  Especially, if we are talking about non-standard controls, such as navigation, <nobr>pseudo-links</nobr> and tabs ( <em>hand</em> ), <acronym>tips</acronym> ( <em>help</em> ), resizing the element and dragging. <br><br><h2>  Making the content </h2><br>  Information rules on the Internet.  The site is just a way to deliver it.  The external design of the site is just a frame that sets the emotional attitude and reinforces the brand. <br><br>  It is by studying the information that the user spends the largest part of his time on the site.  And it is for this reason that due attention should be paid to the design of the content. <br><br>  The objectives of the site and its content is always different.  Therefore, to make out this content is also always necessary in different ways. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d14/c2b/b4a/d14c2bb4a7ab34e435666cece582884b.jpg" width="600" height="500" alt="Fragment of the news site on which the designer showed most of the typical elements for the design of the content."><br>  <em>Fragment of the news site on which the designer showed most of the typical elements for the design of the content.</em> <br><br><h3>  Elements of content </h3><br>  At once it must be said that it is impossible to foresee in advance all possible design options.  We consider only the typical. <br><br>  For example, for a corporate site: <br><ul><li>  text paragraph; </li><li>  hierarchy of headings of <nobr>three or four</nobr> levels; </li><li>  links, <nobr>pseudo-links;</nobr> </li><li>  element highlighting important information; </li><li>  quote; </li><li>  unnumbered list; </li><li>  numbered list; </li><li>  nested lists; </li><li>  illustration on a strip, in the text; </li><li>  a table or several types of them; </li><li>  files for download; </li><li>  callouts; </li><li>  design of marginals, if any; </li><li>  submission of information in <nobr>2-3</nobr> columns (depending on the grid); </li><li>  simple form. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  A fish </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d64/c43/c79/d64c43c793d3055265532782446cef24.gif" width="600" height="300" alt="A fish"><br><br>  Ideally, you need to operate with <em>real</em> content.  If this is not the case, then at a minimum, the ‚Äúfish‚Äù should be <nobr>as typical as possible</nobr> for the page to be designed in terms of its type and volume.  This will avoid gaps in the design and an annoying look of the site after commissioning. <br><br>  It is completely unacceptable to use "fish" from another language, because  Text sizes and average word length vary.  For example in English and Russian is very noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b78/815/3ad/b788153ad7536d3a9a718076e4374e67.gif" width="600" height="230" alt="Different drawing of identical in content blocks of text in different languages."><br>  <em>Different drawing of identical in content blocks of text in different languages.</em> <br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  These requirements are not dogma.  From any rules you can sometimes deviate.  Only this should be done not out of ignorance, but <em>consciously</em> . <br><br><br><br><h3>  about the author </h3><br>  <strong>Pavel Kolodyazhny.</strong>  <nobr>Art director</nobr> and founder of the make <nobr>design bureau.</nobr> <br>  He specializes in <nobr>web site development</nobr> <nobr>and interface design.</nobr> <br>  Total experience in design - 9 years.
