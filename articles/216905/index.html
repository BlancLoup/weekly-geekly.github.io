The name was invented by the rally - <b>Cloak</b> (English cloak).  The application made for the Iphone and made it free, with the possibility of authorization through Instagram and Foursquare.  It indicates your location at the moment, as well as the location of your friends on the basis of recent posts in social networks, this allows you to escape from an unwanted chance meeting.

      The slogan of the Cloak application is: <i>"Incognito mode for real life</i> . <i>"</i> <br>  This application can be called "Anti-social network." <br><br>  By clicking on the bubble on the map, you see the name of the person, his photo and when he was there.  If he was there for a long time, then the image of the bubble disappears like a ghost. <br><br><blockquote>  "It seems to us that we all have already reached the point of social fatigue ... At the moment, there are many social networks with too much information that continue to appear," </blockquote>  says baker. <blockquote>  "And if we want to just be alone and take a break from the whole world, then Cloak will help with this." </blockquote><br>  The application has the ability to set alerts if an ‚Äúunwanted face‚Äù suddenly appears on the horizon.  This is suitable for those who want to completely disconnect from the Internet for a while and just walk.  This application is much better than sneaking through the alleys and hiding behind glasses and a hat. <br><br>  At the moment, the application only works with <u>Instagram</u> and <u>Foursquare</u> , so there are some limitations, namely, if your friends are not in these networks.  But developers hope to add Facebook soon.  It is also supposed to add Twitter, but the accuracy of determining the location in it still leaves much to be desired. <br><br>  Reluctance to meet with friends can be not just because you wanted to be alone, but also, for example, if you are on your first date with a girl or just ran out in pajamas to a grocery store, or have plastic surgery, or change your beloved half.  Many may find utility in using this application. <br><br>  The application is just starting to gain momentum, but Moore says that users have already found various creative and social ways to use it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSocial has had its moment in the sun.  Now people are beginning to revolt, ‚Äùsays Baker. <br><br><h6>  Info taken from <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2014/03/21/tech/mobile/cloak-app/index.html%3Fhpt%3Dte_t1">cnn.com</a> . <br>  Translation and article prepared by the <a href="http://telebreeze.ru/">Telebreeze Team</a> . <br>  Our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TelebreezeCorp">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TelebreezeCor">Twitter page</a> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216905/</a></p>
