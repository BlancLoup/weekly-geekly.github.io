As with EN equipment, it is possible to build high-performance, stably operating modern networks.  On the principles and approaches of Extreme when building a network infrastructure.  About what updates appeared in the line of network equipment, in particular, about the new module with 100-gigabit ports for BlackDiamond and other Extreme switches.  It also demonstrated how, when a line is broken, a solution based on Extreme Networks does not stop video transmission. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73c/514/694/73c5146946614c3db668f2391e4c214f.png"><br><br>  Under the cut review of these and other "extreme" new products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>Alexander Palivoda, Systems Engineer for Extreme Networks at MUK</i>

      We will talk about our equipment and how it can be used to build reliable, high-performance and modern Ethernet networks from small corporate networks to data centers and traffic exchange points. <br><br>  I will begin, perhaps, with a small excursion to Extreme Networks, many probably know what it is and what it eats with, and that the company is focused only on Ethernet, but still. <br><br>  Extreme Networks is made in USA, respectively, and is headquartered in the United States, San Jose, California.  The key event that took place in the last year is the acquisition of Enterasys Networks, which gave rise to capital growth, expansion of the product line, and, accordingly, the arrival of high-quality management, marketing and technical staff. <br><br>  What did it give us, you ask. <br>  1. Expansion of the line of switches, both single-unit and chassis <br>  2. Departure from Motorola's OEM Wi-Fi towards the native IdentyFi that came with the purchase of Enterasys <br>  3. A powerful family of management and security - OneFabric Control Center, which includes the heart of this system - NMS (NetSight + Data Center Manager + Mobile IAM), security (NAC, IAM and Information and Event Management) and the most powerful system for deep flow analysis Corporate Network Data - Purview <br><br>  Since we are talking about equipment, I offer you the equipment presented at the stand. <br>  So, the heart of our booth is the notorious TOP switch of the Extreme Networks switch family - BlackDiamond X8. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d9/7f8/5d9/4d97f85d9f7e45b89a7f0a200d43bb91.png"><br><br>  This switch and beat all conceivable records of The Lippis Report, and won a bunch of other awards, and showed himself very well in the world traffic exchange points, including Ukrainian ones.  Let me remind you that he can.  This is a switching capacity of 20Tbit / s, no mid-plane / back-plane, which results in a minimum delay of 2.3 microseconds, up to 768 10G ports, and up to 192 40G ports, and with low power consumption (5W per 10G port) and only 1/3 drains - 14.5 units. <br><br>  For this switch, a 4-port 100G module is already on sale.  I think that sounds impressive - 32 ports 100G, in 14 units at full speed, and even a million IPv4 routes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/628/d0e/7f2/628d0e7f2f47465d94adc7600e99623e.png"><br><br>  You say, ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs great!  But we don‚Äôt need it yet! ‚ÄùAnd I will answer you - but how long will it not be necessary for you?  As demand and consumption grow, the main goal is internet-backbones, the needs of telecom operators and high-performance computing.  What if I remind you about the delivery of YouTube videos, IPTV and HDTV?  If you take YouTube - every month its traffic increases by 20%, and in order to maintain this growth, you have to constantly add new channels.  And if you remember the transition of many home users to high definition television.  You know about the feature such as SmartTV, which allows us to watch TV as FullHD. <br><br>  Here, too, an increase in traffic is planned.  For example, Comcast has determined that standard television traffic is transmitted at a speed of 3.5 Mbps, while high-resolution broadcasts are transmitted at a speed of 19 Mbps.  If you look at the number of HDTVs sold, you will realize that supporting the traffic that ensures their work is becoming a critical factor.  And this I took only two nuances.  So, is it a question for us and for you up to 100G? <br><br>  Then I move your attention to another new product from Extreme Networks - the top single-unit switchboard - Summit X770.  Its main positioning is data centers and big data environments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/339/179/7ee/3391797ee5a24f609770693512aceecd.png"><br><br>  This switch is unique in the market.  You can see on the front panel 32 ports 40G, using the fan-out cable (lying on top), which expands the port 40G into 4 10G ports, we get the highest density of 10G ports in one unit - 104 ports.  And if you say that the delay - less than 600 nanoseconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/559/a32/93f/559a3293f93f4b76b1dea6ebddcc7d41.png"><br><br>  This switch comes already with power supplies and coolers, but you already choose the variation yourself - AC, DC or mixed AC / DC (as a group :), cooling front-to-back or back-to front.  And of course, support for many new and not very advanced technologies, thanks to the notorious EXOS, namely TRILL, SDN, AVB, DCB, iSCSI.  Well, I can not say about the possibility of stacking with other switches line of Summit.  In principle, it can close the needs of the most fastidious customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/1d4/2d2/1f21d42d29c5463eb2647e22ca2184e5.png"><br><br>  The next switch is one of the most popular models - Summit X670.  Previously, it was the top, I will say this: X670 is the most sold Extreme switchboard in Ukraine.  It is interesting in that it has onboard 48 10G SFP + ports and a motion sensor.  Extreme always cares about the money of its customers, remember that even 10-precise ports have a consumption of up to 5 watts, with constant power consumption, this is a tangible savings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0a/8ae/538/c0a8ae538297441287651176fd618c8b.png"><br><br>  The Summit X670 series is available in two models: Summit X670V and Summit X670.  Summit X670V can be used with a 4-port 40G module that can be used as an uplink, or when deployed to 40G on 10G, it totals 64 ports of 10G.  Again, everything comes with blown front-to-back or back-to front - you can rack yourself up as you please.  Again, different types of food.  This module can also be seen on the stand.  And if you remember that all Summit switches have a non-blocking architecture, then in combination with the innovative EXOS modular operating system, we again get a purple quality. <br><br>  <b>NEWS 2015</b> <br><br>  In early 2015, Extreme Networks expanded its range of X670 switches with two new devices. <br>  Switches: Summit X670-G2-72x - 72 ports of 1 / 10Gb SFP + in 1 RU form factor and Summit X670-G2-48x-4q - 48 ports of 1 / 10Gb SFP + with 4 ports of 10 / 40Gb QSFP + <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33a/564/d3c/33a564d3c2144c43aa47a7dce9757108.png"><br><br>  Summit X670-G2-72x <br>  This is a switch with a fixed number of 10G * SFP + ports, there are as many as 72 ports in 1RU, without the possibility of installing extension cards. <br><br>  Summit X670-G2-48x-4q <br>  Continuation of the Summit X670V version, but with integrated 40G ports on board. <br><br>  The devices have improved performance in comparison with previous versions, such as: delay, now it is 600 nanoseconds, the number of MAC addresses is 288K, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/954/ecd/4c9/954ecd4c9f6945d08f08f47b8a06bef5.png"><br><br>  Next you can see the Summit X480 Series Switch.  At our stand, it is represented by the Summit X480-24x model, which in addition to 24 optical gigovy ports still gives advantages to 2 10G XFP ports (the ports are already on board) and 12 more copper ports that are shared with the last 12 optical ports.  X480 is positioned as a routing switch, as it can take up to a million routes, which is, after all, and 2 full-view, thanks to a separate TCAM.  This switch can be used with two types of modules - a card for 4 ports of 10G XFP, that is, the number of 10G ports increases to 6, or a card for 4 ports of 40G. <br><br>  This is what concerns high-power switches, for which high requirements are mainly offered for Internet providers and other powerful enterprises.  Next, let's go down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/b7d/f22/833b7df22ef441c98d181de6587d239c.png"><br><br>  The next most popular after the X670 is the Summit X460 switchboard, which is most often used at the aggregation or access level.  This switch already has a wider range.  There are 24 ports and 48;  and optical, and copper, and PoE.  The switches of this series have 2 slots on the back side, into which modules with 2 ports 10G XFP, 2 ports 10G SFP +, 4 ports 10G SFP +, or SummitStack stacking modules can be installed.  Moreover, these models can become a stack with both the older models and the younger ones.  SummitStack has been enhanced by the fact that it can use both dedicated stack ports and alternative Exthernet ports. <br><br>  <b>NEWS 2015</b> <br>  Also, at the beginning of the year, Extreme announced the release of the X460-G2 <br>  Summit X460-G2 Family <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/746/43e/9d9/74643e9d9dbe4abcb3f33478a5a85402.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2b/46c/744/f2b46c744226408a956c8dbfd61982ef.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53f/394/2c9/53f3942c9b224227900b84ba270dcb77.png"><br><br>  A feature of these models is the presence of four 10G * SFP + ports on board.  As in previous versions, it is possible to install additional cards, but in new models there is one expansion slot on the reverse side. <br>  Also, it became possible to install a card with copper 10G ports and a card with 40G, this possibility was not there before.  Support for 1588 Precision Timing Protocol, increased number of MAC addresses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73c/514/694/73c5146946614c3db668f2391e4c214f.png"><br><br>  Next in the Summit line are Summit X440 switches, which, apart from the features of variations in the number of ports (8, 24 or 48), be it optical, copper or PoE ports, also have variations on the topic ‚Äî the built-in stack ports of SummitStack or 10G uplinks (which By the way, you can also use it for stacking).  Due to this variability, we get a model range that can satisfy an even greater number of customer needs. <br><br>  Let me remind you that Extreme has a minimum unit per port - 1 gigabit, 0.5 - ports, etc. - no.  The performance of the bus - it all depends on the number of ports, all the switches are chassis-based, be single-unit - they have an unlockable architecture, they all have ports running at full speed (with or without modules). <br><br>  Here it is new - the junior series switch - Summit X430.  This is an L2 access switch.  In the model range there are switches - 8, 24 or 48 port gigabit, and even newer - 8 and 24 port switches with PoE +.  Moreover, port 8 is completely silent, since it has no fans. <br><br>  And now a little magic.  Demonstration ( <a href="https://youtu.be/Ps2Aue46QOI%3Ft%3D14m22s">from 14 minutes on the record</a> ) <br><br>  I have already spoken about the innovativeness of the EXOS operating system.  Everything in it is pleasing to the eye - and the modular structure, and advanced use of Ethernet technologies, and much more.  At our booth, you can see how EAPS native technology will show itself in practice.  Let me remind you that EAPS is Ethernet automatic protection switching, a loop protection protocol with a convergence time of no more than 50 ms.  Who else can boast such? <br><br>  In our booth there is a ring of 4 switches, cameras are turned on in one of the switches (to complicate the task of the camera, let's turn it on not directly, but via the Extreme Networks access point), and we will receive a signal from the cameras through another switch. <br><br>  The meaning and ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù of this protocol is that in a fast time, up to 50 milliseconds, it restores the topology.  For example, we emulate a crash, the link disappears - no matter, pull out the cord. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/006/b01/f1e/006b01f1e83943b9a0451cac97fab5f9.png"><br><br>  You can be very critical, saying that it has been recovering for a very long time, but we see video transmission (which is critical for losses and delays).  In this case, the simplest scheme of the EAPS protocol is implemented, with critical data, video and voice transmission, we can configure fast convergent mode - recovery to 2 milliseconds.  So that you understand: when transmitting sound, the ear will not hear the loss, while transmitting the video, the eye will not see the loss.  I find it cool. <br><br>  Purple taxis! <br><hr><br>  Record of the report <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ps2Aue46QOI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjExTygAoBcXheMjqonMdaoW4a5gA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://muk.ua/company/vendors/extreme_networks/">Distribution of Extreme Netwroks solutions in Ukraine, Belarus, CIS countries</a> <br>  <a href="http://training.muk.ua/courses/extreme-networks/">Extreme Networks Training Courses</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258907/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258907/</a></p>
