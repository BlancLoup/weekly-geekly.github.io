  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to keep valuable frames: recipes for small companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The key reasons why employees decide to change jobs are dissatisfaction with wages, the impossibility of career growth, lack of interest, understanding that in another place, they can do more and better. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As soon as employers do not excel, to retain specialists.  They introduce a flexible schedule, arrange entertainment events, encourage employees to bonuses, buy cookies for the office, distribute subscriptions to the gym and other buns. <br><br>  Giant employers can afford a lot - to organize staff training, establish a corporate hobby, equip recumbent jobs, and in some cases even arrange for the entire office to move to another city or country in order to save employees from the routine.  In the race to create better working conditions, it is very difficult for small companies to compete with big brands, and the best have to be let go. <br><br>  How to fight for the best personnel, if the employer does not have excessive resources?  Here is a list of simple but effective recommendations that I made based on my own experience.

      <b>1. Give workers more freedom</b> <br>  Do not put people in the official framework and do not strictly follow the rules.  In such conditions, your shots will turn into robot workers.  They will go to the office to work on paid hours rather than developing the company.  In the end, they will want to go where there will be an opportunity to splash out their potential. <br><br>  <b>2. Clearly identify goals and objectives.</b> <br>  Giving freedom, yet do not forget that a person wants to know where he is going.  Do not force your subordinate to guess what you are expecting from him.  Often these guesses lead in the wrong direction.  A small five-minute meeting will allow you to prioritize, eliminate doubts and provide the employee with a sense of confidence. <br><br>  <b>3. Stay close to the team</b> <br>  Delegating tasks is important and necessary, but after letting colleagues float free, stay on the same wavelength with them.  Do not close the power in one hand, be aware of all the processes, be interested in the successes and problems of each, and then the letter of dismissal will not fall on your table like head-on water in clear weather. <br><br>  <b>4. Do not tell employees that they are mediocre.</b> <br>  Even if you are dissatisfied with the results of the work, look for the correct ways to improve.  Letting even small achievements be promoted is much more effective than repeated whip strokes.  Endless criticism will force the worker to go where he can be assessed. <br><br>  <b>5. Eliminate bureaucracy</b> <br>  Do not imitate large companies in the preparation of plans and reports, the provision of statements, references and explanatory.  Save energy and nerves of subordinates for more important and interesting tasks.  Let this be your advantage over large structures. <br><br>  <b>6. Provide growth</b> <br>  Remember, about a quarter of employees retire simply because they want change.  Arrange it for them.  If the range of positions in your company is small, be sure to think about the horizontal growth of staff.  Organize corporate training, expand the range of responsibilities of a long-time employee, entrust him with the development of a new direction.  If your budget does not allow attracting coaches from the outside, hold seminars on your own, share experiences, promote self-education of subordinates in every way. <br><br>  <b>7. Do not forget about internal communications.</b> <br>  Do not leave employees alone with their duties.  Let them feel part of a big process.  Speak out loud about the company's success, thank your colleagues, discuss with them plans for the future.  This will serve as an excellent anchor for retaining valuable frames. <br><br>  <b>8. Show an example</b> <br>  To set tasks and demand their fulfillment is not enough for effective management.  Learn to stimulate people with your work and enthusiasm. <br><br>  <b>9. Do not ignore material motivation.</b> <br>  Forget about fines.  It is unlikely that you will be able to save money, but it‚Äôs very likely to spoil the company's image.  And at your leisure, consider whether you have forgotten to revise the salary of an employee, who has been showing brilliant results for the second year. <br><br>  <b>10. Take care of comfort</b> <br>  The employee should not carry stationery from home, and if his mouse is broken, react to it immediately.  Show care and respect to people, and then you will not have to burn precious time in search of new qualified candidates. <br><br>  All this does not require large material costs, but some efforts for each of the points well treat headaches associated with staff turnover.  Checked on yourself! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234061/</a></p>
