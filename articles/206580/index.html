      I remember the theater in which I once played a year and I remember with gratitude.  The head of the theater organizes a bunch of events for his money that are free for young artists, trains them and develops them.  In exchange - only performance at leading venues, contests.  Some of those who were in the theater today are TV and pop stars. <br><br>  Repeatedly, people came to me, whom the leader had long and hard taught.  And then they left after inadequate manifestations in behavior, and always poured over the theater afterwards.  None of them, notably, has achieved serious success over the following years. <br><br>  And I recently realized for myself why this is happening.  In our society, it is not customary, for example, to show fear and weakness - therefore, the manager does not admit publicly in fear of disrupting a project or weak management skills.  Instead, it demonstrates aggression accepted in society ‚Äî yelling at subordinates, throwing tantrums, switching to personalities, and so on. <br><br>  So in Russia it is not customary to take responsibility for your life.  But blaming anyone - this is welcome in any team.  Therefore, pleading guilty in fakapa - this is the fate of the few, but to publicly criticize others and to believe in it yourself in the end - it goes with a bang. <br><br>  It is also not accepted to work, with the exception of IT and a number of other areas - but everyone loves to talk about work <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Therefore, first of all, it seems to me that we have a clear demonstration of this relationship.  <b>And that's fine, get used to it, colleagues.</b>  We have a smart, good candidate who has never doubted himself, but who has seen the inadequacy of the leaders. <br><br>  I will add at the end of this chapter that, indeed, there are a lot of inadequate leaders.  But as a rule, they are not among the business owners - evolution is selecting inadequate (my non-representative sample). <br><br><h3>  Golden sand </h3><br>  In the words of the author can be traced the desire of what is called in the people ‚Äúpay with dignity‚Äù.  There is also a desire for the author to be respected as an individual and professional.  And, of course, everything was spelled out, duties were few and the work was interesting. <br><br>  I can not claim to be the ultimate truth, but I want to note personal experience and colleagues that in any success up to 90% is a solution to problems.  Routines, hemorrhoids, raking of the Augean stables, and just boring and uninteresting tasks.  And often - over the course of long months or years, without earning an obvious tomorrow and a linearly calculated prospect of earning hundreds of oil.  And, of course, without clearly defined job responsibilities. <br><br>  Of course, there are stories that everyone can see - a quick takeoff of Vkontakte, Dropbox, working conditions in a dream team in companies like Google or Yandex.  And then, people usually remember the same Dropbox for ‚Äúa couple of years and a millionaire‚Äù, and not that the idea was shattered by everyone who could, and no one believed, plus all the problems were solved, and how many people passed the turn to the stars.  Or what percentage of people were NOT interviewed in a dream company. <br><br>  But few people take into account the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">error of the survivor</a> - those stories that are not in sight, and which, oddly enough, much more.  Stories full of work without prospects, routine, stupid bosses, inadequate customers, dangerous partners, and so on. <br><br>  Only one thing I would like to note is important here, which usually do not write - <b>time is irreversible</b> .  You can try to look for a dream job for years, changing jobs (resumes with changing jobs every six months or even a specialty is not at all uncommon).  But a professional is usually forged at the expense of negativity and solving problems that other people do not solve for various reasons.  And not in an easy job, from where a person disappears after the first difficulties. <br><br>  Therefore, alas, choosing a path and passing it with dignity is the only path to success that seems to work for most people (if you are not a genius). <br><br><h3>  Give a positive </h3><br><blockquote>  The Chinese word "crisis" consists of two hieroglyphs: "problem" and "opportunity" </blockquote><br>  The only thing that can be noted - in the difficulty of the problems lies their inexhaustible power.  Most of my friends are looking for magic ideas and think that the idea will make everyone millionaires. <br><br>  While the solution to complex, hemorrhoid problems, which no one has solved before you, if only because it is uninteresting or little paid, is the opportunity to open yourself.  In general, some people believe that only in battle a person manifests himself.  And this is your chance. <br><br>  I always took on work that others did not do qualitatively or to the end for various reasons: they do not appreciate me, they don‚Äôt pay me, they don‚Äôt get interested, and then and so on.  I tried to write applications so that they work out of the box.  Documentation so that later there will be no questions about it.  And projects so that it was convenient and they solved the problems of users, and did not create a new problem for them. <br><br>  And therefore, if you finally stopped looking for an idea and realized that the salt is in implementation - try to take an unpleasant problem and solve it so that the solution is self-sufficient and convenient.  Problems surround us everywhere: guards at the entrance, rewriting with the hands of a passport;  constantly breaking mailboxes;  uncomfortable door handles and so on.  Not to mention the Internet - open any site and <b>enjoy the problems.</b>  <b>Because they and the work to solve them - this is a real path to success.</b> <br><br>  PS Who has not read - highly recommend, The <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB_%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583">man who sold the moon, Heinlein</a> .  A tale about how even a genius needs a lot of work to achieve a dream.  Full of beautiful solutions to complex problems.  As they say in some articles (perhaps they are lying brazenly and shamelessly!), Reading science fiction develops creativity and can help novice startups. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206580/</a></p>
