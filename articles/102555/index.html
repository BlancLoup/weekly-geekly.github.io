  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to buy t-shirts with prints on the Internet to be satisfied and not to be deceived (part 1)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>Why and why this article is written</b> <br><br>  I sell clothes on the Internet since 2003 - at first there was an online store of ready-made T-shirts FUTBOLKA.ua, then an online designer of clothes and souvenirs Mya.FUTBOLKA.ua, now all efforts, experience and knowledge are embodied in the service of goods on demand <a href="http://prostoprint.com/">ProstoPrint.com</a> . <br><br>  How many orders are processed during this time?  Not even tens - hundreds of thousands.  I think, if not Kiev, then I would definitely put on Kaluga or Simferopol, if all the goods printed by T-shirt and JustPrint were sent to residents of one city.  So, more than seven years of constant communication with customers of individual T-shirts and printing on clothes on demand convinced me of the following things: firstly, in this market it is quite easy to gain a foothold and succeed simply by offering a quality product (including related services - payment processing, packaging, shipping, etc.), because so many buyers had a negative experience when ordering t-shirts with prints on the Internet. 
      <br>

      <br>
      And second, in most cases, the buyer could avoid this very negative experience.  To do this, you must follow a certain ‚Äúset of rules for reasonable football shopping,‚Äù which I will try to formulate. <br><br>  So let's go! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>What is a good "football shopping"</b> <br><br>  And it consists of the following things: <br><br>  1) the choice of the store or service that will serve you; <br>  2) basic items that are offered in the store; <br>  3) printing technologies that are used for decorating clothes, and types of business stores (printing on demand, design competition, sale of stock, etc.); <br>  4) the proposed terms of payment and delivery of goods; <br>  5) availability of product information, product and print warranties, exchange and return policies, etc. <br><br>  The first point is the key and at the same time the resultant - we will consider it last, because discussing the product basics or, say, the return policy, I will show you the ‚Äúhooks‚Äù, places where you are deceived (or may be deceived).  Accordingly, proceeding to the discussion of p. 1., you will already know many things that will allow filtering out fraudsters or simply not very conscientious people who want to get rich quickly at your expense. <br><br>  <b>Products that are offered in the store</b> <br><br>  If you take it very, very globally, then there are two approaches in working with basic products: print on a cut, then sew a T-shirt, or print on finished products. <br><br>  The first one on the Runet‚Äôs open spaces as a web service is practically not widespread - production agencies and sewing production on ‚Äúlong‚Äù circulation for corporate customers mainly work with us.  Although in foreign online there are services that work on this model - for example, <a href="http://www.designbyhumans.com/">Design By Humans</a> . <br><br>  The vast majority of Russian and Ukrainian online stores selling t-shirts with prints, work on the second model - printing on already stitched products.  About her and talk more. <br><br>  So, a store or service printing on clothes can provide itself with basic products in one of three ways: <br><br>  A. to buy clothes for application from a certain (and specialized!) Brand; <br>  B. sew base articles on local garment production; <br>  V. do not bother and buy textiles where it is necessary and what will have. <br><br>  Consider each method in more detail. <br><br>  <b>A. to buy clothes from a certain (and specialized!) Brand.</b> <br><br>  Strictly speaking, this is the right way.  Serious companies producing clothing for 99.99% of their products supply standardized goods, which is very important for selling online: a T-shirt from each subsequent batch will be sewn of the same fabric, following the same patterns and measurers as the previous one. <br><br>  And the main thing is, of course, quality: respected brands of textiles for decoration (I do not moderately say ‚Äúpromotional clothing‚Äù or ‚Äúpromotional clothing‚Äù, terms that are often heard - you will understand why) have multi-stage quality control and a fair exchange policy for distributors.  For example, if my printers find some small defect on any B &amp; C T-shirt, I don‚Äôt need to float the brain, where to put this product and, God forbid, put a deliberate marriage into someone‚Äôs order ‚Äî I know that the B &amp; C quality department will immediately issue I have a credit note covering the purchase price of defective goods. <br><br>  We approach the most important question: what brands are good as basic products for making t-shirts with prints?  The question is by no means idle, since it‚Äôs still a matter of specialized trademarks - tea, not Dolce &amp; Gabbana ... although you would be very surprised to know how many well-known brand goods that are advertised in fashion magazines and whose boutiques exist in every shopping center , are sewn in B &amp; C or HANES factories.  However, this is a completely different tale. <br><br>  Kohl, so I went to classify everything, then we divide the manufacturers of clothing for application into three groups.  The first - ‚ÄúRECOMMEND‚Äù - includes those companies that operate in the ‚Äúretail clothing quality for decoration‚Äù segment.  This is a separate, higher segment of the market for promotional clothing. It emerged in the world in the last 20 years, when large companies saw and successfully mastered the niche of expensive and high-quality products for subsequent branding for retail, with high margins. <br><br>  The second is ‚ÄúADVERTISING QUALITY‚Äù - brands that are respected and recognized in the world, but whose products are intended for promotional purposes.  Such brands reduce the cost of basic models: the fabric is lighter, tailoring is simpler, accessories are cheaper - the price in the end is much lower than that of their counterparts in the premium segment.  Personally, I think that such t-shirts in retail stores cannot be sold - but the claim here is not to the brand, but to sellers-printers who want to win a penny not in the right place.  My opponents can declare: ‚ÄúThe same Fruit of the Loom also has more expensive products‚Äù - yes, it does, but distributors, as a rule, do not deliver them, and customers have to be content with what they give. <br><br>  The third one - ‚ÄúNEGATIVE‚Äù - I categorically advise you not to buy the products of these trademarks in retail online stores.  In no way do I pretend to the ultimate truth - just sharing my experience. <br><br>  <b>RECOMMEND:</b> <br>  B &amp; C, Hanes, Continental Clothing, Promodoro, Slazenger, Jerzees. <br><br>  <b>ADVERTISING QUALITY:</b> <br>  Fruit of the Loom, Stedman, US BASIC, Sols, Promostar, Screen Stars, Gildan. <br><br>  <b>NEGATIVE:</b> <br>  Swan, Felix, Good, Stuff, T-Smart, American Style. <br><br>  Immediately I foresee the question: what to do if the seller of T-shirts on his site does not indicate the company's manufacturer of the basis at all (‚Äúfashionable T-shirt with contrasting trim on the neck and sleeves, 100% cotton‚Äù), or lists several brands ‚Äúin a row‚Äù (‚ÄúT-shirt white of the best producers of Stedman, Fruit of the Loom ‚Äù). <br><br>  Answer: <b>this is the first ‚Äúrisk criterion‚Äù</b> , a signal that you may be served in bad faith, in some cases, possibly without malicious intent (and in some cases with it).  If a specific manufacturer and a specific model are not specified, you get a cat in a bag - there is no clarity either with the quality benchmarks or the material of the product (100% cotton - is it a cooler, an eraser or, say, interlock?), Or with dimensions ( even if the size scale is published - you can not check it on the manufacturer's website). <br><br>  By the way, it should be remembered that there is no uniform size scale in the apparel industry - therefore, information on a product MUST be present at least some size scale in height (neck-bottom) and width (from armhole to armhole).  If there is none, the order should definitely be abandoned, because in this case the resulting product may be in fact  any size, but if the necessary tag is sewn on it - you will not be able to make a claim to the seller. <br>  <b>There is a normal business practice, and it is this</b> : in the description of the goods must be indicated And the specific manufacturer, And the specific model of the product basis.  In this case, you can clarify all the parameters of the base product before the order, on the manufacturer's website - for example, <a href="http://www.bc-collection.eu/catalogue/women_t-shirts_bc-women-only-play_en">like this</a> - including fabric, cut, tailoring and finishing characteristics, size scale, etc. <br><br>  <b>B. Sew base articles in local garment production.</b> <br><br>  Theoretically this is possible.  Practically - it is difficult, and for several reasons.  Large Russian (Ukrainian, Belarusian) factories can sew, but it turns out badly and always at the wrong time. <br><br>  Smaller productions will be very interested in your order, but they do not guarantee consistent quality, often even despite the sincere desire of the owners and managers to do everything well - staff turnover, there are no streamlined quality control systems, etc. <br><br>  And the services of production- "stars", which can constantly sew well, are expensive - such products cost in the purchase, as a rule, more expensive than similar products from recommended foreign premium brands. <br><br>  In addition, almost all local garment production periodically encounter a shortage of textiles, accessories and frequent supplier rotation, so you should not expect complete homogeneity in fabrics or ‚Äúsnakes‚Äù of a T-shirt or windbreaker that you ordered yesterday and a year ago - the first can be as identical so and somewhat different. <br><br>  Conclusion: if a T-shirt shop declares the production of base products in local production, its goods should be in a ‚Äúabove average‚Äù niche and cost accordingly.  Otherwise, you probably slipped bullshit. <br>  <b>V. do not bother and buy textiles where it is necessary and what will have.</b> <br><br>  Naturally, this is the worst and definitely unacceptable option for the buyer - the only question is how to recognize unscrupulous dealers-sellers.  My recipe is: call (do not write, but call!) The support service of the store you are interested in and ask the manager directly: ‚ÄúWhat type of clothes do you print on?‚Äù.  If your interlocutor beck-meek something about "various suppliers of Euro-exclusive quality" - surely there is a catch. <br><br>  And one more thing: we live in a world in which there is a geographical division of labor.  Therefore, large companies-suppliers of clothing for decorating have long moved their production to countries that are a source of cheap raw materials and affordable labor.  Thus, the Belgian company B &amp; C has its own factories (with European management and multi-level quality control) in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Cambodia, the German Promodoro sews in Egypt, the British Continental Clothing in Turkey, the production of the European division of Fruit of the Loom are in Morocco, and the Canadian Gildan supplies products from Honduras and El Salvador! <br><br>  Take it easy.  But if you are trying to convince you that your potential T-shirt is sewn ‚Äúat ten, no, five kilometers from Paris / Brussels / Vienna, etc.,‚Äù you are almost certainly lying. <habracut><br>  Go <br>  That's all for now.  If you like this part of the publication - in the sequel I will definitely tell you more about the technology of applying prints, types of T-shirt print business and consumer safety rules related to this. <br><br>  Comment, I will be glad to answer all questions. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/102555/">https://habr.com/ru/post/102555/</a></p>
