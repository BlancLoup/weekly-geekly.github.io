  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple business: version 1.7.8.0. Code name "Angkor"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Automatic recording of calls, documents and metro-style invoices, access rights for CRM tables and over 350 other improvements.</b> <br>  The new version of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù 1.7.8.0 adds innovations that improve customer service quality control, speed up work with accounting documents, save time and ensure a higher level of confidentiality of work with important information.  Introducing our customers' offers and current updates, we implemented more than 350 various revisions and improvements. <br>  We present a brief overview of the major updates. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. The accountant will work more quickly - documents and invoices are now presented in a metro-style</b> <br>  ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù became a pioneer in introducing the visual and ergonomic style of Metro among the automation services. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/f/s0/BBC877E6D5C7473/Dokymenti_i_s4eta_metro_small.png" alt="image"><br>  The Invoices and Documents tool in fashionable design is the first step to a fully functional accounting module that is currently in development and will be released in the upcoming version 1.8 before the end of winter.  Now your accountant will be able to work with documents more efficiently in a single interface, creating new or controlling all movements on existing documents in the context of time, counterparty, manager, expense items and income, as well as other parameters. <br>  <b>2. Control access rights, and your databases will remain with you - use special settings in the universal CRM table!</b> <br>  ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù overcame the fears of many executives that negligent managers could ‚Äústeal‚Äù their base of customers or important information.  Thanks to the updates, you will be able to customize the access rights to the client base of managers, choosing whether the employee can only watch the information, or also modify, export and print it.  In particular, you can prohibit managers from exporting and printing the entire table to avoid information leaks. <br>  You can also configure access to certain information only for some employees, for example, if an accountant sees money issues for a task in a table, then it can be closed for the manager by restricting the right of access only to seeing organizational points for the task and comments to it. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/f/s0/1914299653FE8A2/Dostyp_k_yniver_tablice_small.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>3. New window of affairs - we reduce the time for completing work tasks</b> <br>  A new window of affairs is the result of years of research into time management and ergonomics of our CEO personally, and her crusade against inefficiency and ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù, unfortunately, too frequent business practices in our country.  Now, all the necessary properties of the case can be set in a few clicks with the mouse, and not needed at the moment, they are not at all ‚Äúblighted‚Äù - everything is placed on one page - visually and informatively. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/f/s0/5CE83876A2D329C/Okno_del_small.png" alt="image"><br>  The manager no longer needs to constantly remind employees about the deadline for the work - in the new version it is done by ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù with the help of special tools to notify a participant in the case.  You can set up a reminder to the employee about the case, sending alerts for a certain time before the deadline for the case, as well as sending alerts to the employee when the case is overdue (including SMS). <br>  When creating a case, select a case participant from the drop-down list of users and contacts, specify the resources to complete the case, the place where the case is carried out and its budget (expense and income) - the possible properties of the case are greater, and work with them faster at the expense of more convenient organization. <br>  <b>4. Automatic recording of calls and the history of all company negotiations - now you will not miss a single important word!</b> <br>  The new version of ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù opens up additional opportunities for you to control the quality of customer service.  You can view the history of the organization‚Äôs external calls for the entire time (or selected period) and, if necessary, listen to the necessary conversations, because now the ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù automatically records calls.  If earlier this opportunity was available only in expensive solutions of call centers, then in the released version of ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù the tool became available to companies of any scale. <br>  To track the history of the calls you need, use the organization‚Äôs history window, which allows you to sort the calls by various parameters: organization name, number, time period, call status, user name and call direction.  You can also open the call history from the ‚ÄúCall Center‚Äù window. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/f/s0/A8DC2346077511B/Istoriya_zvonkov_small.png" alt="image"><br>  To set up auto-recording of calls, go to the Call Center settings window and check the corresponding box.  You can also enable auto-recording of calls in the context menu of the conversation window. <br>  <b>5. Save time - enable instant access to projects, tasks for all employees of the organization.</b> <br>  Use an additional way to save work time.  If you have a task with which all employees must become familiar, you can quickly open access to it for all employees of the organization.  The same innovation applies to projects - the project can be opened for reading, modification and administration. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/f/s0/3C9683E695A45E8/Dostyp_k_zada4e_small.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Other important changes to the ‚ÄúSimple Agent‚Äù in the Angkor version:</b> <br>  - It has become more convenient to work with files in the system: information about the task, project and file organization has been added to the file properties window (with the ability to go to the selected section). <br>  - There is another way to save time: if you need to quickly transfer a group of contacts to a phone or to an * .xls file, export a group of contacts in the same way as regular contacts, choosing the format you need (vCard, vCard Nokia vCard Unicode, * .xls ), and then transfer the information to your phone or computer. <br>  - Simplified work with e-mails: the user now immediately sees the name of the sender of the letter and his e-mail address in the inbox view window;  in the outgoing mail window began to be displayed: mailbox, date, method of sending files (by attachment or links). <br>  - Accelerated work with the task when moving the comment: using the option "Open Task" you can quickly get into the task to which the comment was moved. <br>  - Version numbers of the program now have code names corresponding to grandiose historical milestones in the development of mankind, such as the current version, which received the code name from Angkor, a huge ancient city on the territory of modern Cambodia. <br>  The new version also made, according to our developers, a ‚Äúmini-revolution‚Äù in terms of optimization of critical algorithms, which increased the synchronization speed with the server by more than 5 times, the stability of the work and markedly reduced memory costs when working with the program. <br>  <b>Stay tuned and use the new tools of "Simple Business" for the success of your company!</b> </div>
