    <h5>  Introduction. </h5><br>  EMC - Electromagnetic Compatibility - a criterion and requirement for the operation of devices and electrical equipment. <br>  EMF - Electromagnetic interference, in our experiment it will be like an electromagnetic field generated by a high-frequency high-frequency voltage and the very high voltage itself. <br><br>  EMC can be divided into 2 criteria. <br>  1. Interference radiation (may be in the power supply network (interfered with consumption), or electromagnetic field radiation) <br>  2. The effect of interference on the device itself. <br><br>  The second we will test. <br><br>  In advance, I want to stipulate this is not advertising and not anti-advertising, that the phone for testing faithfully served me for 3 years, at the moment it has cracked glass, the battery does not hold even 4 hours of Internet surfing (i.e. you can‚Äôt sit on the Internet unless something urgent check), the rear plastic cover is broken, and the phone itself is already quite obsolete.  For these reasons, I decided to change my phone and Iphone to pay what they deserved) <br><br><h5>  The essence of the experiments. </h5><br>  1. Work the phone next to the high-frequency discharge with the formation of an arc discharge. <br>  2. The work of the phone when it hits a high voltage. <br><br><h5>  Devices and components. </h5><br>  1. Multimeter mastesh m838 - as an ammeter. <br>  2. Automotive ignition coil - as a high-frequency generator of high frequency (HV, HF). <br>  3. Computer power supply - as a 12v power source. <br>  4. As an open discharger homemade stand. <br><br>  Total output we had a discharge voltage with a frequency of 400 Hz and a voltage in the region of 20 kV. <br><br>  <b>An interesting fact: the</b> wires of the HV and the earth were attracted to each other, and upon their contact, weak blue radiation appeared at the point of contact, most likely a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4">corona discharge</a> . <br><br>  <b>An interesting fact:</b> during the operation of the stand between arresters, an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4">arc-</a> discharge was formed which is a form of plasma, but due to the fact that the voltage was relatively small (20kV) the arc was not large and not stable.  But like the fact that at home you can get plasma is interesting in my opinion. <br><br><h4>  Testing. </h4><br><br><h5>  Test number 1 </h5><br>  The test was that the mobile phone was located next to the arrester and the phone's response to the impact was studied. <br><br>  <b>Interesting fact:</b> During the setup of the stand that passed at a distance of 3 meters from the computer, when the stand was turned on, the mouse and keyboard constantly fell off, most likely this was due to the long, unshielded cable going to the mouse and keyboard from the PC. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bz85tXZRRo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiGyv9EByaX1uMGr51ythMWrziHtg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Actually the result, the discharge of 20kV at a distance of 5 cm from the phone did not damage the phone and did not even degrade the quality of communication. <br><br>  <b>Interesting fact:</b> During the test, I wanted to measure the current consumed, but during the test the readings of the multimeter were clearly false, it showed a current of 18.88 And that is not physically possible because it has a 10A fuse, as well as theoretically calculated current of only 3A.  Most likely this happened due to the fact that the consumed current had a pulsed character of consumption, and the tester is designed for constant or the influence of interference. <br><br><h5>  Test number 2 (main) </h5><br>  The test was that the mobile phone was leaning against the arrester. <br><br>  1 test.  screen to the discharger. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7LC10RwoLKA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjCLfdOqDOdTbDF9QMyWAxkz64Aow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Sorry for the quality of the video <s>and finger</s> . <br><br>  At the initial moment of the breakdown, the screen flew by the phone (turned white), after the test was terminated, the screen remained white, the rest of the phone‚Äôs functions did not suffer, even the capacitive sensor, which I thought would be the most vulnerable spot, remained in order.  A phone call was made and he was able to pick up the phone, the speaker and microphone were working. <br><br>  2 test.  between two electrodes of the discharger. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xbVmtJKWgmk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjx__ZJBr55eG4d_ZnrJFF4dBH6kw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The phone underwent 2 tests immediately after the first, the current from 1 electrode went through the body and the insides to the antenna and from the antenna the air breakdown to the 2 electrode, the consequences of this test on the antenna appeared "specks" - most likely the place where the antenna coating (insulation) was pierced . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fb/ebd/37f/9fbebd37f9f18a3f5622d119272316c6.jpg"><br><br><h6>  After Tests </h6><br>  At that moment, the phone seemed to me to be completely working except for the screen, we even took a screenshot of the iPhone screen and looked at the picture through connecting the iPhone to the computer, everything was fine. <br><br>  The screen was a pity, but the fact that the phone did not burn at all and remained theoretically efficient, was very pleased. <br><br><h6>  But </h6><br>  After the phone was turned off and the phone screen was turned on again, it <b>worked !!!</b>  I do not know how other models of Iphone, but 1 model (2g) is really unkillable, after this test I was filled with respect for the engineers who created this phone. <br><br><h6>  Total </h6><br>  After all the tests, the phone has remained fully operational and the only thing that has changed in it is a small dot on the antenna isolation. <br>  I think the metal case of the phone played the biggest role in it, it worked like a protective screen (from the EMF), and was a conductor of tension, thereby saving the inside of the phone. <br><br>  Now I think whether to buy a new phone or just change the battery from the old one. <br><br>  ps Thanks to everyone who helped me correct my mistakes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142867/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142867/</a></p>
