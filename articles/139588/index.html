  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to choose a moment to send a letter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Did you know that a letter to a potential client with a commercial offer is best sent from noon to three o'clock in the afternoon, the best day for an invitation to a party is Friday, and advertising mailing of online stores is best done from 19 to 22?</i> <br><br>  Surely, many are familiar with the situation when you are puzzled over when it is better to send a newsletter with an alert, for example, about a new promotion or a commercial offer to a potential client.  <b><a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">Unisender</a></b> clients constantly ask our tech support such questions <s>that we are tired of answering</s> .  If you send on Friday night - will they read it?  Or wait until Monday morning?  What is better - to write on the eve of a holiday or on holidays, at the height of the working day or in the evening?  Fortunately, a huge statistical base has been accumulated on this topic, and in this article we will share with you simple rules - what day and what time to write important letters depending on their topic. <br><br>  Let's start with how to choose the day to send your letter.

That is, the middle of the week, when the heavy Monday has already ended, and the weekend is still far away.  But you should be careful with Tuesday and Thursday, when, according to statistics, people receive the largest number of emails. <br><br>  Friday (especially in the morning) is the most auspicious day for letters promoting entertainment.  And for business letters, the best day is Tuesday.  On this day, a person is full of strength and energy to start a new business. <br><br><h4>  The best day for business letters is Tuesday.  Entertainment is best advertised on Friday. </h4><br><br>  But, choosing the right day, you should consider not only the days of the week, but also holidays, events.  And when sending out advertising emails, it is especially important to find out how many the subscriber most likely gets paid. <br><br>  ‚ÄúA person buys, not because you sent him a letter on Friday at 10 am, but because he has the money he wants to spend,‚Äù say many marketers at successful online stores. <br><br>  Of course, these data are average.  And choosing the most suitable day for email distribution, you need to analyze a lot of data (type and subject of distribution, features of products and services offered by you, sex-age characteristics of subscribers, and so on). <br><br><h4>  The best time for newsletters </h4><br>  Recently, the British marketing agency Pure360 published a study on what time of the day it is best to send letters to customers, the results of which you can see on the infographic: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa5/f00/94d/aa5f0094def5ba372d313ea820001831.jpg"><br><br>  22:00 - 9:00  The most unsuccessful time for email distribution.  Sending a letter to the subscriber at this time, you send it immediately to the basket. <br><br>  9:00 - 10:00  The second most popular time for mailing.  At this time, people not only carefully read letters of any subject, but also actively exchange interesting links with colleagues.  And this is a chance to get new subscribers. <br><br>  10:00 - 12:00  Your letter is unlikely to be read, since everyone is focused on work. <br><br>  12:00 - 15:00  At this time, people prefer to read only news and business letters.  Promotional emails are likely to be ignored. <br><br>  3:00 pm - 5:00 pm  On weekdays, this time is best suited for advertising mailing.  People in anticipation of the end of the working day are happy to read any advertising letters, as well as actively follow the links.  And on Friday at this time to send letters is risky. <br><br>  5:00 pm - 7:00 pm  The most successful time for letters advertising promotional activities. <br><br>  19:00 - 22:00  This is the time of online shopping.  It was at this time that people most often make purchases after reading an advertising letter.  Also at this time, people tend to respond to letters. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  Subscribe to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia">our Facebook page</a> : every day we post useful tips on correct emails and email marketing.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/UniSenderRussia"><b>Like?</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139588/</a></p>
