Why is this question about raising the right one?  Let's figure it out together. <br><br>  Imagine a programmer Ivan, who has worked in the company for some time.  For various reasons, it could happen that he had not had a promotion for a long time.  And he is waiting for him.  I don‚Äôt want to go to the manager and ask for a raise, he‚Äôs not the kind of person to talk about raising and begging, to prove that he‚Äôs worth raising. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>"White" version of events</b> <br><br>  Suppose Ivan shows his position to the manager: ‚ÄúWhat can I do in our company in order to receive + 30%?‚Äù 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Ivan's position: <br><br><ul><li>  He does not ask for anything and starts a conversation from an equal position. </li><li>  He wants to know about his potential job prospects in the company. </li><li>  Perhaps Ivan wants to take a higher position. </li><li>  Perhaps Ivan is even ready to work harder to get the desired increase. </li></ul><br>  Position of the Manager (written purposefully with a capital letter, because we are talking about an adequate manager who is not afraid to develop his subordinates, who respects his employees and works with them on equal and open human positions): <br><br><ul><li>  Ivan is a proactive person, showing leadership qualities, maybe able to grow as a team leader </li><li>  Ivan is loyal to the company, because the first starts a conversation with his manager, and does not go for an interview </li><li>  Ivan is ready, perhaps, for additional work </li><li>  If it was planned to increase only + 10% this year, you can consider Ivan to move up the career ladder and give him the desired 30%. </li></ul><br>  In such negotiations, there is a high probability that Ivan and the Manager will agree and find a WIN-WIN-style solution: <br><br><ul><li>  Ivan will get the desired salary </li><li>  The manager will receive a loyal and motivated employee. </li></ul><br>  Obviously, extreme cases are possible: <br><br><ul><li>  Ivan will ask for + 100%, hardly any company will be able to organize such a large increase. </li><li>  The manager for various reasons will not be able to find options for raising an employee. </li></ul><br>  But in any case, the Manager and Ivan have an open position on interaction.  They can agree, as an option, that Ivan is looking for a new job for 3 months, and the Manager is looking for a replacement for Ivan.  In the end, they will part in good relations and, perhaps, when the Manager has a highly paid position in the project, he will call Ivan again.  Say goodbye, too, need good, but the world of IT is extremely small. <br><br>  <b>"Neutral" version of events</b> <br><br>  The manager (here he is also with a capital letter) periodically holds a one-on-one meeting, asks Ivan how things are, whether he is satisfied with everything, whether there are any conflicts at work and in his personal life, whether he is satisfied with the current compensation for wages. <br><br>  In this case, the Manager, in fact, often has to get answers from an employee, rely on his Managerial intuition and experience. <br><br>  <b>"Black" version of events (or how it happens in reality)</b> <br><br>  It is easier for Ivan to go to the working portal and see new vacancies, respond to those that satisfy his current assessment of himself in the labor market.  Further, he is interviewed, comes to the manager with a job-offer and a fun game begins. <br><br>  If an employee is simply dissatisfied with his salary and not so long ago suffered from its lack of improvement, in general, wants to stay in the company, then he says to the manager: <br><br>  - Look, I have a job-offer, I stand on the market so much, and you pay me less.  What can you offer me? <br><br>  If an employee has long been demotivated by a low salary and considers it to be much lower than the average, he simply says: <br><br>  - I have a job-offer, here's a statement, I'm leaving. <br><br>  If a manager wants to keep an employee for a company, he will start looking for ways to meet his needs: increase salaries, find interesting projects, give bonuses, etc.  And this is a win-win situation for both: <br><br><ul><li>  Ivan understands that since it worked now, it will work in the future </li><li>  other employees whom Ivan told life hacking will be able to do the same </li><li>  Ivan loses the trust manager </li></ul><br>  All this is extremely similar to blackmail, a way out of the situation is a compromise that Ivan brings a short-term bonus - a salary increase.  Total, the manager ceases to hope for Ivan.  Perhaps the manager even reads Ivan look for a replacement. <br><br>  Try to never bring the situation to such a state, it is very difficult to find an acceptable way out of it. <br><br>  Did your employees or you yourself ever asked a question from the title?  Maybe you yourself once did so?  Maybe someone is going to approach his manager tomorrow and ask the ‚Äúright‚Äù question? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> The author once did it himself.  The author is lucky that his manager is the Manager.  But that's another story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338674/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338674/</a></p>
