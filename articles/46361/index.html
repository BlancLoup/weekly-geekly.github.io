But since it is impossible to predict who in which team will be able to take on additional workloads, we take the ideal situation as the starting point, when we have at hand all the necessary specialists.

      As part of the analysis of the stages of work on the promo-site, we will not be able to fully consider the duties of each specialist.  Use third-party sources for a deeper understanding of the duties and qualities of the specialists that will be discussed. <br><br>  <b>Interactive project manager</b> .  This is a client manager, about whom we wrote above and who is engaged in conducting and developing business with a client. <br><br>  <b>An interactive project manager</b> is a specialist who needs to understand at a basic level in all the development processes of any site.  This person should be able to organize a team and clearly set tasks for the performers.  The project manager is the core of the entire project and the timing of the creation of the promotional site depends on it. <br><br>  In this place I would like to elaborate in more detail on the difference between the project manager and the manager.  She is principled and we came to her for a long time.  The manager should deal with issues of communication with the client and ensure the comfortable work of the team of specialists.  The project manager is most often a person familiar with site development technologies and able to organize a team within a company. <br><br>  For many it may seem that there is nothing easier to communicate with the client and lead the project.  But in fact this question is the nature of each of these specialists.  The main task of the client manager is to bring the company as much money as possible.  And the quality of the project is paramount for the manager.  In addition to these reasons, there are a number of reasons for sharing responsibility.  If you try to seriously think about the qualitative and quantitative indicators of the project, you will understand that it is not worth merging these two enormously different positions into one person. <br><br>  <b>Strategist</b> (analyst, marketer).  Thanks to this specialist, you can not only understand the client‚Äôs tasks, but also create a project on the strategist‚Äôs built hypotheses.  In addition, it is the task of the strategist, together with the manager, to sort out the brief and prepare him for further discussion in the team.  Throughout the project, the strategist should monitor the compliance of the development with the original task. <br><br>  <b>Creative director</b> .  Wikipedia has a good description of the duties of a creative director.  ‚ÄúAn important aspect of this position is the interpretation of the client‚Äôs communication strategy and the construction of creative concepts in accordance with this strategy.  Another essential aspect is the duty to initiate, support and develop the creative ideas of all involved in the creative process. <br><br>  A creative director, as a rule, heads the creative department of an agency or a department of a company.  In an advertising agency, a similar department consists of copywriters and art directors.  In a design studio, a team can include graphic designers and programmers.  In any case, in the submission of the creative director are people who are directly related to the creation of creativity.  The creative director is responsible for the final creative product. ‚Äù <br><br>  From our side, we will add that at the pre-project preparation stage, the creative director has the duty to work out a number of ideas together with the creative team, select ideas and present the result to the client. <br><br>  <b>Artdirector</b> .  At the pre-project stage of work, the art director should be able to estimate the amount of work by designers, to follow the presentation presentation for the client.  The Art Director is actively involved in the development of ideas and visual concepts. <br><br>  <b>Designer</b> .  Depending on the complexity of the project, the work of this specialist may be either a small technical (layout presentation of the finished materials), and the development of the main page of the site (if this is a necessary condition for the implementation of pre-project preparation). <br><br>  <b>Technical designer</b> .  This specialist may be required already on the project.  Naturally, the duties of this specialist can take on a good designer.  For large conceptual projects, the designer and technical designer are best divided. <br><br>  the continuation of this chapter follows </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46361/</a></p>
