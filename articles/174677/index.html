Today's review of the sandbox is unusual!  And it is unusual in that me and the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kriptomen/" class="user_link">kriptomen</a> decided to write it together! <br>  Over the past week we have gone through a lot of articles, and it‚Äôs hard to believe that people can write about such different topics and are not always compact.  We tried to make this review really a review, somewhere with minuses, somewhere with recommendations.  Please forgive us for a fair amount of sarcasm regarding some articles.  Sometimes it's hard to resist.  In the article, where required, the initials P - Roman (s), and A - Anton ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kriptomen/" class="user_link">kriptomen</a> ) are <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kriptomen/" class="user_link">indicated</a> . <br>  In general, we hope you enjoy it! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Algorithms </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60087/">Implementation of the algorithm for calculating the Mersen numbers in C ++</a> </h5><br>  The author of the article invents a long arithmetic and gives an example of student laboratory programming. <br>  Unfortunately, it looks that way. <br>  R: author, do not allocate 10 megabytes per stack for one array. <br>  A: i nikogda ne pishi transliton v kode.  NIKOGDA! <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60131/">Euclidean algorithm and its implementation in different languages</a> </h5><br><img alt="&quot;Euclid&quot;" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bf/8f8/8be/3bf8f88bef4ea5e94440bd081b897fdb.jpg"><br><br>  The author, rushing off the bat, proposes to understand the algorithm for finding the smallest common divisor (GCD).  A formalized description of the algorithm (very brainwashing, for my taste) and the implementation of the algorithm in different PL are given.

      It is not entirely clear what the author wanted to say, the article could be replaced with a maximum of three links: <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC_%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euglide_Algorithm_‚Äì</a> a detailed description of the Euclidean algorithm <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm#.D0.9F.D1.80.D0.B8.D0.BC.D0.B5.D1.80</a> - write the algorithm in pseudocode in recursive version <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0">ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/Example_execution_Algorithms_Euclidean</a> - implementation of the algorithm in different PL <br><br>  The author could describe in more detail the application of the algorithm, examples of its actual use. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60267/">Using Nokia Xpress Web App Builder using HabraRSS as an example</a> </h5><br>  A: A bit of necromancy - an overview of a web application for creating applications for S40-based phones (Nokia Asha in particular).  The article can learn how to know the rss address to create your application.  In my opinion, about anything. <br>  R: Quite a strange step on the part of Nokia, to launch a competition on such devices.  Give Africa cheap mobile phones! <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60279/">GitUm - a tool to support work on a project branch in a git repository</a> </h5><br>  It is a decent article, in my opinion a worthy invite.  The author gives an example of working with GitUm, a tool that facilitates working with git-repositories.  Briefly and in the case. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60353/">Useful plugins for Smarty</a> </h5><br>  A bit of code for Smarty from home bins.  Quite classic tasks - the conclusion of the announcement and the conclusion of the correct endings of words.  The author does not hide that the code of 2009, but still decided to share it.  No, well, what if. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60365/">Almost generate almost an invite to Habr</a> </h5><br>  A: I think an invite almost to Habr for the article is provided.  The author, the counterfeiter will not leave you, invite to png, size 24x24px <br>  R: Already there were several articles how to generate pictures like invite to Habr <br><br><h4>  Automation </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60161/">Auto build Android projects in Ant</a> </h5><br>  Guide for those who do not know how to use Google. <br>  It is useful as an extended version of this guide. <br>  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html">developer.android.com/tools/building/building-cmdline.html</a> <br>  I advise the author to also describe the ‚Äúnot for the lazy‚Äù method, or how to create the build.xml file via the console (terminal). <br>  In general, the article was useful to me.  But I am afraid that it can be comprehended by cons, like this article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174425">habrahabr.ru/post/174425</a> <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60179/">(O) Batch execution of SQL queries (JDBC)</a> </h5><br>  A useful article on how to perform SQL database queries with a ‚Äúpackage‚Äù that differs from a transaction in higher performance in Java using JDBC. <br>  I advise the author to make the code tag &lt;source&gt;, and not &lt;code&gt;.  The author also made a grammatically incorrect title, I advise you to correct <br>  The article is brief, background, specific. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60163/">Rapoo h9000 Wireless Headset Headphones</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c74/f8f/283/c74f8f283c5533e71eab4acfa1b79bae.jpg"><br>  R: The author makes a review of headphones whose model is listed in the title.  Inserted specification and those.  characteristics of the microphone (I do not know why, apparently, to increase the amount of text).  (I would like to note that it was decorated ugly, without formatting. It‚Äôs worth paying attention to how reviews are written by experienced authors) <br>  A: The review does not stand out as something special, the author's opinion is strongly condensed. <br>  In principle, if you work on the design of the article (subtitles, text selection), then you can publish.  But it‚Äôs too dry, I think.  I would like to note the presence of spelling errors "Chinese prodovtsov."  Even the browser stresses such errors, it seems to me in the review that is unacceptable (I hope we don‚Äôt have such errors). <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60149/">Types of batteries for mobile equipment</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b5e/de1/d4a/b5ede1d4a5973d672429a00657876a9e.jpg"><br>  R: A fascinating article, after which you ask yourself the question: ‚ÄúIs that all?  Anything science is capable of striding by leaps and bounds? ‚Äù. <br>  Of course, dry, but for the first article is quite suitable. <br>  I would like to ask the author to correct the ‚Äúmemory effect‚Äù on the ‚Äúmemory effect‚Äù in several places and other minor errors (‚Äúcause the battery to burn‚Äù - ‚Äúcause the battery to burn‚Äù). <br>  A: And since the article is a compilation of information from other sources, it would be good to refer to the sources. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60113/">Game Boy Pocket: quick review + giblets</a> </h5><br>  A call to notify about the past days and read about the Game Boy Pocket and see the analysis.  I didn‚Äôt dream of such a thing in my childhood, for example, I didn‚Äôt even know about him, but even though it‚Äôs not the good old Dendy, it causes a smile (still, the first photo shows my favorite Mario and Castlevania running on the devices) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/313/442/91e/31344291ecc7d724473e1ab52bb8b7f6.jpg"><br>  and see the review is quite interesting. <br>  Another interesting fact is that 2 devices take part in the review: one of the Japanese, the second of the Chinese assembly - the devices are absolutely identical in appearance and quality of assembly / materials, and the devices themselves, despite their considerable age of 17 years, are well preserved. <br><br><h4>  Electronics, DIY </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60175/">Some thoughts about smt pick and place homemade</a> </h5><br>  The article is more like: <br>  1) the flow of thoughts electronic engineer <br>  2) on a very big post for Q &amp; A <br>  The article is replete with abbreviations, technical terms.  The article poses a problem, and does not solve it, but only creates questions.  I would recommend the author with his problem to apply to the specialized electronics forum, and not to start the article with the words ‚ÄúGreetings to the community!  We need the first post, ‚Äúpretending to invite,‚Äù so it will be about what my head is crammed with.  " <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60229/">SDR receiver from scratch</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba4/d03/ee2/ba4d03ee2b0302c096a03a925332b4ac.png"><br>  Another article on electronics.  Read the article in one breath.  Very intriguing, I would give an invite just to read the sequel. <br>  Written in clear language, abbreviations are decrypted, the scheme is attached.  In the article, the author briefly describes what an SDR system is, how, theoretically, it can be built, who uses it and for how long.  The author also promises a series of articles on SDR systems. <br>  Remarks: <br>  1) fix ‚Äúnhflbwbjyysvb‚Äù to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù; <br>  2) the article has only one subtitle, so it can be combined with the text, highlighting it in bold. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60071/">Another home server</a> </h5><br>  Collected the home server - write on Habr!  The author apparently doubted for 2.5 years - whether to follow this rule, but in the end he decided.  Seriously, I like such articles, and for a long time I have wanted to collect and hoist servacheks on the cabinet, but here ... The author was not too lazy to write the name of the flash card on which he transferred the system, but for some reason decided to conceal the name of the motherboard, and only lay it out picture.  Not a final configuration, nor any interesting software solutions.  There is not even a photo with a cat on a server. <br>  Quote: <br><blockquote>  The topic was written in the workplace, for this lay out the pictures do not work. </blockquote><br>  No, well, I waited for 2.5 years, and here I had to write an article urgently at work!  :) <br><br><h4>  Let's talk for life </h4><br>
<h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60315/">RERE: Is Time Travel Possible?</a> </h5><br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd let's see!‚Äù (In the voice of Grishkovets) <br><br>  A rather sharp article in defense of the author of a recent article from the sandbox ‚ÄúIs it possible to travel in time‚Äù (the author has removed the article). <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60125/">How about one hour?</a> </h5><br>  The article is a response to a recent post - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/infopulse/blog/170777/">‚ÄúHow two weeks ?!‚Äù</a> and comments on it.  The author shows his vision of the implementation of a fuzzyly described TK from a customer who is not well versed in the web (in particular) technologies (‚ÄúTK mortal‚Äù): <br>  The customer wants to improve his site by adding a certain functionality, he knows what should come out in the end, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to describe it in the TK, he doesn‚Äôt know the pitfalls of development. <br>  On the other hand, the performer, seeing a simple at first glance TK, is taken to execute it ‚Äúin an hour,‚Äù and makes it clumsy as it is written. <br>  We read - "who is to blame" and "what to do."  Drama, gentlemen :) <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60201/">Technological singularity is not scary</a> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1bb/0a5/c71/1bb0a5c715fd412dae153190b6b9a38b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  God, what did I just read?  Looks like a pseudoscientific fantasy on the topic ... on the topic of what?  Unclear.  Either I am tired today, or the author is a professional copywriter who earns money by composing texts from scientific terms.  And it turns out whether he convincingly, or so-so. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60249/">Introduction to klassifayd - history, money, future</a> </h5><br>  A small excursion into the classifiers (methods for presenting custom ads by class, systematized).  I hope the author did not steal it from anywhere, and did not copy it from another resource, because ... <br>  In general, for me personally, the article seemed boring.  It is not clear whether the author proposes to throw all the start-up forces into the category, or says that the market is already drunk, so you should know that there are such things. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60101/">A few words about the principles of design</a> </h5><br>  The author did not lie, and really spoke a few words about the principles of design.  I would like more.  Less water, more principles.  Author, let's more principles! <br>  So far, not enough, and does not pull on a full article. <br><br><h4>  Failed articles </h4><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60085/">Flash drive and the fight with curiosity</a> </h5><br>  An article is not an article.  After reading, I would like to say: ‚ÄúThank you, Captain Obvious‚Äù.  And yes, kep, why do you need a flash drive?  I think most of the problems you could avoid using DropBox. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60083/">What would you like to change in Outlook Contacts and other mass products.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60083/">Or not?</a> </h5><br>  O God, Microsoft, help a man!  Such a cry of the soul can not be left unnoticed.  Why he can not write down the number of the machine in Outlook?  What the ..?! <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60077/">Is Pentest so easy?</a> </h5><br>  Although the article and, I will not hide, about anything, there is something to ponder.  How often are products tested for similar problems?  In particular, corporate decisions.  And how often the products are written with the thoughts ‚Äúwell, it works here, it means everything is in order‚Äù. <br>  quote: Pentest - imitation of real attackers (crackers, hackers, etc.) <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f1/697/446/4f16974468e8888a4ea5afb1f9c603d6.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60061/">GMOs, will they really save the world from starvation?</a> </h5><br>  And again the article is the answer.  This time, based on ‚ÄúMyths of our time: genetically modified organisms. Is the devil so terrible?‚Äù.  I would like to note that the original article was quite clearly argued, it‚Äôs more like a stuffing in order to discuss the Evil Corporation. <br>  No offense to everyone, but sometimes it seems to me that Habr will turn from day to day into a community of gardeners who are fond of space (I myself really like this topic) and occasionally program in Excel. <br><br><h5>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/60151/">The technique of transition to positive thinking "51 shades of white"</a> </h5><br>  What the hell?  :) The article is clearly not for Habr, although it may deserve 3 minutes to read it. <br>  Habr is not for esoteric. <br><br><h4>  the end </h4><br>  This is our review.  Perhaps we missed a couple of articles (laziness or inattention? Somewhere in the middle).  But in general, they tried to give an objective picture of the sandbox: the authors want to use Habr, and it does not matter in what ways. <br><br>  The following is a list of articles in reverse chronological order. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/174677/">https://habr.com/ru/post/174677/</a></p>
