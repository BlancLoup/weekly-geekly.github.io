Exactly! <br>  A few days ago, one American blogger and a teenager at the same time published a report on why teenagers are not interested in Twitter.  <a href="http://shutline.com/">I will gladly share the thoughts that are set out in it and will comment on this message in one.</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Message from Matthew </h2><br><img title="readbook" src="http://shutline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/1.PNG" alt="readbook" width="135" height="144" align="left">  Although Twitter is one of the hottest topics for conversation, but few people think about it, someone actually uses the microblogging service.  The other day, Matthew Robson (Matthew Robson) <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/13/why-teens-arent-using-twitter/%3Fawesm%3Dtcrn.ch_5lh%26amp%3Butm_campaign%3Dtechcrunch%26amp%3Butm_content%3Dtechcrunch-autopost%26amp%3Butm_medium%3Dtcrn.ch-twitter%26amp%3Butm_source%3Ddirect-tcrn.ch">shared</a> his ideas why Twitter is not so popular among teenagers. <br><br>  <em>If you look at all this technical progress, what is created for teenagers?</em>  <em>Basically, these are fashionable things such as the iPhone or the new Palm Pre, a favorite social network among teenagers - of course, Faceook and MySpace.</em>  <em>But why not Twitter?</em>  <em>Most teenagers explain this by saying that they are not used to sharing something intimate and personal with others.</em>  <em>In Facebook you have a strictly limited circle of friends and you know exactly who you are telling.</em>  <em>Even young people love SMS, but why send an SMS is not known where (meaning Twitter), if you can send it directly to a specific person.</em> <br><br>  From this we can conclude: teenagers are afraid for their ‚ÄúI‚Äù, for the dissemination of personal information.  Thanks, of course, to the American boy Matthew, for what he told us, but I think it is worth going back to reality and see how things are in reality.  I want to share with you my vision of the problem, why Twitter is not so popular among teenagers.  I'll run ahead in advance and say that if <strong>you have your own point of view</strong> , be <strong>sure to express</strong> it in the comments. <br><h2>  Why Twitter is not popular with teenagers. </h2><br><img title="twitter bird black" src="http://shutline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/images3.jpeg" alt="twitter bird black" width="106" height="100" align="left">  All replicas about the "non-disclosure of personal information" and "I do not want people to know what I am doing," in my opinion they are not suitable for our country.  It is worth looking into ‚ÄúIn Contact‚Äù, as you immediately understand, that people have nothing to do and they tell everyone and everything.  Who has some new girlfriend, who went where and with whom for the weekend.  You won't talk much about true friends either.  The average user has thousands of them and almost everyone has access to the holy of holies - profile, photos, phone numbers and e-mail.  And what is the privacy after this? <br><h2>  True causes </h2><br>  All the same, the true reason is slightly different, as it seems to me (arranged in order of increasing importance): 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      <strong>First</strong> , you need to keep your blog constantly.  Need to tell something.  Often, the first message is limited to a replica "Hello, what can I say, I'm also on Twitter."  It means that most of them are simply <strong>too lazy to write</strong> . <br>  <strong>The second</strong> and no less important reason for Russia to be unpopular with Twitter is <strong>English</strong> .  A regular user in a panic escapes at the sight of English "hieroglyphs".  The popularity of "In contact" is that it is in Russian.  There are also no Russian-speaking clients for Twiter, in contrast to the same ICQ, which is now gaining momentum. <br>  <strong>Thirdly,</strong> this is the threshold for entering the it sphere.  In Japan, as you know, this threshold is very low.  For example, in the land of the rising sun, the grandmother who reads comics from the PDA screen will not be surprised.  In the west, this threshold is slightly higher, but even housewives can exchange recipes without getting out of the laptop.  In Russia, in the it-sphere, those who are connected with it directly or are very keen on it are well-versed.  So the third reason is <strong>ignorance and unpreparedness of</strong> neither the system nor people for new technologies and solutions. <br><br><img title="twitter on the tree" src="http://shutline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/images4.jpeg" alt="twitter on the tree" width="85" height="68" align="right">  With this post I wanted to criticize the assessment that was given to Twitter.  Not so dangerous, showing all your inside, microblogging service.  True problems are completely different, but for some reason they think completely in the wrong direction ... <br>  Dear readers, do you agree with my point of view or do you think that everything is completely different?  Please share your thoughts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64413/</a></p>
