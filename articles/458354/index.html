  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Introduction to reversing from scratch using IDA PRO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habravchane! <br><br>  For those who do not know, at one time I took the responsibility to translate the Spanish Introduccion Al Reversing Con Ida Pro Desde Cero course by Ricardo Narvaja into Russian.  2.5 years have passed and now I can safely say that the course has been translated into Russian.  At the moment it is 67 parts.  But that is not all.  At the end of the 67th part, we can see what the continuation awaits us.  Now I would like to tell you about how I translated the course, what I encountered while translating, what I learned and how it all happened. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And it was like this that in November 2016, when I almost took off the entire course on debugging <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPvA316tqfNE%26list%3DPL59fvn5FIiQG0CrnALLgXzdpDTOk0hrz2">www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvA316tqfNE&amp;list=PL59fvn5FIiQG0CrnALLgXzdpDTOk0hrz2</a> <br>  Ricardo left such a post on his twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ricnar456/status/793441072307376136">twitter.com/ricnar456/status/793441072307376136</a> .  I was very happy about this post, because the debugging course has not been updated for a long time and stopped at chapter 58. It was something new and useful, because Ida Pro doesn‚Äôt have much literature, especially in Russian - this is an old book by Chris Kaspersky, only the first volume, of the three that were to come out and the book The Ida Pro by Book by Chris Eagle.

      And so I began to translate, because as I knew at that time, Spanish is a very easy language.  At that time, I immediately created Temka on Exelab, <a href="https://exelab.ru/f/index.php%3Faction%3Dvthread%26forum%3D5%26topic%3D24454">exelab.ru/f/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=5&amp;topic=24454</a> .  And immediately after the creation, I received in response that it was Sisyphean labor.  I was very upset, but I cheered up, because the moderator r_e immediately supported me and I understood that it was necessary to continue.  But I did not succeed.  Google coped with the translation very poorly, and Promt is even worse.  Then I decided to look for a freelancer who would help me translate the text.  Many freelancers refused to help after I sent them the source, arguing that this is a non-standard topic and they are not ready to take it.  But still I found one.  All freelancers take payment for the number of characters or words and therefore the first three parts cost me ~ 3 tons.  I began to process them, at the same time understand Spanish and prepare texts without pictures for the next translation, but the freelance translator refused me, saying that he was no longer ready to help and I had to stop the translation.  There was no translation on the forum for a long time, and they began to write about me that Yasha was blown away.  But at that very moment, when I had already given up, the translation into English made by <a href="https://twitter.com/ivinsoncls">twitter.com/ivinsoncls</a> began to appear and only thanks to this person, the course is now available in Russian.  His translation stopped in 46 parts, but that did not stop me.  Up to chapter 46 I translated the English text and at the same time translated Spanish into English and Russian, and began to notice that Google translates better into English than into Russian.  So I began to study, in passing buying the book <a href="http://www.chitai-gorod.ru/catalog/book/817261/">www.chitai-gorod.ru/catalog/book/817261</a> .  Ricardo's translation was very hard.  He constantly made grammatical mistakes in them, or simply missed letters, for example, he wrote to Pedo, but Puedo was needed.  Also, in his texts punctuation marks are absolutely wrong and it was not at all clear whether the sentence ended or not.  That is, he constantly dropped points, or instead of points he put commas or did not put anything at all and it turned out one very long sentence, without points and commas, with errors in words and missing symbols.  He also came up with a lot of words derived from English verbs that are not in Spanish, for example, Pushear, Popea, Pivoteando, Leakeando, Bypassear, etc.  There were also words that were not normally translated through a translator and Ida had to be started and what they meant and what Ida was doing, for example, Armado, Tiros, etc.  But the most difficult thing is that he uses turns and stable expressions that are very difficult for a beginner to translate and which are not translated by an online translator.  For example - ‚ÄúResponded con los pies‚Äù.  If you translate it literally, you get - "And answer with your feet."  The correct translation is ‚ÄúBring an answer‚Äù.  Also in his text there are a lot of identical words.  When they are repeated already 10 times on one page, then you understand that these are already words parasites.  His whole text is crammed with the words - "We see."  Also in one sentence can be up to 5 words - "Which".  Another of the difficulties is the use of pronouns.  It would be completely incomprehensible without the pictures about what he says, what noun, just use the pronouns ‚Äúthis‚Äù, ‚Äúthis‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äù. <br><br>  As soon as I could translate 46 chapters, I began to look for a translator in my city who would help me translate the remaining chapters.  I managed to find him, and when I arrived, and showed him the texts of Ricardo, he said that it was just terrible and asked if Ricardo was exactly a Spaniard.  I replied that he was from Argentina, to which he replied that in Argentina they do not communicate like that and this person is either illiterate or self-taught.  Also, during the translation, I began to teach Google the correct translation, sending him the correct translations and stuffing the glossary in Promt, until I began to learn and translate the words without their help. <br><br>  Also, all this time the provocateur acted on the forum, he is a genius from Mogilev, better known to the Internet community as Indy, Clerk, difexacaw (how does it read ??).  He constantly lowered the topic on the forum to the very bottom, making such an offtopic that the administration specifically created an acidic theme for this character, where he could communicate without a ban.  Seeing that his posts are being deleted, he began to write to me in a personal, always the same thing - that the course is not needed, that the main thing is to study the hardware and that the disassembler is for the slave, and he boyar (read elite) uses only a self-written debugger.  Unknowingly, Indy after his posts only made me work harder.  So I say hello to him.  Also thanks to the moderator, who supported me and defended me from this character. <br><br>  Separately, I want to say hello to Alexander Gostev on <a href="https://twitter.com/codelancer">twitter.com/codelancer to a</a> former employee of Kaspersky Lab, who spoke very positively about my first video course and Boris Ryutin at <a href="https://twitter.com/dukebarman">twitter.com/dukebarman</a> for my feedback on my translation work. <br><br>  After I published a pdf file with the latest translation - <a href="https://dropmefiles.com/XYeNL">dropmefiles.com/XYeNL</a> I received such an offer.  Will I be able to redraw all the pictures and make the course more beautiful in terms of screenshots, since Ricardo's hats are not very beautiful, and in part 67, where he began to draw screenshots as in the previous course, the chapter looks very beautiful.  I support this proposal.  All pictures will be redrawn, grammatical errors corrected, the text will be read and sentences will be revealed.  The whole translation will be the same as in 67 parts. <br><br>  I also want to send a big hello to the guys from the Exelab portal, who supported me with likes and forced me to transfer the course further - these are SReg - 26 likes, ClockMan - 20, ksol - 18, mak - 14, zNob - 12, and also super moderators who I was also supported and defended from indie attacks - this is r_e and Jupiter.  For them, I put this song - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D3vD4wmKtOJk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vD4wmKtOJk</a> <br><br>  I also want to thank the administration of Exelab for helping me in a difficult life situation - ‚ÄúThank you, I wouldn‚Äôt have managed without you.‚Äù <br><br>  I also want to say Thank you to the person who helped me purchase a PC to remove this course.  My old PC on which I shot the first course will not pull up the normal work even of Windows 7. I also want to say thanks to everyone who donated.  Donat was a little, but they still were.  They all went for a good deed.  I went to them to the other end of the city, paid for their translation and bought a couple of books in Spanish. <br><br>  Anyone who wants to express my gratitude for the work done and help me in learning Spanish (Now I would like to go to a language school to learn Spanish.) And translations of further courses from the CracksLatinoS team, please visit my site.  There is everything you need. <br><br>  PS <br>  Since our course is called ‚ÄúIntroduction to reversing from scratch, using IDA PRO‚Äù, I want to hold a small contest.  As you already know, I went to Uspenskoye to visit Chris Kaspersky‚Äôs father (I‚Äôll tell you about this trip very soon) and my father presented me a book that Kohl bought when he was on a business trip - Chris Eagle.  Anyone who is interested in this book, write to me at yasha@yasha.su with the title - "I want a book."  The random number generator will determine who gets it.  You will simply need your address in Russia.  Translation by mail to Russia will be free.  Also, as a bonus, you will receive this sweet mouse KK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51f/47f/5c5/51f47f5c507600d576fe7fd8289346ef.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458354/</a></p>
