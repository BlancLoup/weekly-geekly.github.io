It is unlikely that now they will want to do it more often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-0/7r/_n/-07r_nkqwoqyeynteiv2iytpovw.jpeg"><br><br>  The Red Dead Redemption is coming out the other day - their first game in five years after GTA V. I think she will be fine without classical journalistic reports from the office, but the Hausers still chatted with Vulture, told how the development went.  In the huge text there was a lot of important and interesting, but only one replica interrupted the rest, replicated and grew into an unpleasant scandal on the eve of the release (which, however, is also unlikely to interfere with success). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Dan Houser said: ‚ÄúIn 2018, there were weeks when we worked 100 hours each.‚Äù

      The game is huge, it amazes with the attention to detail of all who have already seen it.  And obviously - to bring to mind such a colossus was not easy.  But not everyone agreed that for this it‚Äôs worth working 14 hours a day without days off.  Recently, recycling is a very sensitive issue in games. <br><br><h2>  Crunchy - the infamous feature of gamedev </h2><br><blockquote>  "Crunch is not the same thing as just rummaging: it is a special type of a long trail, typical of the gaming industry." </blockquote>  <font color="gray"><i>From the preface to the Russian edition of the book Blood, Sweat and Pixels.</i></font> <br><br>  For example, Marcin Ivinsky from CD Projekt - the studio where they made the trilogy about The Witcher - <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/opinion/work-culture-video-games-crunch.html">considers crunches a necessary evil</a> .  He says: ‚ÄúPeople think that games are easy to do.  But it‚Äôs hard work, it can ruin your life. ‚Äù <br><br>  There are many supporting examples.  The work of many blockbusters - Skyrim, Mass Effect, Uncharted - is talking about working seven days a week with breaks only for sleeping.  Clint Hawking, a Ubisoft designer, <a href="http://www.clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2015/03/ten-years-down.html">described</a> how he encountered partial memory loss during hard work on Splinter Cell Chaos Theory.  Several months of life were erased from his head, which he was surprisingly restoring from conversations with friends and colleagues. <br><br>  ‚ÄúStress and anxiety literally hurt my brain,‚Äù he writes. <br><br>  Bret Duville <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-its-like-to-crunch-on-a-video-game-1701998016">recalled</a> how he was a lead programmer at Lucas Arts on the Jedi Starfighter project.  Guide set the task to make the game in 11 months.  40 hours a week turned into 80. Once, after five months at this pace, Bret simply could not get out of the car - he sat paralyzed for an hour and thought that he had a heart attack. <br><br>  In 2015, the IGDA gaming association <a href="https://www.igda.org/page/dss2016">conducted a survey</a> .  52% of respondents indicated that they had been krapchili more than twice in the past two years.  Another 32% said that they are required to have long periods of processing, but this is simply not called "crunchy". <br><br>  And perhaps the loudest scandal happened recently.  <a href="https://habr.com/post/424147/">Studio Telltale Games was closed</a> , hundreds of people were left without work and told about the terrible conditions due to unrealistic deadlines. <br><br><h2>  Rockstar hurried to justify </h2><br>  Of course, in such an atmosphere, Hauser‚Äôs revelation caused criticism. <br>  He hastened with explanations: <br><blockquote>  In fact, the interview was only about the work on narration and dialogue, and not about all the processes in the studio.  After seven years of development, the team of leading screenwriters ‚Äî Mike Unsworth, Rupert Humpfries, Laszlo Jones, and I ‚Äî have been actively finishing all three weeks.  Three weeks, not three years.  We have been working together for 12 years and we are always doing this, we feel that we have to do this in order to complete everything.  After so many years of working on the project, it was necessary to double-check and finalize everything. <br><br>  But most importantly, we do not demand such an approach from the rest.  The company has Sinioras, which are very invested in the project, and this is evident from the final quality of the games.  But additional input is a choice.  Many Sinioras work in the most usual way and do it productively - it's just that I am not one of them.  No one, neither shiniorov nor junior, we do not force to recycle. </blockquote>  This is not to say that the statement completely put out the fire, because the crunch has one peculiarity.  Often they are voluntarily forced.  People start to recycle out of solidarity with their colleagues.  Recycling becomes the unspoken norm, and in the end, if you get up and go home at seven in the evening, they treat you with censure. <br><br>  Perhaps that is why, after Hauser‚Äôs comments, the studio allowed all employees to speak frankly in social networks about their work.  And most of the developers took the side of Dan. <br><br><h2>  What do the developers themselves say </h2><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1052767684738277376"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><blockquote>  I have never worked more than 50 hours a week (and this is more likely an exception), but usually I have from two to six paid overtime hours a week. <br><br>  I get paid for processing from one and a half to two times more, if 8 extra hours a week are recruited or 12 hours more in one day - all according to California laws.  Also for all three and a half years at Rockstar I was asked to work on the weekend once or twice. </blockquote><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1052873840198594560"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><blockquote>  RDR 2 was one of the least stressful projects in my life.  My team and I were able to find a healthy balance between life and work, which always seemed like a holy grail in the gaming industry.  Once I caught pericarditis - it is an infectious heart disease - and I had to go to the hospital.  I went to work the next day, and as soon as HR found out about it, they sent me home by taxi and gave me a week-long vacation.  They said not to come back until the doctor allowed, although I wanted to work. </blockquote><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-2" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1052858607287627776"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><blockquote>  In two years of working on RDR2, I didn‚Äôt have nearly 100 hours a week.  Of course, there were crunches, but nothing extraordinary.  We worked on the game by the sweat, but no one pressed on us.  Maximum work 60 hours per week. </blockquote><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-3" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1052881710092816385"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><blockquote>  During the time that I am in the company, workflows have improved significantly.  The crunch on RDR 2 was much softer than on GTA V when I worked more than 70 hours a week for a whole month (although the boss drove me home). </blockquote>  However, there were also anonymous messages that came to journalists.  For example, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/10/18/rockstar-working-conditions/">VG247 published this</a> : <br><blockquote>  Not all studios pay for processing.  We are definitely not paid.  Many departments write that no one forces them, but I doubt that you will see many tweets from designers and testers.  For example, I regularly work more than 50 hours a week from the moment I came here. </blockquote><h2>  What do you think </h2><br>  I don‚Äôt really want to believe that recycling is a necessary evil.  But waiting for Red Dead Redemption 2 for another year and a half (and then half a year fixing bugs) is also not cool. <br><br>  So let's take a survey.  Who thinks what? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427207/</a></p>
