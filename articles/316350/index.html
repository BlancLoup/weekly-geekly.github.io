We will talk about the equipment and systems fixing the time of arrival and departure, and consider the question of their necessity. <br><br>  The first part of the <b>Hard</b> article will be devoted to equipment that is used to physically control the time spent by employees in the workplace. <br><br>  We will consider all types of working time recording systems that are used with varying degrees of activity in the Russian market.

      Almost all systems that we consider will require - installation, switching equipment, wiring, software configuration. <br><br>  Part Two <b>Hardcore</b> will focus on the need and ethical use of time tracking systems.  Especially for you the most famous Russian businessmen will answer this question. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <b>Hard</b> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#fa6b00">Terminals of registration of arrival and departure</font> </h3><br>  Terminals for time recording do not control any actuators (turnstiles, electric locks, etc.).  This is due to their low price - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/terminaly-ucheta-vremeni/">from 9 670 rubles</a> .  Software almost always comes bundled. <br><br>  The logic of work: the first identification - the arrival, the second - care.  Will work on condition that the manager decides to pay for the work day only if the employee has been authenticated twice, when he came and when he left. <br><br>  Most of the terminals use a human biometric attribute as an identifier.  Most often it is the imprint of a skin pattern of a finger, the shape of a face, a venous finger or hand pattern. <br><br>  Biometric terminals are the most convenient.  ID can not be lost, forgotten, broken, in short, he is always with you.  In the case of a fingerprint, the main limitation is the purity of the hands, because  The sensor glass can easily be stained, and the identification error will be higher. <br><br>  For completeness, we add that there are a small number of terminals that work only on contactless cards, but I don‚Äôt see any reason to consider them in more detail.  the widespread practice of marking the arrival / departure of each other will minimize their effect. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#fa6b00">Mobile phone</font> </h3><br>  In this case, thanks to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.spnx.sphinxnfcterminal%26hl%3Dru">the software</a> , the phone with the NFC module, according to its functionality, turns into a terminal for registering the arrival and departure.  This solution is interesting in that it is presented by the Russian manufacturer of controllers for the access control system <a href="http://securityrussia.com/brands/sphinx/">by the company Promavtomatika</a> , respectively, is part of a large software and hardware complex access control.  Mifare contactless cards are used as identifiers. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#fa6b00">Electronic lock</font> </h3><br>  Not the best way to organize the accounting of working time.  And here it is only because in reality the client quite often wants to use it precisely because of the low cost and minimal external changes that need to be made to the office interior. <br><br>  With the passage of several people in about 90 cases out of 100, one person will apply the card, and of course, everything will pass.  Given the fact that people come to work and leave it, as a rule, at the same time, it will happen all the time. <br><br>  At the very least, it will work, provided that the room is internal, and if there are not very many people in this room - the more people there are, the more errors will be in the reports. <br><br>  <b>System composition and prices</b> <br><blockquote>  Electronic lock - from 1129 rubles <br>  ACS controller - price from 3000 rubles <br>  Software is both paid and free, depending on the controller manufacturer. <br>  Readers - from 562 rubles <br>  Contactless cards - from 16 rubles <br>  Computer - from 12,000 rubles </blockquote><br>  In such systems, almost all possible identifiers can be used - a fingerprint, a venous drawing of a hand or a finger, a face shape, an iris. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#fa6b00">Turnstile</font> </h3><br>  This is one of the best ways of organizing the accounting of working time due to its unique feature - cutting off one by one.  As a result, you will get a clean working time minus all delays, early departures, lingering dinners, etc. <br><br>  <b>System composition and prices</b> <br><blockquote>  Turnstile - price from 32 000 rubles <br>  ACS controller - price from 3000 rubles <br>  Software can be both paid and free, depending on the manufacturer. <br>  Readers - from 562 rubles <br>  Contactless cards - from 16 rubles <br>  Computer - from 12,000 rubles </blockquote><br>  The number of violations after the installation of the turnstile will decrease, although there will be employees who will crawl under the turnstile or jump over, integration with the video surveillance system will significantly reduce the number of people willing to perform such actions. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#fa6b00">Video camera</font> </h3><br>  Strictly speaking, the main character will not be the camera itself, but a video analytics module.  The big advantage of which will be barrier-free, i.e.  lack of turnstiles and locked doors. <br><br>  <b>Monitoring staff activity</b> <br><br>  Ideal for those employees whose workplace is precisely defined.  This is for example the office staff at the desk, the workers at the machine, cashiers, doormen, video surveillance operators, security guards. <br><br>  Software module - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/cctv/soft/6704">5000 rubles</a> <br><br>  In addition to the fact of having an employee in the workplace, video analytics make it possible to record activity, which is important for video surveillance operators or security guards who can fall asleep in the workplace. <br><br>  <b>Face recognition</b> <br><br>  The second model of using video analytics is a person identification system based on face recognition. <br><br>  Software module - <a href="http://securityrussia.com/cctv/soft/402123">314,000 rubles</a> <br><br>  Accounting of working hours is not the main function of such systems, but now they can be used for automatic fixation of the arrival and departure. <br><br><h2>  <b>Hardcore</b> </h2><br>  All articles devoted to the accounting of working time, on resources where commenting is available, cause a flurry of negative comments.  Interestingly, most of the comments are made during business hours. <br><br>  The desire of any person to avoid negativity is absolutely natural, nor is it alien to the authors of articles on working time accounting, which is why it seems to me that this important question was left without proper attention. <br><br>  Nor is it alien to the author of this article, so let us give an opportunity to speak to people whose authority personally makes me listen only humbly. <br><br>  <b>Timura Goryachev - General Director of the concern ‚ÄúKalina‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Quotes from the <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/34568369/">book</a> "Cheats for bosses.  Hard and honest management lessons that are best learned from experience. ‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  Kalina was often called an army company, almost a prison and a concentration camp.  The head of the personnel department of Kalina even began collecting horrible myths about the enterprise - there are many of them, but they all boil down to one general statement: Kalina is a prison ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  In the same book, Goryachev explains why he is so categorical. <br><br><blockquote>  To begin with, people in Russia are less tied to their workplace.  First of all, they don‚Äôt care that they are valued, they don‚Äôt care about the time they spent on the company, they don‚Äôt care about everything the company has done for them. <br><br>  Secondly, the whole world behind the fence every night tells them that stealing is good, steal, come on.  Strictly speaking, people never lived in the times when someone in our homeland considered it differently: for how many years they had been burning at the entrance of a light bulb - for so many years it was considered decent to unscrew them, moreover, in their own staircase.  And this propagated belief "To steal is normal" </blockquote><br>  <b>Mikhail Fridman - co-owner of the consortium "Alfa Group"</b> <br>  Quote from <a href="https://youtu.be/ll2KFqlCTO4%3Ft%3D36m10s">an interview</a> for the program "Business Secrets 2.0 with Oleg Tinkoff" <br><br><blockquote>  People are not accustomed to act not out of fear, they are accustomed to either act in extreme conditions, or under the influence of a stick </blockquote><br>  Appealing to authority is a strong reception, but we will try to be impartial, and we note that these are only private opinions of people.  People who have achieved a lot with their mind and work.  But they are just people, and therefore can be biased. <br><br>  <b>PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) international network of companies offering professional consulting and auditing services</b> <br>  The excerpt from the <a href="http://www.pwc.ru/ru/press-releases/2015/saratoga.html">study of the</a> effectiveness of the PwC personnel management system is also interesting in that it shows the reaction of the staff to the crisis. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOn average, for each employee of companies that marked this trend in 2014, there were almost 2 additional days of unplanned absenteeism, which increased by 1.3 times the loss of these companies from the absence of employees in the workplace‚Äù </blockquote><br>  For all those who read up to this place and did not begin to think that the author, Timur Goryachev and Mikhail Fridman had left the paranoid coils <font color="#fa6b00">‚Üí</font> <a href="http://securityrussia.com/resheniya/time/">prices for equipment and installation services</a> . <br><br>  In conclusion, I would note that personnel control is not an end in itself, but a tool whose relevance in current crisis economic conditions is greatly increasing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/ea8/33b/2d7ea833b34f4f0b9bbaf8fcf1b37dcf.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316350/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316350/</a></p>
