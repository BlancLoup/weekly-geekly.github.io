Solving problems of choice among the abundance of goods</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Who is on the front line? </h4><br><br>  If before the main problem of consumers was the shortage of goods, then today the real difficulty in making a purchase is their abundance.  Today, when purchasing via the Internet is becoming the norm not only in the United States and Europe, or, say, South Korea, but also in Russia (this process is just starting in Kazakhstan), the problem of choice becomes even more acute. <br>  But if there is a problem, there are always willing to solve it.  The solution was the comparison of goods services.  Such services are popular abroad, for example, <a href="http://www.shopping.com/">www.shopping.com</a> , <a href="http://www.shopzilla.com/">www.shopzilla.com</a> .  Such services as <a href="http://www.market.yandex.ru/">www.market.yandex.ru</a> and <a href="http://torg.mail.ru/">torg.mail.ru are</a> popular in runet <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  New service in kaznet </h4><br>  Only recently in Kazakhstan with the advent of the Megaline service from Kazakhtelecom and similar services from other providers, does the Internet become available to a wide range of consumers.  Accordingly, users have an interest in obtaining a wide range of Internet services. <br><br>  Many large suppliers of electronics, computer equipment in Kazakhstan acquire their own online stores.  Today, several large online hypermarket markets already work, first of all, this is homeshop.kz.  Many small suppliers or just intermediaries create more and more new online stores.

      That is, in Kazakhstan, there was a need for this kind of service. <br><br>  The company ¬´iLine¬ª catching this need, has developed its own engine for this service.  We plan to soon launch our first service at <a href="http://www.shopline.kz/">www.shopline.kz</a> . <br><br><h4>  What is so interesting about it? </h4><br>  The proposed Internet resource will contain many typical functions for such services: <br><ul><li>  get information about suppliers of goods; </li><li>  compare the cost of goods from different suppliers; </li><li>  compare technical specifications for different products; </li><li>  obtain information on the availability of goods from suppliers; </li></ul><br>  The process of filling the product catalog is not an easy task, as it may seem at first glance.  A tool that automates this process, providing convenient, high-quality and fast filling of the catalog, is the first competitive advantage of our service. <br><br>  The next advantage is convenient and effective means of searching for goods.  In addition to searching by keywords, the service will provide the ability to search by a combination of criteria, for example, ‚Äúprice range‚Äù, ‚Äúbrand‚Äù, ‚Äúspecific characteristics‚Äù.  Characteristics of product templates are set when filling the catalog. <br><br>  Separate attention is heard by the product evaluation service or store. <br>  In addition to the overall assessment of the product, the user will be able to evaluate the product according to its individual characteristics.  For example, to evaluate the refrigerator on a five-point scale according to such characteristics as ‚Äúfreezing ability‚Äù, ‚Äúsize‚Äù, etc. <br><br>  On the portal <a href="http://www.shopline.kz/">www.shopline.kz</a> , among other things, the visitor will be able to: <br><ul><li>  get information on the rating of goods and stores; </li><li>  get information about hot deals or updates; </li><li>  leave your reviews on products and read reviews from other consumers; </li><li>  discuss products on the forum; </li><li>  read the instructions for the purchase of a limited liability company or other goods; </li><li>  read reviews and news on different market segments; </li><li>  subscribe to the newsletter of news, reviews, articles, etc .; </li><li>  buy the selected item from the supplier‚Äôs online store (in this case, the system automatically redirects the user to the partner‚Äôs online store page, with a full description of the item being offered and the possibility of adding the item to the basket for subsequent payment). </li></ul><br>  It is planned to develop a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù component of the service.  For example, such a function as a ‚Äúwish list‚Äù.  There are many quite popular projects that allow you to publish your ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù on the Internet in order to inform your friends and relatives, say before your birthday, about what gift you are expecting.  You can send your wish list to your friend (s) :) <br>  Why not add this feature to the product comparison service?  Already add :) <br><br>  There are still a lot of "goodies", which can be discussed in the following topics, if anyone is interested. <br>  We will be glad if our experience will be useful to anyone and are grateful for any advice and comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61720/</a></p>
