We want to introduce you to our service I <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/">did everything</a> in the form on which we have been working for the last six months.  While doing a trial project in 7 days, we could not even think that this would become a key area of ‚Äã‚Äãour company.  A lot has happened lately.  But the final version is running, please judge and complain. <br><br>  Briefly about what you can do now with a voice, simply by calling from a telephone to a toll-free number: <a name="habracut"></a>

      - <b>Sending SMS and E-MAIL by voice</b> . <br>  How it works: for example, you are going to a meeting, but you are late, call the service and say: Message Maxim I was stuck in a traffic jam by 3:00 pm I do not have time.  And that's all.  Maxim on the phone receives an SMS and knows that you will be later.  Similarly, you can send and E-MAIL voice, more <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/Emailsms.aspx">here</a> . <br><br>  - <b>Time management voice.</b> <br>  It now includes: <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/Dela.aspx">organizing a to-do list with tags</a> , <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/Reminder.aspx">setting reminders</a> , <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/Note.aspx">recording valuable thoughts and ideas</a> .  How it works: You just call and speak the text of the task, or reminder, indicating the time and date, and that's it.  Tasks are added to your to-do list, and reminders set the time when you need to send you an SMS or E-MAIL with a notification. <br><br>  But the main thing is that all the voice recordings you make come to the post office.  And even without using the to-do list of services, you can organize your tasks very effectively.  In the new version, a summary of the created entry + tags + time is made in the header of e-mails, for example: <b>Subject: [personal] [Sat 17 Feb.</b>  <b>11:30] pick up a coat of dry cleaning ...</b> This is a small innovation, but it greatly simplifies working with affairs in OutLook and Gmail. <br><br>  Our project had the first serious partners in the person of <a href="http://improvement.ru/">Gleb Arkhangelsky</a> , who highly appreciated the capabilities of the service and is ready to recommend it to his colleagues and partners.  In the near future, together with his company, we will develop voice access to OutLook and introduce Time Drive system into our service.  I am sure that cooperation with them will bring a lot of useful solutions for the project and improvements for voice time management tools. <br><br>  - <b>Access to web services by voice.</b> <br>  We have already written about the implementation of <a href="http://vselisdelal.ru/Web.aspx">voice access to Google Calendar</a> .  But I will briefly write here again how it works: after registering in the Services section, you can connect the Google Calendar, i.e.  Allow Vselisdelal to write to your Calendar. <br><br>  Now in any situation, you just call and say, for example, the following message: Googol calendar tomorrow to meet a friend at the airport at 21:00.  And everything, a new event will be added to the Calendar for tomorrow at 21:00 with the text Meet a friend at the airport.  It turned out that voice access to popular web services is a very popular solution and in the near future we plan to launch docking with resources such as <b>Twitter, Remember The Milk, and Livejournal</b> . <br><br>  A joint project with <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/">Moskva.FM</a> will appear the other day.  Now all users of this wonderful service will be able to listen to the radio in the car or in any other place where there is no access to the Internet, just call and add a song to your compilation by voice, or leave a comment to the composition, and also bookmark an interesting program that goes on the air.  Details will be soon. <br><br>  We also plan to unify the docking of our service with third-party web applications through the API.  Now we have enough information to implement a quality solution and it will be launched soon.  So almost any web service will be able to implement voice access. <br><br>  - And further.  To increase the reliability of information transfer, you can now <b>listen to the voice file</b> that was recorded.  A link to it is attached to all emails.  This is in case some part of the message was not recognized or was, but not exactly. <br><br>  Project development plans are many.  And we will step by step implement our plans and expand the capabilities of the service.  There will be much more interesting.  Many thanks to everyone who supports us with a kind word and error message, and ideas for development.  It is very important for us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53429/</a></p>
