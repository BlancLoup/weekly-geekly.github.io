Someone put the site in the cloud and save, someone builds his giant clouds and earns. <br>  What could be useful for a regular user, webmaster, admin in the clouds and why are there so few (or many) in Russia? <br><br><h4>  Cloud VPS / VPS </h4><br>  In the Russian market, cloud providers are probably already provided by more than 10 companies, some have more cloudy ones, some less.  What is the difference between cloud vds and ordinary ones?  For the most part, everything is the same, the hardware is the same, server tezhe, tezha sana (although some hosters still keep vski on local disks), tezhe communication links (all with the same switches and routers), the only feature of these VDS was the possibility of migration between servers, which increased their availability. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The second feature resulting from the first was the ability to dynamically and statically allocate resources for virtual machines (can be seen in selectel or oversan clouds). <br>  Perhaps there is a third feature, but I guess I forgot it, I will be glad if you mention it in the comments.

    <h5>  A small practical opus </h5><br>  Switching to the cloud for xen-virtualok is quite simple to implement, deploying on the <a href="http://www.xen.org/products/cloudxen.html">xen cloud platform</a> machines and migrating the virtual machines from the usual xen to xcp (I note the simple transition in your cloud, if you have san where virtual machines are stored, and the iron monotony (same mothers and processors) and operating systems). <br><br>  The main problem of Russian clouds VDS are their unverified / unresolved time infrastructure and software solutions, in this regard, we can find many articles in Habr√© (even this year) in the format that the provider doesn‚Äôt have a cloud (someone else has <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/selectel/blog/117853/">nfs</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oversun/blog/116137/">Someone gpfs</a> and so on). <br><br>  At the moment, I have the stability of ordinary airborne systems that are not in the cloud is higher than that of the cloud (and given the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cloud_computing/117933/">recent fall of the Amazon</a> , I think not only me).  According to my forecasts, cloud hosters in Russia have gained a critical mass of customers, they have something to test and improve on, so I think in a year it will be possible to say that cloud vdski in Russia are more stable than normal ones. <br><br>  The second big minus of clouds is their cost.  The unreasonably high cost of memory, amid the global decline in prices for it.  No choice of the cost of the drive (the cost could vary depending on the types of raid).  Only paid traffic or channel restriction depending on the volume of services ordered (without the possibility to order a bandwidth in the tezhe of 100 megabits for sane money).  At the moment in Russia it is cheaper to put a couple of its powerful servers on a collocation with 100 megabit anlim than to go to the cloud (the dedicate of a powerful server in Russia is so far more expensive, in the same hetzner the dedik will be cheaper). <br><br>  You can name the third problem yourself in the comments, it is probably different for everyone. <br><br>  After solving these two problems, I will be ready to transfer part of my infrastructure to Russian clouds. <br><br>  It is also surprising that the test gives a very tiny amount of 100-500 rubles, instead of 2000-5000.  By handing out tezhe 2000, you can attract a lot more people to test and, accordingly, there will be more customers who are satisfied with the test, which can be tested for 250 rubles, I can hardly imagine.  Although perhaps the economy of the clouds is such that it does not allow to issue such volumes for the test. <br><br>  At the end I will mention success stories about the clouds, of course, applications as services, Megaplan‚Äôs business manager is actively promoting everywhere, <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">Insales</a> online store service has recently received good investments, the website <a href="http://www.insales.ru/">builder yukoz</a> has been working since ancient times, <a href="http://pdd.yandex.ru/">Yandex Mail</a> has been successfully launched <a href="http://pdd.yandex.ru/">for a domain</a> and others (in the comments you can mention, add in post). <br><br>  And what do you keep in the clouds?  Are you going to?  What is missing?  What are you afraid of, or vice versa? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118400/</a></p>
