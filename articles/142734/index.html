  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel introduced the third-generation quad-core processors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://static.zn.ua/system/illustrations/000/028/929/online.jpg?1296168840" alt="image"><br><br>  Intel has officially unveiled a line of quad-core third-generation processors, on the basis of which ultrabooks will be built. <br>  Although Intel does not specify in the release the name of the new product family, Western media say that these are long-awaited processors codenamed <b>Ivy Bridge</b> , which will replace the current Sandy Bridge chip family.  The announcement of third-generation processors Intel made back in May last year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The new generation of Intel processors is made on a 22-nanometer process, while the current generation is made on the process of 32 nm, and the first generation - 45 nm.  It is expected that the new processors will be more compact and economical compared to Sandy Bridge. <br><br>  In the new line of Intel for the first time used transistors, created by 3D Tri-gate technology, which have a three-dimensional architecture.  The technology provides a 20% higher speed with energy consumption, 20% lower than that of Sandy Bridge. <br>  In addition, it provides improved operation of computers based on Intel processors with 3D-graphics, photos and video in high resolution.  ‚ÄúOur developers have exceeded all expectations, having doubled the performance of working with media and visual materials in new chips regarding the best processor models we have created so far,‚Äù comments Intel Vice President Kirk Skaugen. <br>  The 3rd generation of Intel Core processors has received the Intel HD Graphics 4000 graphics system, which has support for Microsoft DirectX 11, OpenGL 3.1 and OpenCL 1.1.  Also in the new technology implemented Intel Quick Sync Video 2.0, which, according to company representatives, speeds up the process of video conversion to be downloaded to the Internet up to two times compared to processors introduced last year.

      It is worth noting the new security features, including technology Intel Secure Key and Intel OS Guard, protecting personal user data.  For example, the Intel Secure Key includes a digital random number generator that creates unique combinations of numbers to enhance encryption algorithms, and Intel OS Guard technology protects users from attacks that aim to extend privileges in cases where an attacker gets remote access to someone else's computer.  These two new technologies complement the existing platform, which includes Intel Identity Protection and Intel Anti-Theft technologies, and is designed to make computers based on Intel processors one of the most secure systems.  When used with Intel Series 7 chipsets, new-generation processors with Intel Identity Protection technology make part of the screen unreadable for spyware using the "secure transaction display" feature, preventing theft of credentials. <br><br>  Platforms based on third-generation Intel Core processors also provide faster data transfer rates, thanks to the support of the USB 3.0 interface and the PCI Express 3.0 interface integrated into the processor. <br><br>  Changing the architecture of microcircuits while reducing the size of transistors has made it possible to speed up the implementation of the tick-to-tile model, which Intel adheres to.  Recall that in the past, Intel followed the model, according to which one new production process was developed in one year (tick cycle), and the next year, the architecture changed (tac cycle).  Now the corporation was able to accelerate the implementation of the production plan and at the same time change the architecture of the microcircuits and the production process. <br><br>  Deliveries of 13 processors of a new family, intended for desktops and laptops, start from today.  The company promises to expand the line of chips for ultrabooks, servers and other systems in the coming months.  As expected, by the end of 2012, more than 75 ultrabook models should appear on the market, including on the basis of the new generation of Intel processors. <br><br><h6>  Based on ria.ru and km.ru </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142734/</a></p>
