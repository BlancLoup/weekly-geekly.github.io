  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcements, Thanks and Promises</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Well, first of all, let me say a huge thank you to all those who read my articles on this blog, commented, gave their suggestions - I was very pleased to understand that this topic seems important to not just me (and not a bit boring because you can find your interesting moments in everything!).  I received a lot of comments and ideas, questions that I tried to answer ... unfortunately, I was not able to answer all and not all - sometimes because the answer is a separate article, and sometimes simply because I don‚Äôt know the topic of the question to try to answer it. <br><br>  And I have long wanted to write this post.  In addition to the actual informative part (under the cut - announcements of future articles), it will also contain a certain amount of reflection.  Reflections on the topic: but think, habraradi, how long has Habr ceased to be a purely geeky resource of a strictly technical nature? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After a long time, n'est ce pas?  And I can not not welcome it - even at the risk of being mined: after all, now Habr is something more - Habr is a community of smart people.  No more and no less.  Think about it.

      This thought warms me, warms me and the understanding that this is how it should be: there is a humanitarian intelligentsia, and there is a technical one;  so long ago it was in Russia and not only, and this is extremely correct.  And an educated person, in addition to his piece (well, you remember what a narrow specialist resembles to?), Can search for information, knows how to use it, is ready to learn something new, and always tries to understand what is happening around him - even if (and especially if) it is not its focus.  In my understanding, this is what a real engineer should be. <br><br>  However, enough philosophy.  To the point! <br><br>  So, on the agenda we have the following topics.  We have already considered in the first approximation one of the basic financial instruments - stocks.  Without a doubt, he is just one of - but still one of the most important.  Next, I propose: <ol><li>  Discuss other types of financial instruments, make a small comparison of them with the shares we have already studied.  Other financial instruments will be assigned to bonds (bonds), which we will discuss quite briefly - and derivatives (futures and options in the first place) that we‚Äôll dwell on a bit more, because they are often the most difficult to understand for an untrained person.  FX (foreign exchange) and commodities (for example, oil) will not be touched, as this is a separate topic.  Understanding this material is necessary if only to understand why it is precisely ‚Äúthe stock market is not alive in shares of the same.‚Äù  By the way, the notorious crisis has nothing to do with stocks - but in many respects it relates to operations with derivatives :-) </li><li>  Consider the types of stock indexes - first of all the Dow-Jones Industrial Average and FTSE 100 - as the two main indexes of the two largest world exchanges (NYSE and LSE).  It is proposed to consider the principle of the formation of the index, the nature of changes in its value, and some small example of how a change in the stock price of a company that is included in the index may affect its value.  However, if people ask the NASDAQ Composite or the RTS or MICEX indices, I see no reason to refuse. </li><li>  Finally, the most interesting thing is what I wanted to get to for a very long time, exactly where computers and IT infrastructure appear in full growth - actually trading (and, in particular, algorithmic trading - at least in the first approximation).  I would very much like to tell you at least a couple of strategies of electronic trading, and if it works out - about the order, order execution, straight-through-processing (STP) and direct market access - these are all very interesting, although quite complex topics, because there will be a lot of branches in areas that we did not consider;  almost certainly this article will have to be split up into several topics </li></ol>  What do you think?  I have not started writing new articles yet - I decided to take a short pause, at the same time giving you the opportunity to "digest" the material already written and published.  This is me to the fact that if there is something insanely interesting - then write comments or plus existing ones, if enough people are typed - we will change the list.  So - everything is in your hands! <br><br>  PS for those who have not read a single article: <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/finance/43377/">Stocks, part one</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/finance/43428/">Shares, part two</a> <br><br>  At the very beginning of the blog <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/finance/">Finance for All,</a> there is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/finance/43341/">an article</a> - a comparative analysis of Google and Yahoo!  Finance, but it is a little out of our educational cycle. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43495/</a></p>
