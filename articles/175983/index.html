  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silicon Valley in Ulyanovsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the problem of creating an ideal place to work in IT is increasingly rising.  Many people do not like to live in megacities, and some IT companies are increasingly thinking about opening offices in the regions.  Not so long ago, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/155345/">village of programmers in an open field was</a> proposed at Habr√©.  The idea is excellent, but of course it will hardly be possible to realize it with bare enthusiasm.  I love my city and is interested in the development of IT in our region and therefore decided to prepare an overview of Ulyanovsk for all those who are interested in moving to a more peaceful place to work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb9/247/2d2/fb92472d29901f7e3ec68559be4401c0.jpg"><br><br>  In general, it seems to me that this is a future trend - IT specialists will massively move from megalopolises to more comfortable places in our country or to warm countries.  So, about Ulyanovsk: it is a very comfortable city on the Volga with a population of just over 600 thousand people, excellent ecology, lots of greenery, almost no traffic jams, though there are almost no good roads either.  Average housing prices in the region of 35-40 tr.  for the quarter.  meter.  If you shoot, then a good dvushka in the center will cost somewhere in 15 tr.  per month.  There are two airports in the city, two flights depart daily to Moscow, and one day you can decide things in Moscow if you leave in the morning, and in the evening you should be in Ulyanovsk (only 1.5 hours fly).  Many private medical clinics, there are very decent schools for children.  There are several large shopping centers in the city, in which almost all the familiar brands are represented.  You can drive around the whole city in a couple of hours. <br><br>  Now about the local IT movement.  A couple of years ago, no one had heard that there are IT companies in Ulyanovsk, but now everything has changed radically, and the city can compete even with Novosibirsk.  We have a lot of successful IT companies, which are combined into two non-commercial partnerships.  These NPs have established a dialogue with the authorities (we even have a whole ministry of IT technology development!), The authorities are actively promoting the IT culture.  Every year two international IT conferences are held in Ulyanovsk: ulamp and "Strike".  The latter, by the way, very soon: already April 12-13.  More than 2000 participants from all over the country are expected, more than 100 reports and a classy party in the final - be sure to come and see everything with your own eyes!  Also, smaller events are held annually in the city, at the local level, such as ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äôs day‚Äù or ‚ÄúDeadline camp‚Äù - they are organized by local companies to search for talented youth.

      It is probably interesting to many, as in Ulyanovsk with IT personnel, because  if you move the whole company, or open additional.  office, the question arises: "With whom to work?".  And with staff, everything is not bad: there are two large universities in the city, which annually stamp about two thousand IT specialists.  Local companies organized regular free courses for students and young specialists, now at the final discussion stage with the authorities, the IT Academy project will be a kind of ITU vocational school for all comers, which will issue ready-made personnel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e8/34e/e03/4e834ee037afd4d8e9053668029a681e.jpg"><br><br>  The level of wages of local IT specialists ranges from 30 to 100 thousand rubles.  This year I know several candidates when Ulyanovsk companies lured away specialists from Moscow and Novosibirsk. <br><br>  Now about where to base companies.  Renting office space in the center will cost an average of 800 rubles per square meter ... But good office buildings are in short supply.  There are no coworkers in the city yet, but active discussions in the IT crowd and it seems even concrete discovery actions have already begun.  In addition, a future business center for Greencenter IT companies is being built in Ulyanovsk.  The project was supported by the majority of IT companies in the city, the Developer is a commercial structure, without government participation.  Rumor has it that there will also be a great coworking, perhaps even from PLUG &amp; PLAY.  The future IT center will have a convenient location, near Ulyanovsk Polytechnic, build everything up to the last word (high degree of energy saving, 3.5 kW straight cable, 5 providers, ample parking, a cafe / restaurant, a trainer and all that - in general, the first Ulyanovsk "B +").  By the way, the rent is promised from 500 rubles per sq.m.  In general, the project is very interesting, plan to pass in November of this year.  Who knows, maybe Greencenter still eclipses Skolkovo, at least not with PR, but with real deeds. <br><br>  Thus, Ulyanovsk is a very interesting decision for moving.  In the city there is everything for comfortable living and development in IT.  I invite everyone to personally verify this by arriving at the ‚ÄúStrike‚Äù conference.  Look at our immense Volga, breathe fresh air and chat with local IT specialists.  Seriously, come on! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/371/beb/a62/371beba62e8b141470db360b56df78f8.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175983/</a></p>
