      <b>- Development of the PHP-7 branch. *</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Stogov (Zend, PHPNG)</i> <br>  I‚Äôll talk about PHP-7.0 internals, upcoming changes in PHP-7.1, and plans for PHP-7.2. <br><br>  - <b>How Badoo switched to PHP7 and saved $ 1M</b> <br>  <i>Yuri Nasretdinov</i> <br>  We did it!  Several hundred of our application servers are translated to PHP7 and are doing great.  As far as we know, this is the second transition to a PHP7 project of this magnitude (after Etsy).  In the process, we found some very unpleasant bugs in the PHP7 bytecode caching system, but they were fixed.  And now - hurray!  - Good news for the entire PHP community: PHP7 is really ready for production, stable, consumes much less memory and gives a very good performance boost.  I will tell you how we switched to PHP7, what difficulties we faced, how we struggled with them and what results we got. <br><br>  - <b>Creating extensions for PHP using Zephir.</b> <br>  <i>Victor Bolshov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/crocodile2u/" class="user_link">crocodile2u</a></i> <br>  Zephir is a high-level PL, designed specifically for creating PHP extensions (extensions).  The code written in Zephir is translated to C using the internal API for PHP extensions, and can be assembled as its object-oriented extension.  This can be extremely useful for optimizing the bottlenecks of your code: you can accelerate intensive calculations at times. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - <b>Using geolocation in badoo</b> <br>  <i>Andrey Volikov</i> <br>  Features of work with geographic coordinates <br>  How to mine and process billions of coordinates per day, what problems await you <br>  What tasks are solved in badoo using geolocation <br>  How we built the user intersection system <br><br>  - <b>Security: from basic principles to PHP features</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Makarov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/samdark/" class="user_link">samdark</a></i> <br>  While doing a code review of various projects, I repeatedly noticed the same security problems despite the fact that the projects were implemented by experienced teams.  It motivated me to talk about security.  Start with general principles, go deeper into PHP features and go through typical environment setup errors. <br><br>  - <b>Hack - The Next Generation of PHP Language</b> <br>  <i>Alexander Kalendarev <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/akalend/" class="user_link">akalend</a></i> <br>  Many people know the HHVM technology from Facebook, which has been discussed at various Conferences more than once, but so far not everyone is ready to go to it.  But, if you have conceived to use the HHVM technology in your new project, then it may make sense to switch to the next generation language - Hack.  Hack is PHP, but simpler, more efficient, more concise. <br>  Intended audience: WEB / PHP programmers, developers of projects demanding to calculations and loads, or simply wishing to learn the benefits of a new language, compare it with PHP7. <br><br>  - <b>ACL in ERP / CRM systems: architecture and implementation on a specific example</b> <br>  <i>Evgeny Kuzovlev</i> <br>  Systems with selective access - where are they, how do they differ from each other?  What are access control system architectures?  When does each of them apply?  Why is it not enough for the complex, multifunctional systems to use the simple principle ‚Äúallowed - prohibited‚Äù?  How to make a complex access control system easy to manage?  I will tell all this on the example of a specific implemented medical information system (yes, these are also sometimes written in PHP :) <br><br>  - <b>SOLID principles with examples in PHP</b> <br>  <i>Andrey Nester</i> <br>  Many developers have heard of SOLID principles, but few follow them. <br>  In my report, I would like to tell "just about the complex" - how, when and why to use the SOLID principles correctly.  I will back up my arguments with examples of PHP code. <br><br>  - <b>Development of real-time application on the example of KarmaBot</b> <br>  <i>Kirill Nesmeyanov <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/serafimarts/" class="user_link">SerafimArts</a></i> <br>  The history of this bot began in the 2014th year, when the Russian-speaking community Laravel, as it is now, was just emerging.  During its existence, quite a lot of time has passed, the core has been constantly changing and improving.  And the way it was basically a fan project - we were not afraid to experiment on it. <br><br>  In this report, I want to tell the story of the appearance, the moments that are worth paying attention to when developing demons in PHP, those approaches and ideas that did not justify themselves and vice versa - what you should pay special attention to.  And how do we get to the point that the bot now lives in the drupal.ru and dru-io, yiiframework, symfony and other chat rooms. <br><br>  - <b>ATMan or advanced use of Composer for those who want more.</b> <br>  <i>Vladislav Karpenko</i> <br>  Problems of conveyor projects, which are moving into the stage of active support, implies the need to use application frameworks and keep them up to date.  To solve this and other problems when developing our applications, we created ATMan - Advansed Template Manager.  We took Composer, a proven dependency management manager, as the basis.  Expanding its functionality (how to do this, we will tell in our report) we get a handy tool for initializing and maintaining the current state of the framework in applications <br><br>  - <b>Drupal 8: Now with symfony taste</b> <br>  <i>Katya <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kalabro/" class="user_link">Marshalkina kalabro</a></i> <br>  At the end of 2015, Drupal moved from a dashing era of global variables and associative arrays to the era of modern PHP frameworks.  Without backward compatibility.  Leaving a whole layer of Edwards webmasters ‚ÄúHands-print_r‚Äù for the second year, to teach the hardware.  Here you are not WordPress! <br><br>  In many ways, this was done in order to lower the threshold of entry to the drupal for those guys who think in terms of modern frameworks. <br><br>  Come to the report to find out what the new Drupal 8 is like as a web development framework. <br><br>  - <b>API - I'll tell you where the rakes are scattered</b> <br>  <i>Mikhail Konyukhov</i> <br>  A story about where the rakes, mines and stretch marks lie in the life of the API - starting with the statement of the problem, ending with its many years of support.  Read more <br><br>  - <b>Flexible modular architecture of SaaS platforms on Yii2</b> <br>  <i>Victor Pikayev</i> <br>  When developing SaaS platforms, it is very important to achieve a flexible and easily changeable architecture.  Many believe that Yii2 is not suitable for this task.  But it is not so! <br><br>  I will talk about how to build a flexible modular REST server architecture that is easy to change and supplement.  When for each user you can easily add a custom version of a module.  How to keep modules loosely coupled.  And how to implement such an approach in an existing project.  How this approach will help prepare your SaaS service for easy customization. <br><br>  Consider the problems faced by someone who wants to write completely isolated and self-sufficient modules on Yii2.  And how to solve these problems. <br><br> <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/offers/php"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4dd/207/bc4/4dd207bc40f8451d92b3adc50d03d69a.png" align="left"></a>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/offers/php"><b>Voting will last until May 31, your vote is important!</b></a> <br><br>  Organizers of the developer community conference: <a href="http://moscowpython.ru/">MoscowPython.ru</a> , <a href="http://phpclub.ru/">PHPClub.ru</a> , <a href="http://railsclub.ru/">RailsClub.ru</a> , <a href="http://moscowjs.ru/">MoscowJs.ru</a> , <br><br>  Partners in 2016 were: <b>TASS, Badoo, Postgres Professional, ItSoft, Sesmik CMS</b> <br><br>  <b>News and discounts on participation in our channel <a href="https://telegram.me/devconf_ru">@devconf_ru</a> in Telegram</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://devconf.ru/ru/members/members"><b>See you at DevConf 2016 on June 17 in Skolkovo!</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301806/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301806/</a></p>
