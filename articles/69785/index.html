  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Beeline Kamaz for 5 million?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When in one small point on the map a hundred thousand crowd gathers, you need an eye and an eye, otherwise you will get more trouble.  So, our law enforcement officers, about whose valor legends walk, have to come there and watch with their keen eyes that everything is good.  Yes, and doctors do not stand aside: these wonderful people in white coats make up a company of gentlemen in gray uniform in case someone suddenly doesn‚Äôt feel too good.  But this is only the tip of the iceberg!  In fact, at events similar to the reconstruction of the Battle of Borodino, which took place on September 6, a hundred kilometers from Moscow, there are thousands of other people doing a lot of different useful things so that everyone who came there to rest would be as comfortable as possible.  In their ranks one could also meet two people in black and yellow jackets on a white Kamaz worth five million rubles. <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8d/b7a/f8e/d8db7af8e36005732135736f9206cb0a.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Aside from the main festivities, in the open field, the two placed the first and so far the only mobile base station in Russia, providing up to 200 additional voice communication channels in crowded places at one time.  People passing by could hardly have guessed about the appointment of a truck with a 17-meter mast growing out of it, and only those who cruised very close could notice the Beeline company emblems on its sides and say thoughtfully: ‚ÄúOh, that's why I have such a good reception!‚Äù <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4d7/70d/c00/4d770dc0020d5192fb7e38ca92ab0725.jpg"><br>  Strictly speaking, the money mentioned is, of course, not the KAMAZ itself (for reference: a brand new KAMAZ costs about 1 million rubles), and not even a hefty white container behind the cabin, but what is inside it: racks with Ericsson and Alcatel communication equipment as well as antennas growing out of the roof. <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f57/d8e/601/f57d8e60143ae2eaaadf29d63f8ab131.jpg"><br>  From the ‚Äúmarching‚Äù state to the working MBS, it can move approximately in an hour: hydraulic stops are pushed to the sides, the chassis is leveled, then the integration of the brought equipment and the existing network begins.  The choice of the method of communication depends entirely on the conditions in which the high-tech KamAZ found itself: automation can be directed and set up data transmission via satellite, via a relay antenna, or even with a laser.  True, the maximum distance at which you can effectively use a laser is about one and a half kilometers. <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87d/af5/db7/87daf5db744a21e855c24d2d561b88ea.jpg"><br>  Naturally, to ensure uninterrupted communication on 200 voice lines at the same time, quite a lot of energy is needed, and therefore the mobile base station operators are first looking for a local source of electricity.  But even if it cannot be found, they do not grieve for a long time, since a diesel generator is installed on the MBS, and there is a 700 liter canister with diesel fuel next to it, and the Kamaz tanks are also not 95th gasoline, so the time is autonomous The work of such a station reaches two weeks, or even more.  Here we are already talking about how much the crew will endure: although there are two sleeping places, they are designed more for short periods of time. <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/677/5b3/50c/6775b350cf91c0feedf5fe42db5efc8a.jpg"><br>  The question is, why am I telling you this a second time if the presentation of the same mobile base station took place last year?  The fact is that only then her tests were carried out, and various permits were obtained.  And now it is already a fully functional sample, having visited several ‚Äúhot spots‚Äù. <br><img width="525" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/554/86a/864/55486a86406f532a5d72869d29af3bff.jpg"><br>  Is it difficult to say whether to wait for a response from other operators to commissioning Beeline‚Äôs first MBS?  MTS did not declare anything of the kind, and in Megafon they generally consider such developments unpromising.  But the fact remains: at the last holiday, the yellow-striped subscribers felt the most mobile, happily telling others about the presence of reliable reception and the absence of network failures. <br><br>  <i>UPD: Before each departure of the IBS, a long coordination with the authorities is carried out, permits, etc., are obtained as if it were a fixed station.</i> <br><br>  <i>UPD2: Here are the photos that requested.</i>  <i>The power mechanism of the hydraulic mast, can withstand loads up to 30 tons.</i>  <i>On the right of the photo is a 200-liter tank with hydraulic fluid.</i>  <i>To the question ‚ÄúWhat is happening to her in the winter?‚Äù They answered that it was becoming a little more viscous, but there was still no need for heating.</i>  <i>In the center - the drum, which is manually wound cable when the mast is lowered.</i> <br><img width="1000" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/490/4b1/d60/4904b1d60c534540e561dcd98f19dcd3.jpg"><br>  Unfortunately, there were no photos of the hospital bed.  But I found a snapshot of the air conditioner that hangs over it. <br><img width="1000" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1cd/fa7/f89/1cdfa7f89b42101df1ceea716f587dbd.jpg">
