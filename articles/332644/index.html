  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tandem office and mobile telephony. How we developed FMC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  FMC (fixed mobile convergence) is a new technological solution at the junction of different types of communication networks: fixed and mobile.  With its help, any organization can create a single network of office and mobile phones with an overall plan of short numbering.  The technology makes it possible to call up directly for short internal numbers to employees outside offices in different regions of the country or the world without using a real PBX. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Using FMC in a company leads to simplified business processes of organizations, coupled with the ability to optimize costs.  According to preliminary calculations, the savings on one SIM-card will be up to 30% due to the reduction of dial-up time and low IP-telephony rates. <br><br>  Of the additional opportunities for organizations, it is worth noting the ability to set different rules for handling calls inside the workplace and record incoming and outgoing calls from mobile and landline phones.  Thus, all the problems that arise in the organization when using corporate tariffs for mobile communications and office PBX are removed. <br><br><h2>  FMC in MTT Business </h2><br>  The FMC project is an additional method for receiving and initiating voice calls from the Virtual PBX.  This happens without using the Internet, only through GSM radio channels.  At the same time, FMC is a part of the Virtual PBX service and is not connected outside of it.  FMC is also provided only using the MTT SIM associated with the Virtual PBX.

      FMC includes all the functions of a virtual PBX for the city and mobile phones of the company, without requiring an Internet connection.  For the client, connecting to the FMC service means accessing the opportunity to start a new workplace of type VATS - SIM FMC.  In the administrator‚Äôs personal account it becomes possible to specify the SIM FMC as one of the options for dialing to the subscriber. <br><br>  Mobile Internet is available to the subscriber immediately after registration in the network of the cellular operator and activation in the Virtual PBX, while on a limited list of sites, such as mtt.ru, business.mtt.ru, etc.  without billing.  Mobile Internet with no speed limit is possible to connect exclusively with packages. <br><br><h2>  Business API </h2><br>  The following infrastructure elements of the MTT company participated in the implementation of the SIM Card (FMC): <br><br><ul><li>  Billing platform - for billing calls. </li><li>  WebAPI - for the implementation of the functions for connecting the number and provisioning on the mobile component of the network. </li><li>  BusinessAPI - in part of the implementation of the business logic of connecting / managing services. </li><li>  Infrastructure elements of the mobile network (SRF, STP, etc.). </li></ul><br><h2>  Service implementation scheme at the Business-API level </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/176/8d6/51c/1768d651ca924b998c1fa4ebd64b83b3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  For FMC, it was necessary to refine the Business-API.  In particular, the following functions were added to the API: <br><br><ul><li>  receiving the price for the FMC service; </li><li>  receive a list of tariffs for FMC numbers (for selection); </li><li>  receiving the price according to the tariff; </li><li>  add / remove FMC services; </li><li>  add / delete / change FMC number to the VATS client; </li><li>  get a list of FMC numbers (with activation status). </li></ul><br>  Workplace was also transformed into a collection of entities - WPsi (sip_id), WPsf (softphone), WPsim (FMC).  In the future, other types of jobs will be added, which will provide flexibility in setting up redirects and adding new types.  To separate workplace entities, the type parameter is added to the structure, which can take values ‚Äã‚Äã- sip, softphone, sim (hereinafter other types). <br><br>  For the possibility of combining entities into groups for parallel and mixed types of redirection, the wp_group type was introduced, which is a grouping structure within the workplace. <br><br>  To connect DEF numbers, the existing number connection functions and the installation of the designated number are used.  When introducing DEF numbers into MTT-Business as part of the FMC project, they are not registered directly on the SIM cards, but simply act as an identifier for outgoing calls and they will also be used to redirect incoming calls to the appropriate employees or groups. <br><br>  In the Business-API, a function is added to generate a verification code and assign it to a specific drug.  Generation and verification of the code is carried out through the client‚Äôs personal account, as well as via SMS messages. <br><br><h2>  Scheme of service implementation at the mobile component level </h2><br>  In order to enable SIM FMC as one of the dial-up options to the subscriber in the administrator‚Äôs personal account, improvements have been made on the Business-API, WebAPI, MTT-Business portal and the equipment on the mobile network has been configured. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d0f/009/9d8/d0f0099d84694f8681f3bd217b78c0b2.jpg"><br><h2>  HLR Provisioning Improvements </h2><br>  Procedures for replacing the number, blocking, as well as for organizing the incoming communication of customers required further development of the following functions: <br><br><ul><li>  regarding the transfer of unconditional call forwarding parameters by communication of a mobile number and the number of a Virtual PBX; </li><li>  in terms of removing information from the HLR about the bundle. </li></ul><br>  In the future, it is intended to use the HLR-API to manage all information management procedures in the HLR. <br><br><h2>  Voice Call Scenarios </h2><br>  Call flow scenarios are presented in the diagrams: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f19/0e8/146/f190e8146cd04730bae975e63382505a.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/588/61d/0b5/58861d0b56774ffc9f85216cee339d3c.jpg"><h2>  The competitive advantages of FMC "MTT Business"? </h2><br>  The basic FMC package from MTT Business includes a number of free services: <br><br><ul><li>  Free delivery of the required number of SIM cards to the office or to the specified address; </li><li>  no subscription fee for the FMC service as a whole, or for the use of each SIM card; </li><li>  1GB of mobile Internet as a gift and free mobile Internet in roaming; </li><li>  free communication between employees within the corporate Virtual PBX; </li><li>  Free incoming calls in the home zone FMC services. </li></ul><br>  At the moment, a single home roaming zone FMC "MTT Business" includes Moscow, St. Petersburg and the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcapitals.  However, by the end of 2017, the following cities and regions will be included in the geography of the FMC ‚ÄúMTT Business‚Äù presence: <br><br><ul><li>  Ekaterinburg and the region; </li><li>  Novosibirsk and the region; </li><li>  Rostov-on-Don and the region; </li><li>  Krasnodar and the region; </li><li>  Nizhny Novgorod and the region. </li></ul><br>  Over time, we plan to deploy a single home zone FMC "MTT Business" throughout Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332644/</a></p>
