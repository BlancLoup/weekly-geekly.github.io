  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yota for business - commercial launch</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since yesterday, Yota has been offering its Internet access services through its 4G (Mobile WiMAX) network for money.  This applies only to corporate users.  For individuals, services are still free until May 31. <br><br>  Network Features: <br>  - speed up to 10 Mbit / s <br>  - roaming-free space in all cities of coverage (while there are two of them - Moscow, St. Petersburg) <br>  - maintaining the connection when driving at speeds up to 120 km / h <br><br>  For business users, <b>QoS and a traffic prioritization system</b> are also used. <br>  This technology allows video conferencing, video calls, video broadcasting. <br>  An important factor - a high level of security and protection against unauthorized access in Mobile WiMAX networks (unlike Wi-Fi networks) is achieved through the use of mutual authentication, data encryption, periodic change of the encryption key and information integrity control.

      Reliability is also provided by the company itself, which conducts round-the-clock monitoring of the quality of the network and, having its own contact center, guarantees customers technical support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. <br><br>  The <b>Yota for Business</b> package includes: <br><a name="habracut"></a>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúMobile employee‚Äù - a solution for organizing mobile high-speed access to the Internet and corporate resources for employees and managers, often working outside the office.  At any point of the Yota network coverage area, employees can quickly exchange data with the head office, as well as among themselves, including sending there photo and video images;  to work fully in corporate information systems and update data there;  show customers "heavy" applications deployed in the head office;  conduct joint remote work on presentations;  make video calls and conduct video conferences. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúOffice Internet‚Äù is a solution for fast, not requiring any coordination and capital costs, connecting the office to wireless 4G-Internet.  This is a real alternative to wired broadband access.  For frequently relocating subscribers, the solution allows you to create a local network with high-speed Internet and IP-telephony, which is transported along with itself with the preservation of telephone numbers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCorporate networks‚Äù is a decision to create a distributed corporate network based on the Yota infrastructure of a company that will have a high level of flexibility, scalability and security. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúMobile telemetry‚Äù - a solution for connecting remote objects via secure wireless access to a single technological network, which is used to collect data and monitor the status of remote objects.  This solution will allow banks to launch new services through an ATM network (video monitoring, interactive advertising, etc.).  Advertising agencies can quickly update ad units on their displays and add interactivity to advertisements.  Operating companies - monitor the status of remote objects and change the parameters of their work.  The solution can be used to integrate cameras, traffic lights, information monitors and other objects of urban infrastructure in networks that require reliable and high-speed data transmission channels. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAutomotive office‚Äù - a solution for equipping a mobile office in a car.  This office allows you to conduct video conferences on the go, news from mobile video and radio studios to broadcast live from anywhere in the Yota coverage area.  The solution can be used to provide passengers of business taxis and corporate buses with Internet access;  in cars of emergency and rescue services - for videoconferences with the operational headquarters;  in ambulances - to organize telemedicine sessions. <br><br>  Now on the market there are all kinds of subscriber 4G devices: <b>USB modems, Express-cards, HTC MAX 4G phones, laptops with integrated support for Mobile WiMAX, Mobile WiMAX / Wi-Fi Center routers</b> (will appear in April). <br><br>  In the corporate market, Yota uses an affiliate business model. <br><br>  For corporate services, a flexible <b>tariff plan has been</b> developed: from 1,000 to 1,400 rubles.  per month for personal access devices, depending on the number of connected devices, and 2,700 rubles.  per month for shared devices (routers). <br>  All tariffs are unlimited.  This is a fundamental point. <br><br>  As the Yota network statistics show, <b>the traffic volume</b> in Moscow is now <b>38 TB per week</b> and 36 TB per week in St. Petersburg.  Thus, in aggregate, around 300 TB per month is pumped through the entire network.  This is more than in all Russian 3G networks (according to ComNews Research, in the 4th quarter of 2008 the volume of traffic in all Russian 3G networks of CDMA and UMTS standards was 648 TB, that is, slightly more than 200 TB per month). <br><br>  One of the first corporate customers of Yota was the St. Petersburg company First Popular Television (PTV).  The business scenario of using ‚ÄúYota for business‚Äù solutions in her case is as follows: PTV equips the salons of 1,100 route taxis and buses in St. Petersburg with television screens on which commercials are broadcast to passengers.  For remote loading of clips are used Yota network channels and 4G modems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56251/</a></p>
