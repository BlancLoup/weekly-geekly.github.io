Let's try to go back and continue with the submission of the article on LifeHacker.ru - <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2008/07/17/rasprostranjonnye-oshibki-prohozhdjashhih-intervju-po-trudoustrojjstvu/">Common mistakes made during job interviews</a> . <br><br>  So bad advice when passing an interview when finding a job at work or ‚ÄúWell, don‚Äôt take me please‚Äù (text from LifeHacker.ru with my minor changes - I hope they will not be offended, plus some of my additions): <br><ul><li>  <strong>Never get ready</strong> <br>  You know that the interview is already next week, and you like the job offered, but you don‚Äôt even think about getting ready, learning some facts about the company or learning other things related to this job.  Why, you also have the knowledge and experience, right? </li><li>  <strong>Tune in to ‚ÄúI don't care.‚Äù</strong> <br>  Come to the interview sloppily dressed, forget the documents that you were asked to capture, radiate a self-confident conviction that only this work suits you.  Do not strain when answering questions from HR specialists - why? </li><li>  <strong>Be aggressive</strong> <br>  When the interviewer decides to test your patience by asking boring and irrelevant questions - do not even think about enduring.  Instead of polite answers go to the brutal manner of speech and skirmish. </li><li>  <strong>Beg</strong> <br>  Call for help emotions and beg you to take, reinforcing it with as much personal details as possible. </li><li>  <strong>Tell nasty things about the past chief</strong> <br>  Expand everything and do not regret black colors when you paint your previous work and boss in response to a question about the reason for finding a job. </li><li>  <strong>Speak only about money</strong> <br>  Pointing out the reason for the search, do not even think to mention anything other than money. </li><li>  <strong>Do not ask questions and be silent until they ask you</strong> <br>  Otherwise, the employer himself will be forced to feel like on the exam, that he clearly does not like </li><li>  <strong>No certificates, diplomas</strong> <br>  Why bother an employer with information about your knowledge - he may feel more stupid than you and will behave more aggressively. </li><li>  <strong>Do not come to the interview earlier or on time.</strong> <br>  Let the employer not feel that you are ready for everything at once.  After all, they need you as a potential employee - wait! </li><li>  <strong>No office</strong> <br>  In the end, if a firm is solid you will be given a pen and a piece of paper, otherwise you should not go to such a company. </li><li>  <strong>Do not make an appointment in advance.</strong> <br>  Just come to the office and say - "Here I am!".  Require a meeting immediately with the head of the unit where you plan to work.  Why do you need a meeting with the personnel manager? </li><li>  <strong>Perspectives</strong> <br>  There is no talk about prospects, otherwise your potential boss will immediately think that you want to ‚Äúhook him up‚Äù - no one needs competition. </li><li>  <strong>Company plans and you in these plans</strong> <br>  Do not even ask about them, why do you need to know what you are going to do, what projects the company is working on now - they take it - it means it‚Äôs necessary. </li><li>  <strong>Wage</strong> <br>  Do not even ask white or black - nobody will tell about black anyway.  Bonuses also do not discuss - which is not in the contract - that is not in nature.  And never discuss the timing of its increase - because you have not done anything for the company. </li><li>  <strong>Social issues</strong> <br>  Do not even try to ask them - you are not going to the institute of noble maidens.  All social issues should be solved at the expense of your salary - think about it right away! </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://blog.petrusha.name/2008/07/17/kak-ne-projti-intervyu-pri-trudoustrojstve/">Cross post</a> from my blog. </div>
