We are adults - let's get and measure!  So, without delaying the idea indefinitely, we set clear goals - to create HabrUp in 48 hours, able to attract the attention of a million people and, of course, withstand the load and make a profit. <br><br>  Only in this way can I convincingly demonstrate the ease and applicability of Go language for creating Web projects.

      Here I have two legitimate questions: <br>  1. And if I‚Äôm not the smart-ass <a href="http://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2588">Boris Razor</a> , who wants to promote a new startup in this way? <br>  2. Is it a home billet that has long been waiting for its turn in the bins? <br><br>  For the answers to these questions and the essence of the project, if you please, under the cat, respectable colleagues! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Hollywood smile or hungry grin of capitalism? </h4><br>  Alas, I see no way to dissuade you of this, although there is one small idea.  Any of the readers / writers can offer their idea to ‚ÄúHabrApa‚Äù and I will implement it in life during the ‚Äúother 48 hours‚Äù.  But there is a nuance - since such an incredulous person will suspect me of self-interest, then I will not disappoint him.  That is, the idea should bring at least 1 million rubles within two months. <br><br><h4>  Gold for party </h4><br>  Why such a sum?  Here we come to the second interesting point.  The Pirate Party, to whose creation I once venerated, is trying to raise one million rubles, which is necessary for official registration.  You can relate to this as you please, and I am ready to support this initiative just for fun. <br><br><h4>  Other opportunities to cause good </h4><br>  Well, if someone is completely against the pirates, then we will give half to St. Petersburg animal shelter Rzhevka.  If the seals are disgusting to someone, I don‚Äôt even want to talk to such people.  Fu Fu Fu :) <br><br>  Details can be discussed later. Why is it too early to share the skin of an unkilled bear?  Again, I flout the presumption of innocence with such a lengthy tirade, for no one can doubt it.  But I could not write a disclaimer. <br><br><h4>  Coitus, ergo sum </h4><br>  And the last argument in his defense.  It is easy to see that my tongue is suspended, okay, and there is no sawdust in my head.  Immodest, but true.  Ergo, I do not need to "promote" in such a sophisticated way on the verge of a foul.  In general, I would prefer to remain anonymous as much as possible. <br><br>  Those who remain faithful to the conviction in the production of this action, I sincerely wish to relax and try to enjoy at least the show :) <br><br><h4>  Ridiculous ofGovorka </h4><br>  Got carried away?  Sorry.  I have such a gambling nature.  I solemnly promise in the face of my comrades and on pain of weaning from the Pastafarian church that this is the last post in the series with an abundance of water.  Although I would call it not water, but oil poured into the fire for more excitement :) <br><br><h4>  Town of the City </h4><br>  No, we will not create another clone of the Farm Frenzy, by altering it into a simulator controlling a lunopark with blackjack and representatives of the oldest profession.  Although ... Recorded and postponed. <br><br><h4>  Chase, chase, chase ... </h4><br>  The absentee monologue has one drawback - it is difficult to imagine the reaction of the audience.  Therefore, I imagine that you still believed me.  So, from the writing of the first part of the article to this afternoon, I dug.  Kopal in Runet, in search of finding a small, but gaping hole, suitable for squeezing Habrapchik, occasionally being distracted by stimulants in the form of horse doses of coffee (according to the style of presentation, probably noticeable) and light reading.  Looking for updates on <a href="http://a-nikonov.livejournal.com/">Nikonov‚Äôs</a> blog (I‚Äôve been closely following his publications on Pussy Riot and anti-clerical activities), his eyes rested on the eleventh line advertising the book ‚ÄúUpgrade Monkey‚Äù under the new name ‚ÄúCrown of Creation‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  ... hot blood </h4><br>  Bang  There is a contact.  In fact, it is very difficult to describe the logical chain that leads to Implementation from random Inspiration.  By the way, this was a good book in the Soviet adolescence "From idea to model".  If you are interested in the chain and methods of finding ideas, ask - I will answer. <br><br>  Something snapped in my head and I habitually said ‚ÄúHomo Sapiens, damn it.  The crown of creation, pancake.  But he spoke with an error, since the ‚Äúsecond core‚Äù was occupied by tormenting labor contractions.  It turned out - "User Sapiens".  And I liked the little word so much that it began to unravel into a concept. <br><br><h4>  ... there is a Golden City ... </h4><br>  Here we sit here with you, everyone is so smart and beautiful, and somewhere there, in the distant and not very remote place - simple mortals live - users.  And they live, it should be noted, very badly.  That virus will pick up, then stumble on a scam.  And since I recently read KMB (p) for mon papa and for parents of mon amour, the thought of a charity project - ‚ÄúUpgrade‚Äù User Defaultus to the state of User Sapiens arose.  Well, at least hold them to Habilis.  And if not us, then who?  All around help children, trying to protect them from the corrupting influence of evil network pedobirov, and who will take care of our parents, who just as naively send SMS-messages and fall for the bait of Nigerian princes? <br><br>  But some parents will not be enough to create a resonance and attract the necessary HighLoad.  Consequently, it is necessary to expand the circle to all users, including those who are starting their evolutionary path, who are just throwing away the tails of twos in algebra.  Will such a project be in demand?  I am sure about 75%. It is enough to season with a little glaze and polish to a shine to make a <i>cake</i> .  This task, by the way, goes beyond the articles, but you can also participate and follow the birth, maturation and inevitable death of the project (with a probability close to 100%, I will still abandon this project after reaching the goal). <br><br><h4>  Go, Johnny, Go! </h4><br>  Let's return to Go and its application for an objective.  So, for a freshly thought-out (see above and below) project, I will use Go, only Go, and nothing but Go.  Thus, I will demonstrate that this language is applicable for fastdeva no worse than Python / Django or Ruby / Rails.  But I will give you the rigidity of the rules of the game.  There are two options for implementation.  Either I do not use any third-party libraries and projects on the server side of the project (except Nginx on the frontend), that is, I use only standard libraries, or we will still be reasonable people and allow ourselves to use ready-made Mongo, Redis and other third-party packages instead of inventing bicycles .  While the venerable public will think about how best to arrange for me the Procrustean bed, at this time I will be engaged in content, drawing and creating the client part of the project. <br><br><h4>  Show must Go on </h4><br>  Everything, I bow out to morph into a dry and pedantic grumbler, setting forth the essence. <br><br><h4>  Updated on 04/06/2012 </h4><br>  I was asked to create a promotional website and support one good event. <br>  The problem is that this project will not be able, alas, to attract an audience sufficient to conduct testing HighLoad. <br><br>  In this regard, the possible delay of the experiment and articles for a couple of days. <br>  Thank you for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141494/</a></p>
