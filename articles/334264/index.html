  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We read, listen, use. Guide on the sources for the development of Android-developer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of weeks ago, I published a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/333348/">development roadmap for iOS developers</a> .  Now, as promised, - a similar selection of resources for those who work with Android.  The important point is that there are many different sources, but I chose the ones that I constantly read myself, and what I find useful.  So, regular mailings, blogs (personal, collective and in video format), podcasts, live chat rooms in Russian, telegram channels and fire events are all here, under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/334264/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/eb2/608/232/eb2608232ef24b8581549656ba37fd11.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Blogs </h3><br>  <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/"><b>Android Developers Blog</b></a> <br>  News from the heart of the Googleplex, warmed up by the California sun. <br><br>  <a href="https://medium.com/google-developers"><b>Google developers</b></a> <br>  Blog on the medium: written for engineers, written by engineers.  Materials are written or supervised by Google employees, but this is not the company's voice, as one might think, but personal opinions of specialists.  Google developers already read 30,000 subscribers from around the world.
