We all know, most people never change the default program settings - they can't or don‚Äôt want to bother and the browser is no exception, so set your search as a priority (with the knowledge of or without it) often means to get another unsuspecting soul into your <s>diabolical</s> networks.  And if you install a user browser that is already properly configured, then ... the dream is right!  With the advent of the open project Chromium, the dreams of many web service providers have become a reality, and its assemblies began to appear like mushrooms after rain. <br><br>  I have never used a single Chromium assembly except Chrome itself and the new Opera, but I recently discerned curiosity: what can be done there and should I pay attention to it or is it just a continuation of the glorious work of Denis Popov?  Said and done, I rummaged through the Web and selected participants for review.  I considered only Russian assemblies and only from large web service providers, because otherwise, I would not have enough for my review and life. <br><br>  Interesting?  Then let's get started.

      Under the cut a lot of screenshots, the total amount of ~ 3 mb. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today in the program: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://welcome.qip.ru/surf">QIP Surf</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://soft.rambler.ru/">Rambler browser (aka Nichrome)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://browsers.ucoz.ru/">Ucoz uran</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://s1.amigo.mail.ru/">Amigo from Mail.ru</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://browser.yandex.ru/desktop">Yandex browser</a> </li></ul><br>  I installed all tested assemblies on a clean Windows 7 Home Basic x86, in VirtualBox, with default settings.  I did not consider other platforms for a banal reason: almost all survey participants exist only for the desktop and only for Windows. <br><br><h3>  So, number one is QIP's Surf browser. </h3><br><blockquote>  QIP Surf is a free web browsing application.  A convenient and simple browser will make your work on the Internet safe and secure. </blockquote>  Well, let's see.  Download the installation file, run, and <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/469/3e3/279/4693e32791604b3590508550be5659cd.png"><br><br>  The installer tried to download Adobe Flash 11 (!), But it did not work.  Well, it does not matter, we will live without flash.  After clicking the "Cancel" button, the browser is safely installed, we look further.  The QIP Surf interface looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/263/f01/91f263f013d74991b8e7ba27e24ab557.png"><br><br>  Chrome, like chrome, nothing special.  Just to the right of the address bar are a few icons of the preset extensions.  The list of extensions themselves is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f54/d85/546/f54d85546ed44188b570aecabd71267e.png"><br><br>  Click "More extensions", go to the Google Chrome extension store and there ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/067/132/ee7/067132ee7a224f909e0895d703f8b020.png"><br><br>  Unpleasant  By the way, what version of the product do we have?  We look at the window "About the program": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aac/8f4/d79/aac8f4d79814489bae7928cb35150165.png"><br><br>  User-agent string: <pre><code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Mozilla</span></span>/5<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Windows</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NT</span></span> 6<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">AppleWebKit</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">KHTML</span></span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">like</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Gecko</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Chrome</span></span>/27<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.14</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1453</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.94</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Safari</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span></code> </pre>  It turns out that the browser is built on the basis of Chromium from July 2012!  It is not cheerful.  According to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5_Chromium">Wikipedia,</a> it is in active development, but judging by what I see, it has not been updated for the third year - it seems to me that it‚Äôs unfair to the user to offer on the main page of your project.  Also: it‚Äôs impossible to identify this browser by User-Agent, for example, a UA-string from fresh Chrome: <pre> <code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Mozilla</span></span>/5<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Windows</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NT</span></span> 6<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">AppleWebKit</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">KHTML</span></span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">like</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Gecko</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Chrome</span></span>/41<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.2272</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.76</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Safari</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  On other features: the browser in a freshly installed form takes 98 MB, the default search is qip search.  To the credit of the developers, I didn‚Äôt try to push the build, except for Flash, didn‚Äôt get into autoloading and didn‚Äôt get into the default browser without demand - a rarity in our alarming times.  In addition, I did not come across software that I would try to install along with Surf, including the QIP IM client (maybe I was just looking bad), it seems to me that the chance that this browser gets on the PC to the average housewife is minimal, and this is good, given the engine is not the first freshness, the vulnerability of which no one is going to close. <br><br><h3>  The next in turn is our browser Uran </h3><br><blockquote>  Uran browser has several advantages compared with other browsers.  Install our browser and see for yourself! </blockquote><br>  We all know the platform for the free creation and hosting of Ucoz sites, many people have negative emotions towards it, but this is not a conversation now.  If you go to any site hosted on Ucoz and not using a paid hosting rate, we will see ads in its right corner (AdBlock users pass by) and a button offering to disable this advertisement.  If you click on it, we will see the following window: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/459/371/2f64593714f0404e8b39c12393e41ea0.png"><br><br>  The browser is installed without problems, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8d/b7d/6e4/a8db7d6e45844310b74b46c832e31d04.png"><br><br>  Here the differences from Chrome are even smaller.  About the "browser without ads" is true only in part - it is not only on Ucoz sites, but nothing prevents you from installing AdBlock, since the version of the engine allows.  By the way, this is the only reviewer in question today who openly calls himself ‚ÄúChromium assembly‚Äù - the rest bashfully hide this information in the ‚ÄúAbout the program‚Äù window.  By the way, here it is: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/011/d48/afa/011d48afa8514fb084ab073007ba6f29.png"><br><br>  User-agent string: <pre> <code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Mozilla</span></span>/5<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Windows</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NT</span></span> 6<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">AppleWebKit</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">KHTML</span></span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">like</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Gecko</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Chrome</span></span>/35<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1916</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.153</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Safari</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">u01-04</span></span></code> </pre>  Already better, although Chromium, too, "with a dandy," dates back to May 2014.  Pre-installed extensions: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ed/d20/bdc/0edd20bdc57a4ac484f1e3ab97473c63.png"><br>  More extensions can be installed from the online store Google Chrome.  About other features: like the previous browser in question, Uran does not try to drag the left software with it, does not create unnecessary shortcuts, and only ‚ÄúuCozMedia UranUpdate‚Äù puts it into autoload, but sets itself as the default browser without demand - it‚Äôs ugly, I don‚Äôt like it when are doing.  Search default: Yandex, occupied space after installation: 359 mb. <br><br>  This browser has a narrow niche, it was created for people working with the Ucoz platform, and surely it is claimed by them <s>, otherwise it wouldn‚Äôt have</s> been distributed at all with free software (correct, if not), therefore it‚Äôs also unlikely for the housewife‚Äôs PC will fall, so leave it to those who are interested in it and move on to the list further. <br><br><h3>  Next we have - Rambler browser, he's Nichrome </h3><br><blockquote>  A convenient browser for those who want to always be aware of what is happening in the country and the world, do not miss the latest news and keep your favorite services on hand </blockquote>  I did not find the name ‚ÄúNichrome‚Äù anywhere, although I had heard it exactly before.  Perhaps Rambler refused this name (although it remained in the UA).  It is installed without problems, we look at the appearance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d61/aa1/326/d61aa1326e744ec98c6a20e4542df185.png"><br><br>  Here, unlike the previous browsers, at least have drawn a new theme, similar to the design of the site Rambler.ru.  There are also ‚ÄúRecommendations‚Äù, as in the new Opera, which, as it turned out, are added by the Rambler-Monitor extension (it is present in the Google Chrome store, you can install it in any other Chromium assembly).  All pre-installed extensions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/538/8ba/f89/5388baf891754a84ae6190b9cd2aeb0b.png"><br><br>  New extensions are installed without problems from the Google store.

Like Uran, without asking the user, sets itself as the default browser, it places the application with the poker name ‚ÄúHoldem‚Äù into autoload, which is an automatic update tool.  Superfluous software (except for Adobe Flash 13) and does not create labels.  Every time I single out this moment because I wrote an article under the impression of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247927/">this study</a> , and expected that my poor virtual machine would be littered with a bunch of rubbish, but the first three browsers under consideration pleasantly surprised me.  Immediately after installation Nichrom takes 163 mb.  Benefits?  I do not know, three extensions that are present in this assembly can be installed in Chrome, but if it exists and develops, does it mean that someone needs it?  Let's leave the Rambler browser alone and move on to a more interesting object. <br><br><h3>  Fourth in line - the famous Amigo from Mail.ru </h3><br>  Here I can hear the plaintive crash of mice and armrests of armchairs, compressed by hands of enikeyschik, admins and other ‚Äútyzhprogramists‚Äù reading this article - this browser earned fame louder than all the others combined!  How many times have I personally cleaned it from the cars of my friends and acquaintances I can‚Äôt be counted, deliberately installing it for the first time  Here is what they write about it on the download page: <blockquote>  Browser with social networks </blockquote>  The description is rather scanty, download (oh, horror, I download Amigo!), Install, (your mother, I install Amigo !!!) and ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d59/e0d/49c/d59e0d49c70e4834bca2fb1f2d608efa.png"><br><br>  Damn, where it came from, in the installer there were no checkmarks!  We take a closer look at the download page, and of course: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7d/aca/ffa/d7dacaffa795414fbd62b5dbfd77c2a3.png"><br><br>  It seems he considered himself beaten-broken, but overlooked!  Well, it's my own fault, with the programs from Mail.ru, you need to keep your ears open.  Look at the look of the browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5be/e03/05d/5bee0305da644974bfe21eea7fb534e3.png"><br><br>  The changes are more noticeable than the previous browsers in question, even the main menu button was redrawn and moved, providing the proud signature ‚ÄúAmigo‚Äù.  Strangely enough, there are no pre-installed extensions; all additional features are built at a deeper level, like Opera and Vivaldi, for example.  When I clicked on the letter icon, I thought that the browser had a built-in mail client and was delighted in advance, but when I logged in through the Yandex-mail account, it turned out that he only redirects to <a href="https://e.mail.ru/">https://e.mail.ru /</a> , and you can access it from any browser.  As the developers promised, social networking clients are built into Amigo: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/50f/042/d6350f042ede42689e40e06ad4ea74f1.png"><br>  There is nothing to describe, they are present, and that‚Äôs all.  Maybe someone finds it convenient, probably for housewives for whom the browser was created, this is a plus.  There is also a music player from the social.  networks.  Other features: no matter how much I searched, I couldn‚Äôt find how to change the default search - it‚Äôs naturally there from mail.ru - even if you go to the <s>Orthodox</s> chrome url <a href="http://chrome//settings/searchEngines">chrome: // settings / searchEngines</a> pops up an empty window.  At the same time, if on the site google.ru PCM click on the search bar and select "Add as a search engine ..." then something seems to be added.  If you repeat this procedure, the system swears that such a search is already there, then somewhere the information is saved, but where is the mystery covered in gloom.  Blocking a search engine change is not something ugly, it is a mean act, embarrassing, fellow developers, embarrassing!  In addition to Amigo himself, the following shortcuts are created on the desktop and the quick launch bar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d4/e2d/47b/4d4e2d47bff04063bf8cbf24dbc8cf93.png"><br><br>  Moreover, the labels of VK and Odnoklassniki are also petty: they are not labels of urls, but labels on Amigo with these addresses, i.e.  even if the system has a different browser by default, these shortcuts will open through Amigo.  We look at autoload: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/286/af0/5c3/286af05c39a9449dac72ada1b1706c9c.png"><br><br>  Very well, Amigo also wrote himself down there, why - it is not entirely clear, it is possible to speed up the launch or monitoring of social services.  networks, but you could warn about this?  Even in the settings there is no mention of this!  When I sat down for this article, I tried to be unbiased, but this behavior just kills me!  See the version of the program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/6d7/ba0/b8a6d7ba00f8478bbb18615c4cbb1001.png"><br><br>  User-agent string: <pre> <code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Mozilla</span></span>/5<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Windows</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NT</span></span> 6<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">AppleWebKit</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">KHTML</span></span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">like</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Gecko</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Chrome</span></span>/32<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1709</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.125</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Amigo</span></span>/32<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1709</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.125</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">MRCHROME</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">SOC</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Safari</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span></code> </pre>  The version of Chromium from January 2014, foul for more than a year - haven't they been updated for so long?  And at the beginning of the review, I noted that the biggest work was done on this browser.  Apparently a long time ago and so well that you do not need to update.  In a freshly installed form, the program takes 390 mb. <br>  A brief result: this browser honestly deserves all the self-hatred, it spreads literally with every free software that you can download now from the Web, it shoves its labels to where it is not at all, almost there was no case when I looked at a computer that ‚Äú It is slowing down, ‚Äùand this comrade would not have been there.  The only thing that is good is that I did not find Guard'a mail.ru (or whatever it is called there) and the ‚ÄúSputnik mail.ru‚Äù who were loyal companions of the products from this developer.  I do not know what caused it, but they are not, and that is good. <br><br>  I wondered for a long time whether the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù browser from Mail.ru was included in the review, a cursory google did not show that it was removed from support, and it is still <a href="http://internet.mail.ru/">available for download</a> , but on the download page and in the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù there are copyrights 2013 , Chromium is inside version 28 of it, so I decided that no one needed him anymore, and did not consider him, forgive me lazy. <br><br><h3>  And finally - Yandex Browser </h3><br><blockquote>  Convenient and fast program to work on the Internet </blockquote><br>  I will not mention the humorous name of this browser, given to it because of its logo, because once it cost me you-know-what, when I started arguing about it in the comments to some topic.  And my opponent lost even more, so no, you will see here only the official name.  Download, install, look appearance: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/951/39d/a9c/95139da9c0d842c181834653eee14072.png"><br><br>  It is immediately evident that a lot of work was done on the appearance, it‚Äôs completely unlike the original Chromium.  See the version of the program: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/433/086/ced/433086ced8d246ba88c3f24ce45180be.png"><br><br>  Stock User-agent: <br><br><pre> <code class="css hljs"><span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Mozilla</span></span>/5<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Windows</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">NT</span></span> 6<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.1</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">AppleWebKit</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span> (<span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">KHTML</span></span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">like</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Gecko</span></span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Chrome</span></span>/40<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.0</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.2214</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.115</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">YaBrowser</span></span>/15<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.2</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.2214</span></span><span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.3645</span></span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">Safari</span></span>/537<span class="hljs-selector-class"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.36</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  I will tell you a secret, I started writing a review, the version was Chrome / 38.0.2125.122 YaBrowser / 12/14/2,225,10034, and just before publishing the browser was updated - well done developers, almost keep up with Opera, only one version behind Google Chrome, with than Chrome itself was updated to it only last week.  See installed extensions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/288/5e7/422/2885e7422700415798fc56d5c37fefb8.png"><br><br>  Wow!  It's good that they are all turned off, otherwise I would have cursed loudly.  But once disabled, okay, let them be.  Moreover, if you go along the standard chrome path <a href="http://chrome//extensions/">: chrome: // extensions /</a> , we will see only one extension: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/810/097/383/8100973836034fad883bad9a5b6b99cc.png"><br><br>  There will also be all new extensions installed from the store.  In the main window, shown in the screenshot above, they also appear in the ‚ÄúFrom other sources‚Äù group.  For me, it was a real surprise that the extension store here is not the Chrome catalog, but the Opera is an unexpected decision for me.  But if you go to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions%3Fhl%3Dru">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en</a> , we‚Äôll go to the Chrome extensions directory and from there they are installed without any problems (for reference, you need to install the ‚ÄúDownload Chrome Extension "to repeat this trick).  Next, we look that Ya.B has brought with him to the system: it turned out, only a label on yandex.ru.  Rather, a shortcut to an executable that opens yandex.ru using Yandex.Browser, even if it is not installed, as the default browser is a strange solution, and no less vile than the ones from Mail.ru.  In autoload ‚Äî nothing, in ‚ÄúPrograms and components‚Äù ‚Äîbut the browser itself, no ‚Äúelements‚Äù and ‚Äúbrowser managers‚Äù ‚Äîthanks for that, I did not expect.  Other features: freshly installed application takes 397 MB.  There is a ‚Äúturbo‚Äù mode, as in Opera, <s>and as I understand it, it works through the Opera server (correct, if you made a mistake)</s> Vadim Makeev himself corrected, Yandex servers are used there, but the technology is licensed from the Opera.  It has its own implementation of the Express panel called ‚ÄúScoreboard‚Äù, which also pops up when you click on the address bar: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/1eb/c38/8d21ebc38f8341c394028256633161f1.png"><br><br>  Personally, I still like it more when there are screenshots of pages, but this is not a fan's business, it‚Äôs not for me to judge other people's tastes.  Plus, they also worked on the address bar itself, added copying and sharing functions for urls.  The address there is displayed by default in the format ‚ÄúDomain Header‚Äù (for example, on the page <a href="http://soft.yandex.ru/%3Ffrom%3Dprov_all">http://soft.yandex.ru/?from=prov_all there</a> will be ‚Äúsoft.yandex.ru Yandex.Programs‚Äù).  This approach is disgusting to me, I always prefer to see where I am, but it‚Äôs probably better for housewives, I don‚Äôt presume to judge, the main thing is that you can turn on a normal url, rummaging through the settings.  Another ‚Äúsmart line‚Äù has such a feature: you can write ‚ÄúHabrahabr‚Äù in it and it will send us directly to habrahabr.ru - that is, the analogue of Google ‚ÄúI'm lucky‚Äù (which now without turning off the ‚Äúlive search‚Äù and not to use it at all) -he), there are still small buns, such as quick links, etc. - in general, a lot of work has been done with the omnibox, we must pay tribute.  I amused one moment: when I downloaded Yandex.Browser through Yandex.Browser, I saw: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/745/868/212/745868212aff4c179c4b8ce007b29bd8.png"><br><br>  Surely all downloaded executables are marked this way, but agree that it looks funny. <br><br>  Brief summary: Yandeks.Browser, as Amigo strives to get into the system to an inattentive user in the appendage to a huge number of free programs - and this is bad.  But if you temporarily close your eyes to his aggressive ‚Äúsniffing‚Äù and just look at him, you can see that serious work has been done on the browser, not limited to replacing the label and pre-installing a pair of extensions, it can be considered an independent browser, though based on someone else's engine . <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  I installed each of the browsers reviewed for the first time.  I‚Äôve seen some of them before, but never tried to use them, so all that is written here is a first impression.  I didn‚Äôt touch on such important concepts as the speed of work and the quality of the display of pages - they are all at a decent level, but thank you for this ‚Äúdad‚Äù Chromium.  If I missed an important point or responded unfairly to someone, I was waiting for comments with clarifications, intentionally to hide something or to offend someone. <br><br>  Well, who is cooler, I suggest to choose the Community: the survey is attached. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252219/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252219/</a></p>
