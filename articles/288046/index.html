What is this spiritual development - without blogs?  Straight I want a little degraded.  Are you with me? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So I tell you all the time what you should write about in blogs and what about not.  But my opinion is just my opinion, we should look at the entire range.  Here is a girl Nastasya thinking <a href="http://aysaa.livejournal.com/870479.html">about what you can write in LJ</a> .  As a result, it turns out that you can‚Äôt write about anything at all.  I will allow myself to quote: " <em>As soon as you breathed out after the battle about raising children and wrote something about history there, you don‚Äôt need to relax. In the history, the specialists are all in general. Everyone read, you have your opinion and, of course, only it is right</em> . <br><br>  Remember, once upon a time, last year, I told you about the whole investigation into the appearance of the song ‚ÄúCity of Golden‚Äù?  So, now I invite you to read something similar, only this time about the ‚Äúfolk‚Äù Jewish song ‚Äú <a href="http://bujhm.livejournal.com/114292.html">Khava Nagila</a> ‚Äù.  The link contains not only the history of creation, but also the Hebrew text, as well as a large collection of rewrites of this song by various artists from Kobzon to Psoy Korolenko.

      A useful article for all webmasters was written by the author of the blog Umade.ru.  It is called " <a href="http://umade.ru/log/2006/03/186.html">CSS Printing with Style</a> " and tells you how to use CSS to print your website.  Why create separate pages for printing and how CSS will help us - these are the main topics of the article.  I like it.  Eh, if I still understand CSS. <br><br>  Programming theme continues Manic Weblog.  He talks <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2006/03/27/swap-var-values">about the exchange of variable values</a> in the Python programming language.  If I don‚Äôt understand CSS, I only know about Python that it was used in Civilization IV.  As you can see, I, as always, are not in the know.  In general, the text is small and is dedicated to code optimization.  Perhaps interested fans of "python". <br><br>  After ‚ÄúKhava Nagila‚Äù, it would be logical to reflect <a href="http://leteha.livejournal.com/212625.html">on xenophobia and anti-Semitism</a> .  On this topic, leteha shares his thoughts aloud.  For example, here‚Äôs a statement: ‚Äú <em>In Russia, an extremely low level of anti-Semitism. Even at the household level. Many people can hum in the kitchen that‚Äú Jews are flooded. ‚ÄùHowever, respect for an abstract surgeon Aaron Shpenrelson kills to the root</em> . "  Much controversial article, but because this is the most raisins! <br><br>  Domain blog, surprisingly, writes about domains.  In this case - interesting <a href="http://domainblog.ru/2006/03/26/rif">statistics on the process of intercepting a domain</a> in a zone.ru.  In addition, it is reported that this year registration of Russian domains will be launched in this zone. <br><br>  In "KV" horoscopes are not published, but the head ed.  Already ordered to release an application called "KV-Glamor", in which, among the weather forecast, pictures of Paris Hilton and lovely pink telephones, there will be horoscopes.  In the meantime, I recommend reading the short story " <a href="http://mkk.livejournal.com/243845.html">When tolerance was distributed ...</a> ".  Tolerance was distributed to the signs of the zodiac and everyone got a special one.  And the calves decide in any way!  We are the salt of the earth! <br><br>  Some visitors to our forums believe that all this fussing with blogs is the essence of stupid burning of time.  I argue with them, they are with me, but nothing changes.  The next <a href="http://krivetsky.info/2006/03/25/letnee-vremya">link</a> is an argument in favor of my opponents.  There is not a lot of text there, but immediately there is a feeling that the authors of blogs are working with akyns - what I see, I sing.  And when the statements begin: " <em>The transition to summer and winter time is stupid,</em> " - I want to turn off the light. <br><br>  And the following link will be a terrible warning to all <a href="http://murrena.livejournal.com/17853.html">lovers of pirated software</a> .  Especially those who use the "mule", better known as e-mul.  The girl tells how in their company they downloaded a film through this network and received a warning from the provider, who, in turn, were copyright holders.  So watch out for yourself, be careful! <br><br>  A blog with the mercantile name SellMe asks the question: " <a href="http://www.sellme.ru/2006/03/22/mir_bez_rezyume">And what, actually, write in the resume?</a> ".  I think I will not reveal America to you if I say that blogs are very helpful in getting a job.  The correct beautiful blog is a kind of an extended summary version.  The author of this text complements blogs with other useful features.  The meaning of the article: resume - is the last century.  Quote: " <em>A guy from a rival firm asked me whether I should expect to work for them someday. Then he asked for my resume. I said that I didn‚Äôt want a job for which I needed a resume</em> ." <br><br>  <a href="http://verba.livejournal.com/135770.html">Another example of the</a> American legal system.  On the one hand, it is absurd, but on the other hand (by the author), such a system is not only necessary, but in some cases will help to avoid serious crimes.  I do not know, and yet human stupidity is boundless. <br><br>  Well, the blog Lifehack.ru continues to engage in life hacking.  This time the author tells us about the possibility of <a href="http://lifehack.ru/2006/03/27/xakaem_lift">hacking the elevator</a> .  Tips from this article will be useful to those who use the elevators, which stop either on even or on odd floors.  When are the refrigerators hacking so that there are endless amounts of bugs there? <br><br>  Wonderful cartoons from the " <a href="http://users.livejournal.com/xa__/116676.html">New Crocodile</a> ".  I especially liked Sergey Bezrukov‚Äôs portfolio.  He is there in the image of Alexandra Pakhmutova, and Leo Tolstoy, and Marina Tsvetaeva, etc.  etc.  Reached on the earring for the full program.  In addition, a funny picture ‚ÄúAttempt on Petrosian during a speech in front of the unwinders of the winding factory‚Äù.  And the poster of the film "9th Turkish Watch" lights with might and main. <br><br>  In every review I don‚Äôt get tired of mentioning web 2.0 in vain.  It looks like it has become some kind of new religion, right?  Tell me about her.  Will she save the world?  Will humankind reach transcendental nirvana (this type is oily oil)?  And in the blog, defann's place went even further and already write notes called <a href="http://defann.cyberflash.ru/2006/03/21/1">web 3.0</a> .  Of course, you have to be ahead of the rest!  In general, the article is interesting, a few more bricks in understanding why the web is outdated by one point zero. <br><br>  Well, how can my review do without erotica (if not say, pornography, oh ...)?  Then you will have nothing to discuss on the forum, critical you are mine.  Although, the following link will actually be interesting, first of all, for photographers.  After all, the message tells and shows <a href="http://sobaka-bobaka.livejournal.com/604408.html">how to professionally photograph female buttocks</a> .  And the model itself wrote this text.  Frankly, I do not envy her, because it is very hard work to be a pop-model. <br><br>  It turns out that there is a whole Bowivedening (I hope you don‚Äôt need to tell who David Bowie is?).  Many interesting things can be read: for example, <a href="http://za-gonzalez.livejournal.com/231510.html">Bowie and People</a> .  I do not want to tell anything, just go and get an aesthetic pleasure from reading, even if you are not a fan of Comrade David.  And do not forget to click on the label "Bowie", learn a lot of interesting facts.  For example, about the stay of David in 1973 on the territory of the USSR. <br><br>  <a href="http://aveleen.livejournal.com/1086092.html">Notes of the female body</a> amuse any man.  We find the body at a time when various physical exercises are planned, a diet - in general, we would lose weight.  The red thread through the text runs the body's hatred for the brain.  Something all this reminds me of the male body after too much libation. <br><br>  On this review is considered fully completed.  Begin collecting information for the following. <br><br>  <b>Browser Leshka KHALETSKY</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006130602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ13, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288046/</a></p>
