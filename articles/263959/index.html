In a specific case, there is nothing bad in it, I always write simple programs that I can fully remember.  However, I hope you will be interested in cool things, which are obtained when the side effects are separated from business logic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Free monads </h1><br>  For starters, we need to clear our program.  We can <strong>always</strong> separate unclean areas from any code using <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2012/06/you-could-have-invented-free-monads.html">free monads</a> .  Free monads allow you to divide any unclean program into a pure representation of its behavior and a minimal unclean interpreter: <br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> Control.Monad.Free <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">System</span></span>.<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Exit</span></span> hiding (ExitSuccess) data TeletypeF x = PutStrLn String x | GetLine (String -&gt; x) | ExitSuccess instance Functor TeletypeF <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">where</span></span> fmap f (PutStrLn str x) = PutStrLn str (fx) fmap f (GetLine k) = GetLine (f . k) fmap f ExitSuccess = ExitSuccess <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span></span> Teletype = Free TeletypeF putStrLn<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' :: String -&gt; Teletype () putStrLn'</span></span> str = liftF $ PutStrLn str () getLin<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">e' :: Teletype String getLine'</span></span> = liftF $ GetLine id exitSuccess<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' :: Teletype r exitSuccess'</span></span> = liftF ExitSuccess run :: Teletype r -&gt; IO r run (Pure r) = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> r run (Free (PutStrLn str t)) = putStrLn str &gt;&gt; run t run (Free (GetLine f )) = getLine &gt;&gt;= run . f run (Free ExitSuccess ) = exitSuccess echo :: Teletype () echo = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> str &lt;- getLin<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">e' putStrLn'</span></span> str exitSuccess<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' putStrLn'</span></span> "Finished" main = run echo</code> </pre> <br>  The code rewritten in this way collects <strong>all</strong> unclean actions in the <code>run</code> function.  I prefer to call this process ‚Äúcode cleaning‚Äù because we clear all the logic of the program to clean code, leaving aside the minimal impure residue only in our <code>run</code> interpreter.

    <h1>  Proof of </h1><br>  It seems that we did not benefit much from the purification of the code, but paid for this pleasure with many lines of code <i>(and also with the overhead of memory and time)</i> .  However, now we can prove some properties of our code using <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/12/equational-reasoning.html">equational inference</a> <i>(equational reasoning - output through equivalent transformations)</i> . <br><br>  For example, anyone reading this must have noticed an obvious bug in the original <code>echo</code> program: <br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">System</span></span>.<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Exit</span></span> main = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> x &lt;- getLine putStrLn x exitSuccess putStrLn "Finished" <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">-- -!</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  The last command will never be executed ... or will it be?  How to prove it? <br><br>  In fact, we cannot prove that the last command will never be executed, because it <strong>is not</strong> .  The author of the <code>System.Exit</code> module could easily change the definition of <code>exitSuccess</code> to <br><pre> <code class="hljs kotlin">exitSuccess :: IO () exitSuccess = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> ()</code> </pre> <br>  This program still passes type checking, but now it also successfully prints <code>Finished</code> to the console. <br><br>  But for our cleaned version, we can prove that any command after <code>exitSuccess'</code> will never be executed: <br><pre> <code class="hljs cs">exitSuccess<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' &gt;&gt; m = exitSuccess'</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Let us prove with an equational conclusion, this most significant purification profit.  The equational inference implies that we can take any expression and simply substitute the definitions of the component functions.  Each step of the following proof is accompanied by a commentary that indicates the specific functional definition used to proceed to the next step. <br><pre> <code class="hljs erlang-repl">exitSuccess' &gt;&gt; m -- exitSuccess' = liftF ExitSuccess = liftF ExitSuccess &gt;&gt; m -- m &gt;&gt; m' = m &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; m' = liftF ExitSuccess &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; m -- liftF f = Free (fmap Pure f) = Free (fmap Pure ExitSuccess) &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; m -- fmap f ExitSuccess = ExitSuccess = Free ExitSuccess &gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; m -- Free m &gt;&gt;= f = Free (fmap (&gt;&gt;= f) m) = Free (fmap (&gt;&gt;= \_ -&gt; m) ExitSuccess) -- fmap f ExitSuccess = ExitSuccess = Free ExitSuccess -- fmap f ExitSuccess = ExitSuccess = Free (fmap Pure ExitSuccess) -- liftF f = Free (fmap Pure f) = liftF ExitSuccess -- exitSuccess' = liftF ExitSuccess = exitSuccess'</code> </pre> <br>  Notice how in the last steps we turned over the equalities and moved back from the functional definition <i>(on the right)</i> to the defined expression <i>(on the left)</i> .  Such a technique is completely admissible, because, due to purity, the equal sign in Haskell does not mean assignment, but it means really equality!  This means that, talking about code in terms of equality, we can translate expressions in both directions with respect to the equal sign.  Impressive! <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For those who have heard about the Œª-calculus (from the translator)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  In fact, equality in Haskell means not quite equality in the traditional sense.  In Œª-calculus there is a concept of reduction - a term transformation according to a certain rule.  Formally speaking, this is just a binary relation on a set of terms.  A term can be reduced to several different terms, and this ambiguity determines the multiplicity of reduction strategies (energetic - first the argument is reduced, then the expression; lazy - the whole expression first, then the argument as necessary; and the like).  With a fixed reduction strategy, the term is either reduced in a certain way to another term, or not at all.  The latter case is called the normal form of a term; we think of it as a completely completed calculation.  The reductions themselves are generated by some rules.  The best known are Œ≤- and Œ∑-reductions.  In a sense, each functional equality (function definitions) express the same rules.  When a calculation occurs, these rules work in one direction.  If the rule is closed on itself, an infinite recursion occurs, like <code>inf = inf :: a</code> .  However, in the metatheory we can take this binary relation and close it by transitivity and symmetry, obtaining a binary reduction ratio relation.  By the Church ‚Äì Rosser theorem, the reduction equality M = N is valid if and only if there is a term (not necessarily in normal form) P such that both terms M and N are reduced to a common value P in a finite number of steps. Here‚Äôs how since such equalities are discussed in this article. <br></div></div><br>  It is equally important that the above proof is valid, no matter how this free monad is interpreted.  We can change the <code>run</code> function to any other interpreter, incl.  clean and equality is still true <br><pre> <code class="hljs cs">exitSuccess<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">' &gt;&gt; m = exitSuccess'</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  This means that we can safely use it as a <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/rewrite-rules.html">rule override in the GHC (GHC rewrite rule)</a> to optimize the passage through our program: <br><pre> <code class="hljs objectivec">{-<span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta"># RULES </span><span class="hljs-meta-string"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta-string">"exit"</span></span></span><span class="hljs-meta"> forall m. exitSuccess' &gt;&gt; m = exitSuccess' #-}</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  ... and we can guarantee that the rule will always be safely applied and never broken. <br><br><h1>  Code Reasoning </h1><br>  I would like to prove that our program always displays the same string that it receives at the input.  Unfortunately, this we also can not prove, because it <strong>is not</strong> .  The author <i>(the maintainer) of</i> the <code>putStrLn</code> function could at any time change his mind and override <br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">putStrLn str = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">return</span></span> () <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">--    !</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In fact, we cannot even prove that for the cleaned free monad version this is done.  The <code>run</code> function uses the same <code>putStrLn</code> , so the program is in any case subject to the same bug threat.  Nevertheless, we can still prove something about the freest monad, considering it through a pure interpreter: <br><pre> <code class="hljs rust">runPure :: Teletype r -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">String</span></span>] -&gt; [<span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">String</span></span>] runPure (Pure r) xs = [] runPure (Free (PutStrLn yt)) xs = y:runPure t xs runPure (Free (GetLine k)) [] = [] runPure (Free (GetLine k)) (x:xs) = runPure (kx) xs runPure (Free ExitSuccess ) xs = []</code> </pre> <br>  Now we can prove <br><pre> <code class="hljs dos">runPure <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span></span> = take <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  using the <code>take</code> function from the <code>Prelude</code> package of the Haskell98 standard.  I leave this as an exercise for the reader, since this post is already quite long. <br><br>  Pay attention to another important point.  Exploring <code>echo</code> through the prism of clean code, we find a small detail that we did not initially see: the user can enter nothing!  In this case, our <i>(last)</i> interpreter should return an empty list, as well as the function <code>take _ [] = []</code> .  Equational withdrawal makes us rigorous when a simple statement ‚Äúour program always produces the same string it receives‚Äù is not enough.  The more you work with such equalities, the more you improve the skill of reasoning about the properties of your code and find errors in your initial assumptions. <br><br>  Equally important, equivalent transformations allow you to see your program in a completely new light.  We saw that our program became notorious <code>take 1</code> after passing through <code>runPure</code> , which means that we can borrow our intuition about the <code>take</code> function to understand our program and detect such insidious minor bugs. <br><br>  After we selected the pure part of the code with the <code>Free</code> monad and proved its consistency, it becomes a reliable kernel and all we have to do is compile the interpreter from now on.  Thus, while we cannot fully prove the correctness of the entire program, we could prove the correctness of everything, with the exception of the interpreter.  Equally important is the fact that we reduced the interpreter to an absolutely minimally prone form for attacks, which allows us to keep it in our head and support it manually. <br><br><h1>  Testing </h1><br>  We cannot prove anything about the code immersed in the <code>IO</code> monad.  And how could this be done?  One could say somehow: ‚Äúif you compile the code, run the program and enter some single line, the same line will be returned back‚Äù, but this is not really an equation, therefore there is nothing strict in such a phrase.  However, we can write it as a test for our program. <br><br>  Unfortunately, unclean code tests do not scale to large and complex programs and, in test-dependent PLs, writing such tests occupies a significant fraction of the time of the entire programming cycle. <br><br>  Fortunately, we can still easily test clean code with the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">QuickCheck library</a> , which <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck">iterates</a> over clean statements and checks them for incorrectness in a fully automatic mode. <br><br>  For example, suppose you were too lazy to prove <code>runPure echo = take 1</code> .  We can instead ask QuickCheck to test this proposition for us: <br><pre> <code class="hljs haskell">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span></span> Test.QuickCheck &gt;&gt;&gt; quickCheck (\<span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">xs</span></span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">runPure</span></span> <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">echo</span></span> <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">xs</span></span> == <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">take</span></span> 1 <span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-title">xs</span></span>) +++ OK, passed 100 tests.</code> </pre> <br>  Cool!  You can test your code much more actively if it is as clean as possible. <br><br><h1>  Finally </h1><br>  Equational output works only for clean code, so clean parts of the code serve as a valid kernel, which you can: <br><ul><li>  <i>prove soundness</i> , integrity and correctness <i>(prove soundness)</i> , </li><li>  output the properties of his behavior <i>(reason about behavior)</i> , </li><li>  actively test <i>(aggressively test)</i> . </li></ul><br>  That is why we always fight for the share of clean code in our code and minimize unclean parts. <br>  Fortunately, the free monad <code>Free</code> guarantees us an easy achievement of the highest level of cleanliness as possible, and the least amount of unclean code.  That is why all experienced Haskelist programmers should be fluent in free monads. <br><br><h1>  Thanks </h1><br>  Thanks <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kolodeznydiver/" class="user_link">KolodeznyDiver</a> for help with translation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/263959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/263959/</a></p>
