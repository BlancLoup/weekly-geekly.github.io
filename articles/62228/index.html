    <h2>  So.  What is paintball? </h2><br>  <b>Paintball</b> (born Paintball - a ball with paint) - a team game with the use of hand-held airguns (called markers), firing paint capsules that crash when you strike an obstacle and paint it - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">wikipedia</a> . <br><br><img src="http://gallery.stalkerday.ru/d/53-5/IMG_0954_.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Does it hurt? </h2><br>  A hit from 5-10 meters is almost imperceptible, a hit to the support is painful (there will be a bruise).  The most important rule - <b>never take off the mask on the field</b> , otherwise, they can get into the eye or mouth.  If you follow this simple rule - the chances of injury are no more than when walking through the woods.  Next in injury after paintball sports is tennis.  :) <br><br><h2>  Where do they play? </h2><br>  Most often they play on specially equipped grounds with artificially created obstacles.  More or less complete list for <a href="http://www.ad-paintball.ru/map/%3FarrFilter_pf%5BOBJECT_TYPE%5D%5B%5D%3D13141%26set_filter%3DY">Moscow</a> and <a href="http://www.p8nt.ru/map/index.php%3Fcommand%3D%26command%3D%26bitrix_include_areas%3DN%26bitrix_show_mode%3Dview%26arrFilter_pf%5BREGION%5D%3D8172%26arrFilter_pf%5BOBJECT_TYPE%5D%5B%5D%3D13141%26set_filter%3DY%26del_filter%3D">St. Petersburg</a> .  But, if desired, resourceful paintball players can organize the game even at their country house in the near forest.  It is only necessary to have equipment, balloons and air (but this ‚Äúrequires‚Äù permission). <br><br><h2>  What will be the 27th? </h2><br>  <b>The military-patriotic game STALKER</b> is a real adventure, a change of reality.  On June 27-28, 2009, in the village of Zhostovo, Mytishchi district, Moscow region, a 30-hour scenario paintball game will take place.  This is an opportunity to find yourself in a "different" civilization, on a piece of land, surrounded by water on all sides, fenced off from all problems.  This is an opportunity to take on a different social role, different from everyday life. <br><br><img src="http://gallery.stalkerday.ru/d/41-6/1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><ul><li>  <b>A 30-hour non-stop paintball scenario game</b> .  Do not be afraid of numbers at 30 o'clock.  No one forces you to play 30 hours without stopping.  Play as much as you want (an ordinary person has 3-4 hours of play). </li><li>  <b>Intra-game currency: Mouflon.</b>  All mutual settlements in the game take place through the domestic currency, which can be exchanged for ordinary Russian rubles.  Also, mouflon can be obtained as a reward or earned by selling the ‚Äúartifact‚Äù found in the field.  <b>After the game, mouflon can be exchanged back for rubles</b> . </li><li>  <b>A separate ‚Äúrace‚Äù of Wilds</b> in a number of 40 people, consisting of professional paintball players and playing their role as a guard (guarding caravans, raiding players, etc.) </li><li>  <b>It will be possible to rob <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">cows</a> "Wild"</b> </li><li>  <b>Competitions from partners</b> with the ability to win paintball equipment, a tent or a walkie-talkie. </li><li>  <b>Concert, good music, demonstrations from athletes.</b> </li><li>  <b>Tent city, beach, pond, the opportunity to ride a boat, swim and, of course, barbecue :)</b> </li></ul><br>  More information can be found <a href="http://www.stalkerday.ru/">on the website</a> or <a href="http://forum.stalkerday.ru/">on the forum</a> . <br><br><h2>  How much </h2><br>  700 rubles application + 300 rubles equipment rental (on the security of a passport or driver's license) + balls ~ 900 rubles (the floor of the box will be enough for you to be fired).  Total 1900 rubles.  Plus, here is another fare and food and get an <b>average figure of 2500 rubles</b> . <br><br><h2>  Where and how to get there? </h2><br>  Paintball club "Warsector-Zhostovo". <br>  1. By car: 23 km along the Ostashkovskoe highway, the village of Zhostovo, the recreation center Zhostovo. <br>  2. Under its own power: <br>  - by train to Mytishchi station (dispatched from Yaroslavsky railway station) <br>  - At the bus station near the railway station, take the free bus from Mytishchi station directly to the recreation center <i><b>(negotiations are underway, I‚Äôll report the results separately).</b></i> <br>  - At the bus station near the railway station, take the bus number 26 or the minibus number 26, next to the stop Zhostovo. <br>  - further on foot to the hostel Zhostovo <br><br><h2>  How to apply? </h2><br>  You need to <a href="http://www.stalkerday.ru/signup/">register on the site</a> and pay the application (there is a payment through webmoney and eleksnet), print the application and bring it with you to the game. <br><br><h2>  Post Scriptum </h2><br>  I do not hide at all that I am one of the organizers of this event, you can assume that this is my startup, because for the first time in this game we will introduce a ‚Äúscenario‚Äù to paintball.  Also, after the game, I will be happy to talk about the technical base that was deployed specifically for this game (internal economic accounting of currency movements from banks, tracking the number of people in the game using mobile phones, synchronizing stations in terms of session access to Internet, etc.) <br><br>  ************************************************** *********************** <br>  <s><b>update:</b> Ready to donate 2 free applications (you save 700 rubles) to the first two lucky ones who will write me a personal message with their application ID.</s>  <s>(to get an ID you need to register <a href="http://www.stalkerday.ru/signup/">here</a> ).</s> <br>  <b>update2:</b> With our presence at the game, we will be pleased with the honorary steering habr - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/shoohurt/" class="user_link">Shoohurt</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62228/</a></p>
