Are there any criteria for evaluating the site, determining its quality? <br><br>  In this article we will try to understand these issues. <br><br><h4>  Site Evaluation Criteria </h4><br>  The first step is to determine the criteria by which it will be possible to evaluate the site, and arrange them in order of importance. <br><ul><li>  Site visibility by search engines </li><li>  Ease of use of the site </li><li>  Site design </li><li>  Functionality </li></ul><br>  Why did I set the criteria in that order?  From such considerations. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Site visibility by search engines </h5><br>  The main objective of any site is to provide visitors with relevant information.  For example, if we sell puppies of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog in Kharkov, then our site should be seen by those who want to buy them and who are interested in this topic, right? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      We type in Yandex the query ‚ÄúCentral Asian Shepherd Dogs in Kharkov‚Äù, and we see in the first place the site of the dog kennel: <br><br><img src="http://gkstudio.com.ua/images/userfiles/images/Pitomnik_1.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The visibility of the site by search engines I would single out as the main criterion by which we can evaluate the site.  If the site is not found by search engines (and most of the natural traffic is created by search engines), then they will not visit, they will not see, and in fact it will not matter if there is a website or not. <br><br>  The main and mandatory conditions for ensuring the visibility of the site is its placement on the server and filling in the necessary content.  Then the search engine robot will write this content to the database and issue it on request. <br><br><h5>  Ease of use of the site </h5><br>  The second most important criterion for assessing I chose usability.  Finding the site itself is still half the battle.  It is also important to find on the site that material that interests the visitor.  There are sites that contain huge amounts of content, but using them is nevertheless simple and easy.  And there are those where there are five sections, but nothing can be understood. <br><br>  For example, posting job openings on the NetBee site was unpleasantly surprised by the employer registration form.  I decided to upload my avatar, but after uploading it, all the fields that I filled out were cleared!  I had to score them again.  The link ‚ÄúAdd a vacancy‚Äù was difficult to find, although this was the main thing that interested me.  When I tried to add a job, instead of its parameters, fields were opened to fill in data about my company, made very inconvenient.  As a result, I simply closed this site in the hope that someday they would still put it in order. <br><br>  It is quite another thing site "Work in Kharkov."  Everything is quite simple, understandable, convenient.  Adding a vacancy or resume is made without problems, registration is simple, the site is simple and transparent. <br><br><h5>  Site design </h5><br>  Website design is often highlighted.  In the view of many customers, site design is the main and often the only criterion for its quality.  I will not argue - the appearance always plays an important role. <br><br>  One of the sites recognized as the best BeInspired (The most beautiful sites, selected manually - an electronic magazine for designers): <br><br> <a href="http://wonder-wall.com/"><img src="http://gkstudio.com.ua/images/userfiles/images/wonder_wall_com.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  This site was loaded for about ten minutes, and then almost completely slowed down the work of my old laptop, but it‚Äôs worth seeing - the very unusual effect of image deformation with the mouse.  I couldn‚Äôt immediately understand what it is (it looks like a catalog of some institutions), but you must agree, it‚Äôs impressive! <br><br>  And this is another site that is loaded instantly and has a fairly simple, one might say, design: <br><br><img src="http://gkstudio.com.ua/images/userfiles/images/google.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the site should look nice and neat, but this work can be done already in the course of the site‚Äôs existence, since the appearance doesn‚Äôt affect the way the search robots see the site.  They don‚Äôt have an eye, so they can only read texts, or rather, HTML markup of a document.  And the sooner they can do it, the faster the site will begin to give returns. <br><br>  As a rule, website design requires a lot of time, much of which is spent on coordination with the customer, color matching, creating and editing graphics.  All this time, the site is ‚Äúin development‚Äù, search robots do not index it, no one is engaged in its content, and all customer‚Äôs employees are passionate about design, although they are not experts in this. <br><br>  Of course, you shouldn't post a completely raw site on the Internet either.  The ideal option is to quickly create a fairly competent and professional design (this will be enough for a few days), then post the site to the Internet, and fill it up as quickly as possible with content that meets the site‚Äôs theme. <br><br>  After that, you can safely proceed to testing the site, adjusting its appearance (up to a complete rework), without worrying about the fact that potential customers will be lost.  Even if the site will be just a white page on which it will be written, say, ‚ÄúWe sell puppies of the Central Asian Shepherd Dog in Kharkov‚Äù and a phone number is indicated, it will already work. <br><br>  In some cases (for companies that do not want to show the site until its full design approval), a plug should be made where all the keywords and contacts of the company will be present.  It is good if this page will be framed in the style of the company, or at least its logo will be. <br><br><h5>  Site functionality </h5><br>  By ‚Äúfunctionality‚Äù of the site, I mean the implementation of a content management system (content) (CMS), as well as various services (if they are needed, such as an order basket, a search form for goods or services, user registration, voting management, polls, publications, etc. .d.) <br><br>  Of course, the most important part is the site content management system (CMS), since it has to be used quite often.  CMS should be understandable, understandable and convenient, as simple PC users who may not know anything about Web design and HTML will work with it. <br><br>  In addition, a good CMS should properly form the structure of the site so that the site is quickly indexed by search engines, in particular, to provide the ability to edit meta tags. <br><br>  Site navigation should be simple, clear and convenient, and the site itself opens quickly and behaves predictably.  For example, if a process takes time that requires time, such as downloading an image or searching, the status bar or preloader will be displayed correctly so that the user can see that the site is not frozen, but does something. <br><br>  What do you think should be a good site?  How would you prioritize and what criteria did you choose? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120989/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120989/</a></p>
