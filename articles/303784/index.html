Why use personalization in online advertising?  How to act in new circumstances to keep your business afloat and continue the development of the company?  The participants of the Tabtabus Summer Fest festival, which took place in the Smolensk region on June 18-19, received answers to these and other questions. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  According to the tradition, the summer open-air of IT specialists was deployed in the Smolensk Lakeland National Park.

    <h2>  Forest TED and roundtables: what was in the spotlight? </h2><br><br>  The business part of the festival was held in the style of ‚ÄúForest TED‚Äù.  Speakers from Moscow, St. Petersburg and Minsk communicated directly with the audience without presentations and folders with prepared texts.  The focus was on what will be relevant in the IT sphere: what technologies in the surrounding space are already changing the world and how people change under their influence. <br><br>  The first presentation of <b>Alexey Ezhikov</b> , an expert, business consultant and development director of the RUWARD project group, was devoted to the evolution of media, Internet of things, virtual reality and the influence of media on society. <br><br>  The main trends of the IT sphere, according to Alexey, are deep learning and neural networks of deep learning, which are now represented everywhere: <br><blockquote>  Neuro-networks of deep learning have learned to recognize faces in pictures, they beat a person in go, they will soon drive traffic in cities and cars on the streets.  Another, not yet very noticeable trend - biotechnology.  Of course, when we are all young and healthy, it doesn‚Äôt worry us much, but after 15 years we will see how far biotechnology has stepped forward and how our medicine has improved. </blockquote><br>  Regarding Tabtabus, Alexey gave a forecast that it is possible that after 5 years at the festival there will be "virtual" visitors, who will be able to discuss current issues in the IT sphere on a par with other participants who traveled by buses, bicycles and cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/579/b54/a86579b54eaf4181b9c9ddc2aeafdec0.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Andrey Mayboroda</b> , sales organization expert, director of the Green Bussiness company (St. Petersburg), talked about how to build effective sales with a human face for IT companies.  In his opinion, the future lies in the maximum rejection of all kinds of manipulative techniques.  When selling IT products, it is important to help the client solve his problem.  To do this, you need to immerse yourself in the client's business, find out maximum about the sales, the product or service offered - that is, at the initial stage, ask at least 20-25 questions about what the client does (ideally, there should be about 50!).  He also mentioned the importance of social networks: <br><blockquote>  This is a smart tool for sales, it simplifies our life: it becomes easier to find a person, to enter into direct contact with him, to have a direct dialogue - and this is the beginning of sales. </blockquote><br>  Director of Information Projects Ruward, Operations Director of Cossa, <b>Andrei Konovalov,</b> told the audience that personalization could be called one of the main trends of the future in IT, and thanks to it, Internet advertising becomes targeted for the audience.  Hence, the need to work with web analytics in order to understand whether the chosen strategy is effective and correct it in a timely manner. <br><br>  Also, modern IT companies need to show "flexibility" in service and be competent in their field in order to find concrete solutions for businesses, without leaving customers at the crossroads of a choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f8/c37/a4f/0f8c37a4fdd049d788f354459b050405.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Anna Moiseeva</b> - FRII expert, start-up consultant at an early stage of development (Moscow) noted that at present, when launching a startup, it is important to use custom development, study the client, and draw conclusions from the information received.  From technologies that actively influence life, Anna noted uber-services and instant messengers: <br><blockquote>  All that is associated with communication and exchange of information is all sorts of instant messengers, as well as all the technologies that are related to speed: data transfer speed, client and provider connection speed, the so-called ‚Äúuberization‚Äù - fast connection to the service provider‚Äôs client, for example, food delivery services, taxi.  I think this approach will spread in other areas. </blockquote><br>  Entrepreneur <b>Andrei Sharkov</b> , author and presenter of the podcast ‚ÄúFight and do‚Äù (St. Petersburg) discussed with the audience what kind of IT is needed for modern business.  The main points to which he paid attention: it is the need to separate for themselves the concepts of ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù and ‚Äúhobby‚Äù, to be able to correctly prioritize and focus on the final goal.  At the same time, do not refer to the crisis as the main cause of economic failures and failure to achieve the goal, and in a changed situation, correct the work model in time - make the final product or service better, differently or produce more products / provide more services for the same money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/91e/507/a7291e50759047bc81eba0e1f1fe193d.JPG"><br><br>  After the speeches of the speakers, the festival participants divided their interests and discussed current trends in IT at round tables with moderators and industry experts from 20 companies in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Smolensk and Minsk.  The main topics for communication were marketing, design, programming, start-up and project management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/809/160/ef6/809160ef692e4a9394c2e5a484ef9566.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Office sports and outdoor recreation </h2><br>  Traditionally, the festival was held in a format that allows you to combine business with pleasure.  After the business program, everyone who spoke communicated and exchanged contacts with speakers and experts, watched the first photogrow made up of Tabtabus-avatars, and took part in an office sport.  This year, thanks to the good weather, the competitions included mattress races, water volleyball, as well as archery and tug-of-war. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eae/a16/df5/eaea16df59e6480ea7bfe58de36cce2f.jpg"><br><br>  A soup was prepared for all participants of the festival, boat trips were organized, and the Canape bar was opened, where you could buy refreshing drinks for the ‚Äúgame currency‚Äù won in competitions and at round tables under the name of ‚Äútabs‚Äù. <br><br>  Each of the guests was able to mark on the IT-tree, which sprouted to the right of the scene, drawing the logo of their company or leaving a message to descendants. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24c/788/bc0/24c788bc043d460a8072b911197796c1.jpg"><br><br>  Keeping the tradition of the past Tabtabus, when IT people from different companies jointly portrayed the symbol @ - known as ‚Äúdog‚Äù, the guests of the festival once again carried out a cheerful flash mob - this time the @ sign was created on the water.  To do this, participants flashmob armed with inflatable circles.  What happened - look at the photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d3/162/20c/6d316220c6004e8ca764c473c3b4d82a.jpg"><br><br>  The evening was completed by a music program from IT groups from Smolensk and St. Petersburg.  On the festival site were musicians "7.5 floor", "Next frame", "Jack London band."  The evening ended with a campfire gathering with acoustic guitars led by the Partybard team. <br><br><h2>  And then came the morning of the second day ... </h2><br>  The next day, all the IT people were waiting for sports and dance exercises from fitness trainer Anastasia Zakharevich.  Encouraged, the Tabtabus participants went to the ‚ÄúBusiness Breakfast‚Äù with Andrei Sharkov, where the author and host of the podcast ‚ÄúFight and Do‚Äù answered the participants' questions, conducted an interactive and told about how to choose marketing strategies for businesses based on the needs of the target audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10b/543/194/10b543194f5e461aa80428edd9f645fb.jpg"><br><br>  At the end of the summer open-air of IT people, the Tabtabus flag was omitted.  Then the participants and speakers thanked the organizers for the event, because the festival served as an excellent occasion for various companies working in the field of information technology to get out into the countryside with all the staff, discuss topical issues of the IT sphere, have fun, relax and socialize in an informal setting. <br><br>  You can find all the details about Tabtabus on social networks under the hashtag #tabtabus and on the website <a href="http://www.tabtabus.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrhabr%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dtabtabus">www.tabtabus.ru</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/60TYAg8HYM0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgYdDbmaSYN4sitfWE7zdUOwQtMsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Follow the information: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://vk.com/tabtabus">Vkontakte</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tabtabusconf/">Facebook</a> , </li><li>  <a href="https://twitter.com/tabtabusconf">Twitter</a> , </li><li>  <a href="http://fest.tabtabus.ru/">on the festival website</a> . </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303784/</a></p>
