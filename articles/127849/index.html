  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with Alexander Orlov about Software Project Management Management Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>November 26, 2011 in St. Petersburg will host the International Conference in the field of project management " <a href="http://www.spmconf.ru/">Software Project Management Conference</a> " you are on its program committee, could you tell us in more detail - for whom it is intended, what will be discussed there?</b> <br><br>  AO: The conference is designed for people who manage projects in our industry.  At the same time, projects can vary from large to small.  In my work experience, in our experience in training project managers, I can say that this audience has problems with a car and a small trolley.  And it's great that people are trying to figure it out and make our industry a bit more successful.  We are waiting for such people at the conference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>You have been participating in different conferences for a long time, where a visitor, where a speaker and already ‚Äúate a dog in them‚Äù :) Could you tell us what the upcoming conference should give you, how will it differ from other analogues?</b> <br><br>  AO: We want to make the conference memorable, energetic and useful.  What exactly will not be - reports that fill the time in the conference and boring boring reports.  Over the past three years, I spoke at about 30 conferences, except for community meetings, and God knows how many events I attended as a participant.  And about most of the speakers, I know how they will make a report.  Therefore, SPM will have the best speakers - we use personal connections, we invite, we persuade blackmail and threats to speak with us.  :)

      <b>How do you think, why do people need to participate in the conference?</b>  <b>What most personally gave you participation in conferences?</b> <br><br>  These are four things: <br><br>  1. <b>Specific recipes</b> .  The experience of one person is very limited.  You work in the same conditions, with some colleagues, with one project for quite a long time.  And you do not have the opportunity to try 150 recipes for anything and understand which ones work, which do not.  At conferences, people share their experiences - what they did, what happened, what did not work.  I simply took and used some things heard at conferences. <br><br>  2. <b>Useful thoughts, insights</b> .  In our life it is very rarely possible to allocate a whole day to think globally about our work, about our life.  Therefore, when you come to the conference and listen to reports all day long, anyway, all sorts of useful thoughts begin to creep into your head, illuminations flare up.  If the speakers still speak on a topic close to you, then the pressure of insights increases.  :) <br><br>  3. <b>Meet useful and interesting people</b> .  At conferences, I met most of my current partners.  What can I say, at one of the conferences, we personally met Slava Pankratov, with whom we have been working closely for over two years and are now doing business together.  I do not say about how many directors, owners of companies, experts I met at conferences - it is amazingly interesting to communicate with all these people, inspired by their experience and ideas. <br><br>  4. <b>Inspiration</b> .  Conference - the concentration of people with an active lifestyle from your industry.  These are the ones who care.  These are those who are moving and will move this industry in the coming years.  Just to be among them is already cool, it feeds you with some kind of energy.  I want to run somewhere to cause irreparable benefit to people.  Some mystical effect, but it has a place to be. <br><br>  <b>How do you think - how should an IT professional choose an interesting and promising conference for himself, if he nevertheless decided to take part in an industry conference?</b> <br><br>  A.O.  I usually look at the topic - the topic should be interesting to me.  I also look at the people who will perform there.  What is their experience, what can I learn from them.  I‚Äôm not lazy and I look on the Internet for the speeches of these people, I‚Äôm looking a little to see if it‚Äôs worth or not worth listening to them. <br><br>  Over time, it becomes easier - I know most of the speakers of our domestic conferences.  And I know for sure who I'm going to listen to. <br><br>  <b>In SPMConf, one of the topics is the interaction of managers and hirelings, i.e.</b>  <b>PM and HR.</b>  <b>What are the main issues for discussion you see here?</b> <br><br>  A.O.  Questions, in my opinion, are eternal.  How to find the right balance between production (software development) and human development?  Where to get intelligent people, if they all want to find and take to yourself?  How to fairly evaluate the work of people?  At what point and who should deal with processes related to people?  Etc., etc. <br><br>  <b>It is rumored that the conference will have a separate section ‚ÄúSay Tops‚Äù, where top managers of well-known IT companies will speak.</b>  <b>Already have information about who will be and what will act?</b>  <b>How did you get the idea to unite TOPs and conference visitors?</b>  <b>Tops is it interesting?</b> <br><br>  A.O.  What we constantly discover when conducting trainings and consultations for managers of IT companies is that in many companies the communication chain is broken.  The tops want one, the lower classes think that they want a second from them, they themselves want a third and have gone off. <br><br>  Therefore, we, as usual, using personal connections, really invite the directors and owners of companies to the conference to tell them what they expect from managers.  What managers need to do to grow professionally and in a career. <br><br>  Names of directors will not be called yet - busy people may refuse at the last moment.  It will be awkward.  But the directors and owners will definitely be, and exactly with the reports.  :) <br><br>  <b>Why is the conference city Peter?</b> <br><br>  A.O.  Probably because I live here - I want to think that the organizers took into account this moment :) <br><br>  Seriously, there is some glut of conferences in Moscow, and there is undersaturation in St. Petersburg.  We correct this situation.  Plus, of course, everyone who comes will have a great opportunity to see the city.  In general, only for the sake of Peter it is already worth coming.  :) And then there's the conference.  If you still think come, it will be cool! <br><br>  <i>Alexander Orlov is a business coach, consultant in the field of developing non-technical skills among technical specialists, managing software development and testing teams.</i>  <i>The author of the famous resource <a href="http://www.happy-pm.com/">Happy-PM.com</a> , co-founder of the online university <a href="http://www.stratoplan.ru/">Stratoplan.ru</a> .</i>  <i>The author of the book "Secrets of managing programmers."</i> <br><br>  <b>FYI:</b> You can register for the Software Project Management Management Conference via the <a href="http://it-conf.ru/ru/confreg/index.htm">link</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127849/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127849/</a></p>
