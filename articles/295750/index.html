  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Big Data: 20 stunning facts that everyone should know</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For 5 years, the incomprehensible term Big Data was quickly filled with meaning and meaninglessness, as well as the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù 20 years ago.  Since people understand the concentrated and comparative information more quickly and easily, we found it useful to translate an article with the collected facts ‚Äúon the size of a disaster‚Äù.  We must prepare for the future.  In advance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c6/b29/954/3c6b299545b84d458466e6e2f459af88.PNG"><br><br>  ======= <br>  Big Data is more than temporary insanity.  We are at the stage of a revolution that will affect every business and every person on the planet. <br>  Nevertheless, a huge number of people and specialists still regard the Big Ddata concept as something not particularly important that can be ignored, while in fact their usual way will very soon be moved by the steamroller, whose name is Big Data.

      Do not believe?  I present to you 20 statistical facts, which should convince anyone that Big Data is worth close attention: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. The volume of data is growing rapidly, <b>over the past 2 years more data has been generated than in the entire past history of mankind</b> . <br><br>  2. Now the growth rate of data count is even higher and by 2020 <b>1.7 megabytes of new data</b> will be generated <b>every second for every person</b> living on this planet. <br><br>  3. By 2020, our digital universe from the <b>accumulated data will grow 10 times</b> - from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes (44 trillion gigabytes). <br><br>  4. We create new data every second.  For example, humanity generates <b>40,000 search queries every second</b> (only on Google), which will amount to 3.5 queries per day per Internet user and 1.2 trillion queries per year. <br><br>  5. In August 2015, more than 1 billion people used Facebook per day. <br><br>  6. <b>On</b> average, Facebook users <b>send 30 million messages every minute</b> and watch 3 million videos. <br><br>  7. We are witnessing a rapid growth in video and photo volumes, more than <b>300 hours of video files</b> are uploaded to YouTube only one <b>minute every minute</b> . <br><br>  8. In 2015, people will take about <b>1 trillion photos</b> and billions of them will be uploaded to the network.  By 2017, about 80% of all photos will be taken from smartphones. <br><br>  9. This year, about <b>1.4 billion smartphones</b> will find their owners, and each of them has special sensors capable of collecting a wide variety of data about the owner, and this is not taking into account all the data that users themselves create. <br><br>  10. By 2020, there will be over <b>6.1 billion smartphone users</b> in the world (overtaking by the number of landline phone users). <br><br>  11. Over the next 5 years, there will be <b>50 billion "smart" devices</b> in the world and they will all collect, analyze and transmit data. <br><br>  12. By 2020, at least a third of all data will be accumulated in the clouds.  And, therefore, will be available for analysis. <br><br>  13. Distributed computing - has long been part of the existing reality.  Google initially uses them in their daily work: 1,000 computers are involved in responding to each individual search query, which takes just 0.2 seconds to process. <br><br>  14. According to forecasts, the Hadoop market will grow at a rate of 58% per year and will exceed $ 1 billion by 2020. <br><br>  15. Based on the predictions, it can be concluded that with the help of better integration of Big Data, you can save more than 300 billion dollars a year in healthcare ‚Äî $ 1,000 savings per US resident. <br><br>  16. The White House has already invested over $ 200 million in Big Data projects. <br><br>  17. For an average company, a mere 10% increase in data availability will increase their net income by more than $ 65 million. <br><br>  18. Vendors using all the capabilities of Big Data can increase their operating margin to 60%. <br><br>  19. 73% of all organizations have already invested or are planning to invest in Big Data by 2016 <br><br>  20. And one of my favorite facts: At the moment, we are using less than 0.5% of all possible data - just imagine the potential for development in this direction! <br><br>  My prediction?  At the speed at which data volumes grow and, together with them, our ability to analyze them, businesses of all sizes will use one form or another to analyze data in the next 5 years. <br><br>  The question is no longer the relevance of Big Data;  the question is, are you ready for them? <br><br>  <i><a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/big-data-20-mind-boggling-facts-everyone-must-read">Translation of the article Big Data: 20 Mind-Boggling Facts Everyone Must Read</a></i> <i><a href="http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/big-data-20-mind-boggling-facts-everyone-must-read"><br></a> <br></i> <br>  ================= <br><br>  PS The author of the article is a little exhausted somewhere to the 15th fact, the last part no longer looks so big.  So readers have the opportunity to add interesting in your opinion facts that are useful to the community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295750/</a></p>
