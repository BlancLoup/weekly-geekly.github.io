However, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing an integrated module, instead of sticking a whistle of wireless communication, did not seem to me less attractive. <br>  The choice of such devices is quite poor, and I stayed on the Sierra MC7710, as there were messages on the forums about the success of its use with Russian LTE operators.  The adjustment process turned out to be not at all a trivial matter, and in addition it has not been described anywhere from beginning to end.  Therefore, I am sure that this topic should take place in the cache of search engines. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Sierra Wireless AirPrime MC7710 LTE / HSPA + </h4><br><ul><li>  LTE <b>800/900/1800/2100/2600</b> * MHz </li><li>  WCDMA 900/2100 MHz </li><li>  EDGE / GPRS / GSM 900/1800/1900 </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://www.sierrawireless.com/productsandservices/AirPrime/Wireless_Modules/High-speed/MC7710.aspx">full specifications</a> <br><br>  * <i>LTE 2600 FDD, Band 7 (2500-2530 MHz / 2620-2650 MHz) is used by Yota and virtual operators MegaFon and MTS</i> <br><br>  I ordered my module <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/UNLOCKED-NEW-Sierra-Wireless-4G-LTE-HSPA-module-MC7710-/321067279685%3Fpt%3DLH_DefaultDomain_0%26hash%3Ditem4ac119e545">on ebay</a> for $ 260.  Please note that these modules are often locked to a specific operator.

I was planning to connect a MMCX-f pigtail on IPX U.FL to this connector in order to bring the MMCX connector to the case and connect an external GPS antenna that I have to it. <br>  But unfortunately these pigtails have not reached me yet.  So I plugged in a film Wi-Fi antenna that you see in the image on the left (just to try). <br>  Looking ahead, I will say that GPS did not predictably work for me.  Therefore, I will tell you about GPS on this module another time, when I have everything I need. <br>  I connected the U.FL RP-SMA-f pigtail to the AUX connector to which Wi-Fi / WiMax antennas will <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/106196/">traditionally</a> be connected in the future. <br><br>  Then the fun begins. <br>  The Sierra Wireless website cannot download drivers and AirCard Watcher for this model.  Utility Sierra Watcher allows you to configure the device, manually select the network, select the preferred range (2G / 3G / LTE), include GPS and much more.  SierraWatcher also contains the necessary drivers.  To find the right version of Watcher, I had to sweat a lot.  To make it easier for followers, I post the <a href="">Sierra Watcher</a> file <a href="">for MC7710</a> in convenient access. <br><br><blockquote>  To connect to Megafonovsky LTE, I had to go through a small quest. </blockquote><br><h4>  What you really need to do to connect to Megafon LTE * </h4><br><ol><li>  You need to get a special SIM card called U-SIM.  Your SIM card should be changed for free on a U-SIM at any subscriber service office. </li><li>  You need to ask you to connect the Internet L 4G, Internet XL 4G or Internet XXL 4G tariff option.  <a href="http://4g.moscow.megafon.ru/%3Ffrom%3Dservice">more about tariffs</a> </li><li>  <i>And turn on LTE</i> . </li></ol><br>  <i>* If you already have a working LTE device with a Megaphone SIM card, this does not concern you</i> <br><br><h6>  Grunt </h6><br>  Theoretically, this can be done independently, through the <a href="http://sg.megafon.ru/">Service Guide</a> .  But in practice, LTE will not work, because there is some option that allows you to register on the Megafon LTE network, but only Megaphone employees at the service office or call center operators can turn it on.  Practice has shown that few people understand this issue in the subscriber service.  As a result, after I received a U-SIM and connected the Internet XXL tariff option through a service guide, I was assured in the call center that 4G should work for me, and I fought with drivers, Watchers and AT for a whole day without success. -commands.  In the evening, when I arrived at the service office, I shared my problem and asked me to demonstrate that my SIM card can connect to LTE with at least some device.  But an employee of the operator took my passport, went into the settings of my account in a megaphone, sighed sadly, said that I had not turned on that very magic option of LTE, which I myself could not turn on.  After that, everything worked fine for me. <br><br><h4>  What you need to do to connect to Yota </h4><br><ol><li>  You need to flash the modem with this thing: <a href="">Yota firmware for MC7710</a> . </li><li>  Go to where they sell the equipment Yota (suitable stand in the mall), and get a Yota SIM card. </li><li>  To persuade Yota employees to make the initial registration of a SIM card on the Yota network.

Obviously my built-in 3G antenna is not at all suitable for the 2600 range, but the Planet 5dbi Wi-Fi antenna provides excellent speed. <br>  Because, as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/drunken/" class="user_link">drunken</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/106196/">said</a> , ‚ÄúWafer antennas ... have low efficiency, but work in a wide range.‚Äù And 2.6 GHz from 2.4 GHz is not that far :) <br>  Personally, I like the fact that I can experiment with antennas in the presence of a convenient coaxial connector and pleases my umpc's trumpet view <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/724/9ac/9aa/7249ac9aa0811aaa089e9712ff378dc8.png" alt="image">  . <br>  For those who don‚Äôt want such a <i>thing</i> sticking out of his laptop, a suitable solution would be to connect an aerial Wi-Fi antenna to the aux connector, such as the one I connected to the GPS. <br>  I will not give tests with an external antenna and without it, because the difference looks like ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt work at all / how it works!‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Testing* </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Carrier </td><td>  Megaphone 3G (HSPA +) </td><td>  Megaphone 4G (LTE) </td><td>  Yota 4G (LTE) </td></tr><tr><td>  Ping </td><td>  78ms </td><td>  36ms </td><td>  35ms </td></tr><tr><td>  Download </td><td>  5.41Mbit </td><td>  13.95Mbit </td><td>  15.18Mbit </td></tr><tr><td>  Upload </td><td>  0.70Mbit </td><td>  1.77Mbit </td><td>  1.22Mbit </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>* was carried out with the help of the site speedtest.net on Monday February 11, at about 22.00 in the 5th district of Zelenograd.</i> <br><br><h4>  Windows Mobile Broadband </h4><br>  Excellent technology that allows you to use this modem without running a native application, which in my opinion is not very aesthetic.
