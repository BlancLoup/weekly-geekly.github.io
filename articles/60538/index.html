      It seems to me that there are few such people for whom Yandex.News is associated with a news resource.  And I am sure that there are no subscribers to the RSS news feed, because I myself decided to use it. <br><br>  The amount of RSS news for yesterday: <br>  Yandex.News: Economy - 122 <br>  Yandex.News: Politics - 114 <br>  Yandex.News: Science - 72 <br>  Yandex news: Society - 111 <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For comparison <br>  Lenta.ru - 147 (total number of news on the resource) <br>  RIA: Economy - 73 <br>  RIA: Politics - 23 <br><br>  Perhaps Yandex sends so much news because it collects them from all resources. <br><br>  I go to the ‚ÄúPolitics‚Äù section: 21 news (out of 114) about the DPRK.  Open links, each in a new window.  It turns out that there are only 6 news items in the newsletter, the rest are a repeat (everyone‚Äôs headlines are different - they lead to one page).  With other news, the situation is similar: the total number per day tends to 30. Another 80 are duplicates. <br><br>  <strong>I hope this error will be fixed soon.</strong> <br><br>  I open the first available news page ... but there is no news.  There is a choice, presented in the form of links with a preview of 3 identical articles, and a list of "news stories."  Democratic. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/26/09/45/3773996_648x354.PNG"><br><br>  It remains to verify what the choice is offered.  I open everything in a new window.  Half of the articles with links to ITAR-TASS or RIA Novosti.  Wonderful, the source is at the end of the list.  Duplicates are slowly shifting it down, claiming ‚Äúbreaking news.‚Äù  (The question of authorship still concerns and <a href="http://www.lenta.ru/news/2009/03/23/parasites/">Western companies</a> ). <br><br>  By the way, it would be logical if the whole chronology of events was located in the plot, instead of references to identical articles. <br><br>  We get: <br>  1) Redundancy RSS feeds; <br>  2) When you click on the link of interest, a list of sources appears, instead of the news itself; <br>  3) The link to the article should be searched inside the text of the preview; <br>  4) The original source is lost among duplicates, of which there are many; <br>  5) In the plot, instead of the development of events, we get a set of identical articles. <br><br>  It may be a coincidence, but there is no logo on Lebedev‚Äôs studio on the selected news page. <br><br>  If you believe <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/yandex/49397/">this</a> post, the number of transitions to the source is small (of course, depends on the topic). <br><br>  And all from the fact that Yandex processes data automatically. <br><br>  And wherever possible, this is indicated.  Moreover, a <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/faq.html">FAQ has been</a> created for those who may have complaints.  One can learn from it that there can be typos in the news, and even some ‚Äúterrible news N‚Äù can be located on the main page. <br><br>  Reading the FAQ, the thought arises that the absence of an editor is something fundamental.  Perhaps this desire to please all publishers. <br><br>  I do not know about the rest, but I got the impression of a big news dump.  Moreover, on the page <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/about.html">‚ÄúAbout the project‚Äù</a> it is written, only in more decent words. <br><br>  Yandex is not a news resource.  And employees in all interviews like to repeat that Yandex is a search engine. <br><br>  This may be so, but the board of directors and major shareholders are unlikely to think also (most likely they think broader). <br><br>  As a user, I can conclude: Yandex provides the most inconvenient news processing among competitors (Rambler does not count). <br><br>  When you try to receive news from a non-news resource, a state of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581">cognitive dissonance</a> arises. <br><br>  To solve the problem of "heaps" in the news, you need to constantly improve the algorithms.  And this, apart from the enormous cost of resources, time. <br><br>  One simple solution is to include editors in the news processing. <br><br>  You can tighten the rules for working with partners (they are unlikely to be happy).  Develop a mechanism and protocol for receiving news, where, in particular, the source will be indicated in order to eliminate duplication.  And violators to fine, up to the termination of the affiliate program. <br><br>  In this case, it will be possible to get to the article from the main page, or at least to preview the article, with reference to the source without informational garbage. <br><br>  At this stage of my development, I cannot imagine that a system of this level could function ideally without human participation. <br><br>  <em>(Interestingly, company employees use their products?)</em> <br><br>  In the same topic <em>(so as not to start a separate topic)</em> I would like to draw attention to the following situation. <br>  This is a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/usabilitylab/blog/58733/">heat map of Google and Yandex search results (UsabilityLab)</a> . <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/05/26/09/47/3774045_622x218.JPG"><br><br>  There are several doubts about the authenticity of this picture.  BUT‚Ä¶ <br><br>  It turns out that in the general case, if both search engines produce the same results (ideal case), then there is a purely subjective feeling of the advantage of issuing Google.  Only because on the Yandex page useful information can be contained in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãreduced attention. <br><br>  I hope the company staff will leave a comment. <br><br>  And of course, I would like to receive a detailed answer why the editorial group is missing in the news system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60538/</a></p>
