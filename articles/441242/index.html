  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Communication Network Monitoring Center: New State "Defender" of Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the coming months, the Russian government will create a new structure that is accountable to Roskomnadzor - the <b>Center for Monitoring and Management of the Public Use</b> Network (TsMUSSOP).  The corresponding decree has already been signed, <a href="https://iz.ru/848412/pavel-panov-angelina-galanina/napisano-sviaziu-pravitelstvo-nachnet-kontrolirovat-internet">told</a> Izvestia in the cabinet office.  Moreover, this is a planned action in the framework of the overall efforts to ensure the autonomous operation of the Runet in isolation.  Such a structure was mentioned in the ‚Äúsovereign Internet‚Äù bill. <br><br>  The main function of TsMUSSOP: ‚Äúsummarizing and processing the traffic of domestic telecom operators and government data transmission systems to ensure the security of the Russian Internet segment‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to the prepared draft law, the Monitoring Center should be established before July 1, and the system itself should be created by January 1, 2020.  Organizational issues lie on Roskomnadzor, in the structure of which the new division will be included. <br><br>  Apparently, TsMUSSOP will carry out part of the tasks that the autonomous Internet legislation imposes on Roskomnadzor.  Recall that the bill imposes new obligations on telecom operators and owners of traffic exchange points and gives additional powers to Roskomnadzor.

      In particular, telecom operators are obliged to: <br><br><ol><li>  Follow the routing rules established by Roskomnadzor. </li><li>  Correct routing as requested by Roskomnadzor. </li><li>  When resolving domain names, use software and hardware approved by Roskomnadzor, as well as the national domain name system. </li><li>  Use only traffic exchange points from the traffic exchange registry. </li><li>  To promptly inform Roskomnadzor about their network addresses, telecommunication message routes, software and hardware tools used to resolve domain names and communication network infrastructure. </li></ol><br>  Article 66.1 of the Law "On Communications" is proposed to supplement including the following words: "In cases of threats to the integrity, stability and security of the functioning of the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation and the public <b>telecommunications network, the</b> federal authority may <b>centrally manage the public telecommunications network</b> executive authorities responsible for the control and supervision of mass media, mass communications, information technology and communications in a certain Pr  Government of the Russian Federation, which includes, inter alia, measures to eliminate threats to the integrity, stability and security of operating the Internet and public telecommunications networks in the Russian Federation ... Centralized management of the public telecommunications network is carried out by managing technical means of countering threats and ( or) by transferring binding instructions to telecom operators, owners or owners of technological communication networks, as well as to other persons who have  autonomous system number. " <br><br>  As stated in the explanatory note, ‚Äúthe draft federal law has been prepared taking into account the aggressive nature of the US National Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity Strategy adopted in September 2018‚Äù. <br><br>  By May 1, 2019, the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Communications should determine what information the CMSSR should analyze within its authority.  By this date, the agency must submit a draft federal law and regulations required to perform the declared functions. <br><br>  Until January 1, 2020, it is necessary to coordinate with the FSB the rules for the interaction of the new structure with digital state systems, including the segment of detection, prevention and elimination of the consequences of computer attacks. <br><br>  What exactly will the new organization do is not quite clear.  Obviously, this is due to the analysis of traffic in some form.  Former presidential adviser German Klimenko believes that monitoring networks is an important task: you need to understand how to monitor the traffic flow map within Russia within a huge country.  And the press service of TransTeleCom believes that the innovations will make it possible to combat the ‚Äúgray schemes‚Äù of traffic through the state border by operators registered, including in the near abroad. <br><br>  But as a whole, TsMUSSOP should ensure the integrity and security of communication networks: ‚ÄúAt present, there is no single technical system that automatically performs the operational collection, processing and analysis of information about the topology of communication networks, traffic flow, and emergency situations.  Creating a center for monitoring public communication networks solves several system tasks, ‚Äùa source in one of the relevant departments told Izvestia. <br><br>  Independent experts are skeptical about the introduction of another supervisory government structure: ‚ÄúIt will not lead to anything good.  Somehow, operators should not be controlled, and the Internet will continue to exist without regulators and advisers.  This is simply the use of resources by people who want to do this, therefore, they come up with various activities, ‚Äùsays Mikhail Braude-Zolotarev, director of the Center for IT Research and Expertise of the RANEPA. <br><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jy/sd/rr/jysdrr7tqgfjt50wtcshw89ctho.png" align="left"><h3>  Minute of care from UFO </h3><br>  This material could cause contradictory feelings, so before writing a comment, refresh something important in your memory: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How to write a comment and survive</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Do not write abusive comments, do not go to the person. </li><li>  Refrain from using obscene language and toxic behavior (even in a veiled form). </li><li>  To report comments that violate the rules of the site, use the "Report" button (if available) or <a href="https://habr.com/feedback/%3Ftype%3D4">a feedback form</a> . </li></ul><br>  What to do if: <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/karma/">minus karma</a> |  <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/sandbox/">blocked account</a> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">Code of authors Habra</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/other/">habraetiket</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/rules/">Full site rules</a> </div></div></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441242/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441242/</a></p>
