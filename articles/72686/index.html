  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My personal little war</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Tell me about my collision with the forces of Evil in the face of unfair service.  Although in this case they are not even unscrupulous, but simply ... strange. <br><br>  Explanation of the number of times: There is nothing unique in the existential experience described below, anyone who has to deal with the repair of their equipment under warranty can encounter this.  But I decided to post a post, in case it turned out to be useful to anyone.  Why did you write just now?  Well ... hands did not reach. <br>  Explanation number two: Despite the style of the narration, all the dialogues took place in quite adequate and polite tones, at least on my part.  Because the abuse for any reason I prefer to leave the nouveau riche and the boys.  I clarify in order not to create the appearance of a cad who is ‚Äúguilty of himself‚Äù. <br><br>  So, it all started with the fact that in my small family business I needed a photo printer / MFP.  Moreover, it normally supports the CISS (continuous ink supply system), that is, it has a separate print head and fixed ink tanks.  At the same time - relatively inexpensive and as convenient as possible.  There were more optional requirements, like an ethernet port, a card reader ... For me, all this was found in the face of the HP Photosmart C5183.  He also has an ‚Äúolder brother‚Äù who can print on CDs, but I consider this an unnecessary excess.

      At the time of the emergence of urgent need, this thing could be obtained only in one place - in M-Video.  Although I do not think that computers and peripherals should be bought in this home appliance store, there was nowhere to go.  Do not order this fool from another city, right?  Came, bought, went to the office, use. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And then a terrible thing happened - the printer refused to recognize the ink tanks.  That is, at the beginning it looked like a regular error ‚Äúlow level, replace‚Äù, which is not particularly scary.  Who needs the users to print on the ink tanks included in the delivery, and not to buy new ones?  And the replacement has already been purchased, set and use.  But no, "replace" and that's it.  And then some mysterious error with a long digital code, about which Google and the HP corporate website knew almost nothing, except that it was ‚Äúan internal error, turn off and turn on the printer, or contact the service center‚Äù.  Strange?  And I somehow like ... <br><br>  In any case, the warranty is in place (‚Äúwarranty card inside, filled, warranty check‚Äù).  We are going to SC M-Video, located, according to tradition, at the devil on horns.  And there - surprise number 2 for <s>children</s> : there is no warranty card in the box.  And on the way he could not fall out, I have paranoia for this business, and therefore everything is checked two or three times.  It means that he was not there from the very beginning.  They refused to repair the device, referring to the fact that they were not right, and it would be worth going to the store where they took the device and demand a guarantee from the seller, since he did not put it right away.  Well, yes, right now.  Tell me, can I leave the box with the printer for the duration of my trip?  For I am not in a car, but I have already let the taxi go ... Oh, no!  That is, it is possible, but you are not responsible for it?  Clear. <br><br>  In general, I refused to go.  Because as 1) for what reason, and 2) these are your problems.  The serviceman looked at me, scratched his head, waited five minutes - and what if he did leave?  - and called somewhere to the authorities, after which he began to fill out a new ticket.  Wow. <br>  Further, everything is more or less standard, receiving goods for repairs, issuing a repair voucher, ‚Äúwe will call you‚Äù, ‚Äúwill be soon‚Äù.  Wonderful. <br><br>  It was getting dark.  It was the second week since the start of the repair.  I would even say that the second week has ended.  It stood, the printer was not.  It was already made three calls to the SC, where they explained to me in a rather dissatisfied tone that the maximum repair period is two months (and where did they, interestingly, take this figure?), And they cannot find out the status of this repair itself, because it is not produced of them. <br>  On the fourth call, I became brutalized and demanded the phone of the office where my printer was sent.  Issued - it was ABAK (in Kazan, the main in this case).  I call there, I ask the operator to look for my device: first by the number of the repair coupon, then by the serial number.  Oops - such a product did not come to us, we know nothing, we ask for forgiveness. <br>  Satan finally, calling M-Video help, scoring repairmen on the phone, and very, very politely, not to shout, I wonder what is happening with my device, where it is at all and if I can‚Äôt get the replacement repair time?  Or do you read the excerpt from the law? <br><br>  And then a miracle happened.  I was told that they would call back a bit later ... And an hour later they invited me to take the new device, because the old one cannot be repaired.  Can I pick it up right now?  In your SC?  Oh, thank you, how much joy.  I leave immediately. <br><br>  You know ... It's been several months already, and I'm still wondering what happened to the old printer.  Although the new one works all these months without problems, which is what you want.  But built-in curiosity torments.  At least it‚Äôs good that the new ink tanks were replaced before going to the SC back to the former ones, but I would have to say goodbye to them. <br><br>  I will summarize.  In the pros: a new and normally working printer, moral satisfaction from the victory.  In the minuses: a trip to this abroad of yours (through the whole city), hassle, bureaucracy.  It seems, still remain in the black.  This time. <br><br>  PS Suddenly I remembered.  Do you know that the Consumer Rights Protection Act is interpreted by M-Video managers in such a way that it gives them the right not to return money for ‚Äúsophisticated technical devices‚Äù, including cell phones, PCs, peripherals and the like?  If, of course, the device does not have a malfunction that prevents it from being used.  So I did not know either.  I wonder who teaches them all this? <br>  I feel an urgent need to carry with me a printed full and current version of the ZPP.  And notarized. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72686/</a></p>
