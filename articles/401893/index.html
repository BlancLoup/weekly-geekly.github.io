On our planet for sure.  On some sort of "Gamma Centaurus" everything is possible differently.  With the advent of space exploration, the importance of water for humans has only increased.  Very much depends on H2O in space, starting with the work of the space station itself and ending with the generation of oxygen.  The first spacecraft did not have a closed "water supply" system.  All the water and other "consumables" was taken on board from the very beginning, from Earth.

Carbon dioxide emitted by the animals was removed with the help of KPI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1b/a50/a12/a1ba50a122451c538e5f8a99bf11a1fa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the photo: Belka and Strelka star dogs capsule, in which they returned to Earth.</i> <br>  On board the first artificial earth satellites, the life support systems for dogs included some elements of future life-support systems for astronauts: a meal device, a cesspool device;  purification of the atmosphere and the provision of oxygen was carried out using supraperoxide compounds, which, when absorbing carbon dioxide and water vapor, released oxygen in accordance with the reactions: <br><blockquote>  4KO2 + 2 H2O = 3O2 + 4 KOH <br>  2KON + CO2 = K2 CO3 + H2O <br>  K2 CO3 + H2O + CO2 = 2 KNSO3 <br></blockquote><br>  <b>2. LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS OF BIOLOGICAL SATELLITES OF THE EARTH OF THE TYPE ‚ÄúBION‚Äù AND ‚ÄúPHOTON‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Biological satellites of the Earth - the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/235877/">automatic space vehicles "BION" and "PHOTON"</a> are intended for studying the influence of space flight factors (weightlessness, radiation, etc.) on the animal organism.  It is noteworthy that Russia is essentially the only country in the world that has automatic spacecraft for research on biological objects.  Other countries are forced to send animals into space on our vehicles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b95/9f8/b2d/b959f8b2d758f05f7343ab9e474ffa62.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Over the years, the scientific leaders of the BION program were O.G.</i>  <i>Gazenko and E.A.</i>  <i>Ilyin.</i>  <i>At present, the scientific director of the BION program is OI</i>  <i>Orlov, alternates - E.A.</i>  <i>Ilyin and E.N.</i>  <i>Yarmanova.</i> <br><br>  The biological satellite "BION" is equipped with water supply and animal feeding systems, a thermal and moisture regulation system, a day-night system, a gas composition support system, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/024/8f6/f99/0248f6f9964922d55ece5b2dd29d86b6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The system for ensuring the gas composition of the automatic spacecraft "BION" and "PHOTON" is intended to provide animals with oxygen, remove carbon dioxide and gaseous trace impurities in the descent vehicle. <br><br>  Composition: <br><br>  <i>- cartridges with an oxygen-containing substance and an absorber of harmful trace impurities;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- cartridge with carbon dioxide absorber and harmful trace impurities;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- electric fans;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- sensors for indicating the operability of the fans and the tightness of the gas paths;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- gas analyzer;</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- control unit and control.</i> <br><br>  The system provides comfortable conditions in the gaseous environment of the descent vehicle (closed hermetic volume containing 4.0‚Äì4.5 m3 of air) and consists of three regenerative cartridges and an absorption cartridge with an electric fan for each cartridge, providing air regeneration for CO2, O2, CO and other harmful impurities.  Turning on and off the microcompressors allows you to provide a given composition of the atmosphere of the object. <br><br>  Principle of operation: the air of an object is pumped through a fan through a regenerative cartridge, where it is cleaned of CO2 and harmful impurities and enriched with oxygen. <br><br>  Excess carbon dioxide is removed by periodically turning on the absorption cartridge.  Absorption cartridge also provides cleaning from harmful impurities.  The system works with a control and monitoring unit and a gas analyzer for oxygen and carbon dioxide.  When the partial pressure of oxygen drops to 20.0 kPa, the first regenerative cartridge is activated. <br><br>  If the oxygen partial pressure is greater than or equal to 20.8 kPa, the regenerative cartridge is switched off and switched on again at an oxygen partial pressure of 20.5 kPa.  The inclusion of the second and subsequent cartridges occurs at a partial pressure of oxygen of 20.0 kPa (subject to a fall in concentration), and the previously included cartridges continue to work. <br>  The absorption cartridge is switched on periodically with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 1.0 kPa; it is switched off at a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 0.8 kPa, regardless of the operation of the regenerative cartridge. <br><br>  <b>3.

REGENERATION SYSTEMS OF LIFE SUPPORT ON THE BASIS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES FOR CREWS OF ORBITAL SPACE SALUT, MIR, MKS</b> <br><br>  The operation of life support systems based on reserves of consumable substances taken from the Earth has a significant drawback: their weight and dimensions increase in direct proportion to the duration of the space mission and the number of crew members.  Upon reaching a certain duration of the flight, the life-age system on the basis of reserves may be an obstacle to the implementation of the expedition. <br><br>  The table shows the mass characteristics of LSS, based on stocks of consumable substances in relation to the expedition with a duration of 50, 100 and 500 days for a crew of 6 people: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cd/4d0/563/3cd4d05634073d5ba8854e3c305e58ee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Based on the consumption rates of the main components of the LSS, obtained as a result of long-term practice of long-term orbital flights at the SALUT, MIR and MKS stations (oxygen ‚Äî 0.96 kg / person-day., Drinking water ‚Äî 2.5 kg (man. days., food - 1.75 kg / person days., etc.), it is easy to calculate that the necessary mass reserves for the crew, consisting of 6 - and people in a 500-day flight without taking into account the tare weight and storage systems would be more than 58 tons (see tab.).  In the case of life support systems based on supplies of consumables, it would be necessary to create storage systems for cosmonauts' vital products: feces, urine, condensate of atmospheric moisture, used sanitary and kitchen water, etc. <br><br>  What is in fact difficult to implement or not at all possible (flight to Mars for example). <br><br>  In 1967-1968, a unique annual medical-technical experiment was conducted at the <a href="http://www.imbp.ru/">Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Ministry of Health</a> with the participation of three testers: G.A. Manovtsev, A.N. Bozhko and B.N. Ulybysheva.  In the thermocamera experiment, which lasted 365 days, a biomedical and technical evaluation of a new complex of regenerative life-support systems took place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1e/b54/41b/e1eb5441b466bade609b3ac11c0964d6.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/142/6b9/2a2/1426b92a2228616680f337ade0cc4811.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The LSS of the ground-level laboratory complex included: <br><blockquote>  <i>carbon dioxide removal system, atmospheric cleaning system from harmful trace impurities,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>oxygen generation system, water recovery system from moisture-containing products of vital functions of testers, sanitary and hygienic equipment, greenhouse, system of instrumentation equipment.</i> </blockquote><br>  Experimental regeneration life support systems based on physicochemical processes, tested in an annual medical and technical experiment, were the prototype of the standard LSS for crews of the Salyut, MIR and MKS orbital stations. <br><br>  For the first time in the world practice of manned flights on the Salyut-4 space station, the CPB-K regeneration system operated ‚Äî a system for obtaining drinking water from condensate by an atmosphere of moisture.  The crew consisting of A. A. Gubarev and G. M. Grechko used the water regenerated in the ‚ÄúSRV-K‚Äù system for drinking and preparing food and drinks.  The system operated during the entire manned flight of the station.  Similar systems such as SRV-K operated at the Salyut-6, Salyut-7, and MIR stations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be8/b5b/670/be8b5b670e45fb5ae90cd6aab34a1c7a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Note</i>  <i>02.28.17: thanks for the help in editing and understanding the etymology of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/artyums/" class="user_link">artyums</a></i> <br><br>  <u>Retreat:</u> <br>  On February 20, 1986, the Soviet <a href="https://youtu.be/nvILKNTqrAg">Mir</a> space station entered orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b78/50a/15a/b7850a15aa9842d63df49968746fa686.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  March 23, 2001, it was <a href="https://youtu.be/PRMPd-aolQQ">flooded</a> in the Pacific Ocean. <br><br>  Our station "Mir" flooded when she was 15 years old.  Now the two Russian modules that are part of the ISS are already too 17. But no one is going to sink the ISS yet ... <br><br>  The efficiency of the use of regeneration systems has been confirmed by the experience of many years of operation, for example, the MIR orbital station, on board of which the LSS subsystems successfully operated, such as: <br><br>  <i>SRV-K is a system for the regeneration of water from atmospheric moisture condensate,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"SRV-U" - the system of water recovery from urine (urine),</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"SPK-U" - a system for receiving and preserving urine (urine),</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Electron is an oxygen generation system based on water electrolysis,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Air is a carbon dioxide removal system</i> <i><br></i>  <i>"BMP" - block removal of harmful trace impurities, etc.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1ee/e70/b6d/1eee70b6de511f8f9052340c4627ae80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Similar regeneration systems (with the exception of the "SRV-U") are currently operating successfully on board the International Space Station (ISS). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/783/9c5/bcc/7839c5bccc2521f3c2ccdeb1b6619d8c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The structure of the life support system (coolant-cutting fluid) of the ISS includes the gas composition support subsystem (SGS).  Composition: means of controlling and regulating atmospheric pressure, means of pressure equalization, equipment for depressurization and pressurization of PSO, gas analysis equipment, system for removing harmful impurities from the BMP, system for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚ÄúAir‚Äù, means for cleaning the atmosphere.  An integral part of the SOGS is the oxygen supply means, including solid fuel oxygen sources (TIC) and the system for producing oxygen from Electron-VM water.  At the start-up, there was only 120 kg of air and two solid-fuel TGK oxygen generators on board the SM. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://space-start.net/online.html">Live online broadcast from webcam to ISS.</a> <br><br>  <i>To deliver 30,000 liters of water on board the MIR and MKS orbital stations, it would be necessary to organize an additional 12 launches of the Progress transport ship, the payload of which is 2.5 tons.</i>  <i>If we take into account the fact that the Progresses are equipped with spring water tanks of 420 l capacity, then the number of additional launches of the Progress transport ship would have increased several times.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ba/6aa/254/2ba6aa254bba22551428886b7dd61fc6.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e0/617/fac/5e0617fac79c972172cb9a68d4028323.png" alt="image"><br><br>  On the ISS, zeolite scavengers of the Air system capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and release it into the overboard space.  The oxygen lost in the composition of CO2 is replenished due to the electrolysis of water (decomposition of it into hydrogen and oxygen).  This is done on the ISS by the Electron system, which consumes 1 kg of water per person per day.  Hydrogen is now being dumped overboard, but in the future it will help to convert CO2 into valuable water and methane emitted (CH4).

The productivity of advanced systems has been increased by more than 2 times (it provides the crew with up to 6 people), while energy and mass costs are reduced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/edd/2b8/eb4/edd2b8eb4b1365742ea3175942e78c9a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Over the five-year period <b>(data for 2006) of</b> their operation, 6.8 tons of water, 2.8 tons of oxygen were regenerated, which made it possible to reduce the mass of cargo delivered to the station by more than 11 tons. <br><br>  The delay in the inclusion of the system for the recovery of water from urine CPB-UM into the LSS complex did not allow for the regeneration of 7 tons of water and reduce the mass of delivery. <br><br><h3>  "Second Front" - Americans </h3><br>  The <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/104840main_eclss.pdf">process</a> water from the American <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/104840main_eclss.pdf">ECLSS</a> apparatus <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/104840main_eclss.pdf">is</a> supplied to the Russian system and the American OGS (Oxygen Generation System), where it is then ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù into oxygen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/469/a23/0c1/469a230c196c4d805223274fd022ffc6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The process of recovering water from urine is a difficult technical task: <i>‚ÄúUrine is much dirtier than water vapor</i> ,‚Äù explains Carrascillo, <i>‚ÄúIt is capable of corroding metal parts and littering pipes.‚Äù</i>  The <a href="https://youtu.be/iht75kq0RrU">ECLSS</a> system uses a process called vapor compression distillation to cleanse urine: the urine is boiled until the water turns into steam.  Steam - naturally purified water in the vapor state (with the exception of traces of ammonia and other gases) - rises into the distillation chamber, leaving concentrated brown mud of impurities and salts, which Carrascillo mercifully calls "brine" (which is then thrown into outer space).  The steam is then cooled and the water is condensed.  The distillate obtained is mixed with moisture condensed from the air and filtered to a state suitable for drinking.  The ECLSS system is able to recover 100% of moisture from air and 85% of water from urine, which corresponds to a total efficiency of about 93%. <br><br>  Described above, however, refers to the operation of the system in terrestrial conditions.  An additional complexity appears in space - the steam does not rise up: it is not able to rise into the distillation chamber.  Therefore, in the ECLSS model for the ISS, <i>"... we rotate the distillation system to create artificial gravity to separate the pairs and the brine</i> ," explains Carrascillo. <br><br>  <u>Perspectives:</u> <br>  Attempts to obtain synthetic carbohydrates from the cosmonauts vital activity products for the conditions of space expeditions are known according to the scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa3/123/56b/aa312356b55175458786fff78c6d18be.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to this scheme, waste products are burned to form carbon dioxide, from which methane is formed as a result of hydrogenation ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5">Sabatier reaction</a> ).
