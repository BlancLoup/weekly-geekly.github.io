  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Even the illusion of progress increases motivation.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Article from the series "100 things you need to know about people." <br><br><img src="http://img59.imageshack.us/img59/92/thecoffeecard.jpg" alt="coffee card"><br><br>  In the local cafe you were given a regular customer card.  Every time you buy coffee, you put a stamp in it.  When the card is full, you get a cup for free.  Consider two different scenarios: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Card A: There are</b> 10 squares on the card for stamps, and when you receive it, they are all empty. <br>  <b>Card B: There are</b> 12 squares on the card for stamps, and when you get a card, two are already stamped. <br>  <b>Question.</b>  <b>How long will it take you to fill out a card?</b>  Will it happen faster under scenario A or B?  In the end, you need to buy 10 cups of coffee in both cases to get one for free.  So if the difference is, what card do you use? <br><br>  Apparently the answer is yes, there is.  You will fill out card B more quickly than A. This is called the ‚Äúgoal-gradient‚Äù effect. <br><br>  He was studied by <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA">Clark Hull</a> in 1934 on rats.  He found that the rats run faster through the maze with food, the closer they are to the end of the maze, where the food (cheese) is located. <br><br>  The effect of approaching the goal says that <b>you accelerate your activity as you approach the goal.</b>  The scenarios that the author described above were part of a study by Ren Rivets, Oleg Urminsky, and Yuhuang Zheng.  They decided to see if people would behave like rats :) And the answer is yes, they will. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here are a few important things to remember about the effect of approaching a goal: <br>  1. The smaller the distance to the target, the higher the motivation of people ( <b>Carrots should be hung as close as possible</b> , as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/travisbickle/" class="user_link">travisbickle</a> wonderfully formulated). <br>  2. You can achieve greater motivation even at the expense of the illusion of progress as in scenario B. After all, in fact, there is no progress there.  You still have to buy 10 cups of coffee.  And it looks like there is progress, so the effect is the same. <br>  3. People like to take part in reward programs.  Compared to customers who did not participate in them, customers with prize cards smiled more often, communicated more with the cafe staff, thanked and left comments more often. <br>  4. In a related experiment, the same researchers showed that people more often go to the site and vote for the songs, the closer they are to the prize goal of the site.  Thus, the effect of approaching the goal is generalized for many situations. <br>  5. Motivation and sales fall as soon as the goal is achieved.  This is called the ‚Äúpost-prize reset phenomenon‚Äù.  Immediately after the reward is reached - this is the most risky moment when you can lose a client. <br><br>  Suppose you have two levels of rewards.  People, having received the first award, reduce their interest, and then again activate their efforts when they begin to approach the second award. <br><br>  <b>And more numbers.</b>  Clients who received cards with 2 stamps out of 12 filled them on average in 10 days, and customers who received ordinary cards for 10 stamps, in 15 days. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/100783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/100783/</a></p>
