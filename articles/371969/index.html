  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Home archeology or forgotten artifacts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, examining the mezzanine (although this process, both in action and in emotional intensity, is rather similar to what Dr. Jones experienced when touching the marble chest of a statue in the presence of a beautiful woman) I discovered something among various artifacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/2ee/44b/d972ee44b71e4650972d48270f2b34f0.JPG"><br><br>  Those who did not immediately guess what it is, welcome under the cut (the pictures are large. Traffic, if it is important to whom). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is it?  It looks like a usual hand magnifier or, in scientific terms, a magnifying glass.  In my childhood, with the help of such a tool, a bright sun and a caught grasshopper cockroach, very interesting experiments were conducted.  But this is only in appearance.  The presence of two red and green LEDs is alarming, and the presence of a tape head from below can completely confuse a modern researcher.

And, judging by the size of the head, this one is not from a simple tape recorder, which on compact cassettes and which in my early childhood is already quite traditionally included in life, but from a reel tape recorder.  There were such monsters where, in order to listen to music, it was necessary to carry out some manipulations on filling the tape among rollers, and the aesthetes noted the excerpts like pieces of pieces of paper inserted into the film on a reel.  In general, there is a whole theme here according to the traditions of the aboriginal generation of the yellow submarine.  Well, you understand what I mean. <br><br>  After an external inspection of the artifact, there appeared some suspicions of what it is.  Surely.  Somewhere in the 91st year, new words and terms entered our lives tightly.  Three magical words ‚ÄúBucks‚Äù, ‚ÄúBundesses‚Äù, ‚ÄúChukhonka‚Äù settled among them for a long enough period.  In other words, it was a currency.  The currency in those days caused the same paralyzing effect.  Like, there is the usual money - rubles.  And there are - these.  What is the reason, it is difficult now to say when the currency has become just one of the ordinary attributes of our life.  You do not respond to the microwave in the kitchen, even if you do not use it.  There is.  But then ... However, then the microwave caused feelings or almost not easier.  Those who had it.  Personally, I was able to get hold of such a thing only in 2000.  Before it was somehow expensive.  And the currency ... Perhaps it was due to the criminal image of currency in the USSR.  How did the shooting article for illegal operations.  Therefore, to hold the bill of the likely adversary in their hands reminded me ‚Äúfrom the war did not hold military weapons in their hands‚Äù.  Although, as in the movie, it was not a military weapon, but a psychological one.  But beating right on target. <br><br>  Of course, with the advent of the currency appeared and its fakes.  Although, to be honest, personally, I only saw $ 100 fake.  In this case, they could only deceive such a naive guy like me.  I saw this bill in the year of 1995. The bill was made on a color copier, and the relief was packed using extrusion.  But it was done masterfully for the hands and eyes of the inhabitant.  Outwardly, everything is OK and, if you grasp the edge of the bill with your fingers from above and drag it through them, the necessary tuberosity was felt.  But when I was told that these bumps were not entirely real, there was no limit to my insight.  And it was something to be surprised.  Neither before nor after the fakes, I have not seen.  But the currency in those days was very much.  I received a salary in it, I bought computers, cars, etc. for it.  Those.  She was.  But here I personally practically did not come across fakes. <br><br>  Apparently, I was just lucky.  And this device - the answer to the request of the consumer at the time.  It is nothing more than a currency detector.  With this completely homemade.  Let's open it soon to see what's inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bae/a9d/1cf/baea9d1cf18e4d189ae5a85ba6869306.JPG"><br><br>  Oh, this is an engineering marvel of the time.  And even with protection against unauthorized copying.  Which one  But take a look.  This technique was used very widely in the homemade products of that time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/eac/4c3/6f6eac4c3be541ab937d43663694488f.jpg"><br><br>  See also how pretty everything is assembled.  Everything is more or less carefully assembled, presumably filled with hot melt, but I think this is some kind of resin. <br><br>  And these details.  Look, these transparent diodes.  What are they mimishnye.  And resistors with a nominal value applied to them?  Not fashionable now colored rings, namely the nominal value and wattage.  When soldering a face value to the board ... Yes, so no one soldered.  This is worse than going over the bar in the gym. <br><br>  The absence of the element base was more than compensated by the creative flight of thought.  No boxing for batteries?  And that set of ‚Äúpills‚Äù is nothing more than D-0.06 batteries.  Nothing wrong.  An unknown architect of this miracle offered a version of his own boxing with a slimming cog for better contact.  What kind of headscarf?  It is not even washed to the end.  Such is the professional negligence.  The button holder is also beyond praise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/552/4a9/94f/5524a994feb1419481f2c1b692125b93.JPG"><br><br>  In general, everything is beautiful in this product.  How to make a device from branches, plasticine and blue tape (where can it be without it?) That can save a currency trader from surprises.  Well, or convince the "sucker" that the whisker is normal, soaring.  Take the bucks and run.  Yes, do not forget to put a candle that everything is normal this time ... However, I got carried away with something. <br><br>  Run this miracle failed.  More precisely, it was possible, but there is nothing to check.  I do not hold cash currency.  Somehow there is nothing to me now.  Therefore, we managed to verify that the thing is alive.  I fed it 5 volts and pressed a button (only the bottom of the button is visible on the photo, and the device itself has a button on the belly).  The green LED lights up.  I took a bill of 500 rubles and pulled it around with a magnetic head.  Nothing.  Tinkering still.  Wow, the red LED lights up.  Yeah, hands remember something.  Not dollars you slipped me, my dear man, not dollars.  But that's all. <br><br>  What I did not understand is the appointment of a circular line between the LEDs with the inscription EVS.  Perhaps this is sound dynamics.  But this is only an assumption. <br><br>  So, my children, your fathers-mothers in the already distant 90s made tentative steps in the world of currency and its cheaters on the basis of improvised means. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371969/</a></p>
