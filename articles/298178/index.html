  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Taxi companies in Russia have begun a legal struggle against Uber and its counterparts, comments from companies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Representatives of Russian public and non-profit organizations in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe taxi business declare the start of a ‚Äúlarge-scale campaign‚Äù against the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> taxi service and similar services operating in Russia. <br><br>  The document is signed by the following people: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/175/ca1/fc3/175ca1fc3d0086ae16db5cf45a57345c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Stanislav Schwagerus and Viktor Solovyov in an interview with Rusbase confirmed the authenticity of the document.  ‚ÄúUber in this case is a collective concept.  All [similar services] rules are completely contrary to the current legislation, ‚Äùsaid Schwagerus. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚Äú‚Äú Aggregators ‚Äù, guided solely by internal rules, which in a number of key positions do not comply with federal legislation, evade taxes and shift the entire burden for the performance of services and responsibility for it exclusively to taxi drivers.  The height of the lawlessness of the activities of the American company Uber in Russia is its work under the laws of the Netherlands, ‚Äùthe memorandum says.

      Because of this, the authors of the document write, jobs, social and labor guarantees are eliminated, the state ceases to receive taxes, and the automotive industry - corporate orders for new cars for taxis.  Because of the forced reduction in costs, the security of a taxi also suffers, the memorandum says, which is why ‚Äúin the cities, on the roads of the country, dozens of taxi passengers are dying every day.‚Äù <br><br>  Within six months, the drafters of the document intend to implement two tasks, ‚Äúaimed at improving the socio-economic status of drivers‚Äù: <br><blockquote>  1. To involve the executive authorities in each subject of the Russian Federation to revise and bring the rules of taxi activity into compliance with federal legislation.  This "will lead to a more equitable redistribution of income" between the classic taxi and services like Uber, the document says; <br><br>  2. Use a taxi for ‚Äútransport service of government agencies at all levels‚Äù and thus increase the demand for taxi services.  ‚ÄúThis measure will also allow minimizing government spending on the purchase and rental of vehicles for official use by officials,‚Äù the authors of the document believe. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúOn the first point in Moscow, the Department of Transport is already working, on the second, the All-Russian Popular Front is looking for ways to limit officials,‚Äù <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/manifest-protiv-uber/">said</a> Schwagerus Rusbase. <br><br>  The department‚Äôs official response states that ‚Äúthe largest dispatch services for calling a taxi were requested to provide documents regulating the provision of services to the public, as well as justifications for the compliance of these documents with federal legislation. <br><br>  At the moment, Sergey is also engaged in organizing a taxi strike against Uber in Paris. <br><br>  In August 2015, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of the Russian Federation did not reveal signs of violations of antimonopoly legislation by the online services Uber, <a href="http://gett.com/ru/">Gett</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581.%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8">Yandex.Taxi</a> . <br><br>  On January 18, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23382/">wrote</a> that London taxi drivers launched a crowdfunding campaign to ‚Äúdrive‚Äù Uber from the city.  They plan to collect a crowdfunding site <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/Action-for-Cabbies">www.crowdfunder.co.uk/Action-for-Cabbies</a> about 600 thousand pounds (about $ 850 thousand).  This is enough to cover the costs of applying for a review of the decision of the authorities on licensing and regulating Uber. <br><br>  According to them, a taxi service in London is still semi-legal.  Uber and traditional taxi drivers are regulated differently and are not in a single legal field. <br><br>  The price policy of Uber is reduced, by and large, to banal dumping, London taxi drivers believe.  Well, in the race called ‚Äúwho is cheaper‚Äù the advantage of Uber is obvious. <br><br>  We contacted Uber and Gett for comments, asking the following questions: <br><br>  <b>-</b> Why is it insane if the FAS did not reveal anything? <br>  <b>-</b> Are there really problems or "white spots" in the legislation of the Russian Federation? <br>  <b>-</b> Do you think that taxis are doomed, and the taxi driver's profession is no more? <br><br>  <b>Evgenia Shipova</b> , the official representative of Uber in Russia: <blockquote>  1. Uber has a dialogue with representatives of regulators in all countries where the application is available, and Russia is no exception. <br><br>  2. Uber is a mobile application connecting users and drivers.  Uber drivers are independent partners, legal entities or individual entrepreneurs who work in accordance with Russian legislation.  Uber provides new economic opportunities for its partners.  Cooperation with Uber has become a source of additional income for thousands of partners.  Among the main reasons why partners choose to cooperate with Uber include: <br><br>  FLEXIBILITY: partners work in the system when they see fit.  The system does not involve shifts and a minimum number of hours of work.  According to our research, 87% of partners choose Uber because of the possibility of flexible cooperation. <br><br>  TRANSPARENCY: Travel payments are made automatically by wire transfer on a weekly basis.  Uber provides complete payout reporting to facilitate administrative procedures. </blockquote><br>  Gett representatives sent us to previous reports of the company regarding compliance of its activities with the legislation of the Russian Federation: <blockquote>  LLC ‚ÄúGetTaxi Rus‚Äù (hereinafter, Gett) is a Russian legal entity that is not a branch or representative office of a foreign company.  LLC "GetTaxi Rus" conducts its activities in compliance with all laws of the Russian Federation and carries out the payment of all taxes stipulated by the current legislation of the Russian Federation.  Regular inspections of state bodies revealed no irregularities in the company's activities, including in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtax legislation. <br><br>  Gett works only with licensed carriers - taxi companies or individual entrepreneurs in all cities of its presence, namely: in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Sochi, Krasnodar, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Samara and Rostov-on-Don.  The principles of the company and its activities are aimed at the development and stimulation of consumer demand for the services of licensed carriers. <br><br>  This is facilitated by the tariff policy, which allows the consumer to order a licensed taxi quickly and at an affordable price.  Official carriers receive a greater number of orders and, due to the increasing demand, displace illegal players from the market, helping to make the taxi industry as civilized as possible. <br><br>  The representatives of Gett explained that the company has no additional payments - the driver and the passenger have a different tariff schedule (the driver is paid a fixed 20 minute trip, and the passengers have a per minute fare from the first minute). </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298178/</a></p>
