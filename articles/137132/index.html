In the cloud utilities, not only recording metering devices (which the previous author put pressure on), but also transparency, Internet rooms, payment and disassembly, the subscriber arranges sitting on the couch with a credit card and video camera, management team reduces staff, PCO repairs networks and eliminates leaks, information is transparent, available and collected in one place, accounting is available, money is not stolen.  Seeing this, the management companies are happy - they have automated so much work, they are not strained by tenants with questions and scandals - everything is visible and transparent, the tenants, satisfied with beautiful pictures, say thanks to the management company and vote "for" the president, but ...

    <h5>  Life is a bitch </h5><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, not all so simple.  First, who cares?  In the inspirational topic, the author and most commentators talked about residents, a little about management companies and resource workers, and very little about the state (in general, both the municipal, regional and federal branches of government).  Is there anyone else?  For example, equipment suppliers - those metering devices and GSM-modems, another example - investors who want to add another water utility or boiler room to their holding (we will call this category ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù as a whole).  In total, we have: citizens, government, the Criminal Code and the Republic of North Ossetia, business. <br><br>  Second, consider the question "Who can?".  To build a "cloud utilities" need money (a lot) and power (a lot, because there are still no relevant laws).  Of these interested parties, there are such opportunities: the federal government (or the regional one - if we are talking about communism in a single country cloud housing and public utilities at the regional level of the Russian Federation), and some particularly large RNOs that are closely intertwined with business, such as gas and electricity. <br><br>  The third, most interesting, question is ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù.  Residents, obviously, need transparency in accounting, settlement, payments, it is desirable to still spy on the neighbor - if he didn‚Äôt steal, and whether it fell on them.  In addition, citizens holding "active citizenship" are interested in knowing how popular money is spent in the Criminal Code and what resources the state officials spend on resources.  In some cases, the Criminal Code wants to have work automation and accrual transparency ‚Äî so that citizens are left behind, but do not want to open accounting, so that citizens do not ask unnecessary questions, and especially smart competitors do not look into their pockets.  A plus here is the automated reporting to various authorities / levels of government.  The authorities, respectively, want, in favor of citizens, transparency, the existence of mechanisms to control the activities of the Criminal Code and the RNO and the absence of failures in the system (this, of course, the motives voiced aloud, we will keep silent about the rest).  RNO wants again to control the behavior of the Criminal Code, as well as plan activities, take into account costs, report to all interested parties.  Business, as elsewhere, wants one thing - to explore markets - that is, to know where and on whom it can cut money. <br><br><h5>  And then you die </h5><br><br>  I will not describe the horrors of implementation, disruption of terms and lack of funding, this dear reader has long been familiar with.  This is all more or less solved, and time can be postponed - oh, the problem is so important, and additional investments can be organized - the good is monetary, and there are also enough specialists in the country.  The problem is different - the problem is that, by and large, most interested parties do not really need it.  Citizens need only to not steal money, but it was convenient to pay.  CC - to do less, and higher tariffs.  RSO - to make investment programs every year new.  The authorities - well, here as usual.  And a business ... a big one does not want to invest money in it - but it does not always work out with the authorities. <br><br>  As a result, those who are truly interested in implementing such a monster are a couple of disgruntled geeks, one politician who is playing hard to power, a modern, yet honest CC, rotting small RSO ... they all try pieces, with GSM modems and rotting copper lines, in the habit of building a bright future.  And retired grandmothers go to the Criminal Code to chat in the queue, the Criminal Code draws the necessary numbers and manages the money as he wants, carries it to whom it is convenient.  RNO bury another million in the ground, and power ... leads noisy battles in front of his people, well, and ... as usual, in general.  Exceptions are rare, but still occur. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137132/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137132/</a></p>
