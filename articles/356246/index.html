In order to implement this project, it is necessary for the government to develop and approve a plan of relevant activities.  The presidential commission must be executed on time by February 15 of the next year. <br><br>  The order itself was formed a few days ago.  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Railways Director General Oleg Blozerov became responsible persons for its implementation.  The document itself has already been posted on the kremlin.ru website. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Interestingly, the implementation of this process will be monitored by the Government Commission.  She will submit her report by March 1, 2018, after which the representatives of the commission will have to report once every six months.  Responsible for reporting - Medvedev.

      The plan does not provide for an instant translation.  So, by 2020 it is planned to increase the share of Russian software in the systems to 80%.  Currently, this figure is 60%.  For the first time, a state-owned company began making plans to switch to domestic software 10 years ago, in 2007.  But then the market simply did not have a sufficient number of domestic products that could replace foreign analogues.  Now, working with foreign software, the company requires its legalization. And also the source code disclosure by the manufacturer. <br><br>  RZD has about 90% of the algorithms and methods for their use of purely Russian origin.  But, unfortunately, there are not many Russian products among the software - in this case, the share of domestic software is only about 30%.  For equipment, this indicator is even less - only 10%.  Among automated process control systems and in navigation and communication systems, the share of domestic products is about 80%.  In 2020, it is planned to switch to 100% use of Russian algorithms and methodologies.  In addition, by this year, domestic software will be used by 80% and domestic hardware by 60%.  The share of Russian automated process control systems and navigation and communications solutions will be increased to 90%. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt wait for a client to come to you on the wave of import substitution, but you have to work very seriously,‚Äù said Charkin.  - You have to do a tremendous job in order to understand the client where he is going, and also understand our scope.  Our ERP system, for reference, employs 250 thousand people.  Perhaps this is the largest ERP installation in the world.  And we have unique functionality.  Therefore, I am absolutely sure that together we will gradually be able to reach a qualitative level of development from the point of view of domestic solutions. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356246/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356246/</a></p>
