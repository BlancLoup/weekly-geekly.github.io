      Andrei has an incomplete higher technical education.  While studying, I became interested in web development, and then my student hobby turned into a professional activity. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  Before DSL on freelancing, he created and maintained websites of online stores, managed to work in Mail.Ru Group, Lamoda and VKontakte. <br><br>  Interests: outdoor activities, professional and fiction. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  As a technical director, I have a lot of responsibilities.  Most often I am engaged in development and service architecture, training new employees, defining a development strategy, monitoring key indicators and optimizing development processes.  In emergency situations, I put on the costume of the captain of the ship during a storm and seal the resulting holes.  As on the ship, a very important role is played by the team. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Out! <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  Differently.  Sometimes you have to start a working day before the schedule, respectively, and it‚Äôs not always time to leave.  This is primarily due to the specifics of the position - I control all the technical processes in the company and take full responsibility for the work done.  If we talk about the clock, it is 8-15 hours a day.  Depends on the load, current tasks, on the need to connect to solving emergency issues. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  Because of work, home and family affairs, usually 6-8 hours are left for sleep. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  How?  Quickly. <br><br>  If you're talking about food, then the standard set is tea, porridge.  I always have breakfast. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  I read professional and fiction literature, as well as news. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  I chose Any.do.  I use mostly for personal purposes, sometimes for work. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Mail, calendar, messengers, development environments. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  At work we use Jira and GitLab. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  PhpStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, MySQL Workbench. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  There is.  I can not disclose, unfortunately. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  I like my job.  It is annoying that sometimes it is difficult to find time to thoroughly immerse yourself in a task, you often have to switch. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  My top 3 recommendations: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2449712/">Deadline</a> , Tom DeMarco; </li><li>  <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2409500/">‚ÄúHow to feed cats‚Äù</a> , J. Hank Rainwater; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/138437220/">‚ÄúPerfect Code,‚Äù</a> Steve McConnell. </li></ul><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Electronic readers like simplicity and mobility, but I prefer paper books. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  MacBook.  Reasons: POSIX-system (convenience of solving any work tasks), GUI, perfect touchpad and habit. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  Also, that when I do not work.  Heavy and folk music.  There is no separate music for work. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Prioritization of tasks and drawing up a list of necessary decisions for the day.  Make a list in the morning.  Usually after breakfast or on the way to work. <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Always look for ways to develop for yourself and the products that I do.  Critically evaluate your work. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  Do not stop and do not give up.  Into all, and all you get! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322678/</a></p>
