  <section class="page js-page"><h1>To root and features were</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today is the 256th day of the year, which means the professional holiday of programmers, developers, developers, coders has arrived.  In general, all those who make modern life modern, intelligent technology, comfortable work - in short, improve this world.  We thought for a long time what to write, but in the end we came across cool fresh comics about the life of developers and decided that it would be their day and place.  For those who, like us ‚ÄúInglish Polytech Finish‚Äù, we translated the meaning and slightly adapted to the Russian realities.  Happy holiday, friends! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/672/0f6/dd26720f627f69a48d868061f60654da.jpg">  <i>The picture is <a href="http://www.penta-club.ru/forum/user/16565-feuer/">taken here</a> , our signature</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A few words about how it was.  We found comic books by excellent authors on the Toggl time-trackers developers blog and could not stop them from viewing them.  We wrote in technical support on our bad english that we are a small <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">CRM system developer company</a> from Russia and want to publish this business by the day of the programmer in our blog on Habr√©.  We were told that they agree and that english is not so bad.  On this positive note, we sat down for translation and adaptation.  Working on this post was really a thrill - there is something to be sad and laugh about. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Programmer's work environment</font> </h2><br>  It is difficult to be a <s>god of</s> developer, even if you work in a vendor company.  We all come to work and, oh, horror, we are surrounded by people who, on the one hand, consider us a race like aliens, and on the other, believe in our superpowers.  So who are all these people?

The black magicians of the Internet, pumped in the dark art of generating clicks (not to be confused with clickbate!), Traffic and conversions.  Yes, yes, we did find this comic by search query. <br><br>  <i>Technical support</i>  Frontline troops with steel nerves.  Support commandos have a strange ability to say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù in such a way that it doesn‚Äôt sound like ‚ÄúNo‚Äù (we would be in the process of creating the TK and making the 458th iteration of edits into it!).  Technical support, mainly peaceful (because exhausted?). <br><br>  <i>Financial Director (in Russian realities - accounting).</i>  The keeper of the treasury and treasure.  Concerned about servicing financial obligations.  Often he says ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, but in general he sometimes allows some expenses for stupid requests to maintain peace and the illusion of democracy in a company.  In the Russian reality, he owns a powerful weapon of mass destruction for programmers and tyzh programmers (usually for labor - system administrators) - the accounting system 1C. <br><br>  <i>SMM box</i>  Hipster by profession or professional hipster - it depends on the level of zen achieved.  Prefers to communicate using gif-ok.  SMM hipsters are the only ones who can follow Twitter or Facebook skills as a skill in their resume. <br><br>  <i>Product Manager.</i>  Money stops here.  On his keyboard, there are hot keys for a set of phrases ‚ÄúDo it,‚Äù ‚ÄúHow difficult is it?‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù we often met - ‚ÄúUrgently.  Important".  Not very friendly. <br><br>  <i>Frontend developers</i> , they are ‚Äúno labor engineers‚Äù in the backenders jargon.  Strong in classic rock or gangsta rap (or both).  The strangeness of their hobby can only be compared with the inscriptions on their T-shirts. <br><br>  <i>Office Ninja.</i>  Ever wondered where all these colored stickers, free cookies and working gadgets come from?  This is the work of the office ninja.  True ninjas always go unnoticed - only their work is visible. <br><br>  <i>The CEO, he is the CEO, boss, boss, etc.</i>  He is a particularly important person.  He feels most comfortable in the face of new challenges, so expect big changes (or a sudden release of a new product) when everything starts to work very smoothly. <br><br>  <i>The backend developer</i> is an unglamned techie.  Vigilant protector and silent knight - he keeps the business running and generally afloat.  He is the hero the company deserves (but not the one she needs). <br>  (for the translation of the block, thanks to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/conf/" class="user_link">conf</a> ) <br><br>  A variant from <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lonsofore/" class="user_link">Lonsofore</a> - ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the hero of the company deserves (but not the one it needs).‚Äù - ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the hero the company deserves (but not the only one she needs).‚Äù <br><br>  We in <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft</a> do not <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">undertake</a> to divide developers into backend and frontend due to the fact that we generally make desktop software for business, and we all have full stack.  But what about the heroes and the silent knights - yes, this is to our liking.  Much better than t-shirts with the designation of the head and torso with the help of tags. <br><br>  <i>Designer in the state.</i>  A rare beast, since the most creative prefer to roam free, jumping from project to project.  In order to avoid escape or cruel rebellion, it is better for them to transfer all control over the creative. <br><br>  <i>Servers.</i>  Only they work alone 24/7.  It would be like a server ... <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Seven circles of hell developers</font> </h2><br>  Developers often make fun of colleagues and situations, but in fact, in each company, programmers have a personal hell.  With seven circles, limb and other attributes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8af/f0e/200/8aff0e2005d6433a9dc29bd10b70cd28.jpg" width="550"></div><br>  <i>The first round</i> , in fact, the developer's Dante Limb is to stay awake and be out of the house at noon (without access to the Playstation). <br><br>  <i>The second circle</i> is the people.  And the documentation, this documentation is all really zadolbala too.  Marketing and sales and their eternal this: ‚ÄúHave you already laid half of your site?  Not enough for us to work, am I right? "(Amirite - short for" am I right? ").  Type-technical HRs live on the same circle: ‚ÄúHi, do you know JavaScript?  Well, because we are just looking for a Java programmer! ‚Äù <br><br>  <i>The third circle</i> is the clients (well, this is the third in the original, with us, as with any CRM system developer, this is the ninth and some additional one).  Wild people.  Cave  Especially advanced enraged.  Well, these, which heaps send new ideas and "very small changes." <br><br>  <i>The fourth circle is</i> hot.  Managers, products, managers - evil!  They will encircle you, block oxygen and trynde: ‚ÄúWell, what, is it done already?  Well, what has been done?  Done, yes?  Are you ready now? ‚ÄùThey are fans of useless meetings.  Sometimes they really talk about what they ate for lunch!  (We didn‚Äôt see this, but the Expert movie was about our customer‚Äôs red lines from the customer to many of us). <br><br>  <i>The fifth round of</i> hell is a bad code.  Oh, programmer sins.  Legacy code on the vine chops your best ideas and devours your brain, your own old code burns memory and eyes with shame.  Separately, there are mountains of crutches, bicycles and other wild decisions that support everything at once and are developed on some muddy stack. <br><br>  <i>The sixth circle - the</i> separation and distraction from work.  ‚ÄúAre you busy with something?‚Äù (Well, at work, how can you!) ‚ÄúCan you upload some data to me?  Yes, Nah, I'm not in a hurry, tonight will arrange. "  On the same circle is the mythical abyss "Yesterday" - a place where everything should be ready according to today's information. <br><br>  Do not believe that we suffer from this?  Do not believe ?!  Just look at this old and truthful comic. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26d/202/d81/26d202d8117bd6bf0f62e43b3b9c0069.png"></div><br>  <i>And on the last lap a source of internal light and energy is breaking - a coffee machine :-)</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">But we all know how to work.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">In a team.</font>  <font color="#cc0000">In their own way</font> </h2><br>  Office guys know a lot about their work, but from the outside it looks very specific.  Let us analyze the example of a light bulb. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d3/a21/37e/9d3a2137e60e41791dca78fa988695aa.jpg"></div><br>  <i>IT support, technical support.</i>  They unscrew the light bulb and screw it back in the hope that it lights up, then flick the switch.  If manipulation does not lead to success, inform the client that the room is still in the dark and you should order a new room from the warehouse. <br><br>  <i>Front-end developers</i> paint the lamp yellow and rub the backend that the light bulb works, but only during the daytime. <br><br>  <i>The project manager is</i> picking on the running light of a baseball bat, the lamp is eventually broken - and a new ticket is dropped onto the front-end. <br><br>  <i>Marketers</i> develop a concept and agree that darkness is a new light.  And then the marketer gives you the opportunity to read a post about it in a blog, and he goes to finish playing in Candy Crush. <br><br>  <i>A</i> telemarketer (for habrovtsy, who is not in the subject, in the Russian realities it‚Äôs girls on cold calls) brings more light bulbs, even more, quite a lot of light bulbs. <br><br>  <i>The content manager</i> has no idea what to do with it.  Then he sits down and writes an expert article for 2000 words about changing a light bulb. <br><br>  <i>The operator</i> (someone has a farm manager, someone has a sysadmin, someone has a secretary) receives a message that the light bulb needs to be fixed, gives a flashlight, and continues to sleep with a calm conscience. <br><br>  <i>Backend developers</i> wonder where everyone got their problems with these bulbs, remembers forgetting to light up the database, calming down and blaming the front-end. <br><br>  Jokes jokes, but fewer bugs for all of us, more adequacy, salary and mutual understanding within companies and with customers.
