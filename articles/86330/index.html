And I decided to put it somewhere. <br><br>  Since I have never come across all sorts of vykladyvany (read - no one showed his personal code), the first thing that came to mind: sourceforge.net <br><br>  But while I registered my first project, I tried several times to spit and go to the divers.  The choice of a license became a separate test: a list of a whole heap of options is offered (by eye: about 50).  Of all those caught my eye, the acquaintance and arranging turned out to be the GPL.  But those turned out to be two things: GPL and GPLv3.

      Well, enough about the horrific details of my inexperience in legal and project issues. <br><br>  Actually, the project is a PHP application based on Kohana3 PHP framework.  Designed to work in conjunction with the Kannel SMS gateway (or any other one that allows you to send processing requests as a GET or POST request).  More precisely, to process requests coming from the SMS gateway and return the result, which the SMS gateway must send this answer to the subscriber. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before you start this dubious epic with writing code, I was looking for something similar.  I found and downloaded 4 products that, according to the description, were suitable for what I needed.  As a result, I found out that two of them are a stupid web interface for sending SMS via Kannel, and nothing more.  The rest were in such an embryonic state that the set of self-written scripts that I already had at that time (more precisely, a pile) of scripts gave more functionality. <br><br>  In the end, I decided to pick something like that.  It started about two years ago, when I had no idea at all about the rules of good form in the code, about any frameworks and any ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù.  As a result, the samopisny heap corresponded 3 times in the Continuous Integration mode.  In my case, this beautifully sounding combination meant that all the work was done on the working server in between tasks from the management ‚Äúthis should work yesterday!  And this is the day before yesterday! ‚Äù <br>  It‚Äôs better not to think about what bedlam was going on there six months later (in secret: on that very first server, and now things are not much better. Of course, I combed a lot of hair and put it in order, but for a number of reasons it was decided I don‚Äôt want to work there. Therefore, everything remains in a healthy, but semi-combed form. It is quite affordable for work, but not brought to the beauty and harmony of a full-fledged product). <br><br>  In a word: ‚ÄúBardak Corporation‚Äù ¬© :) <br><br>  The current version was also written in the intervals between work in the IT sphere, attempts to understand frameworks, the principles of the PLO, rehearsals, working as a musician as part of a pub project, drinking beer and other pleasures of life. <br><br>  And I realized the hard way: if you write some code, then you will ALWAYS find in it what you NEED to rewrite.  Something is stuck in order to start working faster, something in order to be compatible with what has already been inserted quickly.  And something - just because at the moment you do not know what you will know in six months.  And sometimes even because I know how it is better, how it is more correct, but stupid - I don‚Äôt want it.  And this is - yes, my fault. <br><br>  In essence, this is a remake from a self-made semi-finished product (with user authorization, hard-coded modules and services in configuration files and direct changes to the configuration file of the SMS gateway) to another semi-finished product based on the finished framework (as well as the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmodular structure of the service modules themselves, as well as adding services and linking them to existing service modules. Well, an SMS emulator, completely untied from Kannel, and just testing the availability and performance of the added modules and services). <br><br>  And what if someone who picks with Kannel might find my project interesting, he will download it, look at it and say: ‚ÄúThe idea is interesting, you just have to redo the fuck up in a normal way‚Äù.  Honestly, picking on your own alone a product that nobody seems to need is a bit boring.  After a wave of enthusiasm, performance gradually fades away.  Well, since at a certain moment I left the same office, then the additional motivation (I do it for myself, in order to facilitate the work myself) also disappeared somewhere. <br><br>  Perhaps the project requires new blood.  :) And maybe nobody needs it? <br><br>  PS <br>  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/silkforkannel/">sourceforge.net/projects/silkforkannel</a> <br><br>  Pps <br>  The absence of detailed documentation on Kohana3 has noticeably affected. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86330/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86330/</a></p>
