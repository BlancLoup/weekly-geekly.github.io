Traditionally, anyone could take part in the conference, and this post for a long time was a kind of live broadcast of the text.  Users asked their questions to the speakers - leading experts in the field of SEO - live.  For everyone who wants to get acquainted with the conference materials, we will soon post the corresponding link, but for now you can subscribe to receive materials <a href="http://www.megaindex.tv/2014/">here</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      If you are reading our blog, then you have probably already watched our broadcast from the cozy updated studio MegaIndex.tv. We tried to combine the reports so that this broadcast could save you a lot of time searching for answers to the most relevant e-commerce questions and the right business. -organization of the site, its structure, as well as methods of work on it.  The time that you could spend on the forums looking for answers is reduced many times: indeed, it‚Äôs better to see it once!  In addition, after each report, we sorted out numerous user questions that could be asked here on the conference page. <br><br>  <b>Key issues of webmaster work</b> <br><br>  The conference began today at 11 am with a dynamic report by Arthur Latypov.  After him, Dmitry Sevalnev performed.  Reports of both specialists complemented each other and covered issues of internal optimization and the correct algorithms for working on the semantics of the site.  How does automation affect the acceleration of these processes?  What tools are industry professionals using now?  What results are achieved through them?  Arthur and Dmitry do not make secrets from their own techniques, methods and developments, willingly share them with the audience of their courses and the audience of the project MegaIndex.tv. If you want to review the broadcast or could not see it, the answers to these questions will be available on the project website soon. . <br><br>  <b>Innovation and expertise</b> <br><br>  In his speech, the head of the ALTWeb Group holding and the MegaIndex service, Nikolay Khivrin touched upon the most topical issues that we try to cover on our blog pages and provided additional, most relevant information on the current situation with behavioral factors, rotation and other current trends in the industry.  An innovative algorithm for selecting user accounts - the company's know-how.  Nikolay spoke about this monitoring system in more detail, as well as projects in which these users are involved - in particular, the automated system for working with behavioral factors <a href="http://serpclick.ru/">SERPClick</a> .  The topic was very interesting - more than 500 questions from the audience were asked online for half an hour. <br><br>  <b>E-commerce and internet marketing</b> <br><br>  Victor Nagaitsev considered cases from commercial rankings.  He came with a ready checklist of quality control of stores for e-commerce sites, explaining in detail the requirements for each item.  He also examined cases that he had to solve in practice in this area. <br><br>  <b>Technologies and methods of work on the Internet</b> <br><br>  Valery Kondranin, together with Mikhail Zhukovets, talked about the technical aspects of search engine parsing.  Good news: the <a href="http://xmlproxy.ru/">XML Proxy</a> service allows you to share and acquire Yandex XML limits: important for webmasters who are hampered by restrictions on using XML - for example, that you can use no more than 20% of your own limit in the daytime.  Here you can share your unused limit - for a fee.  Also, Valery and Mikhail made a small overview of the solutions that use parsing, as well as Michael shared his method in which he uses parsing based on the semantic core to quickly gather information on the analysis of competing sites. <br><br>  Alexey Chekushin about the features of semantics, WordStat, counters and search tips - what has changed and what, perhaps, we still did not know.  How to separate commercial requests from non-commercial?  Why the structure of the site e-commerce should not do marketer?  Due to what and why the structure of the site expands?  A couple of questions on the backfill: where should there be reviews about the product - on the product page or at a new address?  For how many requests can you promote one page?  - there are quite accurate answers to this question, which was voiced today on the air along with a kind of sensational statement: ‚ÄúI have a synonym base, but I will not give it away.‚Äù And a new meme ‚ÄúYes, go to the top!‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Organization of work with digital agencies and choice of services</b> <br><br>  Nikolai Kiselev, who, according to his owls, speaks about the painful one - the customer is not always right.  Although this is relevant, but what strategies can be subjective and how to correctly find a middle ground between client and agent components in optimization?  When a client is interested in you, this is a situation that is advantageous for both parties - that is the golden mean.  And according to Nicholas, it is achievable.  Nikolai will begin with a review of the market structure and then move on to the criteria for selecting performers and evaluating the effectiveness of their activities, such as lead generation and real positions, and also warns against possible errors that the customer can make when choosing a digital agency. <br><br>  Leonid Grokhovsky told about what services provided by Internet marketing specialists are relevant for the customer.  How to build a page structure based on user needs and search query?  How to create a system of triggers for the mailing list?  How are segmentation, cohort analysis and customer loyalty increased?  Synergy of various tools allows you to increase the turnover by 10-20 times in two years - <i>generally a freebie</i> - according to Leonid. <br><br>  The conference ended with a debriefing on user issues, which was led by Stanislav Stavsky. <br><br>  Later we will publish the materials provided on the website <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/altweb/blog/228393/">MegaIndex.tv</a> <br><br>  If you want to receive conference materials by mail, leave your address <a href="http://www.megaindex.tv/2014/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228393/</a></p>
