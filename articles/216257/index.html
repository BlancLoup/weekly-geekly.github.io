  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fantastic story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215901/">NASA</a> article <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/215901/">: 715 new planets were found, 4 of them may be suitable for life by</a> me impromptu in the mood a small tale was composed.  Bring it below with minimal edits.  And the idea was born to write a story specifically for publication on Habr√©, if, of course, the habrasoobschestvu express interest. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  The time will come and a pair of stellar scouts will jump out of the hyper near the star system with the planet Kepler-62f.  After scanning the surrounding space and creating a navigation map of the system, the captains will divide the system into two sectors and begin to map it in more detail.  Both ships are also looking for the missing Ray of Dawn, which, according to the latest reports, was to emerge from the hyper on the other side of the star system and begin to investigate it in order to obtain preliminary data on suitability for life.  But the scout contacted only once and then disappeared.  People waited for a short time and the second expedition was urgently formed, whose tasks also included, if possible, finding and clarifying the situation with Luch.  Nevertheless, in hyperspace, people began to move not so long ago and sometimes unknown features were revealed, therefore any information was useful.  Yes, and rarely scouts here and so take and disappear - it's still an emergency. <br><br>  The captain of the ship "Dawn of Hope" was lucky - it was he who got half of the system in which the planet Kepler-62f was located.  He guessed this half in good faith with the draw - lucky!  Approaching the planet, the entire crew crowded in the observation deck, looking at the new planet.  The captain looked at the planet and was secretly proud that it was he who was the first to look at it without the use of any technical devices ‚Äî a direct look.  This is the second such planet in his career, although the first is still rejected.  New, clean planet, which will become an outpost of humanity in this sector of space.  Thoroughly having spoiled the Earth's ecosystem, people now treated much more carefully to other exoplanets, all the more so far not all of them were suitable for comfortable living.  The process of terraforming for the adjustment of the atmosphere was rarely carried out on suitable planets, since  if the atmosphere was not more or less close to the earth, it took a lot of time.  Every newly discovered, prosperous planet was an event.  Yes, they ‚Äúlooked for‚Äù them according to previously known coordinates, but in reality at the beginning of the 21st century, astronomers ‚Äúpainted‚Äù pictures of these planets.  But a lot of predictions just did not come true.  And it was a yes event!  Moreover, the planet was like Earth.  Water, land, areas with snow ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe it will become a new home,‚Äù thought the captain: ‚ÄúAlthough the first generation is unlikely.‚Äù  It was a fact - on any planet, the first two waves of settlers wildly yearned for the Earth.  Some all threw and left.  Despite the subsidies of the central government.  Despite the fact that the Earth opened all new technologies first of all for the settlers, it created favorable conditions for the development of the main spheres of life on the new planet - production, agriculture, industry. whatever the starting capital.  Still, people experienced discomfort - the color of the green is not the same, the tone of the sky is not the same, the earth feels different to the touch - a bunch of everything is ‚Äúnot everything is there.‚Äù  Of course, not all were with this worldview, but the vast majority.  But then a new generation was born, which considered the planet to be its homeland and didn‚Äôt tear too much.  On the contrary, to play a football match and win over the arriving earthlings turned into national pride.  Here we are!  Who knew that there was a secret directive of the central government, according to which the Earth‚Äôs sports clubs were obliged to succumb and lose the first 5 years since the planet accepted the settlement status.  Directly, of course, it was not implemented, but there was simply a long chain of bribes and bases, which led to the fact that it was more profitable for athletes from Earth to lose.  Earth did everything to increase the survival of the human race.

      People are just incredibly lucky that in the middle of the 22nd century, in all that wild slaughter of people with each other, wise people came to power.  Tough and cruel, uniting the planet, they began the process of space exploration.  Incredibly, but the fact is that human civilization with a trend back to the stone age suddenly suddenly, for 80 years this trend has turned sharply upwards.  And the real development began.  No satellites cast on the orbits of the planets and were sent in batches by the AMC, but the process of osovenie space was carried out with the active use of the people themselves.  The Earth created all the conditions for new settlements, except for one thing - only the Space Fleet of the Earth had combat technologies.  The captain caught the reflection of the VKS emblem on his chest and grinned.  The time flew by so quickly when he, at the age of 19, filed an application for entry into the VKS at the next recruitment and spent the whole day at the main building of the Academy, waiting for the result of its consideration.  Legs did not go anywhere, just sat and, hiding, hardly hoping, waited.  His girlfriend did not understand him that day and, under some pretext, left after 2 hours of waiting, he could not even speak plainly.  Just sat and waited.  In VKS recruited people rarely.  VKS is not just a dream of youth, it is a prospect.  After serving in the videoconferencing system, you can already rely on the acquisition of a decommissioned warship, its re-equipment and self-study of the universe.  They paid well for mapping - it was possible not only to live, but to earn money.  And the higher your services to the VKS, the greater the class of the ship could claim.  "Own ship, i.e.  own, really ‚Äù- the captain dreamed:‚Äú You can still open a couple of planets, so you can wipe the cruiser, damn it!  Although not - too cool, probably, the destroyer will be the very thing.  Generations of the sixth.  Not new, but ... " <br><br>  The captain‚Äôs thoughts were interrupted by an assistant: <br>  - Captain, call on non-standard channel. <br>  - Custom?  Is the North Wind contacting us? <br>  ‚ÄúCaptain ... the signal signature is unknown.‚Äù <br>  - What??? <br>  - It seems that the signal comes from the surface of this planet. <br>  The captain turned sharply toward the viewing panel.  From her majestically looking at him a new planet.  Is this the "Ray of Dawn"?  Or‚Ä¶ </blockquote><br>  After, in general, a positive perception of the story, as well as on the leading questions of users, I thought about the question of writing a short story (continuation, additions to the current or a separate story with similar subjects and style).  I have no experience in literary activity behind my shoulders.  Considering that this kind of subject matter of the book exists and is being written (a typical example is the eve online universe, on the subject of which more than a dozen books were written) it would be interesting to know the opinion of users regarding this venture.  I myself love to read fantastic stories that sometimes flash on Habr√©. <br><br>  Why did I give a vote? <br>  There are two aspects here.  The fact is that I believe that the product of labor should be useful not only to you, but also to society.  What is the point of doing something, rejoicing, putting it in a box and forgetting?  Yes, there is an aspect of gaining experience and awareness of what you can, but I would also like to spend the forces (time, resources) used most efficiently, i.e.  someone used your product of labor nevertheless.  The second aspect is quite simple - if I make a commitment, I do it, if I don‚Äôt take them, I don‚Äôt, even if I‚Äôve been uncontradicted, because  There is always a lot of things to do.  I kind of write something like this a long time ago, but there are always more necessary / urgent / interesting things.  Those.  the community is invited to kick me, as a matter of fact, but I graciously agree to a choice: if they want, they will kick, if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt.  The conditional threshold that will move me to action, I determined for myself. <br><br>  PS <br>  1) For some reason, the post could not be placed in offtopic, although, it seems, under the conditions for me there should be no restrictions.  If someone tells you where and much more correctly to place thematically this post will be grateful. <br>  2) About errors found, please write in the LAN, do not clutter up comments.  Of course, I checked everything 2-3 times, but it happens.  Especially for myself, I increasingly notice the problem of technical vision - in the word two letters are rearranged in places, but I don‚Äôt see it, because  on the subconscious that they are becoming as it should (an interesting thing turns out - this is all without using any coding technology based on the redundancy of the original information, i.e. redundancy, there‚Äôs still somewhere there should be a time error is corrected and it seems to be present at the subconscious it turns out).  I can say such a word more than once ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù :) <br>  3) The term of the survey is 10 days. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216257/</a></p>
