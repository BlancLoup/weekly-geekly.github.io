It would seem that everything is simple here - look for a programmer, let him choose the system with which he will be able to work effectively. <br><br>  But the trick is that not all startups have sufficient funding at the initial stage. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, we are preparing two projects with a very modest budget, in which it is desirable to do everything as far as possible by ourselves, with minimal costs and without the involvement of third-party developers.  I am sure that this is a familiar situation to many. <br><br>  In our case, projects are two small and fairly specific online stores, the fate of which is hard to predict.  It may happen that these market segments will be able to be taken practically without a fight, or it may turn out all and not so rosy.  That is why there is no talk about serious financial injections.

      One way or another, the work is on and it is necessary to choose a CMS.  So far, I look primarily at paid projects, as more licked and brought to mind. <br>  The requirements are simple: <br>  - categories; <br>  - basket of goods; <br>  - ease of ordering; <br>  - support of plastic cards and payment systems; <br>  - support for discount and club cards; <br>  - the ability to set seasonal discounts on individual products or their categories. <br>  In addition, it is very important that the site on the system can be made by people who are not trained in programming languages, however, they are ready to understand certain points (but this applies primarily to settings and adjustments).  Simplicity is a fundamental condition. <br><br>  Here are the CMS that I was recommended, I really want to hear from the habra people comments about them: <br>  1. Bitrix.  The system is run-in and well-documented, with good features and an adequate price.  At the same time, someone was talking about the difficulty in mastering, they say, you can‚Äôt do without a programmer anyway. <br>  In addition, Bitrix is ‚Äã‚Äãattracted by the fact that it supposedly interacts well with other products from 1C, without which it is impossible to live now - 1C Enterprise or 1C Warehouse, for example. <br>  2. osCommerce.  I have seen few reviews about it, but it is often recommended as fairly simple and reliable. <br><br>  Links to two more sites were sent without any recommendations: <br>  3. <a href="http://www.mxd.ru/development/">www.mxd.ru/development</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://www.ucoz.ru/">www.ucoz.ru</a> <br><br>  I know that if somewhere they can give objective advice, then this is on Habr√©. <br>  What systems will you advise and why?  =) <br><br>  <strong>UPD.</strong>  Many thanks to everyone for the advice, I have already made certain conclusions for myself.  When we study the proposed options, I will write a post where I will try to list the advantages and disadvantages of each CMS from the perspective of a person leading such a small project. <br>  The reaction of habra people is very pleasant, in just one day I received almost as many messages in habrapochty as in six months.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24887/</a></p>
