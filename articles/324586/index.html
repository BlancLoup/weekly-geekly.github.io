  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employees and social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The wide spread of mobile devices has led to the fact that a large number of employees during working hours began to abuse social networks, wasting a huge amount of time.  In fact, social networks have become a scourge of the XXI century. <br><br>  The topic is not new, and constantly excites both the employer and employees.  The motives of the employer are clear, this is a loss of efficiency and productivity: instead of doing business, the employee spends his work time, which is paid by the way.  For most people, social networks have long been firmly established in our lives, blocking and restricting Internet access from their equipment, the employer forces staff to use their own mobile devices (phones, smartphones, tablets ...), and as a result: employees don't care They sit on social networks, only the employer sees nothing, does not know, does not understand. <br><br>  What this leads to is here:

      ‚Üí Report on the activity of employees in social networks during working hours ( <a href="http://socmetr.ru/people/report%3Fcode%3DqwrLQp9ZkBJ6%26filter%3D4" title="SOCMETR.People">report</a> ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72e/0bc/a92/72e0bca92e5384b9d43b83d30f6848cb.png" alt="socmetr image.investigate.socmetr.people"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  (tool was used: SOCMETR.People) <br><br>  I‚Äôll clarify right away that this is not internal information of the company, information is collected on my own initiative to prepare the material for the article (this scribbler‚Äôs encouragement is one of my previous employers - the company‚Äôs name is not as important as the names of colleagues (all matches are random) (according to FZ 152, Art. 6, p. 1, p. 9, for collecting statistical information with subsequent depersonalization, consent of the subject of personal data is not required.) It is important that social networks are blocked by the employer, but despite this, two-thirds  and employees still use them (but from their mobile devices). If you look at the monthly schedule, the picture is not very happy: half of the employees use not so much how much they abuse. <br><br><h2>  Why? </h2><br>  Social networks have become our way of life: we get news from there (and not the negative that flows from the media, but what we are interested in: beautiful boys and girls, fancy cars, exotic places, cinema masterpieces, etc.), look through the photos, listen to music , read jokes, watch videos, clips, communicate, communicate with people being separated by huge distances.  In a word, one application, and with so many possibilities, it certainly does not replace two friends and a vodka box, but everything is moving towards this. <br><br>  Starting next year, that is, from 2018, the generation 2000+ enters the working channel, and it is already there, having tasted this beautiful fruit since childhood. <br><br>  Thus, regardless of whether access to social networks is blocked or not, they have been used and will be enjoyed by an increasing number of people - this is a trend.  Another question is that a normal employee does not make sense to control, there will always be a result from him, and he himself does an excellent job with the distribution of his time, the very restriction of access hurts more, because sometimes it makes it difficult to learn something new, or cope with an existing problem.  The flip side of the medal is that part of the employees who are engaged in abuse, it is annoying - and both the employer and those employees who work and are forced to pull double the norm, this raises the question: do you need employees who need to be forced to work and who need a supervisor? <br><br>  In this vein, I would like to show that employers are losing blocking social networks. <br><br>  "You can not win, head" (c) <br><br><h2>  What does an employer lose? </h2><br>  First, the leaders of different levels: <br><br><ul><li>  Lose information about the effectiveness of employees and staffing units, and their hidden reserves </li><li>  As a consequence of the first, can not stop this disgrace </li></ul><br>  Secondly, the recruitment department: <br><br><ul><li>  It‚Äôs impossible to check a candidate‚Äôs social activity with his current employer before making a formal job offer. </li></ul><br>  Third, the personnel department: <br><br><ul><li>  Losing the tool for selectively motivating employees (namely, there is no point in motivating those who sit on social networks) </li><li>  An additional efficiency indicator (KPI) is lost: ala ‚Äúsocial network activity‚Äù </li><li>  Does not have the opportunity to get rid of the employee at the stage of probation, in case of abuse of social networks </li><li>  Does not have the ability to block the expansion of the state, with abnormal activity in the social networks of the staff unit </li><li>  It does not have an extra reason for disciplinary action and dismissal of employees. </li></ul><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Thus, employees should not forget that social networks are a tool with double-edged ends, and an employer that a ban is not always the best way to achieve something. <br><br>  However, no matter what, we all are witnessing how globally formed trends that enhance the role of social networks in society and in our lives. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324586/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324586/</a></p>
