Traffic is inexpensive, speed is high.  All these factors (and our natural in laziness to boot) lead to the fact that we no longer want to read and delve into something. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a1/e5/a1e581f91dc4fa291bac2db45cafdb91.jpg" alt="Laziness"><br><br>  As a rule, when a person comes to the site - the first thing he wants to understand is ‚Äúis <b><i>it this or not</i></b> ?‚Äù.  And if in order to get an answer to this question, you need to read a lot of text, then most likely the Internet user <b>will not do that</b> .  I want to quickly find my solution.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  I will give an example. </h5><br>  I often find myself in such a situation that, having visited the site for the first time for a while, I simply fall into a stupor.  It is difficult to immediately understand <b>why this site</b> , what will it be useful to me or how to use it at all?  Spending time turning over the entire sheet ( <i>from the text</i> ) which has been painted there is no desire and time ... And what if all of a sudden this is not what I was looking for !?  From this site I want to quickly leave. <br><br>  And so absolutely in everything!  Whether it is the Internet site, the instruction for the washing machine or the computer program.  We want to quickly find the answer to your question and no longer bother. <br><br><h4>  Let's go back to the video ... </h4><br>  I have long paid attention to the impression that we are made by videos lasting <b>1 minute,</b> which tell in brief about the decision, about the benefits that we will get by using their website. <br><br>  And I'm not talking about advertising in its pure form, no!  Rather about the presentation.  So that anyone can quickly answer the question " <b>Do I need this?</b> ". <br><br><h4>  Create a promotional video. </h4><br>  Having finished writing one of the old versions of my program <a href="http://drp.su/ru/">DriverPack Solution,</a> I got the idea to record just such a video.  And post it on the program website.  So that potential users can meet her. <br>  <u>The main criteria are</u> : it should be short ( <i>do not depress</i> ), emphasize the target audience (to <i>whom it is addressed</i> ), state the essence of the problem and, most importantly, suggest its solution. <br><br>  <b>This video is my attempt to bring this concept to life:</b> <br><br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/driverpack"><img width="380" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5a/e5/5ae5dfa8271f9024e867e8a38d4336cc.jpg" height="245" alt="Download drivers for free"><br></a> <br><br><h4>  What did it do? </h4><br>  Users have undoubtedly become more comfortable ... And what did this give me as the owner of the resource? <br><br>  On the one hand, this reduced the site browsing time and the number of pages viewed ( <i>according to statistics</i> ), which at first glance may seem a negative result.  However, in reality, by doing so we <b>weed out ‚Äúpast those who pass by‚Äù</b> and tie the target audience ( <b>potential buyers</b> ) on ourselves! <br><br>  <b>In July 2009, a promotional video was launched and the dynamics of growth of hosts was very significant right up to November:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e1/ca/e1cac5c1a3c095e1b79b6b0a8652b3f1.png" alt="LiveInternet"><br><br><h4>  We are too lazy to read a lot, but we want to know everything ... </h4><br>  With promotional videos everything is clear.  The conclusion is: <b>you need to do it</b> ! <br>  But what next? <br><br>  In my forum ( <a href="http://forum.drp.su/">http://forum.drp.su/</a> ) I often meet with the same questions on my program.  They arise and will occur, despite the fact that the answers to most of them already exist in the official certificate ( <a href="http://help.drp.su/">http://help.drp.su/</a> ). <br><br>  <b>And in this case, the video materials decide!</b>  We collect frequently asked questions, take our help, compose and record video.  Here's what happened with us: <br> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/driverpack"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/12/4d/124d4c2a9e67d6c980d6dd372cc4498e.jpg" alt="YouTube"></a> <br>  For video tutorials, special thanks to <b>Vasily Kupchikhin</b> (author <a href="http://pc-lessons.ru/">pc-lessons.ru</a> ) <br><br><h4>  Everything is clear, I need it! </h4><br>  If I managed to convince you how important this is and you already understood how to adapt this concept for yourself, then I want to rush into battle as soon as possible! <br><br>  Finally, I will only answer the question that you probably had. <br>  <b>How to make such videos?</b> <br>  For a promotional video, I advise you to use <b>Adobe After Effects</b> .  If they themselves are not strong, then it is better to order on freelancing ... It will cost 3000-6000 rubles.  If you wish, you can try to find one of the ready-made, free templates! <br>  For video lessons I advise you to use the program <b>Camtasia Studio</b> .  Deal with it is not difficult.  And if you want to get out of the situation, you can make a promo video on it. <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> In my first promotional video, not everything is perfect.  There is a spelling mistake, a little lame voice, etc. ... But even this did not prevent the huge increase in users!  Everyone can make a mistake, so do not dwell on trifles, make your own videos, improve your services! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98205/</a></p>
