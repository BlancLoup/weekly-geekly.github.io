  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Launch of Visual Studio 2010 in St. Petersburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Visual Studio 2010 was launched today in St. Petersburg. The first event was a launch in Moscow, and on April 16th it will be launched in Yekaterinburg.  Under the cut a story about the event, some photos and impressions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Go! </h3><br>  Visual Studio was launched at the Park Inn Pribaltiyskaya Hotel.  Arriving at the place 10 minutes after the start of registration, without any queues registered.  Obviously, fewer people participated in Petersburg, since the very same category XI did not exist, there was a category C - ME.  Together in the badge issued a corporate package with a standard set: booklets, CDs with materials, a notebook, pen and questionnaire. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_ddd5d838.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_1b04cd5d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_7cbd97fa.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The first in line was the plenary report.  It was led by Microsoft's vice president of technology, Brian Harry.  He talked about what problems are facing developers, teams, how Microsoft proposes to solve these problems with the help of new products.  Talking about various aspects of the development, Brian called on the stage speakers who briefly told and showed new "goodies".  Some of them were such ‚Äúteasers‚Äù for the upcoming reports.  Vitaly Zayko, Marat Bakirov, Grigory Barkan, and Vladimir Gusarov paired up with Dmitry Andreyev in turn.  Sitronics also conveyed greetings in the form of a video message, which briefly described how the new tools are used in the development of the company's products.

The dinner, in my opinion, was good and organized at a high level, standard buffet.  This is the advantage of holding such events in hotels, and not, say, in exhibition centers. <br><br>  Then all the reports were divided into two sessions: ‚ÄúFor professionals‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeam development‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>"For professionals":</b> <br>  <i>Easy transition to Team Foundation Server</i> .  Brian harry <br>  <i>Visual Studio 2010 for web developer</i> .  Gaidar Magdanurov. <br>  <i>Development of solutions for SharePoint and Office 2010</i> .  George Barkan. <br>  <i>Visual C ++ 2010 and MFC: how to ensure support for Windows7 with minimal code changes</i> .  Terry Lipper. <br>  <i>Scale code and developer productivity - Visual C ++ 2010</i> .  Terry Lipper. <br><br>  <b>"Team Development":</b> <br>  <i>Best development practices: build automation and code management in teams</i> .  Vladimir Gusarov. <br>  <i>Proactive project management using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010</i> .  Dmitry Andreev. <br>  <i>Architectural design and code analysis</i> .  Sergey Orlik. <br>  <i>Modern Windows applications</i> .  Mikhail Chernomordikov. <br>  <i>Effective interaction between developer and tester</i> .  Marat Bakirov. <br><br>  I was present only at the reports of the session ‚ÄúTeam Development‚Äù, so I‚Äôll briefly describe the content and impressions about the reports of this very stream. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_580e27a1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_184ea78f.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_80b4f55e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  Best development practices: build automation and code management in teams. </h4><br>  Perhaps the report with the highest rate of content per unit of time.  Vladimir Gusarov told how using Studio and TFS to control versioning, automate builds and run tests, how to change build scripts.  Very interesting feature of Gated Check-in: changes are placed in the repository only after the build is successfully assembled, so  it is guaranteed that the source code is always in the repository, which at least compiles. <br><br><h4>  Proactive project management using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. </h4><br>  <i>"Scrum in the clear."</i> <br><br>  Dmitry Andreev talked about using Studio, TFS, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Excel and Sharepoint from t.  project management.  Drawing up plans, adjusting estimates for the deadlines by programmers, tracking changes by the manager, compiling and analyzing reports.  All reports are generated automatically for MS Excel or SharePoint Dashboard.  A bundle of all these tools allows you to track changes due to the associativity of all actions. <br><br><h4>  Architectural design and code analysis. </h4><br>  <i>"I do not guarantee you a rest, but I guarantee the removal of the brain."</i> <br><br>  Another interesting report in which Sergey Orlik spoke about the tools of the architect in the new Studio.  Remarkably, all these tools not only display various dependencies (and they display them well) and allow you to quickly understand the code, but also allow you to impose your own restrictions on the architecture and on the code that the developers write.  In this sense, noteworthy is the Architecture Validation option, which, when compiled, checks these changes.  You can read more about it <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/blogs/dev/archive/2010/02/18/vs-2010.aspx">in this article</a> .  In <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio Gallery,</a> you can find a variety of layer templates, sharpened for different types of applications. <br>  Also interesting and useful seemed to me the ability to build sequence-diagrams of calls. <br><br><h4>  Modern Windows applications. </h4><br>  <i>"// HACK".</i>  <i>Comment on the method in the demo project.</i> <br><br>  Mikhail Chernomordikov spoke about Silverlight 4, showed some possibilities for creating such applications.  He told about the use of Windows 7 technologies in C ++ applications, and also showed a short example of using Parallel LINQ. <br><br>  The last report ‚ÄúEffective interaction between the developer and the tester‚Äù, I, unfortunately, was forced to skip, but I will definitely look at it in the record that will appear on the site <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/vs2010">techdays.ru/vs2010</a> . <br><br>  At the exit, in exchange for questionnaires (about the event and about the session), they gave out a beer glass and a Kingston flash drive for 2 GB (Kingston was one of the sponsors of the event). <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  For me, the launch was very positive.  It was interesting to listen to all the reports and it is a pity that they went in two streams. <br><br>  I would note that it was not the launch of not just Visual Studio, but the launch of a whole product line: Studio, TFS, SQL Server 2008 R2, Silverlight 4 (as an announcement).  The reports of the ‚ÄúTeam Development‚Äù session were represented not so much by the development environment itself, but by the entire infrastructure created with the help of several means, and this infrastructure covers many stages and processes of software production: development, version control, assembly, testing, project management.  There are functions that allow you to directly focus on what we do, and not with what we do. <br><br>  Technical overlays on those performances where I attended, almost was not.  Their serious point is only to note that in the plenary report Dmitry Andreev and Vladimir Gusarov failed to start the virtual machine. <br><br>  For me it was the first event of this scale and, in my opinion, it went perfectly. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_cf006eb1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://xmages.net/thumb/thumb_d7f15fa6.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90997/</a></p>
