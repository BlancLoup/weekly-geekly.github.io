The report is based on the data of the My Circle salary calculator: in which more than 7000 salaries were collected for this period. <br><br>  Let's look at current salaries for all major IT specializations, as well as their dynamics over the past six months, both in general and in the main regions: Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities.  As usual, we will study in more detail the specializations of software developers: look at their salaries in the context of programming languages, cities and companies.

      The data presented in our current report, as well as any other, everyone can get independently using <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">the salary calculator</a> "My Circle".  If you like the information that we receive using the calculator, and if you want to contribute to the formation of a more transparent labor market in IT, we invite you to <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries/new">share your current salary</a> , which we use data about in our next annual report. <br><br>  Salary service was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/343578/">launched</a> at My Circle at the end of 2017 with the goal of regular monitoring of salaries in the IT industry.  Salaries are left by the specialists themselves, we collect them and provide them all with open access in aggregated and anonymous form. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr><br><h2>  How to read report charts </h2><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/user_graphs/305"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76c/83a/8d3/76c83a8d3d2c3b661e116d3853c404e0.png"></a> <br><br>  All salaries are in rubles.  These are salaries received on hand, net of all taxes.  Dots indicate specific salaries.  A group of points for each sample is visualized using a "mustache box".  The middle vertical line shows the median salary (half of the salaries are lower and half above this point, we can consider this average salary), the box borders are 25 and 75 percentiles (divide the lower and upper half of the salaries again in half, as a result, half of all salaries are between them).  The box mustache is 10 and 90 percentiles (conditionally we can consider them the minimum and maximum salaries).  More about how the salary calculator is arranged and how to read the data: <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/salaries">https://moikrug.ru/info/salaries</a> . <br><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/user_graphs/291"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c2/c14/616/7c2c14616728bda83d9d35515c82b835.png"></a> <br><br>  The average salary in the IT industry is now 100,000 rubles: in Moscow - 136,000 rubles, in St. Petersburg - 110,000 rubles, in other regions - 75,000 rubles. <br><br>  Compared with the 2nd half of 2018, we observe a general increase in salaries.  On average, in the IT industry, salaries increased by 10% (from 90,000 rubles to 100,000 rubles), in Moscow salaries increased by 13% (from 120,000 rubles to 136,000 rubles), in St. Petersburg - by 10% (from 100 000 rubles to 110 000), in other regions the increase in median salary amounted to 7% (from 70 000 rubles to 75 000 rubles). <br><br><hr><br><h2>  Salaries for core IT majors </h2><br>  Salary status by main IT specializations in the 1st half of 2019. <br><br> <a href="https://moikrug.ru/user_graphs/292"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa2/189/403/aa218940350938e633cbf47fcaa7c7da.png"></a> <br><br>  In general, in all regions over the past six months, there has been an increase in the median salary in the areas of analytics (11%), management (8%), personnel (7%), development (5%) and design (1.3%).
