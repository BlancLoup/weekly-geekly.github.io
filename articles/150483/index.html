This year, again at IFA, I proudly announce the launch of GALAXY Note II, which will be an excellent incentive for users to ‚Äúunleash their creative potential.‚Äù  Thanks to the unsurpassed screen and unique functions, consumers can quickly find information and write down their ideas, freely express their thoughts and manage tasks more effectively.  This device allows you to live an unusual life, opening up endless possibilities for creativity, ‚Äùsaid J.K.  Shin, President of IT &amp; Mobile Communications, Samsung Electronics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46d/b25/097/46db250971b365e54985d59549983c6b.png"><br><br>  Since the introduction of the GALAXY Note line, Samsung has been actively expanding the capabilities of the models in this series.  First in May 2012, the Premium Suite application package was released. It includes additional multimedia features, a number of new applications optimized for the S Pen, and an update to the Android platform to version 4.0 of Ice Cream Sandwich.  In mid-August, the company expanded its lineup by launching GALAXY Note 10.1, equipped with a larger screen, the Multiscreen function for multitasking and an advanced electronic pen S Pen.  And now, the time has come for the second-generation GALAXY Note.  Let's see how a new device can make us happy. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br><br>  GALAXY Note II is equipped with a 5.5-inch (140.9 mm) HD Super AMOLED display, which provides high-definition images.  The 16: 9 aspect ratio is present here for viewing HD video.  A larger screen size greatly improves text readability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05a/cfa/e08/05acfae08eda4fb4f61087a4d4596ab2.png"><br><br>  <b>S Pen &amp; S Note Features</b> <br><br>  Advanced Pen S Pen has a high sensitivity to the force of pressure and high accuracy, able to convey all the nuances of handwritten text or draft. <br><br>  The Air View feature allows you to view email, quickly switch between S Note and S Planner applications or the image and video gallery by pointing the S Pen at the desired file, but not opening it completely.  This provides quick access to search and view information, once again without switching between screens. <br><br>  The new features of the S Pen are also useful for combining your own handwriting with any digital content right on the screen.  Simply press the special button S Pen, and the device itself will understand what content you want to cut or change.  The Easy Clip feature allows you to select and trim content on the screen to the desired size, in order to save it, share it or edit it using various effects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bb2/bba/d20/bb2bbad202709ab8b76c5f9de3e7af27.png"><br><br>  Another new feature, Popup Note, instantly opens S Note as a pop-up window anywhere on the screen.  When you pull out the S Pen during a telephone conversation, the S Note application automatically appears on the screen, allowing you to record a short message.  Also in GALAXY Note II, there is now a macro called Screen Recorder, which allows you to record a sequence of actions on the screen. <br><br>  Something new also appeared on the gesture panel: Quick Command is designed to quickly activate frequently used applications with the S Pen.  A command panel appears, <br>  when the user holds the stylus up the screen while holding the S Pen button.  With this functionality, you can quickly send email, make a call or find a location.  Personally drawn and programmed characters can be added to the command line for quick and easy access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/176/041/ef8/176041ef8e5026d3d4de36584d8d8649.png"><br><br>  <b>Multitasking</b> <br><br>  GALAXY Note II finally has a full-fledged multitasking mode: several windows with different applications open on one screen.  This allows you to quickly move from one task to another, without cluttering up the rest of the display. <br><br>  The Popup Video function has also been improved: with one click of a button, the video can be turned into a floating window on the display.  It will continue to play, and it can be moved to any part of the GALAXY Note II screen.  At the same time, you can safely work with other applications or surf the Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/055/838/c3c/055838c3c1ae36f1463839f75be1c6d6.png"><br><br>  <b>Performance</b> <br><br>  In addition to new features, multi-tasking, content creation and sharing, GALAXY Note II boasts high performance.  A powerful 1.6 GHz quad-core processor and HSPA Plus, as well as 4G LTE connectivity will allow you to experience the beauty of the updated functionality of the device and work in the mobile Internet.  GALAXY Note II is equipped with the latest Android OS 4.1 (JellyBean).  It opens up new graphics and updated service Google Now with contextual search on the device.  The smartphone is equipped with a memory from 16 to 64 GB with the possibility of expansion by microSD cards.  The picture is completed by a powerful 3100 mAh battery, which allows for a long and active use of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5be/2dc/94c/5be2dc94cfd195604159041bf165b2a8.png"><br><br>  GALAXY Note II is equipped with an 8 MP camera and a 1.9 MP front camera with the ability to record HD video.  The camera has the same rich functionality (Buddy Photo <br>  Share, Burst Shot, Best Photo, etc.), which was previously presented in the smartphone GALAXY S III.  From there, the Smart Stay technology migrated to the new device, using the camera to control the device's transition to the standby mode while the user is watching the screen.  Also available is the AllShare Play function with which you can share content with other people in real time by connecting GALAXY Note II to HD TVs, phones, tablets, laptops and other devices on the network.  AllShare Group Cast allows users to collaborate on documents, presentations or images in real time, without downloading files separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8f/d29/788/c8fd29788f2c8d520772e74cbc63708b.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fa/12f/787/5fa12f787d1b1f21647d69d0619a8ce5.png"><br>  The new GALAXY Note II will appear in the markets of Europe, Asia and the Middle East in October, in two color variations: white marble and titanium gray. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> very soon we will tell you about other Samsung UNPACKED and IFA2012 updates, including the new ATIV Windows family ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/678/362/b26/678362b2607ab211b4c9bfd46b7254e0.png"><br>  and Galaxy Camera. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d1/6c6/69a/5d16c669aa4c7abc273b19a280afd57d.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150483/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150483/</a></p>
