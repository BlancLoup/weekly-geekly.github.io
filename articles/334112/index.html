  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nike Brand Story</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of June, the Cannes Lions international advertising festival was completed.  The highest award of the "Golden Lion" in individual nominations received 18 clips. <br>  Incredible success enjoyed video company Nike - five of them were recognized as winners according to critics. <br><br><h3>  Do it “just.” </h3><br>  Nike is a young corporation, the story begins in 1963.  The world was restored after the Second World War.  Phil Knight graduated from the university, briefly worked as a specialist in finance, and went to Japan to conclude the first business deal.  Did he know that he was destined to found a global brand? <br><br>  The idea of ​​Phil Knight was simple - to fill the American continent with inexpensive Asian-made sneakers, buying and selling.  Few people know, but originally the company was called Blue Ribbon Sports, and the running shoes, which it sold, bore the name "Tiger", now known under the Asics brand.

The Japanese were courteous and silent, they listened.  Knight finished the presentation, paused. <br><br>  “What company do you represent?” The question of the partners broke the silence. <br><br>  “Blue Ribbon Sports!” Knight smashed the first thing that came to mind.  That was in 1964. <br><br>  Closer to the 70th, the company has changed, management has completed the resale of shoes.  The epoch of own production has arrived, in connection with which there is a need to invent a new brand.  The team of Knight, which by that time had about 50 employees, went over several dozen ideas - brainstorming did not give results.  Time passed inexorably. <br><br>  Phil Knight chose between Falcon (falcon) and Dimension 6 (sixth dimension) —the last one liked because he invented it himself.  Phil's companions were honest - long names were not original and empty. <br><br>  Successful thought was born suddenly!  The first employee of Blue Ribbon Sports, Jeff Johnson, saw the word "Nike" in a dream.  The name comes from the Greek goddess of Victory (pronounced "ny'-kee").  In Russia, speaking of a well-known brand, they say: “Nike,” but the correct one is “Nike.”  The word "Nike" is consonant with the surname of the founder: Knight-Nike. <br><br>  The appearance of a new name was preceded by one important event — the development of a logo.  The creation of the emblem was commissioned by Caroline Davidson, a student at Portland University, who received an education in advertising.  I needed a badge that can be easily placed on the boot: <br><br>  “What type?” Said Caroline. <br><br>  “I don't know ... Anything that evokes a feeling of movement!” Phil answered her. <br><br>  The first logos looked like lightning and turbulence, a “tick” was born on the second attempt - it looked like a wing and a trail of a sped runner.  At the end of the work, Caroline handed Knight "Swoosh" (originally SWOOSH), and he handed her $ 35.  (Even at 2014 prices it is very small). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d59/a65/707/d59a657077f04232bf9213faa4184b1d.png"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/nike90sport/">A source</a></i> <i><br></i> <br>  The rapid development of the company Nike put it on a par with the largest manufacturers of sportswear and footwear.  Phil Knight generously thanked Caroline - the founders held a gala evening in honor of the designer, where they handed the woman a gold ring with an engraved logo and a weighty envelope with stocks.  This is a good lesson, both for business creators and for young designers, do not be afraid to work for little money! <br><br>  What is “Sweet”?  The sound of cut air.  Why precisely he?  Nike sneakers were invented for running.  Step, movement, jerk, speed!  Shoes - freedom, ease, flexibility, depreciation, the famous "tick" combined in itself these concepts, becoming the only logo that has a name. <br><br>  The simplicity of the Nike corporate identity has allowed the brand to be remembered by several generations, and now it is clearly associated with sport, dynamism and constant movement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7c5/678/d14/7c5678d148f345ba8b9b789ec55198fd.png"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://planet-sports.com/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  Svush underwent only minor changes in more than 50 years of its existence. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/080/43d/694/08043d694a074398975d37230af40ee8.jpg"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://1000logos.net/nike-logo/">A source</a></i> <br><br>  The logo has changed, after 7 years from the moment of its appearance, in 1978 it became more “correct” in shape.  Rectangular inscription neatly placed above the picture.  A few years later, the "swush" slightly stretched out, like the distance between the letters, made the text more readable and dynamic, and in 1995 the brand underwent the last change, became quite recognizable for designers to remove the name reminder.  22 years have passed since that moment. <br><br>  Despite the popularity of products, Nike still had to compete with the leaders of the sports market.  Advertising that existed before the 80s, whose characters were famous athletes, lost its relevance - the sport became available to fans.  The company's management wanted a slogan that is able to motivate.  A phrase that will make everyone believe in himself: a boy from a school stadium or a participant in the Olympic Games. <br><br>  An important mission was performed by the advertising agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy, the founder of the company Dan Wieden took up the business.  After all, it was not only a monetary contract, but also a question of reputation.  Dan spent his days in endless searches, how could he come up with a capacious phrase that will be remembered? <br><br>  In 1977, Gary Gilmore was sentenced to death for the murder of several people.  The news spread all over the States - the court passed such a sentence in the USA for the first time in 10 years.  Gary was not a prosperous citizen, he spent most of his life in prison.  He deliberately chose the death penalty, refusing to ask for pardon. <br><br>  “So let's do it!” Said Gilmore solemnly.  (Original as: “Let's do it”).  The phrase with a little change was borrowed for an advertising campaign.  For the first time the slogan appeared in wide distribution in 1988.  Movie waiting for colossal success. <br><br>  Unlike “Swush”, which is performed in different colors for the style of sneakers, the inscription “Just do it” is used in two - black and white, rarely placed on clothes and is rather a slogan and logo of company policy than products.  Here, the designers did not deviate from the company's “corporate style”: ease in font, rectangular shape, letters of equal height, in a word - minimalism. <br><br>  So, if you’ve been looking for a simple design that will be known to millions, then: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d41/97d/290/d4197d2905d64ae3aec9a3ce109c1b94.png"><br><br>  <i><a href="http://womenonthefence.co/">Image source</a></i> <br><br>  The text was prepared by Logomyshina’s copywriter - Alena Kovalenko </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334112/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334112/</a></p>
