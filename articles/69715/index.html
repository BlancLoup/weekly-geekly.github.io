      THE FIRST STEPS <br><br>  In 1933, the first unmanned aerial vehicle Queen Bee was developed in the UK.  For testing, three restored Fairy Queen biplanes were used, which were remotely controlled from the ship by radio.  Two of them crashed, and the third made a successful flight, making Britain the first country to create and place a radio-controlled air target on the wing. <br><br>  German scientists were ahead of their time for decades.  In the world almost until the end of the 1980s, each successful design of unmanned aerial vehicles represented the implementation of the ideas of building flying vehicles based on the V-1 cruise missile or the Focke-Wulf aircraft (Fw 189). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db5/b34/998/db5b34998a9e362d84e7e6de2b0034c8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"V-1"</i> <br><br>  The first unmanned vehicles in the form of air-to-surface weapons were used by the US Navy during World War II. <br><br>  In 1944, the US Navy attempted to use remotely piloted carrier-based vehicles - converted B-17 aircraft to attack German submarine bases. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/681/083/02a/68108302a520ec2b813cfe813b54b04d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>B -17</i> <br><br>  In the USAF, unmanned aerial vehicles appeared as controlled airborne objects in the late 1940s.  At first they were ordinary aircraft equipped with remote control flight systems.  They were used as targets for anti-aircraft weapons, training exercises for anti-aircraft guns and air defense units.  Later, in 1951, special radio-controlled air targets and unmanned reconnaissance aircraft began to be created. <br><br>  Note that unmanned vehicles appeared as a result of the construction of aircraft models and the transfer of pilot functions to automatic devices and instruments.  In many print media and electronic media, various terminological abbreviations and abbreviations are used to designate and describe unmanned aerial vehicles.  Often, authors of texts, translations and materials provide abbreviations from English - UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle / Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle) - and Russian transcription - UAV (a historical abbreviation).  Most often, UAV and UAVs are understood precisely as software and remotely controlled aircraft without differentiating them according to their characteristics and control methods, although, depending on the methods and flight control systems, they can be divided into two classes: unmanned software piloted aircraft (UAVs) and remotely piloted aircraft aircraft (RPV).  Since practically all unmanned vehicles created in the USA and other countries were built using elements of software (autonomous) control systems, we will further denote them using the abbreviations UAV and UAV. <br><br>  Unique to their time with the developments and mass production of steel, the American Firebay (Fire Bee) family UAVs from Teledyne Ryan. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f73/f30/589/f73f30589b5e587cea2870bc54a04688.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Firebee</i> <br><br>  In the period from 1948 to 1995, they were represented by various models and modifications of unmanned aircraft with turbojet engines: target UAVs (subsonic and supersonic), reconnaissance UAVs, radio countermeasure UAVs, impact and multifunctional UAVs.  Many devices created on the basis of the air target BQM-34A Firebee, for a long time were in service with the Air Force, the Army and the US Navy. <br><br>  In the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953), the US Air Force attempted to use unmanned Firebee targets with photographic equipment for reconnaissance of ground targets, and Tarzan radio-controlled bombs to destroy bridges. <br><br>  In the early 1960s, the US Air Force was tasked with monitoring missile tests in the Soviet Union and detecting the positions of Soviet missile systems.  After the RB-47 and two U2 spy planes were shot down over USSR territory, the development of the Red Wagon unmanned reconnaissance vehicle (Model 136) was started in the United States.  This UAV had high wings, low radar and infrared visibility. <br><br>  During the Vietnam War (1965‚Äì1973), the Firebee medium-altitude UAVs were successfully used for aerial reconnaissance and surveillance by the US Air Force and Navy.  They could be launched from the ground and from an aircraft carrier.  In the course of separate operations, the UAVs were launched from aircraft carriers.  They have made about 3400 flights over the well-protected territory of northern Vietnam.  With the increase in American aviation losses from ground-based air defense systems, the demand for the use of unmanned aircraft for photo and radio intelligence from a great height has sharply increased.  Created by Teledyne Ryan, the Model 147E high-altitude UAV of electronic reconnaissance transmitted information about the SA-2a Vietnamese SA-2a (C75) air defense system to its ground station during its flight. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6b5/5b8/bc3/6b55b8bc3a3e922e750e608270fdcb5f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>SA-2a SA-2a (C75)</i> <br><br>  Despite the fact that he was shot down in one of the sorties, the assessment by the US military of its use was very high, it was weighed against the full cost of the development program of this device.  In total, in the Vietnam War, American UAVs made almost 3,500 flights, with losses amounting to about 4%.  UAVs were used for photo reconnaissance, detection of radio-electronic means and other enemy objects, signal relaying, electronic warfare and setting false targets to complicate the air situation.  But the full program of using unmanned systems was shrouded in mystery so that its success, which was supposed to stimulate the development of UAVs after the end of the war, remained almost unnoticed by the US leadership. <br><br>  Subsequent events and technical advances have caused significant changes in the understanding by the leadership of the US Department of Defense of the role and place of UAVs in the weapons system.  From the mid-1980s, US aircraft manufacturing companies began to develop and build automated tactical and operational-strategic unmanned aerial vehicles. <br><br>  SOVIET EXPERIENCE <br><br>  In the USSR, from 1930 to 1940, the aircraft designer V.Nikitin developed a special-purpose torpedo-glider (PSN-1 and PSN-2) of the type ‚Äúflying wing‚Äù in two versions: manned training-sighting and unmanned with full automation.  By the beginning of 1940, a draft of a flying torpedo with a flight range of 100 km or more (flight speed of 700 km / h) was prepared.  However, these developments were not destined to translate into real design.  In 1941, before the beginning of the Great Patriotic War (1941‚Äì1945), in the USSR there were successful applications of heavy bombers TB-3 as unmanned vehicles for the destruction of bridges.  Nevertheless, in the war and after it they were practically not used. <br><br>  In 1957 (September 23), the Design Bureau of A.N.Tupolev received a state order for the development of a nuclear supersonic medium-range cruise missile.  The first take-off of the winged model Tu-121 was carried out on August 25, 1960, but the program was closed in favor of the ballistic missiles of S.P. Korolev Design Bureau.  The created structure found its use as a target and was adopted as the basis for the design and construction of the Tu-123 supersonic unmanned aerial vehicle "Yastreb" (flight range up to 4000 km).  Subsequently, the Tu-300 ‚ÄúKite‚Äù drums were developed at the AN Tupolev Design Bureau. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01b/172/9a3/01b1729a3139ee88b359f43eb410db7f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>BLA Tu-300 "Kite"</i> <br><br>  unmanned reconnaissance aircraft (BSR) Tu-141 Strizh and Tu-143 Reis.  They were mass-produced and were in service with the USSR Air Force. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c28/9f3/fb6/c289f3fb657cbaf7b81ee2001b64df23.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Tu-143 "Flight"</i> <br><br>  The complex with the BSR "Flight" in the 1970s was supplied to some African and Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq. <br><br>  Modernized and manufactured in the 1980s, airborne reconnaissance systems BP-2 with the Strizh device for operations in the operational zone, BP-3 with the Reis unmanned aircraft for operations in the tactical zone and Reis-D (Tu-243) with increased range are in service with the Russian Air Force.  The BP-3 complex with the BSR Reis is also part of the Ukrainian Air Force. <br><br>  In 1997, the Stroy-P reconnaissance complex with the Pchela unmanned aircraft (lead developer - Kulon Research Institute) was accepted into service by the Russian Land Forces and Airborne Forces. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16e/ee3/211/16eee3211ebc04133aac098e62afd774.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Bee"</i> <br><br>  This complex was used in the counter-terrorist operation of the united group of federal forces in the North Caucasus (1999‚Äì2000).  As part of the modernization program of the Stroy-P complex, the research institute Kulon developed a tactical small-scale reconnaissance and observation complex of the battlefield with the Pchela-1 unmanned vehicle (the new Pchela-1 devices from the base model developed by the A. A. Design Bureau. S. Yakovleva in the 1980s, differ in the modified composition of the target equipment). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d8/de8/c18/1d8de8c18b6108fc6ee47ac819d68289.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Tipchak"</i> <br>  In 2007, Luch Design Bureau completed the construction of the Tipchak unmanned artillery reconnaissance complex for the regimental and brigade units of the Ground Forces of the Russian Armed Forces (according to the results of state tests, the complex was accepted into service). <br><br>  MIDDLE EASTERN DIRECTION <br><br>  In the 1970‚Äì1990s and the following years, Israeli military specialists, scientists and designers made a significant contribution to the development of unmanned vehicles.  It so happened that Israel occupies one of the leading places in the world in the creation and combat use of unmanned systems.  The project of armament of the Israeli Air Force with unmanned aerial vehicles began in 1969, led by Colonel Oded Erez, who was assisted by Lieutenant Colonel Yoesh (Chato) Tsidon, a representative of the American company Teledyne Ryan in Israel.  Later on, the project was headed by Beni Peled, commander of the Israeli Air Force in 1973-1977. <br><br>  For the first time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) faced the urgent need to have unmanned aerial vehicles during the War of Exhaustion (1969‚Äì1970).  Static hostilities took place simultaneously on three fronts: against Syria, Jordan, but first of all against Egypt.  Then the demand for aerial photography of ground objects sharply increased, but the Israeli Air Force found it difficult to satisfy all requests.  Often, the subjects were covered with a powerful air defense system.  In 1969, a group of Israeli officers conducted experiments on installing cameras in the case of commercial radio-controlled models.  With their use, photographs of the Jordanian and Egyptian positions were obtained.  Major Shabtai Bril from military intelligence and Shlomo Barak from the Air Force participated in these experiments.  They developed several prototypes.  But these experiments did not continue.  The leadership of military intelligence demanded a UAV with higher tactical and technical characteristics, primarily with a longer range, and the Air Force command was preparing for the purchase of jet unmanned aircraft in the United States at that time on the recommendation of the ‚Äúbuy UAV‚Äù group. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/917/58a/9d7/91758a9d7a4f141d30690fa907c5acea.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>"Mabat"</i> <br>  A little later, another group was formed that was involved in the creation of UAVs for the IDF.  This group included: American engineer Al Alice, Israeli Air Force pilot, lieutenant colonel of the reserve Yehuda Manor, Ezra Dotan (Babin) and Shlomo Barak mentioned above.  They created the company "Eirmeko" (AIRMECO) and developed the original small-sized UAV with two engines, capable of lifting a load of 12 kg.  The vehicle crashed on the very first test flight from the Sirkis airfield due to a breakdown in one of the engines.  But the work continued.  With the help of Nick Ziroli, the designer of the controlled aircraft models, who was one of the first designers of the UAV in the American firm Filco Ford, a new unmanned vehicle, Owl, was created.  Eirmeko employees tried to interest Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI - ‚ÄúIsraeli Aviation Industry‚Äù) in their development, but they didn‚Äôt show interest in the created ‚Äútoy‚Äù. <br><br>  In March 1970, the Israeli Air Force delegation left for the United States.  In late July of the same year, a contract was signed with Teledyne Ryan, an American company, to develop the Firebee Model 124I reconnaissance UAV (‚ÄúMabat‚Äù) and manufacture 12 such devices for Israel.  After 11 months, the cars were delivered to Israel.  On August 1, 1971, a special squadron was created for their operation - the 200th, the first UAV squadron in the Israeli Air Force. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64b/234/6fb/64b2346fbc5c98fa83a227956cbedb7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>"Shadmit"</i> <i><br></i> <br>  Notable developments and models ordered by the Israeli Air Force in the USA were modifications of unmanned aircraft of the Firebee family - Mabat reconnaissance UAVs (Model 124I, Model 147SD) and Shadmit UAVs (Model 232, Model 232B) manufactured by Teledyne Ryan, - as well as UAV-traps (false targets) to combat the enemy‚Äôs MQM-74A Chukar air defense systems by Northrop Grumman, which were named Tel in Israel.  In 1973, these vehicles were used by Israel during the Arab-Israeli conflict (‚ÄúDoomsday War‚Äù) for observing, reconnaissance of ground targets and setting false air targets.  Unmanned reconnaissance aircraft "Mabat" made aerial photographs of dislocations of troops, anti-aircraft missile batteries, airfields, carried out reconnaissance of objects before air strikes and assess the results of these strikes.  Soon after the end of the 1973 war, the Israeli Air Force made a second order for 24 Mabat vehicles.  The approximate cost of a UAV of this type with additional equipment was $ 4 million, the aircraft itself cost about $ 2 million. Mabat and Tel ‚Äùunmanned aircraft were purchased until 1990 and were used as part of the Israeli Air Force until 1995 inclusive;  The Shadmit targets were in service with the Air Force until 2007. <br><br>  Along with orders and purchases of UAVs from US manufacturing firms, Israel‚Äôs own powerful base for the design and construction of unmanned complexes was created in Israel over several years.  The most active and far-sighted in the strategy of the UAV was the Israeli firm - manufacturer of electronics "Tadiran."  Thanks to the initiative of its director Akiva Meir, she bought the rights to the improved Owl UAV from AIRMECO in 1974 and from that moment became the first industrial manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles in Israel.  Since 1975, Israel has moved to the development and production of its own UAVs, the first of which was the Sayar (Mastiff export name Mastiff) of the manufacturer Tadiran.  This unmanned aircraft was first introduced to the general public in 1978;  he and his advanced models were in service with military intelligence. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a63/921/8c3/a639218c32f14c5c4e321b32f7cc6800.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>UAV-spy "Scout"</i> <br><br>  By order of the Israeli Air Force, the IAI company developed and created Scout-type devices (‚ÄúScout‚Äù), in Hebrew - ‚ÄúZahavan‚Äù.  The first combat sortie of the spy UAV was performed on April 7, 1982, to Lebanon, after Operation Peace for Galilee (Lebanon war of 1982). <br><br>  IMPRESSIVE SUCCESS <br><br>  In 1982, Israeli-made unmanned aerial vehicles were used during the fighting in the Bekaa Valley in Lebanon.  IAI‚Äôs small-sized ‚ÄúMastiff‚Äù UAV ‚ÄúTadiran‚Äù and ‚ÄúScout‚Äù carried out reconnaissance of Syrian airfields, air defense system positions and troop movements.  According to information obtained using the Scout, a distracting group of Israeli aviation before the strike of the main forces initiated the inclusion of the Syrian air defense missile radar, which were hit by self-guided anti-radar missiles.  Those air defense weapons that were not destroyed were suppressed by interference.  In press, it was reported that during the war of 1982, the high point of the IDF anti-radar weapons arrived.  On June 9, in the course of Operation Artsav-19 against the Syrian air defense missile system in Lebanon, the Phantom fighter jets launched about 40 new type of guided missiles, the Standard (AGM-78 Standard ARM), and also attacked ground-based weapons - Kakhlilit. and Keres.  In the course of the operation, false air targets ‚Äî Tel, Samson and Dalila ‚Äî were also widely used. <br><br>  The success of Israeli aviation at the time was really impressive.  Syria‚Äôs air defense system in Lebanon was crushed.  Syria lost 86 combat aircraft and 18 ZRK batteries.  Analysts noted that in June 1982, during the fifth Arab-Israeli war, a strange "attack" suddenly struck the Syrian air defense system.  In a short period, a large number of launchers and command posts were destroyed.  And often Israeli rockets fell right into the open hatches of ground vehicles, which did not fit into the theory of probability.  The military experts invited by the Syrian leadership from the Soviet Union at that time concluded: the Israelis used a new tactic - a combination of UAVs with television cameras on board and missiles being launched with them.  This was the first such spectacular use of unmanned aircraft, which today predict total supremacy in the "sky of the future." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9c/2a1/cd2/c9c2a1cd24c9c717c1283cd0dcba5cb9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>UAV Israel</i> <br><br>  In November 1988, the IDF command decided to purchase the Pioneer UAI and its command stations.  The aircraft was developed in 1986 for the US Army (the so-called RQ-2 Pioneer) and was manufactured in the United States under license from AAI Corporation.  Soon, however, the decision was changed and the UAI was manufactured by IAI Searcher Mk I (in Hebrew - ‚ÄúHugla‚Äù).  For the first time the UAV "Hugla" was demonstrated in mid-March 1989.  Its Israeli Air Force shipments began in July 1992;  it was removed from service as the Scout (Zahavan) UAV in 2005.  Since 1995, the squadron of the Air Force and other units of the Israeli army supplied such UAVs as: IAI "Sercher-2" (Searcher Mk II; in Hebrew - "Kochav Laban");  Hunter production IAI (they were built in small quantities from 1988 to 1995);  IAI Harpy (¬´¬ª); ¬´-450¬ª (Hermes-450S,   ‚Äì ¬´¬ª  ¬´ ¬ª)   ¬´¬ª (Elbit Systems); ¬´-1¬ª (Heron-1,     IAI ‚Äì ¬´-1¬ª,      ¬´¬ª,    2005    2007   ¬´¬ª  IAI   PHB,       IAI    ). <br><br> 8  2007     -     ,     :    Skylite B (¬´¬ª)   RAFAEL (¬´¬ª,   ‚Äì ¬´¬ª)    ‚Äì Heron TP (¬´¬ª)   IAI,    ¬´-2¬ª. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b1c/d2b/a22/b1cd2ba224187137e775d83da5b6b4dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br> <i>Heron TP</i> <br><br>  ,   ¬´¬ª        .           ,   ¬´¬ª (Pioneer)        . <br><br>     <br><br>  1980‚Äì1990-                  ,     .          :        ¬´¬ª, ¬´¬ª  ¬´¬ª;   IAI         Pioneer  Hunter,  -, , ,  ‚Äì  Searcher.        ,  ,           ,        . ,  -   Kontron    - Seeker (¬´¬ª)     240 .           1986 .    ,          ( 750 . .).          ¬´-2¬ª      400 .
