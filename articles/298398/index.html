  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Which IT specialists are now in demand in Germany (performance report)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I am writing a report based on the last 5 months of active project development. <br><br>  The report consists of 3 parts: <br>  1. What IT specialists are needed now (on the example of Germany).  I think that this also applies to all of Europe, but so far everyone is settling in Germany. <br>  2. What important points I noticed in the process of working with candidates <br>  3. Announcement of the project's functionality (it will be useful for those who are not going to go abroad yet) <br><br>  <b>1. Trends.</b> <br>  <b>What experts are needed most often</b> <br>  The project constantly receives requests for senior programmers and <b>Team Lead</b> . <br>  The most requested programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare <b>PHP, JavaScript, NodeJs, Ruby, Scala, and Java.</b> <br>  Frameworks do not play a very important role, but it‚Äôs still worth pointing out.  For example: Angular, React, Backbone, Zend <br>  There are also requests for UI-UX designers and QA.  But they are much smaller. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Companies</b> <br>  Companies are very different, from well-known large companies to start-ups.  I tried to derive differences in the requirements for candidates depending on the level of the company, but there are no clear trends.  All individually.  In fact, the result depends on the candidate.  If a candidate demonstrates a high level of technical knowledge and knows English well, then he should not cling to any particular company.  Such a candidate will find a job with a 90% guarantee. <br><br>  <b>Geography offers</b> <br>  So far, Germany (Berlin and Frankfurt).  This is due to the fact that the growth rate of the IT industry in Germany exceeds all expectations. <br>  Since among the candidates there is a demand for the UK, Holland and Singapore, I develop these areas.  But it is quite difficult to reach out to agents and employers, since they have a very vague idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe post-Soviet countries in the context of the level of knowledge of IT specialists.  Germany has long understood this, but other countries, especially Singapore, have not yet.  But the water wears away the stone. <br><br>  <b>2. Important points for candidates</b> <br>  <b>Underestimation of their knowledge and capabilities</b> <br>  Very often, candidates underestimate their level - indicate Middle instead of Senior.  This is despite the fact that the level of knowledge of basic technologies tends to 100%.  In the process of clarifying the reasons, I found out that most often the candidates believe that the Senior requires a team management experience.  Yes and no at the same time.  It depends on what the employer puts into this concept.  It is for this reason that I advise you to rely on your technical knowledge in determining the level of qualification.  The fact is that employers often look at the headlines in a resume and look for a senior there.  All the rest are immediately discarded and no one even knows how talented guys they have just missed. <br><br>  I must note that programmers from the CIS are immediately expected to have a high level.  That is why the red tape with visas does not frighten the employer.  I have often heard from agents that they have already successfully arranged candidates from the CIS.  And even those who work with EU candidates never refuse to see a candidate‚Äôs resume from, for example, Russia, Ukraine or Kazakhstan. <br><br>  <b>Causes of failure</b> <br>  Most often insufficient knowledge of the language.  Alas, this is still a problem. <br>  Much less often - technical knowledge, but this is more related to the Middle, who are sometimes invited to be interviewed. <br><br>  And there is one more thing (concerns me and the project) - to create a questionnaire and then not respond to letters.  Probably not get rid of this, but I ask you to create a questionnaire only if you really have an interest. <br><br>  <b>The announcement of the new functionality on the site</b> <br>  There are still some important points that I did not indicate in the second section.  They concern the summary.  But it makes no sense to write about this until the functional itself is ready.  I expect to launch a section by the end of February to help create an IT resume.  It sounds trite, but I gathered some important information for almost a year of the project, both from my own experience and from communication with agents and employers.  I also implement all this in the form of a functional. <br><br><blockquote>  The main conclusion: programmers from the CIS are cool, and if English is also tightened, then they will not be priced! </blockquote><br><br>  Thank you all for your attention.  Good luck. <br><br>  PS: I often post current vacancies in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">facebook group</a> .  So if you want to be in the know, click like in the group and you will find out all first. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298398/</a></p>
