The stand itself is plastic, its upper surface is made of aluminum, it stands on 4 rubberized circles.  Also, the stand is equipped with a <em>built-in USB hub for 4 ports,</em> powered by 5V voltage via a standard miniUSB input.  There is an off / on lever. <br>  Technological specification: <br><ul><li>  Airflow - 28 CFM </li><li>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- 1500 rpm </li><li>  Noise level - 25 dBa </li><li>  Voltage - 5V </li><li>  Size of coolers - 60 * 60 * 10 </li><li>  Resource - 20,000 hours </li><li>  The amount of delivery - 300 * 230 * 13.8 mm </li></ul><br>  To test the stand was taken laptop Acer Aspire 4920 c dual-core processor 1.83 GHz and 2 GB of RAM.  Mileage - a year and 4 months.  The operating system is Windows Vista. <br>  The principle of the test was as follows: measure the temperature of the main components of the laptop (processor, memory) at various loads without a stand and with a stand.  The temperature <em>fan was</em> used to measure the temperature <em>.</em>

And it is important for several reasons.  Firstly, if your laptop is very hot, then it is quite problematic to keep it on your lap or easily inflammable surfaces.  The tested Acer can easily burn a hole in a regular A4 sheet.  Secondly - it is not very comfortable to type on a hot keyboard.  <strong>And thirdly, and most importantly</strong> , the temperature rise of the conductor leads to an increase in its resistance ( <em>physics, section conductors, paragraph 48 - a consequence of the Joule-Lens law</em> ).  Plus, in modern processors there is a system of protection against overheating.  So that your processor does not melt, with a strong increase in temperature, it begins to skip some cycles in its work.  That is, CONDITIONALLY, if it performs 100 clock cycles (actions) in a normal state, then at a high temperature it will do 50 clock cycles.  In simple language - <strong>the higher the temperature of your computer, the lower its performance!</strong>  In general, the temperature of the computer - very, very important thing. <br><br>  Let's start the test.  To begin, we will measure the temperature in a state of conditioned rest. <br>  The screenshot below shows the temperature of the main devices, as well as the load on the processor. <br><br><img src="http://www.ohmygadget.ru/catalog/blog/test1.jpg" width="413" height="474"><br><br>  Next, includes Photoshop and Counter-Strike.  After 20 minutes, we look at how the temperature has changed: <br><br><img src="http://www.ohmygadget.ru/catalog/tests/test2.jpg" width="410" height="481"><br><br>  We see that the temperature has risen strongly, and is not safe for a laptop.  This is signaled by red lights near the temperature values.  In addition, the processor load is 100%, and the game Counter-Strike noticeably ‚Äúslows down‚Äù (and this is on 2 cores and 2 GB of RAM !!!). <br><br>  Now turn on the stand.  It works very quietly, but still a quiet, unobtrusive sound from the coolers is heard. <br>  We continue to play CS and watch the temperature change. <br>  Already after a few minutes the temperature went down, and after 20 minutes it became quite comfortable for work.  The keyboard is cool, the "brakes" in the game have disappeared. <br><br><img src="http://www.ohmygadget.ru/catalog/tests/test3.jpg" width="411" height="476"><br><br>  Turn off the game and photoshop and leave the computer to work in the conditional state of rest.  We look at the results: <br><br><img src="http://www.ohmygadget.ru/catalog/tests/test5-2.jpg" width="414" height="477"><br><br>  It is easy to notice, comparing with the first screenshot in this article, that the temperature of the computer with the stand is much lower than without it. <br>  Below is a graph of changes in the temperature of the computer for the entire test time: <br><br><img src="http://www.ohmygadget.ru/catalog/tests/test5-5.jpg" width="412" height="478"><br><br>  All phases of the test are very well visible on this graph: work at rest (indicated by the chart as <em>‚Äú</em> <em>USP‚Äù</em> ), work with the programs on (indicated on the chart as ‚ÄúCS 1.5 + adobe CS3‚Äù).  And the moment when the stand was turned on is very well noticeable. <br><br>  From this we can conclude that our stand under the laptop fully and efficiently performs its functions, namely, produces cooling the computer.  In addition, it has a built-in hub for 4 ports, which is also a definite plus.  It can easily be taken to bed to work on a laptop while lying down or to gaze at a movie, without straining about the fact that it is unevenly standing and warms your legs very much, and besides, it still looks very stylish!  A very important nuance - the air intakes at the stand are located on the end and not on the bottom, so that the device can be safely used on any surface (blankets, sofas, knees, etc.) <br>  Our verdict is a great stand, a great product! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86032/</a></p>
