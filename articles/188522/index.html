  <section class="page js-page"><h1>You will have to pay for public music playback.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On July 22 of this year, the Rossiyskaya Gazeta published a draft order ‚ÄúOn the approval of minimum interest rates, as well as the procedure for collecting, distributing and paying remuneration for certain types of use of works and phonograms published for commercial purposes.‚Äù <br><br>  And it seems to be okay, since the reproduction for commercial purposes, it should be taxed.  By the way, if you turned on your favorite track in your car and were heard by others - this is a commercial purpose. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so, here is a link to the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2013/07/22/avtor-site-dok.html">draft order,</a> according to which it is now proposed to pay for each square meter of music you illegally voiced.  Let me quote some provisions of the planned law: 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <blockquote>  Payers of the author‚Äôs remuneration for public performance / public display of works are individuals (including individual entrepreneurs) or legal entities, regardless of their legal form, as well as other subjects of civil law (the Russian Federation, a subject of the Russian Federation or a municipality) organizing public performance / public demonstration of the work in live performance or with the help of technical means in a place open to the public, or in a place where  There is a significant number of non-family members, that is, a person who takes the initiative and responsibility for conducting a performance / public show. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Payers pay an award for using works at minimum rates in accordance with this Regulation both for paid and free entrance for viewers (listeners), regardless of the number of copyright holders per work, and whether the works are subject to legal protection, live performance, including with the participation of the artist, who is the author of the works, or the performance is carried out using various technical means (radio, television and other technical  x funds), regardless of the payment of remuneration to performers. </blockquote><br>  Those.  in fact, it does not matter at all whether you take money to listen to music at the club or <s>turn on the ‚ÄúO man, what a man!‚Äù</s> at the cottage <s>at 3 o'clock in the morning,</s> cook barbecues under Trofim at your dacha.  If the neighbors hear, then you are breaking the law.  By the way, not necessarily neighbors, but anyone who "does not belong to the ordinary family circle."  Great, right? <br><br>  Finally, I will also leave a link to the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2013/07/22/muzika-site.html">comments of Vladislav Kulikov</a> in which all the charms of the bill are more fully described. <br><br>  Interestingly, this new project is again invented to distract from something really important, or is Mikhalkov missing the island? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> In the discussion there was a small dispute about the law, you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/188522/">from here</a> .  Lord skeptics, on Sunday on one of the TV channels of my city there is a program in which the new law will be partially covered.  There is a Skype record with one of the representatives of RAO, which clearly states that yes, it is planned to penalize not everyone who included the ringtone on the bus, but those who publicly play music are potential payers.  For objective reasons, I can not put the record in public access before the release of the TV program, but on Monday I will definitely provide a link to the video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188522/</a></p>
