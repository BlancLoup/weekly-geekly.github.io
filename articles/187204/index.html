However, after the birth of time, she became sorely lacking, and clearly needed my help.  The only adequate way out of the situation that has come to my IT head is to entrust this business to a machine, or rather to a robot vacuum cleaner. <br><br>  Only two questions bothered me: <br><ul><li>  Which robot to choose? </li><li>  Where to buy it? </li></ul><br>  In this article, I would like to share with you the experience of choosing, buying and impressions of using a robot vacuum cleaner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>

    <h4>  Selection </h4><br>  After reading a few reviews and comparisons, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159965/">here</a> , <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru/articles/robotic_vacuum_cleaner">here</a> , <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/home/iclebo-arte.shtml">here</a> and many more places, I looked at two popular gadgets - Neato and Roomba.  It is they who divide among themselves practically the entire western market of robotic vacuum cleaners.  Roomba is a much more popular robot, but if you look at the real characteristics and reviews, I liked Neato more.  Plus, for the rumba would have to overpay about $ 300. <br><br>  The first thing you notice in Neato is that for its parameters and functions the robot is not at all expensive.  In America, this vacuum cleaner can be bought for about 10 thousand wooden, well, or $ 320 with free shipping for US.  At the same time, Neato removes no worse than its more expensive counterparts - and, unlike Roomba, it is equipped with a full-fledged navigation system and does not waste a lot of time on randomly moving around the apartment.  Having a toy of some kind of intelligence is captivating - you want to pay for something really relevant, supporting the development of such technology. <br>  The same important point that bribed me when reading the reviews is that Neato works as a full vacuum cleaner, i.e.  he has a good traction, of course in this regard, and more noise from him. <br><br>  Neato has several major advantages: <br><ul><li>  High cleaning speed </li><li>  Fewer accidents </li><li>  Stable quality of cleaning - the robot does not miss any areas and, in general, is cleaned very well </li></ul><br><br>  There are also disadvantages, but they are not so significant: <br><ul><li>  The controversial design is something very bright and vaguely reminiscent of a transformer. </li><li>  The distance finder-navigator is taken out in a separate ‚Äúturret‚Äù, which bulges a little, therefore, Neato may not be able to get under some sofas or wardrobes with low seating, as its competitors will do </li><li>  The lack of analysis of the degree of contamination seems unpleasant, but in fact it almost does not spoil the impression.  If Neato cleans up daily, the pollution that needs to be given greater attention simply does not appear.  And the robot vacuum cleaner is bought for permanent work. <br></li></ul><br>  Since none of the shortcomings became critical for me, I decided to take the Neato XV-21, the latest model available in stores today. <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4><br>  In our stores, I didn‚Äôt even look closely at robots - I had enough impressions from the prices that were almost doubled - so I started searching on eBay, Amazon and other large stores that are recommended by the <a href="http://www.neatorobotics.com/where-to-buy/">manufacturer</a> .  By the way, there is no sense to buy Neato on the official website - there are not those 30-40 percent discounts that make the price so tasty. <br>  As for the prices on eBay and Amazon - they are almost the same, and here it is worth proceeding from what is more convenient to pay.  If PayPal - then go to eBay, if the credit card - then to Amazon. <br><br>  I bought Neato XV-21 on eBay.  It cost me $ 329, while on Amazon it could be ordered for $ 335. <br><br>  For delivery, as is often the case, the seller did not send the goods anywhere except by the US, in connection with which I had to use the services of the <a href="https://qwintry.com/ru">Parcel Post</a> , this is an intermediary in the states who receives your purchases in the USA and sends them to your address.  Among the many intermediaries, Banderolk stands out for its extremely distinct and adequate pricing policy, as well as responsive Russian-language support.  That confirms my own experience of delivering devices through this service.  And since they aren‚Äôt looking for well from good, I decided to entrust the delivery of an expensive purchase to them. <br><br>  Delivery, I designed the SPSR-express.  After 11 days, the courier delivered the package home to Ulyanovsk.  It is important to note that the Russian Post did not touch my package and it is very pleasing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ff/ba6/882/3ffba688248019f1d234a204693d33d2.jpg"><br><br>  Charges: vacuum cleaner + shipping 10429 + 4145 = 14574r <br>  At the time of purchase, the most adequate prices in Russia started at 20,000 rubles, so the net savings were approximately 5,500 rubles. <br><br>  Shipping cost is due to the large weight of the gadget itself - it weighs about 7.3kg in the factory box.  Since a parcel package, the reduction in the cost of shipping one kilogram is progressive - simply, the more you order, the less it will cost 1 kg of delivery - in order to save, it makes sense to buy an extra battery, brushes and filters, but I didn‚Äôt bother about it.  In principle, the parcel can be supplemented with anything - the main thing is to observe the limit: 1000 euros and 40 pounds of weight. <br><br><h4>  Impressions </h4><br>  Both my wife and I are extremely pleased with our new pet.  This is a really useful gadget, it saves a lot of time.  Carpets and a variety of coatings do not interfere with the robot vacuuming, in our apartment there is tile, and laminate, and carpet.  The only thing with which he is not on friendly terms is with long curtains, it is better to pick them up at the time of cleaning;  wires that should be hidden if possible, and with floor cloths that he chews.  The rest of the quality of cleaning immaculate! <br>  Of course, in bachelor's days, when I lived alone, the issue with cleaning the floors was resolved quite simply - not to give sneakers to guests, so all the main ‚Äúpaths‚Äù were clean) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c8/253/7a9/9c82537a926b921bd366e2474f95b0c8.jpg"><br><br>  An important point about noise.  Yes, as indicated in the reviews and comparisons, the Neato XV-21 is noisy, and decently - in general, like a wat vacuum cleaner for 1400, and I initially planned to use it only in our absence, but in fact we often turn it on we are at home, and the child fell asleep a couple of times thanks to the rhythmic hum. <br>  Video of the beginning of the harvest, as well here is shown restrictive tape <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gro_JLf5aVw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhit_c-6qOFDlXtII5pEX6x-rCTjxw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video of how Neato parks, very funny by the way) <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zyxPzaZb9NQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEDC11A0K846byeDdiF0exniTrTg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Neato also has a useful ‚ÄúClear Spot‚Äù function that allows you to clean a small area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout a meter by two, which is sometimes very useful.  Is there such a function in rumba I can not say. <br><br>  PS Actually, in the article I described those moments that worried me when I bought a robot, if you have any questions, ask, I will try to answer, check it out live. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187204/</a></p>
