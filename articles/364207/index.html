      In order to successfully complete TOEFL tasks, fluency in the language and competent written language are required.  Successful preparation for the test for 4-8 weeks is possible if the applicant speaks English at a level not lower than Intermediate.  Options differ not only in terms of time and intensity, TOEFL training is divided into three main forms: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://toefl-test.ru/kursy-toefl-v-moskve/">specialized courses</a> ; <br>  ‚Ä¢ classes with a tutor; <br>  ‚Ä¢ self-training. <br>  Of course, it is impossible to unequivocally say which form of training is preferred.  The effectiveness of a particular type of occupation largely depends on the applicant, his level of knowledge and character. <br><br>  <b>Specialized courses</b> <br><br>  Training in courses is the best option for those who want to systematically prepare the exam and make sure that his knowledge of the sections Speaking and Writing are at the proper level.  Preparation takes place in a group under the supervision of a specialist, who can be individually consulted for clarification and advice.  The teacher will share his experience and tell about some features of the exam tactics.  It is better that an experienced teacher, who has experience in passing the test and who can share personal secrets and unobvious nuances, prepare you for TOEFL. <br>  Interacting with other participants in courses will help you to see your strengths and weaknesses, and also devote a sufficient amount of time to the Speaking section. <br><br>  <b>Tutoring</b> <br><br>  This method is the most expensive, but at the same time the most effective.  Usually it is chosen by employed applicants who cannot fit into the schedule of group classes.  It would also be wise to use it on an emergency basis, if instead of 4-8 weeks set aside for training, there are 2-3 remaining.  Often the tutor is chosen by people whose English level is below Intermediate, so that they can quickly ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù with the program.  TOEFL preparation under the guidance of a tutor has objective advantages: a personal approach, an individual program, convenient class time, the possibility of a detailed analysis of obscure topics and aspects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/1b6/c85/a961b6c85af84001863cb60fe2c15c7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Self-training</b> <br><br>  You should know that self-preparation for TOEFL is the most risky way.  Here all responsibility falls on the shoulders of the dealer.  Answers to all vague questions will have to look for yourself in textbooks or the Internet.  If you are not sure that you can do well with TOEFL without help, then it is better to choose one of the above methods. <br>  How to understand whether this way for you?  First of all, self-study is suitable for applicants with a high level of proficiency in the language, and for people with excellent self-organization and discipline.  Preparing yourself, you have to show your moral and volitional qualities and perseverance.  Especially for this, there are a large number of manuals, methods and Internet resources offering ready-made training programs. <br><br>  <b>TOEFL preparation tips</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Examine the requirements for each task thoroughly.
