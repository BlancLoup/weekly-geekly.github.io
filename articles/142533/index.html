So don‚Äôt judge strictly, I chose those hubs that seemed more appropriate to me. I‚Äôd be at it if someone tells me more suitable place if that). <br><br>  A couple of years ago I wrote my first non-technical post on Habr√© about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/88834/">life in Brazil</a> .  The topic turned out to be very popular, and since then I have already responded to more than one hundred messages with questions about life here. <br><br>  So now, about 2 years and a month later, I decided to write a sequel, and describe what has changed in the last 2 years.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For my part, quite a lot has changed.  Since the previous events, I first grew to a development manager in the Brazilian branch of Mandriva (to be exact, specifically in Konektive - the Brazilian part of the mandrivo-conglomerate of companies), then to the technical director for desktop areas, and finally about 9 months ago I went to work in Intel, where I still am.  At Intel, I work in the intel linux graphics <a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/team.html">team</a> , and I was responsible for the latest releases of our graphics drivers for Linux ( <a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2011Q4.html">2011Q4</a> and <a href="http://intellinuxgraphics.org/2012.02.html">2012.12</a> - they were already covered in the opennet), and I was directly working on their development.  For example, everything that we have released so far for the Intel Haswell GPU was written directly by <a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2012-March/015629.html">me</a> .  Although of course there are many other interesting projects, but I can‚Äôt tell you anything about them yet :). <br><br>  But returning to the subject of Brazil, in recent years quite a lot has changed here.  Although, when I tried to figure it all out, the main themes continue to be relevant, the differences are more in detail. <br><br>  The crises of the last years of Brazil practically did not touch, at least, they didn‚Äôt remember my friends or friends.  Yes, prices for gasoline, for alcohol (which has now been renamed ethanol to meet international standards, have increased, although it has not changed much from the technical side :)), and in general, inflation has raised prices for almost everything.  But on the other hand, salaries also rose, both minimal and more specific. <br><br>  Especially noticeable difference in salaries was outlined in the computer field.  As I already wrote, computer related professions in Brazil have been growing almost exponentially in recent years, and this is starting to produce its effects.  The difference between those who work as ‚Äúenikeyschiki‚Äù and real professionals becomes very large, and this is expressed also in salaries.  For example, the salary difference for the same profession (analista de sistemas, or system analyst in Russian) changes from an average salary of R $ 1,200 (for enikeyschikov, about 500 US $) to BRL 3000 (about 1,500 US $) for professionals.  Depending on professional growth, this difference grows even more - for example, salaries directly for programmers and computer experts grow up to BRL 30,000 and higher, and for enikeyschikov 2000 practically a ceiling.  And so on.  So there is a strange situation when there are hundreds of vacancies with good salaries, but it‚Äôs impossible to fill them - because most have learned to ‚Äúprogram‚Äù in C # and Java according to the minimum program, and when the word ‚Äúalgorithm‚Äù is in their eyes, tears come to their eyes.  Sad, in general ... <br><br>  But returning to the non-technical aspects, in terms of life priorities, for example, housing prices are constantly growing, but still remain accessible to the majority of those interested.  In recent years, the government has conducted many programs to provide housing for the poorest groups, collectively called ‚Äúminha casa, minha vida‚Äù (‚Äúmy home, my life‚Äù), providing very large loans to buy a home for those who receive less BRL 1800 per month.  There are still quite a lot of conditions, but in general, buying a house for a family with financing for 10-20-30 years does not present a particular problem.  Prices of course VERY vary depending on the city, state and district - for example, a large house with 3 bedrooms, a plot of 200 square meters.  meters, a garage for 3 cars in a good area is somewhere around 250-300 thousand reais in a medium-sized city.  In Sao Paulo, for example, such a house will cost about a million.  And in small towns it is quite possible to find exactly the same sentence for 70-100 thousand.  With financing for 20 years, the mortgage is somewhere around 9-10% per annum (although it depends on the bank, of course). <br><br>  From the point of view of renting an apartment or house, it is still quite expensive, since prices have increased in recent years due to the general growth of citizens' well-being.  In Sao Paulo, a one or two bedroom apartment close to the center will cost about 1800-2400 per month (which is, of course, expensive, but there are more than enough people willing).  In Curitiba, for example (where Konektiva‚Äôs headquarters is located), the same apartment will cost around 1200-1500.  In Sao Carlos (a city in the middle of the state of Sao Paulo) - it will cost about 700-900 reais per month.  And in small cities it is quite possible to find exactly the same, but for 300-500 reais per month.  So the difference is very, very significant - I don‚Äôt know how it is in Russia ... <br><br>  What is especially expensive here is all sorts of technological things.  Any car costs at least 2 times more than in any other country nearby, due to taxes.  For example, ford focus or renault logan which cost a maximum of 15 thousand reais in argentina / chile / mexico / ..., cost from 35 thousand here.  IPad costs from 1200 dollars.  Samsung galaxy S2 - 1000 dollars.  And so on.  Food, on the contrary, is cheap, it is quite possible to live well eating 20 BRL per day.  Particularly chic restaurants cost 40-60 reais for lunch, and 100-150 for dinner for two with good wine.  Although, of course, there is a particularly super-chic, where prices start from 100 reais and up to infinity :). <br><br>  As a bonus, for all computer and high-tech devices (and, in general, for any product - clothing, for example, or furniture), which are produced in Brazil - taxes are more than reduced, about 2 times (or even more).  So most people buy either local products (positivo, cce, itautec, semp toshiba), or products collected in Brazil from local factories (acer, lenovo, hp, etc.), which are built specifically for the local market.  If we consider that the sale of technological products in recent years has been growing about 2 times every year, then it is very profitable for manufacturers. <br><br>  Regarding health care ... The government has made many different programs to help low-income citizens.  For example, the most expensive drugs for particularly complex diseases, which cost several dozen minimum wages per month, are distributed free of charge.  There are free medical programs and affordable medicine, but ...  there are not enough doctors for everyone, and depending on the city and state, the situation can vary from ‚Äúaverage‚Äù to ‚Äúnone‚Äù.  Therefore, there are hundreds of private health programs and health plans.  The cost varies from 70 to 300 reais per month, and depending on the plan, insurance supports only the specific city in a particular state, and a full set of all kinds of surveys both in Brazil and abroad. <br><br>  Finally, about work ... There are many laws on work and the protection of workers from the arbitrariness of the employer.  It‚Äôs very difficult for a company owner to fire someone without a particularly good reason - since in this case you will have to pay at least a monthly salary + 1 monthly salary for each worked year + all overdue vacations + 40% over the entire amount.  And if he does not pay within 30 days, the government may demand to pay the full amount in double amount, under the threat of closing the company + arrest. <br><br>  On the other hand, taxes are still quite large.  With each salary, the employer must pay almost the same amount to the government (if for example the salary is 2000 per month, the employer pays 2,000 employees + another 2,000 to the government in the form of taxes).  And from the final salary, which is paid to the employee, the government still deducts somewhere from 10 to 27% of taxes.  At the end of the year, some of the taxes are refunded, but not all.  In general, this is a rather complicated system, which is not particularly easy to understand. <br><br>  That seems to be all that I originally wanted to write - but, of course, I described far from everything.  So if you have any questions, or would like me to highlight some more specific topics - ask.  I will be glad to answer! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142533/</a></p>
