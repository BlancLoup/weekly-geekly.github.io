  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Wireless audio transmission from PC to speakers with PurePath</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <i>Negative experience, also experience</i> </blockquote><br>  Good afternoon, dear reader, I want to share the experience of creating a system of wireless transmission of audio signal from a PC to my speakers with a subwoofer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3f9/226/7d0/3f92267d0101397239c4fad43e9acb1c.jpg"><br><br>  It seems to me that everyone is trying to get rid of extra wires in everyday life, isn't it? <a name="habracut"></a>  And if the device connected to the PC is still far away, then the desire increases.  Once I wanted to revive the sub in the corner (unfortunately there is no longer possible to install the manufacturer), which was finally done.  Played soft, powerful, warm music, but ... The fact is that from the laptop to him was about 4 meters!  Wires - no!  Without thinking, I went to the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù and the first thing I <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/main/set.php%3Fcode_id%3D1036638">got was the PurePath</a> system represented by the <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/main/set.php%3Fcode_id%3D1036638">MA8521T</a> USB transmitter <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/main/set.php%3Fcode_id%3D1036638">- PurePath ‚Ñ¢ HD (2.4 GHz) of</a> high-quality stereo audio signal and the <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/main/set.php%3Fcode_id%3D1036636">MP8520R - PurePath ‚Ñ¢ HD (2.4 GHz)</a> receiver of high-quality stereo audio signal.  I wanted everything ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù, in vain I hurried ... (probably, you have already noticed the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù trick).

    <blockquote>  I ordered, waited, came, did not start, talked to the manager, passed, waited, came, started. </blockquote><br>  So you can briefly describe the process of obtaining, as it turned out - no one really knows anything about this thing.  The manager, as always, assured at first that I was entangled in 2 "birch trees" ("+" "-") and burned the little creature, then I was advised to buy another "driver", since without it it should not work (although the site says the opposite).  Changed almost without problems.  At this lyrical digression ends. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/zip/mp8520r.pdf">The instruction and</a> connection <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/zip/mp8520r.pdf">scheme</a> is rather trivial - in the PC ‚Äúflash drive‚Äù of the transmitter, to the speakers and power - according to pinout: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/99d/5ed/ade/99d5edade3a77df21740187ff6085b80.jpg"><br><br>  Nothing supernatural.  Connect and go, come to life, earned!  Happily there is no limit, he immediately began to test the range, on sites assured 10-15 meters, but in fact it turned out to be the first wall.  In line of sight on 6-7 did not depart, and everything was fine.  For those who ordered - the sound disappears and wheezes, and in the discussions they generally suggest <a href="http://www.masterkit.ru/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D1671">soldering the capacitor</a> .  I was lucky, the sound did not wheeze, but the diode of the signal ‚Äúoverload‚Äù was burning ... And then I decided to google how to deal with it, and the Wi-Fi Internet tightly hung ... <br><br>  At first, I thought that the provider was naughty, rebooted the router, etc., and generally took all the measures, but noticed that as soon as I turn off my receiver everything is normalized.  That's it!  The trouble is that my <a href="https://www.google.ru/search%3Fq%3Dlinksys%2Bwrt160nl%26aq%3D2%26oq%3D%25D0%25B4%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25BB%25D1%258B%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%2B%25D1%2586%25D0%25BA%26aqs%3Dchrome.3.57j0l3.4872%26sourceid%3Dchrome%26ie%3DUTF-8">router</a> operates at 2.4 GHz and this system is also 2.4 GHz.  Probably, spam and flood signals kill the air.  I tried on several routers.  Oh, I would have 5 GHz ... Regarding these problems - silence. <br><br>  <b>Morality</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>Long, fat, not trimmed ...</i> </blockquote><br>  <i>Most appropriate of all, it would be to insert a picture from the Internet here, about two guys mockingly looking at me, but better in order.</i> <br><br>  ~ Did not understand initially and thoroughly in the system; <br>  ~ It all came out wildly expensive, it would be easier to remake a bluetooth headset or order something similar on the Chinese market, but I don‚Äôt know what to do in a hurry, they didn‚Äôt let me think about analogues.  And the quality was expected better; <br>  ~ All information is basically copied and the same on all sites; <br>  ~ Later I found a <a href="http://www.ti.com/tool/purepath-wl-cfg">configurator</a> , which may help me to flash and change the frequency, or to improve the quality (again, with the possibility of a reset and firmware, I was assured that it was impossible).  Now there is no time, and it is used while it is in a non-Wi-Fi zone; <br>  ~ Perhaps you should try to change the Wi-Fi channel to 11 (the largest distance from 2.4 GHz); <br>  ~ You can easily find the <a href="">scheme of the device</a> , but unfortunately, I have not yet pumped out the ‚Äúability‚Äù to create such things (I assume that the cost price, to do it myself, is several times lower), but I firmly decided to do it; <br>  ~ You can laugh, but you want to cry because of the inability to use everywhere. <br><br>  And lastly, as it is live, in a box of beads: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/677/87a/e26/67787ae26d5dcf4582486abae9881b2c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Transmitter</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/972/b4c/e87/972b4ce87f76832c90a66c26e94c560f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Receiver</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87c/4e6/2aa/87c4e62aa28cd127ada8b4849fb8914b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In a box</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcd/463/900/fcd4639008e55123873b153be95535ab.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/36d/b4c/0da/36db4c0da4cb66becc1b05c1bbe070a2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Thank you very much for your attention!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172853/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172853/</a></p>
