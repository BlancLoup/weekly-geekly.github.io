It is found in the thickness of the granites and the atmosphere of Jupiter.  The most paradoxical mineral, black blood of modern civilization. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the first wells of the Terek-Sunzhensky district produced a stunning fountain in 1895, which could only be managed after three years.  And after a few years, it dried up both at this well and at its neighbors, we had to switch to the pumping method of production.  Already by the forties of the 20th century, wells were heavily flooded, and many were even suspended.  However, after the war, almost all of them again began to produce practically anhydrous oil.  History repeated after half a century.  By the 1990s, wells were practically not used due to severe watering, but after the Chechen wars, debits increased significantly again, and many small wells even began to drain oil to the surface ... <br><br>  According to geologists, the Romashinskoye field could have produced about seven hundred million tons of oil, but today more than three billion tons have already been produced and no end is expected. <br><br>  The White Tiger field in Vietnam takes oil from the strata of fundamental rock where there should be no oil.

      These facts and the like cannot be explained by the classical biogenic theory of the origin of oil.  Recall that it was proposed by Lomonosov.  According to her, oil was formed from the remains of dead organisms and vegetation that once covered the planet.  Over millions of years, thick layers of remains have produced millions of tons of oil. <br><br>  However, there is another, abiogenic or mineral theory, about which we barely hear.  Its founder is Mendeleev.  Proponents of this theory consider oil to be the product of chemical reactions occurring at great depth and not associated with organic remains.  And the speed of these processes is hundreds or even decades. <br><br>  The answer to the question ‚ÄúWho is right?‚Äù Has far from theoretical significance. <br><br>  If the supporters of the biogenic theory are right, then oil on Earth will be exhausted sooner or later.  The increase in production is possible only under the condition of constant exploration of new deposits.  So, we are waiting for the constant rise in oil prices and in the not too distant future (and some scientists argue that over the next 40-50 years) a serious technological crisis.  Consequently, humanity must make efforts to transfer energy to new rails, to search for raw materials for the chemical industry, to transfer vehicles to new types of fuel. <br><br>  If the latter are right, then the oil on the planet is constantly being formed, and it will not be possible to exhaust it.  Then we should expect a certain stabilization of the level of oil production and leveling of distortions in the economies focused on oil production.  In this case, mankind should solve the issues of rational use of the available oil, its competent production, and the creation of conditions for its renewal. <br><br>  And I want, of course, to represent the society in which our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will live as a stable and developing one, and not as a society of growing economic collapse ... <br><br>  And although there are a lot of facts confirming both theories, modern science has not yet made a final decision. <br><br>  The first theory is confirmed by the entire development of petrogeology in the modern world.  The largest deposits are explored and used on vast tracts of sedimentary rocks, which in ancient times were seabed or covered with thick forests.  Experiments set back in the 19th century showed that the effects of temperature and pressure on organic substances lead to the formation of substances similar to oil in composition.  It must be said that as far back as the eighteenth century, scientists considered organic substances to be completely different from inorganic ones and even could not assume that oil could occur in a way that was not associated with organic matter. <br><br>  Since the 1930s, chemists are no longer so categorical and confirm the possibility of creating substances that make up oil on the basis of simple compounds.  In addition, oil deposits were discovered directly in the earth's crust under sedimentary strata, where organic residues could not get in principle.  Such, for example, is the White Tiger field in Vietnam.  It has already produced more oil than expected according to the forecast and the debit has not yet decreased. <br><br>  During the 20th century, scientists developed and tested both hypotheses.  But it is strange that in the public consciousness it was fixed biogenic, which predicts the end of oil. <br><br>  Why did we forget about the mineral theory?  And is she correct? <br><br>  Since science has not yet made a final decision, it‚Äôs too early to talk about the unequivocal victory of one of the hypotheses.  It is possible that both are right.  It is possible that both are wrong, but there is also a third.  Or the fourth, which will be able to describe all the observed facts and predict new ones.  Time will tell. <br><br>  But the massive silence of the mineral theory is alarming.  Primarily interested in this are oil producers, both private owners and corporations, and the state with an oil-production economy.  The hypothesis of the imminent completion of oil reserves on the planet gives them the opportunity to constantly raise prices for raw materials.  Classical theory allows specialists, its supporters, to maintain their conservative views, their positions, their posts in institutions.  In recent years, those who have access to oil have been the informal government of the whole world.  They keep abreast of the economy of all mankind and are not going to give up their positions just like that.  An interesting comment on this question of the doctor of geological and mineralogical sciences Vadim Skaryatin ‚ÄúAs for the scientific community, for many years it really preferred not to talk about mineral theory, but here the reason is different: people tried to preserve conservative views, and with them their posts, posts in institutions.  Collusion of oil companies?  This could be in America at the very beginning of oil production. ‚Äù <br><br>  In fact, we see that it is this scenario that is being worked out now. <br><br>  Head of the Department of Geology, RSU of Oil and Gas.  I.Gubkina V.P. Gavrilov declares: ‚ÄúIf we build our approach to the development of fields on new principles, coordinate the selection rate with the rate of hydrocarbon inflow from generation centers in these areas, the wells will operate for hundreds of years‚Äù.  But maybe it will be only in conditions when oil producers cease to dictate their conditions and the direct linking of the economy to oil production will lose its sharpness.  But this is too optimistic, the reality is more than cruel: in order for reserves to resume, civilization must abandon modern mining technologies, special mining schedules will have to be established, giving the fields time to recover.  Is it possible?  Today is unlikely.  After all, there is no real alternative to oil. <br><br>  DI Mendeleev at one time stated that burning oil is the same as heating a furnace with banknotes.  If he lived today, he would have thought us insane, but perhaps our children will surpass us.  God grant that the grandchildren handle it ... <br><br>  Links for those who are interested: <a href="http://gazeta.aif.ru/online/aif/1405/bel56_01">1</a> , <a href="http://oils.himdetail.ru/oil5.php">2</a> , <a href="http://www.popmech.ru/part/%3Farticleid%3D2267%26rubricid%3D3">3</a> , <a href="http://www.ap7.ru/paradoksi/proishozhdenie_nefti_kisloroda_i_oznovyh_dyr_na_planete_zemlja.html">4</a> ... <br>  <i>written for the site <a href="http://magov.net/">magov.net</a></i> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29531/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29531/</a></p>
