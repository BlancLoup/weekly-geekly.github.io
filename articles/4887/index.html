  <section class="page js-page"><h1>WSJ website continues to experiment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The dramatic transformation of the site WSJ.com happened the year before last.  Prior to this, a site with paid access to content and copyrighted columns instead of blogs was an anti-example of how to make online media.  But two years ago, everything miraculously changed: some of the content was free, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/8_0019.html">blogs</a> , <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/page/8_0018.html">podcasts,</a> and even video reports appeared. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The experiment turned out to be very successful, and it is not completed, but continues to this day.  Recently, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/gagin/" class="user_link">gagin</a> Alexander Gagin said that the paper version of the Wall Street Journal from January 2, 2007, <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/mass_media/2477.html">will change the paper format</a> to look more modern and even ‚Äúweb-based‚Äù.  This will change not only the format, but also the content of the newspaper, which will become secondary to online, that is, it will mainly comment and analyze the news published on the site. <br><br>  It is difficult to say how successful this experiment will be, but the idea itself, of course, is correct.  After all, we know how <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/222/">severe the crisis is</a> now facing the paper press, from which readers and advertisers go to the Internet.  Not only WSJ, but other publishers are also thinking about how to move their publishing business online, at least in part. <br><br>  Bill Grueskin (Bill Grueskin), editor-in-chief of the online version of WSJ, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/12/digging_deeperwsj_gets_comfort.html">tells you</a> what difficulties they had to endure by introducing journalistic blogs on the site.  The editors were afraid of losing control over the content.  There were fears that a journalist could publish information in a blog that, for example, would greatly affect the stock market.  After the introduction of blogs, it became clear that this is indeed a very powerful tool: any more or less interesting news gathered dozens of comments in a blog in a matter of hours.  As a result, it was decided to read and edit all the author's blog posts before publication.

      Using online has allowed journalists to significantly improve their work efficiency.  First of all, all employees of the newspaper saw a daily rating of the most popular articles on the site - naturally, it was a matter of honor for each of them to get there.  Secondly, you can experiment online with different forms of presenting the material and immediately see how the number of readers is changing. <br><br>  The editors began to analyze which texts most widely diverge in the blogosphere and began to spread them freely.  At the same time, 99% of the content on the site remains paid, and the number of paid subscribers has grown to 788 thousand people. <br><br>  Two years ago, the change of the website concept was successful, and from 2007 a new stage of transformation will begin.  The publication will publish even more "hot" exclusive news, and several reporters will work on the articles (they will complement each other's texts).  At the same time, the paper newspaper will only have to slowly comment on the events a day after they occurred.  The editors also plan to organize on the site something like a social network for readers.  In <a href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/12/digging_deeperwsj_gets_comfort.html">one of his interviews,</a> Bill Grueshkin tells in detail what the site WSJ.com will become after January 2, 2007. Apparently, this will be a very interesting experiment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4887/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4887/</a></p>
