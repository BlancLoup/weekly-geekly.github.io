      One solution is to use the so-called cognitive radio, which can detect unused frequency bands at the moment and switch between such free channels without interrupting data transmission. <br><br>  A startup from New Jersey recently created the fastest prototype to date, using the principle of cognitive radio.  The prototype operates at the maximum possible frequency range and is one of the first among the models of this technology, which will enter the mass market in the future and will allow using the spectrum more efficiently. <br><br>  This is a device called CogRadio, which was created by Radio Technology Systems in Ocean Grove, New Jersey.  The device can quickly move from one wireless channel to another and at the same time broadcast the video stream without interruptions, and is also used for testing and testing software that will be used in commercial products. <br><br>  "This is the most convenient and versatile broadband device that was not previously available to researchers," said Dipankara Raychaudhuri, director of Winlab, at Rutgers University, where CogRadio software was developed.  Existing models, he says, cannot switch quickly enough, and have a limited range of spectrum and bandwidths.  ‚ÄúToday it is the best experimental cognitive radio prototype available, and this is very important because everyone is interested in testing and deploying such a technology.‚Äù <br><br>  This is the first device capable of operating in the range from 100 MHz to 7.5 GHz, including frequencies for television, Wi-Fi and frequencies for GSM.  The device is able to detect unoccupied frequencies and switch between them for 50 microseconds, and in some cases for 1 microsecond.  This is a record for switching speed, said Peter Woliansky, a graduate of Bell Labs, who designed the device and then founded a startup. <br><br>  The device is capable of transmitting data at a speed of 400 Mbit per second, which is much faster than existing Wi-Fi devices. <br><br>  Commercial wireless systems created with this technology could offer new services.  And of course, this technology, if it enters the mass market, which is now dominated by large companies, will create competition, which in turn will lead to a decrease in wireless access prices for the end user. <br><br>  Now the device costs $ 6000, but it is cheaper than other similar devices. <br>  Prices will fall and such devices can afford not only rich laboratories, but also a wide range of small companies that develop software for cognitive radio.  ‚ÄúFor people who study wireless technologies, it‚Äôs very difficult to create such a device and make it work,‚Äù says Woliansky. <br><br>  CogRadio will serve as a testing ground for research works of the National Science Foundation for mobile-oriented Internet access, in which wireless communications and smartphones are considered as the main means for Internet access (project headquartered in Raychaudhuri Labs) <br><br>  CogRadio will also be used in one of the first outdoor tests of cognitive radio, which will be at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where its software was developed.  (Research in the field of cognitive radio was mainly conducted in a shielded laboratory due to possible dangerous interference, but the US Federal Communications Commission began issuing permits for outdoor tests). <br><br>  And researchers from Virginia Tech will use such devices to develop the next generation of high-speed broadband channels for police and firefighters, and other emergency services that include video transmission and Internet access. <br><br>  Cognitive radio can create a whole range of new services.  For example, it can route cellular calls to Wi-Fi, which is being done today in small wireless microcell base stations, and also can avoid using fiber to access the Internet, and instead use the existing television spectrum in the 400 MHz band. <br><br>  In all such projects, the big problem is fast frequency switching and high bandwidth.  ‚ÄúYou need to quickly switch from frequency to frequency, perhaps in a very wide range, and as soon as you find a free channel, you need to use as much bandwidth as possible to transfer data and it‚Äôs actually very difficult to do,‚Äù says Chip Elliot, project director for a cognitive radio project NSF at BBN in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  "This radio is perfect for such things." <br><br>  Someday, future smartphones and other devices will include some of these technologies.  ‚ÄúWhile this is an important milestone for implementing high performance and the use of cognitive radio, much remains to be done - chip design, interface, and much more,‚Äù says Raychaudhuri.  Other companies and research groups are also working to improve and enhance cognitive radio. <br><br>  Passions run high as the demands on mobile networks grow.  Bell Labs believes mobile traffic will grow 25 times by 2016, Cisco, he said, will grow 18 times.  The FCC makes it clear that the existing spectrum will end next year, and new technologies will be vital. <br><br>  The upcoming report on wireless technologies in the White House is being prepared in collaboration with Eric Schmidt, the head of Google, and other experts, including Craig Mundie, the chief researcher and strategist at Microsoft.  FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski is also pushing the industry to develop new technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154805/</a></p>
