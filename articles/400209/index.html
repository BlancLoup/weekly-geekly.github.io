We have collected for you an overview of interesting beauty and not only gadgets that will help you make an unforgettable gift. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Useful gadgets </h1><br>  The best gift is a useful gift, and the fitness tracker is quite consistent with this.  Usually they are available in a unisex style, without unnecessary problems.  For example, the <a href="https://hi-tech.mail.ru/xiaomi_mi_band_2_14463719-catalog/">second Mi Band</a> can be a great gift for both women and men.  A neutral gamut of four colors is perfect for both genders.  A simple and necessary set of characteristics: sleep monitoring, alarm clock, pedometer, calorie counting.  You can set up an alert for calls, SMS and alerts from applications.  What is important is compatible with Android and iOS and holds a charge of up to 20 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e35/9fe/fdd/e359fefdd6854986be7869e429395edc.jpg">

      If you decide to shift the focus from universality to femininity - get ready for a long search.  Very few companies make exclusively female trackers.
