And its meaning is simple - do not be lazy to see what they are doing and how they are promoting their products.  And just that - chase them in the neck.  God so that they littered the entire Internet.  There is a high probability that for your business from them as much harm as benefits.  Waste of money. <br><br>  It is no secret that for the promotion of sites using such technology as "rerayt".  The point is to get a ‚Äúunique‚Äù text based on other texts.  The trouble is that people are engaged in this, who not only do not understand the subject matter, but who do not care about the result of their work. <br><br>  But you, dear entrepreneurs, do not care?  If not, try searching your products on the Internet.  Perhaps you will learn a lot about it.  And then the Internet will be a little better.  And to stimulate attentiveness, I will describe an amusing situation.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The fact is that I sometimes snore if I lie on my back.  Everything is not so critical, but my beloved half sometimes has to poke me at night so that I roll over on its side.  Somewhere long ago I heard that there is something that allows for the prevention and treatment of snoring.  And so I decided to find this miracle thing on the Internet, read the description and if you like it - buy it. <br><br>  I do not remember how to make a request to Google.  But one of the first pages was <a href="http://shop.doctor-al.ru/view_goods.php%3Fid%3D315%26amp%3Bad%3D2435">http://shop.doctor-al.ru/view_goods.php?id=315&amp;ad=2435</a> .  Once I came to her, then people tried, raising it to the top.  In general, SEO in action.  And someone spent the money on it. <br><br>  As any adequate buyer, I decide to read the text of the description.  And you know what led reading this text?  To the fact that I will not become their client.  Not great, of course, a loss, but the example is indicative! <br><br>  Why not?  I was just killed, as the description of the device "Extra-ENT" ends: <br><br>  <b>Unfortunately, the device does not fulfill its function,</b> since when the masticatory muscles relax in a dream, the jaw drops, the teeth unlock, the jaw moves back, the lumen of the pharynx subsides, snoring and respiratory disorders resume. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f55/c79/6ab/f55c796ab8b378f90bbc73ed6eca0606.png" alt="Extra ENT"><br><br>  Fine!  Just a wonderful description.  There is such a joke, but the truth is it does not work. <br><br>  And where is SEO?  Perhaps this is the customer himself incorrectly composed the text? <br><br>  No, this is exactly SEO.  The customer most likely did not have any texts at all and ordered them to be done by SEO-people.  And they did.  How could. <br><br>  How did they do it?  Very simple.  A little googling, I found this page here: <a href="http://dentaluxe.tver.ru/services/%3Fn%3Dapnea">http://dentaluxe.tver.ru/services/?n=apnea</a> <br><br>  The first advertising text is made on the basis of the text from the second site.  There "Extra-ENT" is given as an example of a non-working device.  Therefore, it is written that it does not fulfill its functions, and it is proposed to purchase another device. <br><br>  Rerayter made a layout from this text and did something else and didn‚Äôt even see what happened. <br><br>  Conclusion. <br><br>  Cheap cheese only in a mousetrap. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131141/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131141/</a></p>
