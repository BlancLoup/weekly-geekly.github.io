      Maxim Matvienko, chief project engineer of DataDom, will talk about the basics of creating a physical infrastructure of communications and information processing facilities.  In his speech, Max will answer the questions: what is the data center?  What engineering subsystems does it consist of?  What engineering systems technologies are used in the construction of data centers?  What are the parameters for evaluating the effectiveness of data centers?  What typical mistakes are made during construction? <br><br>  Igor Dorofeev, General Director of IKord, will devote his speech to the concept of data centers as a foothold for making business decisions.  Today in the industry of data centers there are a huge number of methods, approaches, standards and technical documents.  For the organization of effective work requires a clear understanding of what is really important and what is secondary.  Understanding the basic fundamentals - the concepts of modern data centers - will help answer this fundamental business question.  Briefly, they can be formulated as follows: efficiency, reliability and safety. <br><br>  Fyodor Klimenko, General Director of GREEN Tablet PC, outlines the prerequisites that caused the emergence of modular-type data centers and introduces participants to the event with the nuances of this approach to building data centers.  Special attention will be paid to the expert assessment of in which case it is optimal to build a stationary data center, in which is modular, and in which - to buy a container. <br><br>  The event is scheduled for two round tables.  The first one, entitled ‚ÄúPost-Professional Education in the Field of Data Centers‚Äù, will be devoted to the issue of educational standards in the field of data centers.  The current situation in the data center market shows that the industry is experiencing a huge shortage of qualified personnel.  One of the objectives of the Association will be the creation of educational standards for professionals specializing directly in the creation and operation of data centers.  Within the framework of the round table, the reasons for the need for specialized educational personnel, real needs of students of data center courses and prospects for the development of training programs on the subject of creating and operating data centers will also be discussed. <br><br>  After the first round table, Alexey Degtyarev will identify the current problems of the Russian data center market - from design to operation - and tell you how the Association of Industry Data Centers will help solve the problems of the data center industry. <br><br>  Independent consultant Dmitry Bassisty will talk about the current standardization situation in the Russian data center market segment, as well as justify the need and point out the main advantages of the new harmonized standardization base for data center industry participants in Russia. <br><br>  The second round table, ‚ÄúFormalization of data center operations‚Äù, will be devoted to the current situation in the field of formalization of data center operation processes, as well as the need to regulate the operation processes and prevent consequences in case of its illiterate implementation or absence.  Sergei Lebedev, deputy head of the maintenance department of the data center for the operation of engineering systems of Sberbank, and Andrei Pavlov, general director of DataDom, will lead the round table.  Also invited to participate in the round table are: Anton Platonov, CEO of the Scientific Innovation Center (StoreData);  Evgeny Gromov, Head of the Operations Department, Data Storage Center (SafeData);  Alexey Tarakin, Head of the Engineering and Operations Department of the Service Center of the VTB24 Bank Company, and Igor Nesterov, Deputy General Director of AKOD. <br><br>  The program of Svyaz-Expocomm-2014 events can be found at: <a href="http://www.sviaz-expocomm.ru/common/img/uploaded/exhibitions/sviaz_expocomm/doc_2014/anons_media_grus.pdf">http://www.sviaz-expocomm.ru/ru/program2014/</a> <br><br>  Video broadcasting from the event is organized by 1Telecom and will be available on the portal <a href="http://alldc.ru/">AllDataCenters.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222527/</a></p>
