Here you take a task: zafigachit beautiful timekeeper "Until the end of the super sentence, there are always 2 hours left."  Open the editor ... and click: how to do something?  It seems I heard something that we began to do landing pages on Vue.  Or is there another reactor? </p><br><p>  Well, when you are in openspace, sitting through two tables.  You can always get up and quietly ask your neighbor, "Remind us, do we take Vue for everyone now?".  Worse, if TL is in a different time zone.  The same question - but the answer is tomorrow.  And if he spun, then the day after tomorrow.  And everything, instead of 1 minute - two days of delay. </p><br><p>  Or worse.  You sit, do not touch anyone, and then suddenly a quiet whisper on 3 floors with the question above.  You answer quickly, and again to restore the context.  But after all, it was necessary to look into Vika ... </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  So, my personal rules of remote work, which I absorbed during freelancer. </p><br><p>  <i>Of course, I do not always follow them.</i>  <i>And yes, several years of work in the office are already causing distortions of the form "let's just meet and discuss live."</i>  <i>But I fight!</i>  <i>And I try to continue to stick with them.</i> </p><br><ol><li>  Always take the time to find the answer yourself. <br>  Causes: the information that he found is remembered better;  on the way, a huge layer of context is being gathered unnoticed. <br>  Bonuses: saving on TTL question-answer, up to a week when the gurus in another time zone is on holiday in a drinking bout. <br>  Cons: even a simple "yes" / "no" answer takes time, often an order of magnitude more than getting an answer yourself. </li><li>  Always describe the context by asking a question.  We <i>didn‚Äôt find</i> ‚Äú <i>React or Vue?</i> ‚Äù But <i>sawing the front for Landing for Kudykatishkin‚Äôs customer. Is there already a standard solution for it? I didn‚Äôt find a wick in the git, only the bare html layout is the last for them. for dynamics?</i> " <br>  The reasons are: the figure quotation of modern soap dispensers is not always convenient for discussions, and when in the middle of a discussion a guru is summoned, he will almost certainly respond based on his current context.  Setting a local context allows you to get an answer to your question, rather than thoughts on a topic. <br>  Bonuses: the topic becomes a self-documented piece for archeology, even if you once again forgot to add solutions to the wick. <br>  Minuses: "In order to properly ask a question, you need to know most of the answer" (c) Robert Sheckley.  "The right question." </li><li>  Always describe the context, giving the answer.  Not " <i>Vue</i> .", But " <i>since the conquest of the pharaohs, for all customers who are not outraged hoping to leave for cheaper studios in the future, we use Vue. For all customers who are outraged, there is a record in the Vic is mandatory.</i> " . <br>  Reasons: all the same figure quoting, plus intelligent highlighting answers to questions in search engines.  The presence of a local context allows this solution to be applied in the future. <br>  Bonuses: a person who wants to find an answer can independently find this answer and follow it.  By the way, this answer may be outdated.  So when we write such an answer, we look at the next item. <br>  Disadvantages: if you are the same ‚Äúguru‚Äù, then the number of such questions grows with time, and this growth is often not leveled despite all the training attempts;  so ... look at the next item. </li><li>  When we receive the second question, we find our last answer (which, as we remember, will keep enough context in itself), we bring it to a reasonable place in the wiki ("general technical principles", "basis for the Kudykatishkin project" or "FAQ Guru") , create a short link to the answer, and quote the answer along with a link to it. <br>  Reasons: the answers may be outdated; in the paragraph under the link, you can write "outdated!";  we quote everything as it is to reduce the time spent by the questioner (he has already spent time searching for an answer, and if for some reason he could not find the last answer - you shouldn‚Äôt force to lose more time). <br>  Bonuses: Our FAQ is growing, which minimizes the number of questions from people who are lucky to find, answers take seconds to analyze the given context and pull the link from the answer catalog at hand. <br>  Cons: the creation of documentation falls on the shoulders of those who can give an answer.  Stop, and minus it? </li><li>  Turn on the telepathic mode.  Yes, I know that all telepaths are on vacation - so we have to do their work.  Use the provided context to answer questions that will obviously follow.  Just say " <i>Vue. By the way, for three days we decided to do new landing pages with the help of Gridsome, look at the excellent description of how to prepare it at link link.int/gridsome. And please check the graphics that it is without watermarks - I know that this is not your job, but the layout has switched to neural networks, so that part of it slips, I would not want the customer to notice it again</i> . <i>"</i> <br>  The reasons: it is still the context of the same question - the reader, even if he knows all this, will be sure that everything is valid;  and if he still does not know, he suddenly found out. <br>  Bonuses: the more information is included in the answer, the higher the chances that there will be no more questions, which means that more question-answer cycles will be saved.  And for those who then find the answer. <br>  Disadvantages: branch prediction carries the risk of work done for nothing in this particular case, but it well pumps the skill of telepathy. </li><li>  While we write the answer, we additionally rethink and try on the given context.  Yes Yes.  We try to avoid mindless copy-paste.  Question: "I saw that we did everything on Vue, but for some reason the last three landings were on jQuery. I did not find any information in the wiki, and the author of the last three landings went to sea (why did they get the last bugs on me).".  Yes, you can copy the aforementioned answer about "Vue if not stated otherwise in the wiki," but it is better to either try to ask the holiday manager (directly or put it on the thread) and go through the communication tracker with the client. <br>  The reasons: yes, yes, you know better, and yes, everything in Vika should be, but people are mistaken, even such infallible ones as you and the client communication department.  Maybe this is a requirement that you have forgotten to make in Vika? .. <br>  Bonuses: if you still forgot, you can make, avoid conflict with the client as well as once again remind everyone responsible to make such things. <br>  Minuses: loss of time here and now for additional soundtracks. </li></ol><br><p>  During my work, I had to apply these rules for coding, for reverse, for analyzing data, for layout, for protecting against DDoS attacks and for filling out tax returns.  Try to recall a dozen recent discussions where consensus has been reached, and imagine that the question and answer would be reformulated according to these rules ... </p><br><p>  ... <br>  <sub>Promised bonus: distributed 10 paper and 10 electronic books "Business on their own" for authorship <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> (freebie over, thank you all!).</sub> </p></div>
