It just so happened that I was born in one of the industrial cities of Ukraine, and not in some coastal city of California.  And so it happens that you enter a website, a store, or something else that is tasty and healthy, and you are right there from the doorway: <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúUkraine sucks dude.</b>  <b>Humble yourself. "</b> <br><br>  And you make this face like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a93/d77/7d1/a93d777d126ce92527d4f36d1c7b8e7e.jpg"><br>  and leave.  You are not welcome here and no one wants your dirty money (virtually dirty - was going to pay with a card). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But the moment comes when you think: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ad/994/77a/5ad99477a4a2f6ba5e90addf4de808ac.jpg">

      And you decide that all the same <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f04/d8e/ccb/f04d8eccbed54edd331314233791afae.png"><br><br>  Well, judge for yourself: any resident of the CIS or another non-grata country pays for the game disc the same money as all other users who live in the right places.  But due to the fact that the guys from Activision decided that he was a redneck and lol, then they cut him such buns: <br>  - Access to the GH store.  It means - no you Disturbed.  You are limited only by what is on the disk. <br>  - The inability to import music from other discs of the series.  Yes, you have to rearrange the disc and re-enter the game if you want to play Rise Against - Re-education Through Labor from the World Tour, and at the moment you finish drumming with Five Finger Death Punch - Hard To See from Warriors of Rock. <br><br>  I clearly decided that it was a mess and that I would force them to sell me the content no matter what.  I was ready to fence proxies, VPNs, fake accounts, and just about anything.  However, everything turned out to be a little simpler, but with its unpleasant moments. <br><br>  I have to say: you do not need a VPN.  There is no reason to hide your actual location because both the PSN Store and the Activision guys are guided by other factors.  But even without this, the final result is somewhat overlaid, both in time and in money.  Most likely, the majority will decide that the game is not worth the candle ... or how was it? <br><br>  Here is a list of what we need: <br><ul><li>  PSN account with fake US address </li><li>  Working PayPal account with a screwed card </li><li>  Disc Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock with the US region </li></ul><br><br>  And now let's order what and why. <br><br><h4>  PSN account </h4><br>  This is probably the easiest.  You just need to create another account on the console and register it in PSN.  The residential address must be American, you can generate valid data using <a href="http://fakenamegenerator.com/">fakenamegenerator.com</a> .  Do not worry, it is not checked in any way, even by GeoIP.  Here, by the way, there are additional buns: now the American Store is available to you, which is much richer in choices than the same in the CIS. <br><br><h4>  Paypal account </h4><br>  If you already have one, skip this item.  We do not <a href="http://paypal.com/">carry</a> out any financial frauds, so there are no special tips here - go to <a href="http://paypal.com/">paypal.com</a> , register as a law-abiding citizen, fasten your card, verify it. <br><br><h4>  CD with the US region </h4><br>  Probably, the first thing you will hear your own "ah", having reached this point (more precisely, having reached it still in the list).  After all, everyone knows that PS3 games are not locked in the regions.  It's true.  But not for the guys from Activision.  In disks with the CIS region, the ability to access the store and work with DLC is completely blocked.  Even if you buy content on PSN - the game simply will not see it.  Therefore, you need to go to <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon</a> or <a href="http://ebay.com/">eBay</a> and order the American disk through intermediary services or directly, if you are lucky and the seller sends around the world. <br>  What comes to you will have a BLUS marking on the end (and, possibly, the Soundgarden album inside as a gift).  Our discs are marked BLES. <br><br><h4>  Making them take our money </h4><br>  Now you have access to the GH store.  However, you cannot buy anything with your card.  PSN sranivayet card issuing region (or the address that is listed for the card recorder in the bank) with the region in which you say that you live.  Therefore, even Payoneer does not work here.  The only way out - PSN recharge cards, which are also divided into regions.  It looks not so scary, but in practice it turns out that a) it comes out more expensive b) most stores will not sell you even a code if you are not from their region.  When you try to buy (even through paypal), you will receive something like ‚ÄúDude, tuna trees, you are not from our area and we will not sell you anything‚Äù and will make void transactions, or even worse - they will hold hold and request documents. <br>  For example: <br>  pcgamesupply.com - immediately after the payment makes void. <br>  hotcdkey.com - requires documents. <br>  We have nothing to do with it, so we go immediately to <a href="http://electronicfirst.com/">electronicfirst.com</a> .  Where are all friendly and not particularly soared where you are from.  A $ 10 card will actually cost $ 15.  Not very profitable.  But a $ 50 card will cost only 20% more expensive.  The store works only with paypal.  Delivery of the card number to the e-mail may take some time (about half an hour), because  they manually erase the protective covering hiding the code and send you a scan. <br><br>  In the store you can buy both individual songs and packs.  Paki, of course, more profitable.  One song costs $ 2, a pack with three songs - $ 4.  Import discs (yes, it is also not free) costs from $ 2 to $ 6.  And you can even import disks with our region - you will not need the disk itself, only the code from the manual's turn.  Content is downloaded from PSN. <br><br>  With all my heart I wish the copiersta to die quickly, but before that I could suffer a little longer.  Because this situation rather reminds me of national intolerance. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> users of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/pippin/" class="user_link">Pippin</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/navion/" class="user_link">navion</a> shared information that buying in these stores also passes without problems: <br>  <a href="http://4saleusa.com/search.php%3Forderby%3Dposition%26orderway%3Ddesc%26search_query%3Dpsn%26submit_search%3DSearch">4saleusa.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.maximuscards.com/index.php/itempage/index%3Fcat%3D3">maximuscards.com</a> (apparently the cheapest thing here) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143293/</a></p>
