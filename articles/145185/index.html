How to open a virtual account in the US?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One day I wondered - <a href="http://php-junior.ru/lifehack/kak-vy-vesti-paypal-v-rossii-kak-otkry-t-schyot-v-ssha-palyu-temu">how to withdraw money from Paypal to Russia</a> ?  There is a chip - direct withdrawal of money from Paypal for those who do not have an account in America is closed, i.e.  without having a bank account in America, you will not be able to withdraw money directly. <br><br>  However, I was really sorry to lose a large percentage of the commissions of exchangers (frantic cheating), so I was looking for a way out. <br><br>  Below I give instructions from 8 points. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. We <a href="http://share.payoneer-affiliates.com/a/clk/254ZwC">order a card</a> from Payoneer.com. <br>  2. If possible, fill in all the data correctly (well, or who should - on the drop). <br>  3. While the card is in progress, we set up an account on Paypal.  It must be registered to Russia.  If you have registered in Ukraine or Kazakhstan - obviously, you will have to somehow register again, delete the account - with the active main address of Ukraine or Kazakhstan, you will not even be able to select the Paypal direct output menu to your bank account. <br>  4. Has the card arrived?  Fine.  Most likely, you have already received your access.  You can now activate the card, enter the admin area.  Then we write in those.  support - it is possible in Russian - that you need to withdraw money from Paypal or Moneybookers to your Payoneer card.  You should be asked to answer the following questions:
