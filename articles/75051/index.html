  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first release of Simply Linux - a new distribution for ordinary people has been released :)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday (111109) a new distribution kit, Simply Linux, was born.  In general, the first question would seem: why do we need another distribution kit?  How many of them already, all sorts of different.  Many enthusiasts make their assemblies on different repositories.  Nevertheless, the development of Simply has a powerful ideological basis - a focus on novice users, most of whom will never become "continuing", since their goal is not to dive into the depths of the computer, but to use it as a means to perform typical tasks. <br><br>  And there is nothing bad about it, they just have other interests.  There must be someone to heal, teach, build, and not everyone to be IT people :) Well, for such users, windows only? <br>  What happens to most distros?  They need to be penetrated in order to choose worthy and convenient programs for themselves, to penetrate in order to customize everything for themselves, to penetrate in order to at least choose a distribution kit.  I don‚Äôt argue that many people like this process, but there is a large part of indifferent people who don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre just not interested in what‚Äôs inside.  It is not interesting to choose a computer, it is not interesting to choose a system, programs.  ‚ÄúGive what works, show how I can carry out my tasks and can be free.  And we need to do business. " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ffd/6c8/6c1/ffd6c86c146deaf845d6c5bd794d3265.png" alt="image"><br>  Simply Linux has a minimal package base.  Unlike other distributions, the number of programs in which rolls over 1000, Simply includes only about 30 programs, according to the principle 1 task - 1 program.  That is, one browser, one office suite, one player, etc. The programs are selected the most functional, the easiest, and fully Russified by the results of the author's analysis.  Yes, 1000 programs are cool, a lot, and a lot is always better than a little, because a lot is a choice.  But the opportunity is specific, as choosing one needs to analyze, try, learn and take a little risk.  Who wants to spend time on it?  The answer was in the previous paragraph: "... give ... show ... and we need to do business." <br>  By the way, the entire distribution kit is placed on a CD. <br><br>  What else?  Distribution is easy.  Not only because of the program staff, but also because of the shell (xfce), which does not require a lot of resources.  This means not only that you can safely work on weak machines, but also the fact that more resources can be allocated ‚Äúfor the cause‚Äù, that is, for the work of the programs themselves.  How much memory does downloading photos from a modern DSLR require?  In general, whatever computer it is, it will load faster if ‚Äújust the system‚Äù does not take a large chunk of memory.  Well, you can still remember the movies in HDTV.

      In addition to the system itself, an important place in the project is the site.  While he is not ready yet, because the idea is really serious.  Make not just a promotional product site, but also a resource for those who have switched to Simply.  There will be everything: from recommendations on additional software with detailed instructions on what to install, to detailed documentation, including answers to the most basic questions in the opinion of Linux users.  The proposed programs for additional installation will be selected on the same principle as in the basic set - Russification, functionality, stability. <br><br>  Well, the very design of the site should radiate warmth and comfort.  :) <br><br>  Some technical information.  The distribution is collected from the Sisyphus repository (the domestic free software repository, which is one of the five largest in the world), its stable branch is the Fifth Platform.  The Fifth Platform is a convenient platform for the development of various software solutions, free and non-free (Description of the functionality of the PP requires a separate post, I will definitely write) <br><br>  Current Distribution Version: 5.0.0 <br>  Repository: Fifth Platform (ALT Linux / p5) <br>  Kernel: 2.6.30 <br>  Glibc: 2.10 <br>  GCC: 4.4.1 <br>  X.Org: 7.4 <br>  Versions of the main programs: <br>  Xfce 4.6.1 <br>  Firefox 3.5.3 with Yandex Bar <br>  Thunderbird 3.0 pre4 <br>  Openoffice.org 3.1.1 <br>  GIMP 2.6.7 <br>  Sonata 1.6.2 <br>  Pidgin 2.6.3 <br>  Gnome-mplayer 0.98 <br>  Brasero 2.28 <br>  medit 0.94 <br><br>  Finally, I will say that the distribution kit is not so severe that it does not attract attention at all.  It has a rather nice, stylish interface.  In addition, the talented designer Vlad Gerasimov, the author of the Vladstudio project (do not consider it an advertisement), signed for Simply a couple of dozen wallpapers that make the interface cute and unusual.  And we have worked on our own logo and system design. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/596/e8f/f9d/596e8ff9dcd1fc07666a32204eebd787.jpg" alt="Simply Linux logo"><br><br>  By the way, we are Denis Koryavov, author of the distribution, project leader, member of the ALT Linux Team, and employees of the marketing department of ALT Linux.  Each of us has a personal interest in the project, which is important for its success.  More and more people are joining the project, many are inspired by the idea, they recognize that such a distribution kit is really needed.  Of course, we still have to work and work. <br><br>  To clarify the question to the end: ‚ÄúWhy is another distribution kit?‚Äù I will give examples that answer the question ‚ÄúFor whom?‚Äù, And I hope that they will turn out to be quite exhaustive. <br><br>  1. The student sits on the Internet, chatting in ICQ, downloads essays, copies them to a text editor, prints, and then plays solitaire all day and sits on classmates. <br><br>  2. A music lover downloads music from the Internet or buys a CD - many collections, and listens, listens, listens.  And then he watches movies downloaded in torrents and plays Robots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56d/478/ef2/56d478ef2791c632e4fb947840712878.jpg" alt="music in simply linux"><br><br>  3. The designer uses in his work only a graphic editor and the Internet.  At home watching the video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/b37/fad/9ddb37fad7d86a1269bbf61f818ce066.jpg" alt="Work with graphics"><br><br>  4. The manager types texts, answers corporate mail, makes presentations and sits in ICQ until the boss sees.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e3/dc5/e0b/5e3dc5e0b971abb20e6d93c546d89e5e.jpg" alt="office work"><br><br>  5. The director of the company uses the computer exclusively for electronic correspondence and viewing news.  Because there is no time !!!  He spends his free time with his family. <br><br>  There are really a lot of such people.  Is free software available to them, will they have at least some interest and incentive to switch to it?  We hope so.  There is an alternative, and now much depends on us. <br><br>  Download the distribution here (CD, 700 MB): <a href="">ftp://ftp.altlinux.ru/pub/people/dkoryavov/distr/slinux-5.0.0-final-i586-ru-install-cd.iso</a> <br>  Project page (no website yet): <a href="http://www.altlinux.ru/products/5th-platform/simply/">www.altlinux.ru/products/5th-platform/simply</a> <br>  The site will be here: <a href="http://slinux.ru/">slinux.ru</a> <br>  Personal blog of Denis Koryavov: <a href="http://myaltlinux.blogspot.com/">myaltlinux.blogspot.com</a> <br>  E-mail for contacts: slinux at slinux.ru <br>  Information on the Fifth Platform on which the distribution kit is built: <a href="http://www.altlinux.ru/solutions/business/platform5/">www.altlinux.ru/solutions/business/platform5</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75051/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75051/</a></p>
