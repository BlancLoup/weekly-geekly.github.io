Under the cat more about the test, option number 3, some numbers and graphics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How was the test performed? </h4><br>  When a new user visited the site, one of the three options for ordering was randomly opened with the same probability (all options are shown on the KDPV): <br><br>  ‚Ññ1.  Only the button "Add to cart". <br>  ‚Ññ2.  ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù (main order option) + ‚ÄúBuy in 1 click‚Äù (optional). <br>  Number 3.  "Buy in 1 click" (main order option) + "Add to cart" (optional). <br><br>  In the session for the buyer, the option number assigned to him was kept, so that when going to other pages of the store, the buyer saw the same order option, and not a new one each time.  A custom variable with the option number (_setCustomVar) was added to the Google Analytics tracking code, and based on the value of this variable, the site visitors segments were formed for each of options # 1, # 2, # 3.

      <i>When buying using the ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù button, the buyer can collect a lot of goods in the basket and then place an order in the classical way in three steps: choosing a delivery method, choosing a payment method, entering a shipping address.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>When buying in one click, only the phone number and the buyer‚Äôs name are filled in (something like ‚Äúcall me back‚Äù).</i>  <i>The operator of the online store specifies the address and the amount of delivery later by phone.</i> <br><br><h4>  results </h4><br><h5>  First test </h5><br>  The first test - all three options # 1, # 2, # 3 - was conducted from November 17 to December 10, 2013.  On the chart below, you should pay attention to the indicator Total Events options - this is the number of completed orders in each of the three options (counted according to the order placed events): <br><br>  No. 1 (cart only): <b>14 orders</b> <br>  No. 2 (cart + 1 click): <b>26 orders</b> <br>  ‚Ññ3 (1 click + cart): <b>22 orders</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bb/f33/479/4bbf33479c6fb6f4232abdc5c5d7848c.png" alt="AB test Add to cart vs Buy in one click"><br><br>  Comparing options # 1 and # 2 and taking into account only paid orders (these numbers, for obvious reasons, are slightly different from those shown in the chart), the addition of the ‚ÄúBuy in 1 click‚Äù button allowed us to increase conversion by 58% (before the start of the test, the overall conversion rate of all site visitors in paid orders was 0.59% and in option number 2 increased to <b>0.93%</b> ).  The average order amount in option # 2, however, decreased compared with ‚Ññ 1 by 7%. <br><br><h5>  Second test </h5><br>  Obvious was the victory of options # 2 and # 3 (with the possibility of buying in one click), so option # 1 was removed, and only # 2 and # 3 continued to participate in the competition.  In the second part of the test, from December 11 to December 28, 2013, option No. 3 showed a greater result: <br><br>  ‚Ññ2 (basket + 1 click): <b>43 orders</b> <br>  ‚Ññ3 (1 click + cart): <b>69 orders</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c24/0c4/741/c240c4741d9e1b23e7a2f7e30f350ae5.png" alt="AB test Add to cart vs Buy in one click"><br><br>  According to the preliminary results, option # 3 (1 click + to the basket) won, but after dropping out all the abandoned orders and calculating the amount of sales, option # 2 was still the most effective for this project.  Firstly, due to the fact that there were about <i>three times more failures</i> on orders of 1 click (every fifth order in one click was failed: buyers simply make test orders, enter ‚Äú1234‚Äù instead of a real phone number, etc. .; for a classic checkout, the number of failed orders is about 7%).  Secondly, the average cost of the paid order in option # 3 was significantly - by 35% - less than in option # 2. <br><br><h4>  About option number 3 </h4><br>  A rather noticeable increase in orders of 1 click for option No. 3 in the second part of the test compared with the first part was observed partly due to seasonality (new year), partly due to the fact that the online store published paid reviews (advertisements) in some entertainment sites and blogs with advertisements for specific commodity items - there were more orders per click from such posts than in a basket (here the numbers vary depending on the product, so they are not given; on average, one click was half as large for all advertising transitions  used). <br><br>  There is practically no pronounced difference of preferences in choosing an order in 1 click or through the basket either in the region, or in the browser, or in the OS, or in the user's device (they checked all the options just in case), and the most obvious dependence is on the traffic source.  The most common case is in conversions from search engines to specific product pages.  If a person knows what he is looking for and gets directly from a search engine to the page of a certain product, then most likely he uses the option of an order of 1 click (here, too, the data vary considerably depending on the commodity position). <br><br>  In terms of the total amount of sales, option # 2 showed a result <b>13% higher</b> than option # 3. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  The task of the test was on a running online store of relatively small size to calculate <i>how much the</i> conversion can be increased by simply introducing the possibility of an express order.  Since the test was conducted not so long, it would be fair to round the result of the increase in conversion for this project to + 50%.  The same estimate is generally true for total sales. <br><br>  For online stores, a standard order in which consists of a single product, it is likely that a one-click order option is better suited as the main option.  In this example, the average number of goods in one order is 1.8 (and if we consider additional services to goods, for example, gift wrapping, then 2.6), and option No. 2 with the basket as the main way of ordering worked better. <br><br>  It is possible that in a number of projects it is worthwhile to use a combined scheme in which to use the 1-click purchase option as a priority for selected products, which are ordered, as a rule, in one copy (in this test such an analysis was not carried out). <br><br><h4>  Thanks </h4><br>  The online store ‚Äú <a href="http://www.mega-podarki.ru/">Mega Gifts</a> ‚Äù shared its experience; all data was published with his permission.
