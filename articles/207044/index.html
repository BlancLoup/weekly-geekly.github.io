And since now is the time to try my hand at this - I want to share the experience of my last year‚Äôs admission to Tampere University of Technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/368/493/714368493284fe0f95f086fb7b83455f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The story is built linearly - at first I will briefly tell about how life led me to this move.  Next, I will describe the stages of receipt, problems and solutions that can help in the coming year.  I will also touch on important topics - money and housing. <br><br><h4>  A bit of history </h4><br>  In the near 2012 I was still studying at St. Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation and was quietly planning to finish higher education in the direction of Information Security.  Along the way, get a job in one small bank.  Last year of study inspired optimism, and the bank at least some vague faith in the work in the specialty.  One of the New Year's Eve evenings I received a call from my old teacher with a proposal of some interesting work.  When I met a man the next day, I learned about a very attractive scientific activity in the city of Tampere, but the main condition was to enter a local university.

    <h4>  Arrival </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.tut.fi/en/admissions/applying-to-tut/masters-degrees/how-to-apply/index.htm">The application process</a> looked quite clear at that time, and over the past year, I did not notice any special changes.  The main charm of studying in Finland is free education.  Not every European country can boast such a bonus to youth development. <br><br><h5>  What was required for admission to the IT program: </h5><br><ul><li>  Complete and print the <i>application form</i> .  The admissions office will later require a paper version. </li><li>  Get <i>a notarized translation of the diploma</i> .  Or request the original in English at the university. </li><li>  <i>Transcript of records</i> .  A similar process is also required for the diploma supplement. </li><li>  <i>Certificate</i> of English surrender. </li><li>  <i>Motivation letter</i> or "why I want to learn from you." </li><li>  <i>Resume</i> , preferably containing at least some experience of scientific activity. </li><li>  Two <i>letters of recommendation</i> from work and / or study.  The form is electronic, but again you need to print and sign. </li><li>  <i>Copy of international passport</i> </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Details </h5><br>  Since at the time of submission of the documents I was still in high school and did not have a diploma, I had to apply to the dean's office with a request for a current list of grades and an extract ( <i>Letter of information</i> ) that I would receive a diploma in July.  It is necessary to have seals of the university and the department.  I had to write letters of recommendation in English myself, although by agreement with the signatories.  Resume is very useful to prepare using a business CV template. <br><br>  In parallel, I began to prepare closely for the language exam.  The university accepts various certificates for the IT program with the corresponding minimum requirements: TOEFL iBT - 79, TOEFL paper based - 580, IELTS Academic - 6.5, PTE Academic - 62 and CPE / CAE - C. My choice fell on TOEFL iBT and the long return process began the required ability to adequately express and write in English.  The minimum threshold seemed low (79 out of 120), but it was decided to spend all my free time on training.  The examination is paid, takes place in special centers and must be registered in advance.  Even taking into account the training on the book Barron's TOEFL iBT, the exam itself was many times more difficult.  Honestly, I was sure I had piled it up.  But two weeks later, it turned out that he scored 83 points.  It is important that when registering for the exam, you must specify the university code for the e-mail from the exam organizers, but for the actual admission you must submit the original certificate, which is stated to be completed within a month and a half across Europe. <br><br>  After I prepared all the documents, the question arose of transferring them to the university, which is waiting for them via the same mail.  Alas, it leaves much to be desired, so a willful decision was made to go and pass them personally.  First impressions of the trip were good - everything was starting to look more real.  So, began the long weeks of waiting for a decision.  One day, I received an email confirming receipt!  Now it was necessary to wait for the original in the mail, which took a few more weeks.  With this letter, you can apply for student housing, what a special office - <a href="http://www.toas.fi/">TOAS</a> .  The main charm is that housing for students is of rather good quality and two times cheaper than the secondary market. <br><br><h4>  Visa </h4><br>  To get a study visa to Finland, in addition to the original confirmation letter, you must prove that you will not die of starvation in a foreign country.  Namely, an account statement was required.  There should be more than 300 thousand rubles (600 euros per month).  You also need a completed <i>OLE_OPI</i> form for a study visa from the Finnish immigration service website, an insurance policy for 100 thousand and two photos.  After receiving the documents at the consulate and fingerprinting, the longest wait begins - it takes about a month and a half to process the request, then you can start calling and asking about readiness.  After confirmation, it's time to go and get your temporary residence permit! <br><br><h4>  Costs </h4><br>  In my opinion, the most important section.  On it you can roughly estimate the future costs of relocation, housing and study.  Pay special attention that this is the data of 2013, and now the amount may differ. <br><br><h5>  Costs in Russia </h5><br>  Summary table of spending in his native country.  Remove from this list can not be anything. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Item of expenditure</b> </td><td>  <b>Approximate amount</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Notarized translation of documents </td><td>  5000 RUB </td></tr><tr><td>  TOEFL IBT </td><td>  250 USD </td></tr><tr><td>  One year insurance policy </td><td>  200 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Study visa </td><td>  300 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Pledge of housing </td><td>  300 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Other add.  costs </td><td>  1500 RUB </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  It is important to note that the visa must be paid in the local branch of a Finnish bank, but in rubles at a not very pleasant exchange rate.  A card will only need to pay for TOAS and TOEFL.  When paying for housing, you can omit the invoice number for returning the deposit, it will be possible to change it in the future. <br><br><h5>  Finland </h5><br>  This subsection describes the main expenses for accommodation, food and study.  These numbers are relevant. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Item of expenditure</b> </td><td>  <b>Approximate amount</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Student fee </td><td>  100 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Housing </td><td>  from 300 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Rent a month </td><td>  250-350 EUR </td></tr><tr><td>  Food per month </td><td>  100+ EUR </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  It is worth noting that for students here and food, and travel is two times cheaper.  For example, lunch at a university will cost 2.50 euros. <br>  In principle, the estimate of 600 euros / month looks quite sound, so you can live without starving, and even having fun somehow. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  What can I say, the hostel here is amazing and has nothing to do with the same place of residence in Russia.  Although life and flows with a neighbor (each has its own room), but enough personal space.  For 36 square meters, ‚Ç¨ 315 is given monthly, and this is in a house built in 2000.  Then a few photos of the apartment on the day of arrival. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fd/366/99f/9fd36699f3aa78c2ca8946f653a64bb2.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff0/2d8/0db/ff02d80db91630352af1ef4820fe17a0.jpg"><br><br>  The apartments are mostly furnished, clean and bright.  Light, water and 100 MBit are included. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br><ul><li>  LTE.  For 24 euros to 50 MBit. </li><li>  Nature.  Bike paths, ski trails, forest and lakes. </li><li>  Infrastructure.  You can buy everything without leaving the neighborhood. </li><li>  Silence.  In fact, life in the forest.  You can work and play sports for your pleasure. </li><li>  Post office.  Shipping from Amazon for a couple of days is very good! </li><li>  You can drive home for the weekend.  The road to St. Petersburg takes 5-6 hours by train. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/42d/603/075/42d603075d5bf494df3aeed850490acb.png"><br>  <i>LTE at university</i> <br><br>  Alas, there are downsides.  Diversity in recreation is not enough - the city is very small.  But inside the university there are many guilds, events, and clubs of interest.  <a href="http://tietoteekkarikilta.fi/en/guild">Guild IT</a> also has a place.  After living in a big city here is very boring.  Saves an abundance of study or work. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.tut.fi/wwwoppaat/opas2013-2014/kv/laitokset/">Here</a> you can see a list of specialties and university courses for this academic year.  More general information is <a href="http://www.tut.fi/en/admissions/applying-to-tut/index.htm">here</a> . <br><br>  I will immediately answer an interesting question about the further job search: there is a chance to get a job.  It is not easy, but possible. <br>  I like to study, although the system is very different from the native one. <br><br>  Thank you for your time!  I hope that the post will be useful and will help start your journey in the near abroad. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207044/</a></p>
