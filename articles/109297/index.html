And it is important that those people with whom you want to discuss the event do not need to register at all.  When creating a task, you simply specify the E-mail of the invitee (or invitees) and the person can immediately take part in the discussion. <br><br>  For what this is done - surely everyone was faced with a situation where you need to collectively discuss something.  How to do it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can, for example, use group chat on Skype.  Yes it is fast and convenient.  And if the discussion is delayed for several days or weeks?  And if not all participants are registered?  Ask them to register for one event?  Surely you don't really want to strain anyone.

      You can use the group (meeting) VKontakte.  But the question arises that there are no notifications about the new message in the group and you have to regularly go and look - but didn‚Äôt someone write something to the right group?  And again, the problem of having all the right people on this very VKontakte.  For example, I registered there relatively recently after the urgent requests of friends and precisely for participating in such discussions.  True, I go there God forbid, once a week.  And it is absolutely not convenient for me. <br><br>  Of course, there are excellent scheduling services for anything that offer many possibilities.  But the above-mentioned point with registration + excessive functionality - does not attract me to use these services in this context. <br><br>  <i>I made the OpenTask service first of all for myself, but like some of my other projects I decided to make it accessible for everyone.</i> <br><br><h5>  And so, what can OpenTask? </h5><ol><li>  Creating a task-reminder for yourself. </li><li>  Invitation to the task of the right people without registration.  Registration is only needed to create tasks. </li><li>  Notifications of each comment on the e-mail of each participant in the task.  The letter contains the comment itself. </li><li>  You can set the end date of the task and, optionally, there is the possibility of notifications about the impending completion date. </li><li>  Creating categories and assigning these categories to tasks. </li><li>  Highlighting tasks by color. </li><li>  It is possible to delegate task management to all task participants. </li><li>  A simple notebook to not enter frequently used addresses manually when inviting to a task. </li><li>  The presence of the English language allows for discussions not only with Russian-speaking users. </li><li>  A separate ‚ÄúRemind‚Äù button for each task participant.  Politely reminds you to go. </li></ol><h5>  And what OpenTask can not? </h5><ol><li>  There is a limit on the number of participants in the task - no more than 30.  Although, if you need more - on a separate request and it is possible. </li><li>  This is not a social network, so there are no friends and other things inherent in social networks. </li><li>  It can not contain errors, bugs, flaws.  If you find - please write about it. </li></ol><h5>  How to invite to the task and what happens? </h5><br>  When you invite a new participant to a task that does not have a registration, a unique link is generated for it, which is sent to the e-mail address specified in the invitation.  The link itself is rather long, which already provides sufficient guarantees that a stranger does not enter the task, but as an additional protection for the invitation, you can set a password that the user can change (or set if the invitation is without a password). <br><br>  When inviting you are given the opportunity to enter the text of the accompanying note, which will be in the letter of invitation. <br><br>  If you have allowed all participants to manage the task, then any of the participants will be able to independently invite their friends to the task. <br><br>  If the invitee wants to register, he will not lose access to his tasks to which he has been invited before - they will be transferred to his account upon registration. <br><br><h5>  Some technical details </h5><br>  The service runs on regular hosting. <br>  Self-written engine, PHP + MySQL <br>  Event Alert Notification - crown perl script <br>  Determining the country by IP to correctly display the language of the site when you first visit using the API service wipmania.com <br>  Faced with that, the mail () function periodically terribly tupit, so I had to make a crutch - invitations, comments are recorded in the database, then the script on the crown picks them up.  Probably, is this usually somehow realized? <br><br><h5>  Creation costs </h5><br>  Time - about two weeks, in the evenings, excluding weekends. <br>  Hosting has already been, so free, since the tariff allows. <br>  Domain name - 520r. <br>  Logo design on Freelance.ru - 500r. <br>  Total: 1020r. <br><br><h5>  Future plans </h5><br>  Taking into account the fact that the service was developed for myself and all the functional goals I needed have been achieved, I do not plan to do anything else.  But this does not mean that the plans will not change :) Write, offer - I‚Äôm surely implement practical proposals. <br><br>  <b>Welcome to the <a href="http://opentask.net/">OpenTask.net</a> service!</b>  <b>I would be glad if this service will help anyone.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109297/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109297/</a></p>
