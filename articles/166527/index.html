In fact, without the ability to read English texts in IT, it is very difficult to live - everything is really sensible, usually in English-speaking resources. <br><br>  But who can say that what he was taught in school and the university really helped him in understanding English literature?  I suspect that not many will be able to confirm this.  If we are to be honest, I don‚Äôt know how things are in metropolitan schools and universities, and in provincial schools it‚Äôs all very bad. <br><br>  I was lucky in this matter - since childhood I have been learning English in a group, then I worked a lot with tutors, so I use English quite well and without any clever methods.  But at the university where I studied, the teacher used the Milashevich technique in the educational process.  I admire this simple and elegant approach to translation training, and I would like to talk about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is this technique? </h3><br>  It was developed at the time in the Far East by V. V. Milashevich, a candidate of psychological sciences, primarily for learning Chinese, and later shifted to English.  Then his students made a lot of things out of it, including something called ‚Äúmilgred‚Äù (it's hard to say what it is, but I didn't understand anything on their website).  I am not familiar, to be honest, with the derivatives of this technique, so this is not about them.

      If in a nutshell, the methodology is based on the fact that to translate a text from a foreign language into a native one it is not necessary to know all the nuances of a foreign grammar.  In many cases, it is enough to know how one grammatical structure of a foreign language ‚Äúreflects‚Äù on the native language.  I will illustrate with the following well-known phrase: <br><br>  <em>Globe kusdra steko budlanula side of the trunk and Kurdyachit bokryonka</em> <br><br>  Familiar?  This is an artificial phrase of the Russian language, in which, in general, there is not a single Russian word (unless the union is ‚Äúand‚Äù).  But from the morphology of the phrase itself one can understand the following (as Wikipedia tells us): some, a certain way characterized, a female being did something in a certain way with another male creature, and then started (and continues to this day) to do something another with his cub. <br><br>  Arranging this phrase into English looks like this: <br><br>  <em>The iggle squiggs trazed wombly in the harlish hoop</em> <br><br>  Already less clear?  Because the grammatical structures of the English language are much worse for us. <br><br>  It turns out that in order to understand the first sentence, we just have to find out what kind of ‚Äúkuzdra‚Äù is, what kind of ‚Äúgloka‚Äù it is, and so on, since we are familiar with the structural elements of the language.  In fact, the translation will be reduced to the search for each word in the dictionary - and we already know how to connect these words.  And in order to understand the second, we first need to figure out how the sentence works and where to start the translation. <br><br>  Based on principles of this kind, learning takes place.  Nowhere is it mentioned what the Present Perfect is and when it is used - it does not matter for translation.  It is important to correctly define the grammatical structure of the sentence, and the rest is a matter of technique.  And the technique provides all the necessary tools for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a81/602/59c/a8160259c6b99a0d834f9306a0bff9ba.jpg"><br><br>  Usually the tools are presented in the form of such schemes.  Understanding them right away is not so easy, but in general, with a systematic approach, they make it possible to identify grammatical structures and translate them correctly. <br><br><h3>  Technical translation </h3><br>  The Milaszewicz technique is well suited for learning the translation of technical literature.  Learning such a translation using the traditional method requires a huge amount of time, which is usually not the case for the main consumers of technical literature (technical specialists themselves).  Studying only what is necessary for translation, it turns out to save a huge amount of time. <br><br>  For comparison: in order to learn by this method, it will take 72 academic hours (in some places on the Internet they write about 30-40 hours, but this is too optimistic) for students who are motivated to learn.  At the same time, in principle, the elementary level of the trainees is not important - with me in the same group there were students who never studied English, and learned German in school.  And they managed to keep up with the whole group without any tension, and in some aspects were even more successful. <br><br>  How much is required, for a similar training according to the traditional method, everyone can imagine for himself: remember the huge heap of time that fell into the void during your learning of the English language. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br>  To be honest, the results amaze and surprise me.  At the time of training in this technique, I already could easily translate from English to Russian, so for me it is difficult to evaluate something.  But having understood the grammatical schemes, I was able to put the rather scattered knowledge about the language into a more or less coherent system, which also makes life very cool and strong. <br><br>  Therefore, it is worthwhile to focus on other students of my group.  I will be honest: the university was a paid and intellectual level, and the level of basic knowledge of the students was very different.  But in a rather short period of time I saw how even the most thoughtless began to slowly translate rather complex texts.  I sincerely doubt that they learn according to the traditional method, they could do at least something with these texts. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  + short training periods (72 hours, 4 hours a day, less than a month) <br>  + no requirements for the initial level of knowledge <br>  + systematic approach, close to techies <br>  + clear learning outcomes <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  - there is absolutely no speaking (however, it would be foolish to expect this) <br>  - In the absence of vocabulary, a dictionary is constantly required for translation. <br><br><h3>  Why am I writing about this </h3><br>  Well, there is such a technique, and it's great, why is this being asked on Habr√©, where everyone already somehow knows English? <br><br>  First, if somewhere you come across a technique or derivatives of it - at least there will be an idea about it.  Milgred is now actively trying to promote, even patented something. <br><br>  Secondly, not so long ago I talked to my former teacher and learned that the university was closed, and now she is engaged in tutoring.  And a ready course of study, polished by 10 years of training for real students, specially designed for teaching at an IT-oriented faculty (in general, the faculty was ‚ÄúInformation Security‚Äù), and these are lectures, diagrams, exercises, texts for parsing with a teacher and for independent translation, and etc.  - disappears, because in our small town there are few who need it.  And I thought that maybe on Habr√© there will be someone who will be interested in this course in one or another aspect?  The technique and the course is really cool! <br><br>  In general, if all of a sudden - the contacts of the teacher will give to the lichku </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166527/</a></p>
