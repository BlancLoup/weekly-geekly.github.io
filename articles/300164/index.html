      The global informatization of the economy is gradually and truly transforming the technologies of managing organizational structures.  Let's talk about the management model based on business objects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Internet of things for business objects - all parts:</i> <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25334/">Part 1.

Business objects: new technologies - Advantages.</a>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25594/">Perspectives.</a> </li></ul><br><br><h1>  BUSINESS OBJECTS: NEW TECHNOLOGIES </h1><br><h2>  1. Model </h2><br>  The information factor becomes the most important for efficiently obtaining a business result, which is increasingly the basis of competitive advantages, allowing you to attract the best resources and market products in expanding markets.  At the same time, an understanding of the special model of ‚Äúbuilding a business in a complex dependence on other businesses (economic entities)‚Äù is being developed.  For modern technologies of effective management, flexibility, mobility, adaptability and systematic characterization are most characteristic. <br><br>  More and more emphasis is shifting from the business <i>process</i> model to the object. <br><br>  <b>Focusing on business processes</b> involves the active building and management of a model of interrelated functions, enshrined in regulations and automated systems, <i>to stabilize the behavioral structure of the company in general and the management system in particular</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bf/de0/1ac/8bfde01acfc24840abdc1585ccb49e9d.png"><br><br>  <b>The prioritization of business objects</b> offers the active building and management of a model of interconnected entities endowed with hierarchically ordered opportunities (rights) and tasks (duties) <i>to stabilize the strategy of the economic entity in general and the management system in particular</i> . <br><br>  If business process management allows you to stabilize a business at the level of execution of algorithms (related actions) to achieve your tactical goals, then managing business objects allows you to stabilize your business at the level of an interacting model (related entities) to achieve strategic goals (mission). <br><br>  The superiority of the point of view of management as the priority management of business objects is to ensure the flexibility and mobility of business processes.  After all, there is no need to project (fix) and control (correct) business processes in detail.  A more general task: to assemble a network of competent interacting business objects under a single dynamically developing strategy.  Such an approach does indeed have a higher level of abstraction and is somewhat more complicated, but it is an order of magnitude more stable and adaptive in the context of a constant change in internal factors and the external environment. <br><br>  Information management as a new stage in the development of business management technologies makes it necessary to consider business not as processes executed by authorities to achieve a policy goal, but as interaction of multidirectional objects that are combined and execute a certain dynamic model of processes for moving along coordinated goals on mutually beneficial conditions within the agreed strategy (mission). <br><br><blockquote>  The increasing management of information is characterized to one degree or another: <br>  - intensive consumption of information; <br>  - deep qualitative and quantitative data processing; <br>  - active generation and distribution of information of various types and purposes; <br>  - a special kind of building organizational structures; <br>  - resource mobility; <br>  - the involvement of independent experts and performers; <br>  - sustainable strategy and mobile tactics of its implementation; <br>  - powerful information and technological tools, including the right of ownership and the right of use; <br>  - using special methods of building adaptive business processes; <br>  - the advantage of new knowledge and ideas over fixed assets; <br>  - wide and democratic delegation of functionality. <br><br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24592/">The influence of informatization on the economic space makes you turn to the elements of information management.</a>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24592/">And this is inevitable for managers who want to develop successfully and for a long time.</a> <br></blockquote><br>  Information management in one way or another offers to look at business as a kind of network of separate interacting objects in order to achieve a common goal.  This is very similar to the Internet of Things.  In principle, this is the same concept of interaction of objects or things within the target connecting network.  Here are just for business, additional objective objectives and tasks are of particular importance, the implementation of which is projected and organized by the interaction of completely different objects, including physical and virtual ones.  Moreover, if IoT is a system that exists within a <i>single technological network</i> , then a business is a large and long-term project within a <i>single management network</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/179/114/2ee/1791142ee317463480aa791854e67b7b.png"><br><br>  The development of technology makes business change and adapt to a rich information environment.  And business is trying to build different models of interaction of completely different objects: <br>  - <i>if yesterday a</i> business designed a product under the ‚Äúcustomer profile‚Äù, <b>today</b> it involves potential customers in the design processes and product promotion; <br>  - <i>If yesterday the</i> business went to the bank for a loan, <b>today</b> it is actively involved in crowdfunding; <br>  - <i>If yesterday,</i> business through trial and error communicated with the market and investigated consumer preferences, <b>today</b> it buys big data (big data) for a multivariate analysis of market reactions; <br>  - <i>If yesterday</i> business was competing fiercely for ideas, <b>today</b> it agrees with competitors on issues of shared specialized production and the introduction of industry-wide standards. <br><br>  Accents undoubtedly shift: <br><ul><li>  <i><b>Yesterday</b></i> we understood the economy as a production and financial system that consumes resources (materials, raw materials, equipment, capital, personnel, etc.) and implements manufactured goods, works and services in monopolistic or competitive markets, </li><li>  <i><b>Today, with the advent of the global information technology and information management technologies, the</b></i> economy is increasingly transforming into an expert-management system that consumes information (knowledge, data, experience, models, hypotheses, etc.) and optimizes the interaction of independent economic actors within the framework of trade-off and efficient consumption . </li></ul><br>  It is obvious that for the business there are important various options for combining useful operating objects into effective models and there are no obvious reasons to limit attention to physical or logical things.  For management, it is rather important to correctly identify and classify objects in order to properly manage them. <br><br>  <i><a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/25590/">(continuation - Part 5.
