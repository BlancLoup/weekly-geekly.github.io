In continuation of the topic of fraud in RuNet, raised by us <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/payonline/blog/281581/">earlier</a> , we bring to your attention the latest data on the number and volume of fraudulent transactions by types of cards and types of payment card use infrastructure. <br><br>  The Central Bank noted a decrease in the share of unauthorized operations and the amount of funds stolen from bank cards.  The volume of illegal transactions using payment cards issued on the territory of the Russian Federation in 2015 amounted to about 1.14 billion rubles, which is 27% lower than in 2014, <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/psystem/P-sys/survey_2015.pdf">according to the</a> ‚Äú <a href="http://www.cbr.ru/psystem/P-sys/survey_2015.pdf">Survey on Unauthorized Operations in Russia in 2015</a> ‚Äù.  The number of unauthorized card transactions by the end of 2015 decreased to 0.0015%.  A year earlier, their share in the total number of transactions was 0.0026%.  And, despite the fact that the number of payment cards with the use of which unauthorized operations were carried out, in 2015 increased by 2043 compared to the same period of 2014 and amounted to 16686 units, the volumes of unauthorized operations also decrease, and at a fairly rapid pace.  We at <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> , which is engaged in accepting payments, cannot but be happy with such dynamics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb7/bda/700/bb7bda70093b41d2be1c25233288f539.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another positive trend is a significant decrease in the amount of illegally debited funds from cards through ATMs.  So, if for the whole of 2014, 51,687 unauthorized operations were conducted through an ATM, then in 2015, fraudsters activity decreased almost two times, to 25,395. up to 8% at the end of 2015

At the same time, the damage from such operations still constitutes a significant part in the total volume of all unauthorized operations (about 27%).  In general, a little more than 300 million rubles were stolen through ATMs over the year.  In 2014, the amount of stolen funds amounted to about 600 million rubles. <br><br>  The share of the number of unauthorized CNP transactions, which did not require the presence of a card, which was 66% in 2014, by the end of 2015 had grown to 74%.  In 2015, CNP transactions accounted for half of the total fraud.  At the same time, the growth of this indicator in 2015 amounted to 12 percentage points (from 42% to 54%). <br><br>  The main factors affecting this trend include the growing popularity of payment services for goods and services on the Internet, as well as the relative simplicity of performing such operations through social engineering methods without the use of specialized knowledge and means by attackers, the Central Bank notes.  At the same time, the total amount of funds withdrawn by remote means in 2015 did not reach the level of 2014 - almost 570 million rubles.  in 2015, against 609 million rubles in 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80c/a37/751/80ca37751edf489095715401c128fce4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the total number of payment cards, with the use of which unauthorized transactions were carried out in 2015, payment cards prevail, which may be due to their wide distribution - 88% of all payment cards.  At the same time, in the total number of active payment cards, only 0.011% was used for unauthorized operations.  It is different with credit cards.  With a relatively small share of credit cards in the total number of fraudulent transactions (21%), the share of such cards among active ones was about 0.024%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/317/966/06d31796691c47baaff022133108e1c3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2015, the number of unauthorized cross-border transactions - performed outside the Russian Federation, using payment cards issued on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as operations performed on the territory of the Russian Federation using payment cards issued outside its borders - doubled the number of domestic Russian unauthorized transactions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/374/aca/058/374aca058a2946e3b63a39ee614042bc.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd2/99f/540/fd299f54018f47a0aebaf44899dd9839.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Last year there were 32.5 thousand attempts to carry out unauthorized transactions through Internet banking for a total of 5.13 billion rubles.  Of these, not less than 48% of the total amount of cash falls to the share of fully or partially stopped operations. <br><br>  Legal entities lead in the number of suspension of fraudulent transactions: more than half of transactions (57%) were fully suspended in their accounts, including at the requests of clients, before the final withdrawal of funds.  But a large proportion of the termination of such operations belongs to banks, whose risk management systems are established in such a way that large write-offs from legal entities are always noticeable.  And according to the accounts of individuals, banks alone are practically unable to determine whether the operation is unfair, therefore 91% of unauthorized operations are detected by customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/619/b7e/7cb/619b7e7cbd2b4a39ab62863ac566cb8d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  According to experts, card holders are partly to blame for the development of remote methods of stealing funds from bank accounts.  Recently, Russians are increasingly using various Internet sites to purchase goods or services and pay with cards there, not always paying due attention to security. <br><br>  Based on materials of the Bank of Russia.
