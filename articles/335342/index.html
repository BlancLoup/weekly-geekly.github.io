  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How artificial intelligence can save email</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a99/a39/b9d/a99a39b9d95d4779af40a96749ee66e3.gif"></div><br>  On the one hand, email remains a popular means of communication, and on the other hand, it is when working with email that the issue of information overload is very acute.  People receive tens and hundreds of letters, archives of correspondence consist of thousands of conversations.  Often, there is no power to understand all this diversity, and a significant part of incoming correspondence is garbage that no one wants to receive and which will never be answered. <br><br>  This leads to the fact that some users - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/24/email-is-dying-among-mobiles-youngest-users/">especially young people</a> - are using less and less e-mail.  It seems that the future of email is under threat due to the development of chatbots and instant messengers, but perhaps this technology still has a chance to solve its problems.  And artificial intelligence (AI) can help. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  How AI makes letters better </h2><br>  One of the problems underlying information overload is the poor quality of the content of some email messages written by people.  According to <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/">statistics</a> , on average, an office employee receives up to 121 letters a day - if it is difficult for a person to immediately deal with a message, there is a growing likelihood that it will be delayed and then buried under a new correspondence.

      Artificial intelligence helps to solve this problem now.  For example, the developers of the <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/">Boomerang</a> service created the Respondable AI extension, which analyzes the text of email messages and suggests ways to improve it.  The robot will say if the topic is too short and incomprehensible, warn that the text looks rude.  As a result, clear messages will be sent to the recipient, with which it is clear what to do, and the sender is more likely to receive an early reply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/7a2/e03/83f/7a2e0383fe3a41ab8aa37276642bf29d.png"><br><br>  <i>Artificial intelligence analyzes the letter and informs the sender what its minuses are and how likely it is to get an answer.</i> <br><br>  In addition, robots can give personalized advice on how to communicate via email with a specific person.  For example, the <a href="https://www.crystalknows.com/">Crystal</a> service collects public data about people with whom a person communicates by mail, and generates recommendations on how to write letters to them. <br><br><h2>  The robot knows what you want to read. </h2><br>  The numbers <a href="http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/email-statistics/">indicate</a> that people most often unsubscribe from mailing lists because their mailboxes are filled with irrelevant marketing information.  And here artificial intelligence can become a tool for solving problems. <br><br>  Already now, email-marketing systems with the introduction of AI-technologies are able to divide site visitors into groups by the keywords that led them to a page, or even based on the activity of a particular subscriber.  As a result, it is possible not only to create letters ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù by the interests of a specific user, but also to understand what kind of message you need to send to him - stirring up interest or something to try to wake up the person who subscribed to the newsletter but does not read it at all. <br><br>  For example, the purchased Zeta Global service <a href="https://boomtrain.com/">Boomtrain</a> analyzes user behavior on the site, then uses this information when composing messages, and the virtual assistant <a href="https://www.conversica.com/">Conversica</a> sends a letter to a potential buyer a couple of minutes after he leaves his email - and about 50% of the interlocutors respond to such robotized letters, because they seem to be written on behalf of a person, people like it more than faceless auto replies. <br><br>  But that's not all - AI systems, like the one that is built into the <a href="https://sendpulse.com/p/ai/">SendPulse</a> email distribution <a href="https://sendpulse.com/p/ai/">service</a> , can collect information about the behavior of email subscribers in the past: on what days and what time they opened emails, in which cases they clicked on links .  All this significantly increases the percentage of opening letters - an average of 60%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/74f/02d/a2f/74f02da2f0dc0ddce9a202c65dbbfaec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, such an analysis allows you to automatically change offers in pop-ups and subscription widgets depending on the user's preferences (for example, based on search requests) - as a result, users are shown interesting information, and they receive newsletters that are actually read. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Despite the fact that email problems remain, which no artificial intelligence can solve at the moment - for example, difficulties in correctly displaying letters on any mobile device - it is obvious that AI may be a key factor in maintaining email popularity in the future. <br><br>  The introduction of AI-technologies solves the problems of both business and end users - people receive letters that are useful and personally understandable to them, and companies note an increase in business indicators.  And if this is so, then there are no reasons why email cannot be the number one means of communication. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/335342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/335342/</a></p>
