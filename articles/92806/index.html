For about a year I regularly collect, publish and share these links in the thematic Friendfeed-room User Experience, but in addition to the general tape, a digest has also proved useful.  This is the first release - April 2010. <br><br><img title="Fresh Material Review, April 2010" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/252/f35/c47/252f35c47c95bbf41e50fec50ce5aa7e.jpg" alt="  ,  2010" width="550" height="150"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Methods and practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/faceted-finding-with">Faceted Finding with Super-Powered Breadcrumb</a></strong> <br>  Greg Nudelman offers an interesting approach to building navigation in online stores and online catalogs.
