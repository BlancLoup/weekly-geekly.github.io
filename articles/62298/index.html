    <img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090617/7wNlnK6T15.jpg" align="right">  Last week, during a conference for Apple‚Äôs developers (Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developer‚Äôs Conference, WWDC), the day was announced when it would be possible to download a new firmware for iPhone version 3.0.  On the 17th of June, the iPhone 3.0 Operating System will be available for iPhones worldwide.  If you look at your calendar, you will notice that this day has already come, and soon the owners of Apple‚Äôs phones will be delighted with push notifications or a newfound opportunity to work with the clipboard (cut, copy and paste). <br><br>  Although, perhaps, you know many features that will appear with the iPhone 3.0 update, you probably do not know <strong>all the</strong> features.  You may not even know where to download the firmware.  This short article provides a brief overview of the iPhone 3.0 firmware, what to expect from it, and what's new in the applications and the iPhone 3G S. <br><br><h1>  Where to download the firmware </h1><br><img src="http://pic.ipicture.ru/uploads/090617/HVXebjRPBu.jpg"><br>  IPhone 3.0 firmware is available for all iPhone, iPhone 3Gs, and iPod Touch models.  Some features will not be available for the first generation of iPhones, and the firmware for the iPod Touch will not be free - it costs $ 9.95.  Download the firmware on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/softwareupdate/">Apple's Software Update</a> page. <br><br><h1>  What features to expect </h1><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1uYVTk-_WE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSqh95ub9Hi7yE-RtiqLniKUnpTg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <sup>(Video review in English)</sup> <br><br>  We will not talk about the hundreds of new features that will be available in the new firmware, we want to focus on those that are worthy of news headlines.  These are features that make your phone seem completely new to you.  We chose our favorite thirteen: <br><ol><li>  <strong>Buffer operations - cut, copy, and paste</strong> : This feature was very lacking.  Now cut / copy / paste works with words, paragraphs and links. </li><li>  <strong>Copy / paste for a photo</strong> : You can transfer several photos to a letter. </li><li>  <strong>Spotlight</strong> : New feature for iPhone 3.0 to search for music, contacts, mail, etc.  We were deadly missing the search function for mail, and now we have it. </li><li>  <strong>MMS</strong> : Now iPhone ... can send MMS if your operator supports them.  AT &amp; T subscribers are not lucky - they will have to wait until the end of summer to use MMS, although this feature should be included in the standard plan. </li><li>  <strong>Use as a modem</strong> : iPhone 3.0 supports using the phone as a modem for laptops and other devices, so you will always have access to the Internet.  However, it is not cheap, so we are not sure how often we will use this feature (without jailbreak). </li><li>  <strong>Downloadable movies and TV shows</strong> : As we were told last week, there will now be movies and TV shows on iTunes that you can buy and / or rent.  Audiobooks and educational content will also be available for download. </li><li>  <strong>CalDAV Support</strong> : The new firmware will improve calendar synchronization, as iPhone 3.0 now works with CalDAV format, which is used by Google, Yahoo, and others.  Now syncing with your Google Calendar will be available. </li><li>  <strong>Landscape orientation for mail and notes</strong> : It is hard to work with a tiny virtual keyboard, but with iPhone 3.0 you can work with notes (Notes) and mail (Mail) applications in landscape orientation.  This will allow typing more quickly and with fewer errors. </li><li>  <strong>Voice notes</strong> : In the line of iPhone applications, completion, with which you can record your thoughts or someone's lectures.  Of course, there are other uses, but we will leave you room for imagination. </li><li>  <strong>Signing in to YouTube</strong> : I was extremely annoyed that I couldn‚Äôt pull my favorite videos from my YouTube account into my iPhone, but now the problem is solved - you can sign in to YouTube with your username and password. </li><li>  <strong>Push Notifications</strong> : Finally, you'll know when a new IM message arrived.  Applications can send you messages even when they are not running. </li><li>  <strong>Find my iPhone</strong> : Admitted on WWDC, this feature allows you to ping your phone via MobileMe, even if it is in silent mode.  Also, using MobileMe, you can remotely lock your iPhone and erase data from it. </li><li>  <strong>Shake to switch a song</strong> : If you are sick of a song in your iPhone, shake it and something new will play.  Cheers to control with an accelerometer! </li></ol><br><br><h1>  iPhone 3G S, applications and what's next. </h1><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4aQpczZC00%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj5gopcojMH81ChpFydDGGTKTsEeg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <sup>(Video review in English)</sup> <br><br>  Although the iPhone 3.0 firmware is coming out today, you will have to wait until Friday if you are waiting for the iPhone 3G Speed, a new generation of iPhone.  The biggest changes are increased computing power, video recording, extended battery life, a true compass, and improved photo quality.  Apple posted a long video of all the new features in the iPhone 3G S. In general, however, the progress is not as noticeable as in the case of 3G, when we saw features like GPS.  iPhone 3G S comes out on June 19th - this Friday. <br><br>  Many of your favorite apps will receive updates to support purchases from apps, push notifications, and third-party support.  Take a look at our <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/06/08/iphone-30-apps/">Top iPhone 6 iPhone 3.0 Apps to Watch</a> <i>article</i> to read what else is coming out for iPhone 3.0 and 3G S. <br><br>  It's time for joy - makes your iPhone even more useful! <br><br>  <i>The update from the respected <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ain/" class="user_link">AIN</a> : a working solution from the <a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/">Dev Team</a> jailbreak and unlock already exists for all phones except 3GS, and all this will be available until Friday.</i>  <i>Hooray!</i> <br><br>  <i>Update2 from me: Thank you very much for fixing my karma from 6 to 2x.</i>  <i>Now I will remember about habrakata, and the translator‚Äôs responsibility for inaccuracies and understatements in the original.</i>  <i>Cheers!</i>  <i>;-)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62298/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62298/</a></p>
