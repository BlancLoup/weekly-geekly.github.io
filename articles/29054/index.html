  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do you have poor eyesight? Then you have no place in RuNet!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - Cross post from my <a href="http://absolvo.ru/2008-07-14/u-tebya-ploxoe-zrenie-togda-tebe-ne-mesto-v-runete/">blog</a> <br>  It seems that most developers who implement captcha on their projects are guided by this very motto.  People with poor eyes have a trite problem with recognition of captcha, and sometimes they simply do not have the ability to recognize it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vision problems can be great variety.  Hyperopia and myopia - perhaps one of the most ‚Äúharmless‚Äù, there are many more serious.  Let's first take a look at some captcha pictures that are not difficult for you to recognize (if you have eyesight as part of ‚Äúgood‚Äù), but turn into a big problem for people with visual problems.  I smoked them a little: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/721/558/f03/721558f0301e7c2701ade7615b3279ab.png" alt="Do you have poor eyesight? Then you have no place in RuNet!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/897/d4e/5f9/897d4e5f9248b857bbfb954f01d87bba.jpg" alt="Do you have poor eyesight? Then you have no place in RuNet!"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/078/e7e/aa3/078e7eaa381958250af1c33e27b4476f.jpg" alt="Do you have poor eyesight? Then you have no place in RuNet!"><br>  Share your examples of those captcha that are problematic to recognize, it will be interesting to see. <br><br>  How to solve this problem in the west?  Easy - alternative captcha, for example sound.  Frankly speaking, sound captcha is a separate song, because I tried these captcha, and I was able to make out what I was told there from the third time, but I did not strain my eyes. <br><br>  However, this is also not a panacea, not all users can work with a computer, they can work with a mobile phone.  Not everyone eventually has a sound card or speakers are included.  But that's not the point, the point is that people should have an alternative, if a person sees poorly, he is not disabled, he just has some difficulties.  And we, developers, do not care. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/557/382/185/5573821854c460083d844e8f93dc18bf.jpg" alt="Do you have poor eyesight? Then you have no place in RuNet!"><br>  How many guest guards and feedback forms with captcha I have made - I have never thought about it, reassuring myself that there are not so many such people, that it is not lethal and in general it does not matter.

      Examples of sound captcha: <br>  <a href="http://scripts.titude.nl/demo/captcha/">scripts.titude.nl/demo/captcha</a> <br>  <a href="http://recaptcha.net/learnmore.html">recaptcha.net/learnmore.html</a> <br>  (I could not find a single Russian solution, maybe someone saw?) <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsound captcha has been in the air for more than one year, someone is using it in order to strengthen the graphic captcha (yes, yes, there are such maniacs :)), someone to enable people to use the service with vision problems.  However, for what it would not be used - they are rarely used, because it is more difficult to set up and maintain such a captcha than a normal picture generator with noise in the background. <br><br>  If we continue this topic, the problems of poor people do not end only with captcha.  Aggressive design, the lack of a ‚Äúprint version‚Äù (I have a few friends who read websites like that, not to save traffic, but in order to better perceive the text, not really straining, already sick eyes,) etc.  etc.  I am sure that if, after reading this note, you take a walk through the network, you will find hundreds of examples of disregard for such people, not really bothering about the search. <br><br>  Let's still be more closer to those who want to use the fruits of our services, but cannot, due to reasons they cannot change. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29054/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29054/</a></p>
