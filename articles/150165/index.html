Despite the fact that the new mobile platform from Microsoft is relatively young, many popular utilities are already presented in the Marketplace, and in most cases you will not even have to change your habits. <br><br>  The fact is that customers of familiar services often have got versions for WP7, and many applications for this platform, on the contrary, are written specifically for it and have unique functionality.  In a word, you will not be disappointed in the selection of software for a new phone, the main thing is to make a choice. <br><br><h2>  Evernote </h2><br>  We think that this program does not need a detailed description.  One of the recognized leaders in the market for individual planning and a universal assistant for all occasions - all this is Evernote.  There are a lot of usage scenarios for the application, and you can access notes from absolutely any modern platform, you would have access to the Internet.  If formally Evernote is a repository of notes with any media content, then in fact it can be adapted to any needs.

Roughly speaking, everyone gets exactly what they need in Evernote, and the program doesn‚Äôt limit your choice.  Not forgotten and unique to the platform WP7 features.  So, any note or shortcut is easy to put on one of the desktop tiles, and the application itself is made in the best traditions of the Metro UI interface. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/db21927d-f292-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5e/86f/06b/e5e86f06bb2f0f5df0e76e2c188adaba.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  Facebook </h2><br>  The official client of the most popular social network in the world is simply doomed to be in demand, isn't it?  In spite of the presence of integration built into the OS, an application that inherited the usual partition structure may seem more convenient to many.  Everything we use for Facebook is easily accessible from a mobile client.  This includes viewing and filtering news feeds, adding notes, photos and check-ins, as well as chatting with friends through comments and personal correspondence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e37/26b/f6b/e3726bf6bbd3a7c67a5fa5d3ff2326be.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/629/dcf/eee/629dcfeee552d7f83ad32571e2a2d257.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/973/9bf/f4a/9739bff4a35e567cfc95a9381e491f79.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, the program can promptly notify you about new messages and other activities, and if you follow the discussion, you need to shake the smartphone without getting off the screen to get the latest content updates.  Switching between tabs, as in many other utilities, made horizontal scrolling. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/82a23635-5bd9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23d/5ec/be7/23d5ecbe7c39feed2a08d054d0f87cbe.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  FB2 Reader </h2><br>  The smartphone has long ceased to be a tool aimed solely at making calls and messaging.  Despite the rapid development of the market for various specialized gadgets, books are actively read on the phones, and one of the best programs for this is FB2 Reader.  With it, you can access not only your literature, stored in Microsoft's SkyDrive cloud storage, but also extensive shelves of publicly available OPDS directories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/682/635/5ac/6826355ac005cd896c5701251ecb6747.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb7/509/17d/fb750917d56fb34aa2157e9f8c780715.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4c/6a5/f12/b4c6a5f12d5e07baec62d33e66669c84.jpg"><br><br>  A set of settings should be considered customary for a program of this kind, but it does not give the impression that the developers have forgotten something.  Several themes, adjustment of the font size with a good example and adjustment of the appearance of the status line - all this is available.  You can add a bookmark or go to the content directly from the context menu, and if you are more comfortable reading in the landscape orientation of the screen - there are no problems, the program will reformat the book in seconds. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/3d9c3155-cef5-4fb3-ae33-aa25794b3b7c"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed8/57a/eb1/ed857aeb1ee82604d737ec9d682fd00a.gif"></a> <br><br>  Buy in Marketplace for 69 rubles: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/c5306975-0b96-439a-8826-b2518cef81f7"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f87/482/9f6/f874829f6a10e1c36a6a76cdd3cff9d2.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  gMaps </h2><br>  Without a smartphone can not do, and when the task of orientation in unfamiliar places.  It is not necessary to highlight your way by keeping the screen on, you just have to start the mapping program, and after a few moments it will determine where you are and offer options for routes to the destination.  In the work gMaps uses Google maps, which are the most optimal for many regions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bf/6ad/0d6/0bf6ad0d6aff2b6b0251dba4050ec1c5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/777/358/ed5/777358ed5e2ab05b98d0629478d73cc7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16c/985/70c/16c98570c165a97517eaea6dd79f19e8.jpg"><br><br>  Switching of map layers is very conveniently implemented, it is not necessary even to go to the menu.  In addition, the button to specify your own location has a prominent place, and if necessary, the program can serve as an exhaustive reference for public places, because it has a huge search giant database at its disposal. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/7b8bedd5-4368-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/89f/ce3/63f/89fce363f9aa06a2bb8ca362849df3e4.gif"></a> <br><br>  Buy the full version in the Marketplace for 69 rubles .: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/5fad1b41-f8db-4397-b584-4a0da12fe233"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f50/d6a/7a2/f50d6a7a27594e9ea031e184da56e9c0.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  Mehdoh </h2><br>  A program that rightfully deserves the title of the best third-party client for communicating on the microblogging network Twitter.  Functional saturation, designed in strict adherence to the canons of the interface design and complete free of charge, made Mehdoh one of the most popular applications for Windows Phone 7. The client makes extensive use of the platform‚Äôs capabilities and allows you to fine tune not only your behavior, but also the appearance of live tiles on the main screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/687/81c/229/68781c2293aba0e22b5f989628e24857.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c15/d1f/1d0/c15d1f1d014e40a777ec7ebf5a4eeae5.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1ce/188/58d/1ce18858d11d81cef26afa4d3b5b3261.jpg"><br><br>  They can be static or, like the People hub, display a selection of avatars of your friends and subscribers, as well as other information depending on the type of tile.  During the development of Mehdoh, the support of all the main services for the most productive work with Twitter was taken into account, and in general the client is distinguished by the highest stability and usability. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/150f3fc4-dc0d-4299-a8ba-069b70436ad7"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66e/3f9/6e3/66e3f96e34eb11f8e8e50b72ad598d05.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  Skype </h2><br>  We think that the importance of this application can not be overestimated.  As soon as the official client of Skype appeared on the Windows Phone 7 platform, many users decided to try the new product from Microsoft, because their own set of programs, without which it is impossible to do, was formed with its help.  At your disposal is a familiar interface with a list of contacts, chat rooms and a dialer, made in accordance with the standards of design interface Metro-applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01a/3ec/e7d/01a3ece7d34de7e4c927bfc747051a79.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6f4/17e/655/6f417e655c12b8931d048ef51988c5ea.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a77/3cd/806/a773cd80670adcc45419300da73ea50f.jpg"><br><br>  There are separate buttons for the dialer and account search screen.  You can change your online status or filter your contact list with a single click.  Like the list of installed applications in your smartphone, entries in the contact list are filtered by the selected letters of the alphabet, making it easier to find the right one. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/c3f8e570-68b3-4d6a-bdbb-c0a3f4360a51"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46c/0e0/c03/46c0e0c03a897b972c49229620cb5d47.gif"></a> <br><br><h2>  Yandex maps </h2><br>  Yandex was one of the first to feel the need for high-quality applications for the new platform, adapted to the same local conditions.  The company's products for the Android OS have long won the approval of users, and Yandex.Maps - confirmation of the qualitative approach to the new projectile.  At your disposal are the usual layers of desktop maps, including satellite imagery and a ‚Äúfolk‚Äù map, compiled on the basis of information from users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f8/f69/75d/8f8f6975d7c78d0a7a807408d9f7bd58.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4d/1f0/ac8/d4d1f0ac8e2078aad565060f92737d0b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/441/bf1/47d/441bf147d504d681f4b3faa197e5cc0c.jpg"><br><br>  To activate the display of traffic jams, a separate indicator is provided, which also displays their summary rating by city, and at the bottom of the screen there are buttons for searching and building routes.  For better readability of the map, a quick scale setting is provided, as well as a mode change from day to night so that the smartphone‚Äôs unnecessarily bright screen does not distract your attention in the evening. <br><br>  Free install from Marketplace: <br><br> <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/82781e98-b22e-4349-aaac-3b1cde739d07"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1d0/b3a/257/1d0b3a257301d92e29f7d37425f84497.gif"></a> <br><br>  Of course, this is not all applications that we can recommend to you.  Some will like certain alternatives to the considered utilities, and not all users need instant access to social networks.  Nevertheless, we are confident that the myth of the absence of popular and convenient tools for Windows Phone 7 has long been debunked, and the need to navigate the constantly evolving Marketplace comes to the fore. <br><br>  We would appreciate your own recommendations in the comments to this article. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150165/</a></p>
