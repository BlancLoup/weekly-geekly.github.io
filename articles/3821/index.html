  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design and Dumping</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear readers.  It is time for the first post ‚ÄúSemicolon‚Äù.  In it, we will talk about dumping in the design market (the original article was slightly modified due to the reluctance to use some words in the browser and the desire to preserve the uniqueness of its content). <br><br>  The most inquisitive can see the definitions of the words <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD">"designer"</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">"dumping"</a> in wikipedia.  I want to note that the concept of ‚Äúdumping‚Äù is actively used nowadays not only for international trade otneny, but also when describing the deliberate reduction in prices on the market to force out competitors. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  If there is a fixed price for some type of work, then customers are satisfied.  They understand that they are not wasting money (it is worth considering the existence of very high-quality service providers, but in this case, buyers themselves understand that they are spending money on show-off).  And then there are garni lads, ready to do anything, for the "50th."  These are masters of their work who ‚Äúprofessionally own Photoshop‚Äù and also create ‚Äúa unique corporate style in just 50s.‚Äù  So what is their destructive action?

      First, not every client can distinguish quality work from mediocre.  Most of them do not know about web standards, composition, information design, typography and many other things that the designer must be aware of.  I do not blame them - they are always right and not at all obliged to understand the design.  After all, the doctor does not require us to know Latin and anatomy.  But if he does everything cheaply, hastily and with errors, then the patient will soon incur losses and realize that he saved in vain.  Good work cheap does not happen.  Remember this, gentlemen clients. <br><br>  Secondly, designers who deal with dumping damage their colleagues.  Do you know why this method of fighting in the market is severely punished in all areas of the economy?  It would seem, as well, when all goods and services are cheap!  Well, let's look at a specific example.  In the design market, where some abstract work costs $ 1,000, everything is calm.  Customers are satisfied, because there is a clear price for the service, they believe that they pay their money for a reason.  But then wizards appear, ready to do this work for 50. The people are indignant and consider themselves to be deceived.  Yes, and differences, at first glance, is also not visible - everything is just as bright, sometimes even brighter than those who want 1000. The image of design as a service drops sharply, the service seems cheap.  Under this pressure, the rest of the designers are also beginning to cut prices in order to somehow resist.  As a result, prices can reach a level at which it is simply unprofitable to work.  And many will even stop doing design because of this.  A pity, because they worked well. <br><br>  And the last, in my opinion, the destructive influence of designers involved in dumping - the Internet is littered with freak sites.  And at work I come across such business cards, from which it becomes scary for the future of the Russian language.  I'm not talking about advertising booklets, banners hanging over my city.  The prosperity of cheap design is detrimental to Russian culture. <br><br>  I do not consider myself a saint, I also have mistakes.  If you find them - tell me, I will be very grateful.  But if I think it worked badly - I will not sell it.  Gentlemen designers, guest workers, do not take money for "professionalism."  Speak honestly what you learn.  Then it will be easier for potential buyers to figure out what the matter is. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3821/</a></p>
