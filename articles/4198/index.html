  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online shopping started in Belarus</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Trade of Belarus proposes to introduce the mandatory registration of domain names of online stores.  All of them will also be required to obtain a license to work on the web.  Authorities seriously intend to take control of this retail sector, hitherto existed in a semi-legal position.  The draft law should be considered in Parliament in early 2007. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Until now, Belarusian legislation has no concept of ‚Äúonline store‚Äù at all.  For retail sale via the Internet, it is enough to register as an individual entrepreneur or a legal entity and indicate in the license the type of activity ‚Äútrade on patterns‚Äù and / or ‚Äúdistribution and distribution trade‚Äù.  The concepts of "online store", "e-commerce" are completely absent. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt the moment, almost all the stores are working‚Äú in black ‚Äù, except for those that sell uncertified or used goods,‚Äù the owner of one of Minsk online computer equipment stores, who asked not to be named, tells Habrahabru.  He temporarily closed his store before the presidential elections [in spring 2006], because ‚Äúbefore the elections every first store was checked and I didn‚Äôt really want to get money.‚Äù  Now the entrepreneur works illegally. <br><br>  Recently, the authorities have stepped up pressure on Belarusian entrepreneurs, who are at their own risk trying to trade on the Internet.  At the end of 2005 - the beginning of 2006, cases of the imposition of penalties became frequent.  As a violation, most often, a retail license is imputed, which does not indicate the domain name of the store and does not mention the form of retail trade - sample trading.

      According to the Ministry of Commerce, this year about 200 sites were tested.  According to the results of the checks, facts were revealed when the seller does not register the fact of purchase of the goods and payment for it, and the buyer subsequently cannot protect his rights. <br><br>  Increased pressure on online stores is directly related to the introduction of new legislation.  The draft of the new version of the law on consumer protection will be submitted to the lower chamber of the Belarusian parliament in early 2007. <br><br>  Beginning in the fall of 2005, <a href="http://forum.onliner.by/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D2347994">scraps of rumors are heard</a> from the corridors of the Belarusian authorities about what will be included in the new law.  Now there is <a href="http://www.interfax.by/%3Fid%3D33%26amp%3Bid_sp%3D25195">more information</a> on this.  The Ministry of Trade of Belarus proposes to introduce mandatory registration of domain names of online stores in the country.  Now the ministry together with the State Standard and interested departments is developing a draft of a new version of the law on consumer protection.  Obligatory registration of domain names of online stores at the State Inspectorate for Information Security under the Presidential Administration of Belarus will also involve obtaining a license for the right to conduct retail trade. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn the one hand, legalizing an online store and paying all taxes in full is good.  This makes it possible to work quietly and not shiver at every sale, that this could be tax or OBEP.  But on the other hand, such a store will lose 99% of customers due to higher prices for goods and the inconvenience of buying, ‚Äùsays our interlocutor.  According to him, the reasons for the numerous checks are quite clear: ‚ÄúIf you can check the market outlet at any time, simply by coming and buying something there, then with‚Äú virtual ‚Äùsellers things are worse - they are more difficult to verify.  And since the profits there for the most part are not taken into account at all, it is clear why the tax services became interested in online shopping.  For more than a year, they have regularly carried out test purchases and, of course, fined the owners. ‚Äù <br><br>  - It comes to ridiculous.  If you are an employee of the tax (OBEP) state standard, then you go to <a href="http://www.shops.by/">shop.by</a> , for example, and look at shops selling cell phones, call anyone and order a cell phone.  If they bring him - then feel free to write a subpoena and fine.  Because there is not a single online store that has a license to trade in cellular. <br><br>  <b>Why not one?</b> <br><br>  Because it is a means of communication, and getting permission for such trade from BelGIIS and Beltelecom will cost so much money that all individual entrepreneurs taken together cannot afford.  The cost of a certified BSN-shnogo phone is already $ <nobr>20-25</nobr> .  above the "original". <br><br>  <b>Madhouse ...</b> <br><br>  This is just an example of the work of a ‚Äúproperly organized legislative framework.‚Äù  That is why I still do not open the official store. <br><br>  <b>It turns out that now the state has begun to pursue a systematic policy to legalize online stores, but the goal of this policy is not the development of e-commerce?</b> <br><br>  The goal is to drive everyone to the collective farm, plant a tractor and pay $ 100.  per month, enough for bread and "ink".  The state is not profitable rich people.  It's easier to manage when people have no choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4198/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4198/</a></p>
