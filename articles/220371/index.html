All this time I released updates, improved the system, communicated with users and figured out what to do next.  And since the current situation is very different from my original plans, I think I need to talk about the process of promotion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Russian-speaking users </h4><br>  More than a hundred render nodes have accumulated over this ‚Äúpost-release‚Äù month, and there are already more than 300 users registered on the tracker. The daily online reached 10 nodes, while I put my Jobs on the render, people apparently decided to type a rating as soon as I tired of putting - online went to a sharp decline.  Users of course put their own Jobs, but there was no regularity for everyone to always have something to render.  Nevertheless, I think that everything is in order with our community, unlike ... <br><br><h4>  Foreign users </h4><br>  The themes about torrender were created on four foreign forums, including on scriptspot - the main resource on max scripts on the Internet.  In a month I received only one answer in one of these topics: <br><blockquote>  I haven‚Äôt been given the system a try. </blockquote><br>  And nothing more.  Zero.  The topics are gone from the first pages, we can assume that the English-speaking community ignored the torrender completely.  In our forum, the situation with foreigners was commented as follows: <br><blockquote>  For comrades ‚Äúfrom there,‚Äù the word torrent is associated exclusively with piracy, so nothing surprising.  torrender for the legit audience is unlikely to even have at least some sort of success.  And you see that and the negative will pour. </blockquote><br>  I didn‚Äôt agree, but it cannot be that all foreign 3dshniks are so zombie by the mantra ‚Äútorrent is bad‚Äù so as not to even realize that torrent is just a technology, but after such a zero reaction for a whole month - probably all the same the way it is.  And therefore, now nothing will be done for foreign users.  But after the Russian release, I was advised to connect a kickstarter, venture capitalists, to go to Silicon Valley, but in the end, that's it.  I was even disappointed to be going to translate some of the tracker pages from English to Russian, in order to finally concentrate on the Russian-speaking users, but for now I‚Äôm just too lazy.

    <h4>  Pirates </h4><br>  In tspertsii torrender also did not ignore the attention, someone (by the way Russian-speaking), who had already broken one of my scripts, posted a link to the project of the torrender there and hinted that due to weak client protection (macros are really broken by once-two hackers) use a slightly modified phishing version.  But this topic has not received much enthusiasm either, just one answer: <br><blockquote>  that's pretty smart  The more yours will, your faster your scenes will render ... if that's how it works ... <br>  wish there was something like that for cinema.  Would be sweet. <br>  if you need security  But for personal projects this would be epic. </blockquote><br>  As a developer, I can confirm that yes, there is no oppose to such a modified client, even it‚Äôs not necessary to break the PHP tracker part, but I don‚Äôt see any reason to rewrite the client from C ++ script for the sole purpose of improving security.  it is still not clear how the project will be claimed by Russian users. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  I will work on promotion and social engineering for protection, so that the system is self-regulating, I will introduce a reputation for users, to evaluate themselves, legalize, identify "phishers" and the like.  And so that there is always something to render - I will introduce automatic generation of test scenes, but of course all this will take some time.  We will be on the alert, we will wait (s) m / f "Treasure Island" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220371/</a></p>
