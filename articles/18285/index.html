I do not know who owes the service to such a speaking name, but it works, and well.  Remembered?  Fine! <br><br><img src="http://img172.imageshack.us/img172/8434/18274658kc4.png" alt="Crazy Egg"><br><br><blockquote><h3>  What it is? </h3><br>  As already mentioned above, this is a service for tracking the movement of users around the site - who clicked where, which links are the most popular, and similar, heterogeneous information for usabilityists. <br>  The service allows you to track the activity of certain users, and display this data in various forms: ‚Äúinfrared‚Äù - where the more active the area, the ‚Äúwarmer‚Äù it is, salutes (the more active the area, the more candy), a simple list sorted by activity, flasks ( the fuller the flask, the more active the area), the clouds (in my opinion the most convenient option - combines all the others together).

Relatively inexpensive, but certainly not cheap - the service involves 4 paid lines and one free.  In order to write this review, I was not too lazy to pay $ 19 (per month) by choosing the average option - for several projects with additional features included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/0a0/b16/0b00a0b16b1eda28e35f39487dcd2545.jpg" alt="Link tracking"></blockquote><br><blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b5/433/892/0b54338921665ffb5a90930147296f5b.jpg" alt="Popularity list"><br><br>  Yes, yes, the service is not free.  More precisely, there is a free opportunity to test, but it is slightly cropped (you can only track 5,000 visitors and only 4 pages on the site (attention - 4 pages, not sites), i.e. it is enough to understand the usefulness of the service). </blockquote><br><blockquote><h3>  Why is this? </h3><br>  With this service, you can shuffle the blocks on the site that are most useful to users.  No need to argue with the creators - which block is located where.  This will help them <a href="" title="Crazy Eggs">crazy egg</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38c/af8/e75/38caf8e753782a01dc6419d3902edd57.jpg" alt="Add project"></blockquote><br><blockquote>  Also, this service will help you understand - in which area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe site it is best to place ads when it comes to monetization in your service.  After all, altruism is good, and money for the maintenance of the service is needed, and it will not be superfluous to calculate the areas where advertising will bring the greatest return, and the least irritation among users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0dd/3fb/b34/0dd3fbb34709e77f3fbcd6523c7eac77.jpg" alt="more utility"></blockquote><br><blockquote><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  No kilometer scripts need to be inserted, just insert 2 lines of JavaScript, and the service will start tracking.  As I understand it, the executive script runs on the <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com/" title="Crazy Eggs">CrazyEgg</a> server, so your site will not lose a second in performance, and the utility is pretty big. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/e4e/e67/a90e4ee6760978463e6306a2f5982e24.jpg" alt="popularity management"></blockquote><br><blockquote><h3>  How much is it? </h3><br>  As I already mentioned, the service is far from free, although it has a test-free version.  I'll tell you more about pricing. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  1. Free trial version.  Includes the ability to track 5,000 visits, 4 pages on the site. <br><br>  2. Basic version.  In this version you can track 10,000 visits, and 10 pages, which is quite enough for an average corporate site.  There is a basic kit - $ 9 per month.  This package includes all additional features. <br><br>  3. Standard version.  It includes the ability to track 25,000 visits on 20 pages.  It is suitable for testing a new startup.  It costs $ 19 a month, I bought it for testing the service, and writing this review. <br><br>  4. Version "Plus."  Differs from the previous trackability of 100,000 visits, 50 pages.  Very good rate for large services.  It costs 49 dollars a month.  Quite a lot of money for the service, but they usually more than pay off. <br><br>  5. Version "Pro".  It costs almost $ 100, has the ability to track 250,000 visits on a hundred pages.  The tariff is suitable for monsters with high traffic and a large number of pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f73/fb2/62d/f73fb262da4618a8dde67690cfd191ea.jpg" alt="Tracking statistics"></blockquote><br><blockquote><h3>  There are analogues </h3><br>  I was not lazy, and I collected a couple of links with peers who offer the same services, but a bit cheaper. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  1. <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/home/%3Fhl%3Den" title="Posh collection and analysis of statistics">Google Analytics</a> is a free service for collecting and analyzing statistics, displaying statistics in the most visual form, and without a variety of ratings, counters.  Very detailed and useful thing.  I recommend, because  I myself use it for this blog. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://www.mapsurface.com/" title="Service to track the popularity of blocks on the site">MapSurface</a> - I haven‚Äôt used it myself yet (because I preferred CrazyEgg), but hardly being a bad service would collect a lot of positive feedback.  Unfortunately, he is now in closed beta status. </blockquote><br><blockquote><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  You can use and need.  Here are just the tariffs rather painfully bite, but usually this money then with a vengeance beats off on increasing the conversion of visitors into money.  You need to use the service to test advertising space and the convenience of individual pages, which helps again to increase conversion.  In general, a <a href="">useful thing</a> for each site owner, and for usability in general, it is practically obligatory.  Fortunately for people who have lost money this month - there are useful analogues. <br><br><img src="http://img241.imageshack.us/img241/2346/confettitnml5.jpg" alt="An interesting idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe visualization of popularity - candy"></blockquote><br><br>  The author: <a href="http://www.birzool.com/" title="I'm writing about web interface usability">Jaroslav Birzul</a> (DezmASter). <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.birzool.com/crazyegg/" title="Crazy eggs, original source">Web Interface Usability Blog</a> . <br><br>  PS: All with the past New Year!
