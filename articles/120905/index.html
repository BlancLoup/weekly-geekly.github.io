      With this letter I hope to close this topic once and for all. <br><br><h4>  So, a little help for those interested in the topic: </h4><br>  <b>An LCD monitor</b> cannot radiate actively except light, since it does not have the necessary conditions for other emissions.  In old CRT monitors, a mechanism is used for the purpose of bombarding the phosphor with electrons using an electromagnetic trajectory control system.  There - yes, a little fonilo.  In the LCD monitor, each pixel is a microscopic controlled polarizing mirror, illuminated either by a thin fluorescent backlight or by LEDs located behind a layer of liquid crystals. <br><br>  Theoretically, the <b>system unit</b> emits something, approximately like an anvil, but it is also iron, and the filling is thin, so that nothing really goes beyond the limits of the iron box. <br><br>  In ordinary <b>mice</b> , shining red light from under the belly, a simple 2-10mW LED is used.  This is not even close laser.  The task of the diode - just to illuminate the space under the mouse. <br><br>  <b>Laser mice</b> use a 15-25nW laser LED.  Safe power for short-term retinal irradiation is 5mW.  This is 200 times more.  For 10 seconds of looking at the sun through dense clouds, you will cause more harm to your eyes than if you carefully examine the diode of the included mouse for about fifty years. <br><br>  <b>A laser printer</b> is called a laser not because the engineer Garin‚Äôs hyperboloid is inside there, but because the laser diode is working there is a little more powerful than the mouse, which shines in a rotating mirror, which allows the light beam to pass along the entire photodrum.  The diode blinks at high frequencies, the reflected beam illuminates the photodrum, the cells of which are electrified, to which the powder from the cartridge then sticks, which is then imprinted on the paper and fixed on it with a thermal.  All catastrophic static electricity took over the paper.  But she doesn't care anymore - she's already dead.  The maximum that can happen is that your trash can comes to life and remembers the felling of the Amazon jungle. <br><br>  <b>A mobile phone is</b> your most terrible enemy - its radiation is up to 1W at its peak (this is when you speak by telephone from a well in the zone of uncertain reception).  The usual electromagnetic background at rest is about zero milliwatts. <br><br><h4>  Now let's go through external threats: </h4><br>  Each head <b>metro</b> car has 4 electric motors with a capacity of 160 kW each.  The subway tunnel is a reinforced concrete pipe, in fact - a waveguide.  There are 2 head cars in the train.  8 * 160 = 1.2 megawatts.  Those.  you get to work at Megavolnovka. <br><br>  <b>Trams and trolleybuses</b> : two of the same engine to the car.  Only a shielding tunnel is not. <br><br>  <b>Tram and trolleybus wires</b> are also aggressive emitters, although they look so peaceful ... Did you ever go under high-voltage lines?  Heard how they are buzzing?  These wires discuss with each other who irradiated you more powerfully and your probable lifespan.  By the way, when you look out from the edge of the platform in the subway in the tunnel of the train, you are standing half a meter above the contact rail, arm thick.  And it has 825 volts and 10 kiloamperes (an electric current is supplied with exactly one hundred times less current, and by the way, it is guaranteed to kill). <br><br>  <b>A car generator</b> , driven by a belt / chain connection to the engine crankshaft, generates a current by rotating one iron piece inside the other and also actively low-frequency radiation. <br><br>  By the way, about the "wave".  <b>Home microwave</b> has a power of only about 1 kW.  And it fries so that the eggs then do not scrub from the walls.  And because all these watts in the process of warming up are imprinted in your pasta!  (my God, I doomed people to death by starvation). <br><br>  The amount of substances actually harmful to health <b>in Moscow air</b> rarely falls below one third of the maximum permissible concentration.  And the term "maximum permissible concentration" is usually indicated for a time interval of 24 hours, and you breathe it constantly, for years. <br><br>  So I really hope that now you know exactly what you need to fear. <br><br><h4>  Conclusions for those who did not make their own: </h4><br>  Office equipment is safe.  Onishchenko is not a complete parasite and there are no really dangerous devices on the market. <br>  Therefore, if someone starts telling me again about the radiation of office equipment, or I find out that someone started telling someone about the radiation of office equipment, or someone starts putting humidifiers near the printer (because the water is there it does with its radiation), overshadow the USB-phone with the sign of the cross and expel the devil from the fan, then I will make it so that all the remaining time you will be working on the accounts.  In case you are a well-deserved hero of the company, maybe you will be provided with a mechanical adding machine ... although there is no ... there are moving metal parts ... again pickups, again radiation ... and on the scores there are dry pieces of metal along metal axes ... what to do, where to run ... <br><br>  In short, the smartest will work on calculating sticks, and make reports in coal on birch bark until they pass the EGE at least 75 points in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, Russian, computer science, and separately - the exam on life safety. <br><br>  With love, your admin. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120905/</a></p>
