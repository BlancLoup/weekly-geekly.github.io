They publish materials from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft and its high-resolution <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182584/">HiRise camera</a> .  Popular science geological surveys prepared by American geologists are translated by Russian volunteers, who have found the opportunity to devote their personal time to this, in the name of science and Mars. <br><br>  Now materials have accumulated enough to open a full-fledged site. <br>  Without further ado, welcome to Mars: <a href="http://www.uahirise.org/ru/">www.uahirise.org/ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/736/953/247/7369532478998f99742a1489c2af984e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is the first ever NASA site in Russian.  In fairness, I must say that there are already similar sites in French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Icelandic, Greek and Arabic.  All of them are created under the <a href="http://www.uahirise.org/epo/hitranslate/participate.php">NASA HiTranslate</a> program.

      It so happened that the HiRise team for a long time did not have the opportunity to search for disinterested translators in Russia.  Therefore, many countries have overtaken ours.  Then, <a href="https://vk.com/curiosity_live">we</a> came to the HiRise team and said: ‚ÄúWe seem to have found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175827/">Mars-3</a> .  Take a picture, please, again that point on the surface of Mars. ‚Äù  They said: ‚ÄúNo problem ... By the way, you have no familiar translators, who could russify the HiRise site?‚Äù <br>  The cry of the search for volunteers was cast about six months ago, and now, the worthy result of their work is in front of us. <br><br>  For example, here are some articles from Tumblr: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dce/66f/68d/dce66f68d5447603a212940960dda85e.jpg"><br><br>  Bright material at the bottom of one of the valleys of the Night Maze <br><br>  In many valleys (or rounded depressions) of the Labyrinth of the Night, light, sometimes layered material is found.  The Night's Labyrinth is located at the western, far end of the vast system of canyons - Dolin Mariner.  To the west of the Maze itself are the volcanoes of the province of Farsida. <br><br>  This picture of HiRISE gives us an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe light material that is found in large numbers at the bottom of the valleys of the Night Maze.  The spectral data from the CRISM instrument installed onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft indicates that the light material is hydrated (i.e. contains water).  Hydrated material could have formed after water had entered the hollows, or after ice melted at the bottom of the valley as a result of volcanic activity. <br><br>  Earlier images of the same area were combined with a new image to create an anaglyph image ( <a href="">ANAGLYPH</a> ).  In this form, the image will allow scientists to understand the relationship between light material and dark rocks that form the bottom of the valleys. <br><br>  Translation: Leven Ivan <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0b0/4a1/91d/0b04a191d4c052494b7a9a5eb182e1cd.jpg"><br><br>  Rising dunes in the mountains of the Nereid <br><br>  The photo shows the southern part of the cluster of dunes in the Nereid Mountains, where the change in the position of the dunes and surface ripples is monitored. <br><br>  Many of the dunes in this photo are steep slopes with their sloping sides to the south.  The northern orientation of steep slopes indicates their formation as a result of winds blowing in the same north direction.  Similar ‚Äúascending dunes‚Äù were also found in other areas of Mars, for example, in the Mariner Valley, and in this case indicate rather strong southern winds. <br><br>  An enlarged photo shows one of these leeward slopes.  In addition, some hollows from landslides are visible, which are explained by the precipitation of sand from the slopes.  Subsequently, the wind again moved part of this sand and formed ascending ripples in the depressions.  These and other photos of HiRISE show the dynamic interaction between wind and gravity - only two of the many processes that occur daily on Mars. <br><br>  Translation: Anton Horyukov <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/193/301/b16/193301b16b48200d2d79159a05cea790.jpg"><br><br>  What it is? <br><br>  Look carefully at the image, what do you see?  Mountain ridges and hills protruding above the surface, evenly covered with dark spots.  Thanks to the high resolution color image, you can see the sweating surface and light halos surrounding some dark spots. <br><br>  Give up?  These are sand dunes with a cap of frozen carbon dioxide during late winter on Mars, when carbon dioxide sublimation begins (the transition from a solid state to a gaseous state, bypassing the liquid state).  Be that as it may, the sublimation mechanism is rather complex and manifests itself in the form of spots or channels, alluvial alluvial fans, etc.  To date, there are three snapshots of this area in different periods (see pictures ESP_020276_1180, ESP_019854_1180, and ESP_019287_1180). <br><br>  The landscape of our image is very similar to the landscape image ESP_019854_1180, which was made exactly one Martian a year ago, at the same time of the year.  However, the picture presented in the other two pictures is different.  Often, by observing one site year after year at the same time, one can see significant changes.  This is comparable only with the annual change of seasons on Earth. <br><br>  Translator: Vadim Mustafin <br><br>  The work in the HiTranslate project is continuing; today 96 entries have been translated, i.e.  The material is still an immense amount.  If you want to participate, you can contact the official <a href="http://hitranslate%40uahirise.org/">mail</a> and offer assistance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189374/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189374/</a></p>
