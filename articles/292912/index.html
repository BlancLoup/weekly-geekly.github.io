  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not scary Minusinsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every year, Yandex is worried about the SEO community with innovations in search results, forcing the brain of analysts to work more actively.  Already toughened the quality assessment of the reference mass, focusing on behavioral factors.  An attempt to make search results more natural was a long time ago, but Yandex began taking active actions when it announced contactless ranking on December 5, 2013. <br><br>  As an experiment, this happened in Moscow and only for commercial requests.  The first stage was launched on March 14, 2014, and this algorithm affected only the themes ‚ÄúTourism‚Äù, ‚ÄúReal Estate‚Äù and ‚ÄúElectronics and Home Appliances‚Äù.  It became a bell that the jokes were over and now everything is grown-up.  For those who did not understand the seriousness of Yandex‚Äôs intention, it was summer 2014, when the search query classifier changed, the list of commercial queries was expanded, where the reference weight was turned off and the text ranking formula was changed again by commercial queries. <br><br>  With this innovation, top companies have given up their positions to beginners.  And only everyone learned to live in a new world order, as Yandex announced and introduced the Minusinsk algorithm. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What influenced Minusinsk?

      Search results have been updated again, the sites of top companies have regained their positions, but this turned out not for long.  The algorithm takes into account the activity of working with the site, is able to distinguish between natural links and purchased ones.  But many have already spoken about this. <br><br>  In our Internet marketing company, analysts noticed that when working with sites in the TOP-10, a significant number of large well-known directory sites appeared, such as Puls prices, TIU.ru, etc.  The ratio of directory sites and online stores with a catalog structure was 8 to 2. Then it was hypothesized that the new algorithm ranks better sites that have a catalog structure. <br><br>  The hypothesis required confirmation.  At that time, 2 projects of online stores just came to work - materials for repair and equipment for metal working.  The situation was such that, after the work on internal optimization and two updates of Yandex, the position of customers in the search engine remained almost unchanged.  We considered the reference mass for sites dangerous and outdated in current conditions, so we decided to take the path of the greatest and long-term effectiveness. <br><br>  Since the sites have catalogs with a wide range of products, it was decided to try to rework the structure of the site according to the hypothesis put forward - they changed the structure of the site under the catalog.  The pilot project was the site of metalworking equipment.  Having coordinated with the client all the changes, we set to work, which took us about a week to complete (processing, tuning, integration, etc.). <br><br>  After the site was indexed by search engines - positions began to grow upwards.  The site is promoted by 25 key requests, not counting tails, of which there are more than a hundred.  Now is the third month of withdrawal of requests in the TOP-10 and the following results were received: TOP-1 - 5 requests, TOP-3 - 7 requests, TOP-50 - 17 requests, which are about to catch up and also take positions in the TOP-10 .  At the same time, I would like to add that we did not purchase a reference mass for website promotion. <br><br>  Links to the site will lead in the future, but it will be a different story, completely unrelated to the conclusion of the site in the TOP-10, but with the information policy of the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292912/</a></p>
