We do not just eat to survive - in the process we communicate with people, build relationships, discuss ideas, spend time with family, try new things and much more.  Evernote could not ignore such an important part of our lives. <br><br>  Let me introduce <b>Evernote Food</b> - an application that is already available for iPhone owners to download. <br><br>  Evernote Food will allow you to save all the sensations, thoughts, impressions and memories associated with food. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/evernote-food/id481893372%3Fmt%3D8">Download Evernote Food on the App Store &gt;&gt;</a></b>

This is a basic concept around which memories are built.  Lunch includes a caption, photographs, their names, place information, notes and tags.  When you add photos to lunch, the interface layout resembles the shape of the letter ‚ÄúT‚Äù: horizontally you can flip through the photos, and the corresponding information will be displayed in the vertical part. <br><br>  <b>Related Notes</b> <br>  At the bottom of the screen, the app shows all notes related to your meal intake that you have in Evernote.  These can be notes created at the same time or containing keywords related to the place where you had dinner.  These can be the faces of people you met with and added information about them to Evernote or to another new <b>Evernote Hello</b> application. <br><br><h3>  Sharing </h3><br>  As with Evernote, we focus on helping you save and quickly find your memories afterwards.  Memories of dinners often concern other people, so our application has been integrated with Facebook, Twitter and the ability to share information via email.  When you open access to information about a particular dinner, your friends will be able to see all your photos, recordings and impressions associated with it. <br><br><h3>  Unlimited possibilities </h3><br>  Below we have outlined several options for using Evernote Food. <br><br>  <b>A party</b> <br>  Suppose you decide to have dinner with friends.  Launch Evernote Food when you go to a restaurant or cafe and take a photo of the setting.  Find this place on the Places screen.  Then take photos of all the dishes, your friends, wine and everything else you want to remember.  Caption each photo by clicking on the picture.  Sketch a couple of general notes and thoughts that came to you during the dinner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/156/36c/8d6/15636c8d60005a922113049223257433.png"><br><br>  <b>Family dinners</b> <br>  When you are going at the table as a big family or visiting relatives for the holidays, you always want to remember this.  Use Evernote Food to record the process of cooking or take notes on the trail of table talk. <br><br>  <b>Recipe creation</b> <br>  Hone the recipes of new wonderful dishes take time.  Evernote Food makes this process much easier.  Create a new entry (meal) and title it with the name of the dish you are working on.  Do not forget to take photos at each stage of preparation, accompanied by the necessary instructions.  In the notes section you can add more information about the dish, including tips and ideas. <br><br>  <b>Travels</b> <br>  Many people like to try foreign cuisine while traveling.  Use Evernote Food to remember all your bold experiences during the holidays.  In the headlines you can specify the names of places, then take pictures of the situation, all the dishes and other things that you want to remember. <br><br>  <b>Diet</b> <br>  Evernote Food can be used as a simple tool to control your daily meals.  Create entries every day.  Photograph dishes and write down their names, indicate the ingredients and calorie content and enter additional information in the notes section. <br><br><h3>  Everything syncs with Evernote </h3><br>  All information in Evernote Food is synchronized with Evernote, and you can view it from any device or computer.  These notes are beautifully displayed in Evernote, and can be viewed from all your devices. <br><br>  For now, notes created in Evernote Food are read-only in Evernote.  If you want to make a change, simply open Evernote Food. <br><br><h3>  Enjoy your meal! </h3><br>  We are pleased to present this application, in part because we like to eat at Evernote, but also because this program seems very useful to us.  Would be grateful if you try Evernote Food and tell about your impressions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134192/</a></p>
