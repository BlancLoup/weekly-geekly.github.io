  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Personality vector</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Often you want to understand - what is a person, a person.  Often it is necessary to evaluate people for some specific parameters and in general.  With specific parameters, everything is clear, but what is a person in general?  How can it be characterized?  Than?  Intelligence?  This is not an adequate indicator.  Just because the term is too ambiguous.  The point, of course, is not in the term, but in the characteristic itself.  Position, appearance, logic and quick thinking?  All of this is particular (the very specific parameters), each of which, individually, will say nothing about the others and cannot be taken as the basis for the integral characteristic of the personality.  Reasoning on this topic (not without the help of other people) a certain model was born that can help in this matter. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Consider a regular plane with two axes and a point.  A point is a man.  The horizontal axis is time.  Vertical - the level of [development] of a person.  The level of human development - the level of personality - is some relative approximation, which tells us that the gopnik, whose meaning in life is fighting, beer and sunflower is lower than, for example, an entrepreneur who has a small but profitable business (clearly, that entrepreneurs with the level of Gopnik‚Äôs development also happen, but this is not about those).  I repeat that this is a relative approximation, not more. In this model, it plays a secondary role.

      From the point, the current position of the person, draw a vector - the direction in which he moves.  Time flows inexorably, so the component along the horizontal axis will always be.  What about the vertical?  Human vector at an angle to the horizon - a person develops?  Is his vector constant - is a person improving <b>continuously</b> ? <br><br>  We divide people into two types - those who develop <b>constantly</b> (the value of the constant vertical component is not as important as the very fact of its presence) and all the rest.  Let's call the first type - <i>dynamic</i> , the second - <i>static</i> .  In the first type, the vector always has a positive component along the vertical axis, and in the second, as it will.  This is a definite assessment that can be applied to those around us. <br><br>  What can such an assessment of a person give us?  I'll try to explain. <br><br>  It is not easy to evaluate a person as a whole, due to a wide variety of comparison criteria and the difficulty of determining which of them is more important (knowledge or speed of thinking, appearance or inner world, etc.).  The proposed assessment does not determine the level of personal development at any particular moment.  It shows the nature of changes in this level over time.  It is more logical to compare people by specific characteristics (their values ‚Äã‚Äãat the time of comparison) after determining whether they are <i>dynamic</i> or not, because  <i>dynamic</i> have advantages over <i>static</i> .  It is obvious that people of the first type will sooner or later be higher in terms of development than people of the second type, regardless of the initial conditions.  What type a person belongs to is more important than a set of its specific characteristics.  The fact of constant work on oneself says a lot about a person. <br><br>  This model, like any other, is prone to have flaws.  I want to highlight the most significant, in my opinion. <br><br>  1. The level of personality.  The linear scale certainly cannot express the diversity of human development.  It is necessary to understand this approximation as widely as possible.  It is not only about some professional knowledge, but also about the development of oneself as an individual.  The latter, in my opinion, is more important than the first.  Psychology defines the development of personality as the <i>constant expansion of its capabilities and the formation of new needs</i> .  There is a nuance here: making your way through life, gnawing your way ‚Äúto the top‚Äù is not a development.  To develop such a skill, if it was not there before - development. <br><br>  However, you can not try to embrace the person as a whole, but consider a specific characteristic.  In particular, the model also works fine (for example: if there is a choice between two specialists, the first of whom has more complete knowledge in the subject area, but does not develop them, but uses them to make money, and the second is less qualified, but is constantly being improved, then my choice will be the second). <br><br>  2. The vector is not constant.  There may be objective reasons that are not immediately visible from the side, which keep it in a horizontal position.  For a woman, for example, this can be (but not necessarily be) the birth of a child, for a man - a cash deficit and the need to earn.  There are also life crises and just a desire to be lazy.  All this leaves an imprint on the direction of motion.  Therefore, the fact that at the moment a person moves horizontally is not enough to say that he will always move like that. <br><br>  3. Development can be not only by inner desire, but also forced.  In any case, a person will be at least a little bit, but develop during life on the onset of various life stages (study, independence, relationships, work, family, children, etc.).  However, in periods of stability many do nothing and do not grow.  A person who receives new professional knowledge is undoubtedly developing.  Is this development a desire "from the heart" or is he just settling into a new job and pulling up to stay?  What will be its vector when the forcing component disappears?  It is also relevant for women who are eager to fight in order to feed their families. <br><br>  4. All develop to a certain time.  I'm talking about people in the period of maturation.  Someone is faster, someone is slower, but everything is developing.  Their vector always has a positive vertical component.  Some stop early, some later, and some never.  Thus, the fact that a person is developing now does not guarantee that he will always do this.  Maybe time will pass, a person looks back, he will like who he is and he will stop.  Of course, in the majority, we are talking about people between the ages of 20 and 30. Those who are 20 years old and less are still in the process of growing up and they are developing ‚Äúby default‚Äù, and those who develop after 30 will probably do it always. <br><br>  A number of voiced deficiencies of the model concern one thing - the difficulty in determining whether a person belongs to the category of <i>dynamic</i> people.  People for whom the process of continuous development is an obligatory norm of life.  It is clear that some people can be attributed to this category without any doubt.  But for a number of reasons, there are not so many people in the world around.  In discussions of this question, one criterion was born that simplifies the task a little: the presence of a constant desire to develop (signs of the presence of this criterion: just a desire to develop, aversion of routine, monotony, swamp as the norm of life, ‚Äúawl in the ass‚Äù).  A person may not be able to develop in his current life situation for a number of reasons, but the presence of ‚ÄúShila‚Äù may make it clear how he will behave when the situation changes. <br><br>  Our life is connected with a lot of people.  Some of them have a strong influence on her.  We cannot choose one of these people (relatives), but we can (others). <br><br>  If you are a specialist and choose a company (work) with which you would like to tie your fate for several years - look at the manager.  <i>Dynamic</i> he?  The answer to this question can give answers to many others.  Young companies tend to develop, but not all of them, having achieved a certain profit, go further in their development.  All companies are characterized by the presence of various kinds of internal problems, but some of these companies solve their problems, while others turn into a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hr/83305/">swamp</a> .  Some are overwhelmed by competitors, while others are ahead of competitors.  In many ways, the fate of the company determines the head.  And the fact is <i>dynamic</i> or not. <br><br>  If you are a manager, look at your employees who occupy key places.  Will these people meet your expectations and the level of your company in a year, two, five?  An unequivocal answer is impossible, but the direction of their personality vector may provide a substantial basis for a forecast.  Will they be able to keep up with rapidly developing technologies?  Are they able to develop and lead one of the directions in the future?  Will they be able to understand the crisis (God forbid) and not run away, having turned the tail, sensing danger? <br><br>  If you have one <i>static</i> team and you are thinking about changing the situation, also think about yourself - whether you can manage <i>dynamic ones</i> ? <br><br>  Getting involved with a friend, a colleague in a joint venture - a business, a startup, compare the directions of your vectors.  In most cases, in order to work on a joint business to bring pleasure, both you and your partner need you to be on the same level of development as a person.  By comparing vectors you can roughly imagine how long your partnership will be possible.  You will be able to understand, for example, that having put the matter on its feet, you will encounter a classical contradiction - when one of the partners wants to skim the cream and live for pleasure, while the second wants to invest the money earned in development.  Perhaps someone of you will go into the gap in their development and the other will no longer be interested in him as a partner.  Do not flatter yourself in these arguments.  :) <br><br>  With great care, apply this model in relation to friends and relatives.  Do not make hasty conclusions, but think better - than they are dear to you?  What do you appreciate in them?  Is it really critical for you to be with them on the same level throughout life? .. Relations with people close to you are more complicated than with superiors, colleagues and subordinates.  There are nuances that may have greater significance than the vector of personality.  It is worth considering. <br><br>  First of all, of course, it is worth looking at yourself.  And do not fool yourself in your thoughts.  List yourself as clearly as possible - what, how and why have you grown lately.  If it is clear that nothing, then you need to drop everything else and think hard on this issue.  Everything else is nonsense, if you do not have this. Do not forget - narrow professional skills are not the main thing.  And if you have the idea that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need it,‚Äù believe me, you are mistaken.  Need to.  Everybody.  To each. <br><br>  With these considerations, I tried to convey the importance, even the necessity of constant self-development, talked about a model with which people can be assessed from this point of view and showed possible ways to apply this model.  If in the process of reading you discovered something new or an article made you think, this is good.  If all of this for you - an obvious and well-known fact - is excellent. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will quote from an <a href="http://azps.ru/articles/cmmn/cmmn83.html">article on personality psychology</a> : <br><br>  <i>The individual is <b>normally</b> in a state of continuous development, self-improvement and self-realization, constantly discovering new horizons for himself on his human path, is experiencing the ‚Äújoy of tomorrow‚Äù, and is searching for ways to update his abilities.</i>  <i>In difficult conditions - tolerant, capable of adequate action.</i> <br><br>  ps I would be grateful for ideas of more appropriate names for types.  The terms " <i>dynamic</i> " and " <i>static</i> " - very dry, and not enough to reveal the essence of the issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84179/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84179/</a></p>
