It shows the link to the personal account and the history of all notifications. <br><br>  Also now the type has changed.  There was an "app", and now it's an "add-on."  Unfortunately, it is not possible to upgrade from application to add-on.  Therefore, we had to fill it again.  Will have to be updated manually.  We will briefly describe how the supplement differs from the application, and why we had to switch.

And we decided to donate at least 100 thousand notifications every month for each channel. <br><br>  More under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  What is different from the addition of the application </h1><br>  To begin with, the application has an icon in the list of applications.  By clicking the window opens your application.  In your manifest will be: <br><pre>  "app": {
     "background": {
       "scripts": ["background.js"]
     }
   },
</pre><br>  To make an addition from an application, you just need to remove the app section, move the backgroud to a higher level and add for example ‚Äúbrowser_action‚Äù - the same button on the browser panel. <br><br>  But in this case, Chrome will not allow you to update the application, you will have to create a new one. <br><br><h4>  Why did we even do this? </h4><br>  We used a hack to open links from notifications - a time window with the size of 1 pixel was opened, and a link in a new tab opened from it.  The fact is that if you open a link directly, then in the case of HTTPS links, chrome fell. <br><br>  In the case of the hack, we had a flickering window on the screen + some opening delay.  And on OSX, this time window was not closed for some reason at all.  And also, we needed to expand the functionality, with the same history panel. <br><br>  The solution to the problem was to use the ‚Äútab‚Äù permission, but it works only with add-ons and is not available to extensions.  Through it, you can directly create a new window (tab), with the link we need.  Additionally, you can, for example, post the address of the current tab as a notification somewhere.  It will be a small analogue of services for sending addresses to smartphones, but you can post directly to the channel, to your entire audience. <br><br><h1>  What's new in addition? </h1><br><ul><li>  When opening links does not flicker.  window </li><li>  Icon in the panel with history and the button to go to your personal account </li><li>  Notification time <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb2/a70/268/cb2a70268e564a138f4d3f83d89a2f81.png"><br><br>  That is, turning on the computer in the morning, you can see which, for example, logs were at what time. <br></li></ul><br><h1>  History categories </h1><br>  We made the division of history into categories.  This allows you to select a specific channel by which you want to view notifications.  It should be borne in mind that this is not the usual channel tape.  These are exactly the notifications that went through your selected filters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/724/d41/64d/724d4164d75e4a21b51d6951caf35300.png" width="500"><br><br>  For example, you can select the DocSur channel - and see the fluffs that have passed through it.  Notice, it's all with the filters that I chose for myself, among them: notifications, android, google <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32d/fd2/217/32dfd22175d44867a20f7196b0baa767.png" width="500"><br><br>  This allows you to use pushall as a reader with a predefined filter.  That is, you receive important notifications, those that are important to read immediately - you click and read, the rest can be brushed away and read by selecting them from the story. <br><br><h1>  Search </h1><br>  We did an instant search by channel and alert history.  Through the channels it works from the single character entered, you can enter several words.  According to the history of alerts, the search works by one keyword starting from the three characters entered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/871/92e/46d/87192e46d4d14d42880ef0177cbec369.png" width="500"><br><br><h1>  100 thousand notifications for free every month </h1><br>  We still have no paid clients, and we decided to increase the previously promised 5000 notifications per month to 100 thousand notifications, at a minimum.  If we like your channel, we can give you even more notifications for free. <br><br>  This action will be assigned to all new and existing channels, that is, even after it ends.  all previously created channels will be able to send all as many notifications. <br><br><h1>  Several analytical articles from us on Spark </h1><br>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/12028/pochemu-web-push-v-chistom-vide-zlo-razbiraemsya-v-voprose">Why is a pure web push evil?</a>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/12028/pochemu-web-push-v-chistom-vide-zlo-razbiraemsya-v-voprose">We understand the question</a> <br>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/12145/telegram-boti-ne-vse-tak-raduzhno-kak-kazhetsya-poterya-okolo-90-auditorii">Telegram bots?</a>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/12145/telegram-boti-ne-vse-tak-raduzhno-kak-kazhetsya-poterya-okolo-90-auditorii">Not everything is as rosy as it seems.</a>  <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/pushall/blog/12145/telegram-boti-ne-vse-tak-raduzhno-kak-kazhetsya-poterya-okolo-90-auditorii">Loss of about 90% of the audience</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268671/</a></p>
