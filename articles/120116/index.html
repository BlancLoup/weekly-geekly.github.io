  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iPad and innovations in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our country, we probably often periodically resent any of the reasons.  Here and the blog came just by the way. <br>  I want to tell you an entertaining story that happened most recently in the first science city of Obninsk, related to innovation and the development of an application for the iPad.  From these words, perhaps, all of us are already a little nauseated, but I think that the story is quite relevant. <br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/benefi/2711533330/" title="_MG_9789 by benefilord, on Flickr"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfd/2f9/622/cfd2f96228216df9b1a4cf3a5c773771.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="_MG_9789"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br>  On May 19-20, the 2nd Obninsk Innovation Forum was held in Obninsk, where, as you understand, they discussed how to save our country with the help of those innovations.  Prior to this, in April, the city administration decided to conduct a request for quotations for the development of " <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/public/action/orders/info/common_info/show%3FnotificationId%3D560650">PROMO applications for Apple iPad</a> ."  On the 21st of April an order was placed.  This is true, we learned a little later. <br><br><h4>  To whom? </h4><br>  It all started with the fact that on April 22 the designer of the Obninsk company approached me with a request to give some photos of the city of Obninsk.  I gave links and asked why they?  The designer replied that they were saying for some iPad application about Obninsk, which they do.  Having rocked up on business, I somehow managed to forget about this conversation.  A few days passed and one of my friends gave a link to the order of the administration, which I cited above, with the question: 180 thousand - is this not a lot of application?  I looked at that order, I saw that it was closing on April 28th and it seems that the company that appeals to me is already working on it.  The city is small and we quickly found out that it was already decided who would do the work and should not even be thrust.  Well, these are just rumors that it is natural to prove almost impossible. <br><br><h4>  How? </h4><br>  We decided to get acquainted with the technical specifications and submit an application for the execution of works.  But of course it was not so easy.  For the execution of all the work 14 working days were allotted (well, that would be just in time for that very forum).  For these days it was necessary to create an application and place it in the AppStore and also ‚Äú9.  A PROMO application must be coordinated with Apple Inc.  ‚ÄúWe all know that Apple makes no guarantees on how long it will consider it and whether it will accept it at all.  The presence of a third party in the terms of reference was certainly embarrassing.  We started calling the administration and trying to find out if this was possible, but we were told that it was only their business to check the order for compliance with the 94th procurement law.  And he seems to be consistent.  After a while, I had a clear idea that the technical task was written by the final contractor.  There were only a few hours before the order was closed and we decided not to submit the application, because we thought that it was almost impossible to do the work, place the application and coordinate it with Apple during these periods (this kind of implies the existence of some kind of papers that need to come from California ).

      <br>
      As a result, the order was won by Black Sun LLC in the amount of 100,000. The second application was from Kronos LLC for 150,000. All honestly - the order was placed 4 days before closing, two applications were submitted. <br><br><h4>  The triumph of innovation </h4><br>  On the 14th of May the application appeared in the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/id435736922%3Fmt%3D8">AppStore</a> , it was posted by LLC Cronos.  And actually presented at the Obninsk Innovation Forum.  The administration is happy, those few visitors to the forum who had an iPad were also probably happy. <br><br>  A little later, the developer from Kronos LLC decided to <a href="http://vobninske.ru/blog/editorial/5098.html">talk</a> about how the application was made and dispel the baseless myth that the competition is corrupt. <br><br>  In the comments to the story, I decided to ask also about where the site from which the images are downloaded and which is listed in the ToR.  I was answered: ‚ÄúThis second part is simply not there - nothing is downloaded from the Internet. <br>  In the process of execution, it was decided that this was not necessary for the initial launch, since even a sufficient number of photographs were not enough. ‚ÄùThat is,  here and so just thrown out the item from TZ!  It is possible that someone because of this point decided that he would not have time to complete the work. <br><br>  Everything!  There was no limit to my indignation! <br><br><h4>  What are the results </h4><br>  Or maybe we still need iPad apps for each city?  And I'm just a conservative person and I do not understand anything. <br>  I would also like to contact you in order to get acquainted with the technical task and check whether the work performed corresponds to the stated requirements.  It would be even better to make an expert opinion if inconsistencies are found. <br><br>  Direct <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/pgz/documentdownload%3FdocumentId%3D9128518">link</a> to TK. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120116/</a></p>
