  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OpenMPT program that surprised me</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I dabbled in track music a little ten years ago. <br>  And there was a desire to try to make not even music, but simply, let's say, sound design to the video. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  I know, of course, that there are professional programs for creating sound, they require unreasonable professional knowledge, a very powerful processor, and besides, for the most part they cost from a few hundred dollars and up. <br>  But I‚Äôm not a professional sound engineer and I‚Äôm not going to make money on it, and besides, I‚Äôm not spending my time learning the complex process of creating audio recordings in any mega-product from my hand. <br>  It seemed to me that for a small musical hooliganism a tracker with a dozen samples would be enough for my eyes.  And I decided to look for something on the trackers. <br>  It turned out that in recent years, trackers have been actively developing and now they are completely professional tools for sound processing. <br>  The two most advanced <b>trackers Renoise</b> and <b>Mad Tracker are</b> commercial products that are successfully used to create audio products, and I will not write about them. <br>  But <b>Mod Plag Tracker</b> (or <b>OpenMPT</b> ) is a program that is made by amateurs for amateurs. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6c/6a3/aa6/b6c6a3aa6bd4dae55c8e836b6d1f5873.png"><br>  But here‚Äôs what amateurs got aroused by some amazement - it turned out a program for creating music that is not inferior to professional sequencers: <br>  1. Supports midi format and external midi devices. <br>  2. No limit on the number of tracks. <br>  3. DirectX effects are supported. <br>  4. Supported software synthesizers and effects - VST <br>  5. Audio output in studio quality to disk (192kHz quad). <br>  6. Compatibility with old formats of popular trackers. <br>  Somehow it all works very well even on a netbook with a completely non-fast processor and everything is completely visual and simple. The second thought that visited my head while examining this miracle is the ability to record musical fragments with notes using ordinary computer keys - the perfect notebook a book (actually for this reason it is called a tracker) for musicians. And then you can make an export in the midi and a musical printout if you need it badly. <br>  And so, in half an hour, I tapped on a computer keyboard a few bars in the spirit of Radio Mali. <br>  <a href="http://prostopleer.com/tracks/5156634DYHt">To listen</a> <br><br><h4>  A few words about the synthesizers. </h4><br>  The Steinberg company at one time proposed a mechanism for creating virtual synthesizers (Virtual Synthesis Technology plugins), which can be included as components in sequencers.  Over the past several different people and companies have written hundreds of virtual synthesizers. <br>  Many of them are free.  What does this mean?  If you want Roland, Korg or some other exotic instrument to sound, you don‚Äôt need a piece of hardware, just install the plugin. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/417/b6f/3fa/417b6f3fa36a6320e56f4504b5d9521e.png"><br>  A computer with a midi keyboard turns into a universal tool, limited only by the budget for the software.  What else surprised me was the number of synthesizers under free licenses. They are very different in quality. <br><br><h4>  Short review of VST synthesizers </h4><br>  Estimates are rather subjective, but can help the interested reader save time.

      <b>AviliaFree</b> - fantasy set of sounds in non-European temperament.  Not a single melodic preset. <br>  <b>Arppe2600va</b> - classic synthesizer.  3 wave generators, 80 presets.  Configured by ‚Äúwinding the wires into the terminals‚Äù.  For nostalgic masochists. <br>  <b>Augur is a</b> blunt synth with a flat sound. <br>  <b>B8 Organ is a</b> simple organ, a flat sound, a dozen presets. <br>  <b>dmihammer</b> - marimba, vibraphone, woodblock flexible setup <br>  <b>gtg_ep 2008</b> -el.piano with a bold sound. Presets and convenient configuration <br>  <b>Cheeze Machine</b> - synth. Violin, flute.  Simple stereo sound.  5 presets. Convenient setting. <br>  <b>dco-6</b> is a clone of the model Roland Juno 6. Characteristic sound of disco recordings of the 80s. <br>  <b>dirty mono</b> - a poor set of sharp presets. Mono. <br>  <b>e-piano</b> - Cheap Electric <b>Piano</b> Emulator.  The sound is quite tolerable.  The simplest settings. <br>  <b>eff-xx-two</b> - Sounds of space ships.  Pretty vile. But a lot. <br>  <b>gmsynth</b> is a general midi EMU sample set.  Typical midi sound.  Rather boring.  You can adjust a little (portamento, attack, etc.). <br>  <b>gtg 44 s</b> - a very bright and recognizable sound. A bright set of presets for electronic music. <br>  <b>gtg strings synthesizer</b> - bluff electronic violins.  Rough. <br>  <b>ivf combo organ</b> - transistor electrical <b>agencies</b> .  Flat retro sound. <br>  <b>KX-SYNTH-X16</b> -127 Presets. Muga Killer. Bright Electronic Sound and Effects.  5 frequency generators. <br>  <b>lpx-s1</b> - Another minimogoobrazny sint.12 presets.  Very visual generator control. <br>  <b>megadirty</b> - <b>poor</b> set of sharp presets.  Stereo. <br>  <b>MininmogueVA</b> - classic.  Minimug in person. <br>  <b>mrtramp</b> - toy piano with a nasty sound. Mono <br>  <b>gtg_ms2008</b> is a cross between a miniature and a june.  Very beautiful and concrete sound. <br>  <b>evm_occam</b> - soft multi-layered sound.  Psychedelic soft sound. Two channels with different presets superimposed and very good stereo sound. <br>  <b>phyzmod</b> is a technotronic noise generator.  The horror of the transformer box. <br>  <b>pling</b> - the generator of sharp sounds.  Poorly at all. <br>  <b>VOPM</b> - supposedly a synthesizer.  There are no presets.  How to extract sound from it is unclear. <br>  <b>vstjuno6</b> -Roland Juno 6. It turns out incredibly. Curved implementation of the envelope. <br>  <b>richman</b> is a technotronic noise generator.  Megauzas from the transformer booth. <br>  <b>Superwave Stylophone is an</b> emulator of some ancient wretched transistor organ. <br><br>  Drums <br>  <b>retromine_v01</b> is a virtual analog drum synthesizer.  It is difficult to understand how drums are attached to the keys.  The sound is pretty simple. <br>  <b>Tromine_get and trominez v1</b> 1 - non-standard keys for tools. It is <b>difficult</b> to understand where what tool. <br>  <b>TS 808</b> - percussion synthesizer Nothing special, but quite decent. Convenient control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135237/</a></p>
