  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most nightmarish profession in science</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scientific research often led scientists to take risks.  The example of doctors who deliberately infected themselves with dangerous diseases is an example of how to fix their symptoms and experience a new method of treatment.  Sometimes such experiments ended in the death of a researcher. <br><br>  American physicist William Widd Weilliam Weed interviewed more than a thousand scientists and based on their opinions made a list of the most unpleasant specializations in the field of science. <br><br>  1. Developer of new fuels <br>  Humanity cannot live without energy.  However, the development of new fuels is an extremely long and laborious process.  For example, the Livermore National Laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, has been conducting nuclear fuel research for 50 years, which could theoretically be used to create automobile engines.  Scientists suggest that their research will have to continue for at least 20 years.  They compare themselves with the builders of medieval cathedrals, when the walls of the cathedral were erected by several generations of masons.

      2. Laboratory assistant analyzing stool patients with dysentery <br>  In the mid-1980s, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Technology studied microorganisms that cause dysentery.  To do this, they had to study tens of thousands of stool samples of patients with dysentery.  In the 1990s, they created the company Techlab, which manufactures equipment for conducting relevant tests and analyzes the samples that doctors send them.  Three dozen employees of this company are exclusively engaged in opening containers with feces, studying their color, smell, density, and conducting microbiological analysis. <br><br>  3. Laboratory assistant analyzing animal sperm <br>  Such studies are carried out in laboratories producing research in biology, zoology and genetics.  Despite the fact that laboratories are armed with special electronic devices, the simplest and most effective method of stimulating ejaculation is hand stimulation.  Some experiments require that the animal is not artificially put to sleep and not under the influence of anesthesia.  It is especially hard for scientists who are forced to work with large animals, such as elephants, bulls and lions. <br><br>  4. Mosquito Researcher <br>  Biologists and physicians who study methods of fighting malaria in real conditions are often forced, in the literal sense of the word, to pay for their knowledge with their own blood.  They expose parts of their body and offer them to anophelesam mosquitoes for breakfast, lunch or dinner. <br><br>  American researcher Helge ZielerHelge Zieler, who has been conducting similar studies in Brazil for two decades, estimated that she could catch (or swat) 17 mosquitoes in a field in the field.  Theoretically, a person can be replaced by animals, also attractive for mosquitoes - the pig is considered the best candidate.  But in many countries, influential animal rights organizations are protesting against such treatment of pigs. <br><br>  5. Microbiologist studying pathogenic microorganisms <br>  Samples of microorganisms that can cause a deadly disease are usually placed in a specially protected room, which researchers periodically have to enter.  It is especially dangerous when microorganisms can be in the form of air suspension. <br><br>  6. Tester of closed spaces <br>  Such a profession is absent in official documents, but nevertheless, such specialists exist.  They are, in particular, at NASA NASA - where space vehicles are manufactured and tested, in which astronauts must live and work.  Engineers and technicians who create spaceships check their tightness, security, comfort on themselves.  To do this, they have to live for weeks in the capsule of a spacecraft and lead almost the same way of life as astronauts in orbit.  By the way, the astronaut's profession was also recognized by scientists as one of the most unpleasant. <br><br>  7. Criminologist-sociologist <br>  Scientists studying criminology are often forced to conduct research in prisons.  As a rule, prisoners are interviewed by students.  Often, such interviews are conducted unguarded, as it is believed that the prisoner, seeing the jailer, behaves more constrained and does not go to openness.  The struggle for the purity of a scientific experiment leads to the fact that many interviewers become victims of rapists right in the prison cell. <br><br>  8. Skeleton Cleaner <br>  Scientists and taxidermists often work with the bones and skeletons of animals, which are previously required to be cleansed of the remnants of flesh and blood.  To do this, use either the method of digestion of bones, or the remains of an animal are taken out into the yard, where they are engaged in insects.  In both cases, scientists are forced to endure an intolerable smell. <br><br>  9. Popularizer of the metric system <br>  In the United States, the traditional British system of measures and weights is adopted, using miles, feet, pounds, Fahrenheit and pints, and not meters, kilometers, kilograms, liters and Celsius.  In 1975, in the United States, it was decided to gradually move to the generally accepted metric system in the world, for which the corresponding unit was created at the National Institute of Standards and Technology National Institute Standards and Technology.  The life of the employees of this division is extremely difficult - most of the time they spend on unpleasant conversations with representatives of corporations and officials, convincing them of the advantages of the metric system.  In fact, they are engaged in advertising or trade, and science is in oblivion.  It got to the point that at one of the press conferences, the head of this department could not name his weight in kilograms. <br><br>  10. A cryptozoologist <br>  Some rare species of birds and small animals can now be considered extinct.  But deleting them from the list of living zoologists does not raise a hand.  Therefore, for example, in Hawaii, a special unit of ornithologists has been operating, which has been trying to catch rare birds that have not been seen for at least two decades.  In search of birds, they go out daily and return daily with empty cages. <br><br>  11. Executioner of frogs <br>  Many medical and biological faculties and many laboratories conduct experiments on frogs.  In particular, their reflexes and features of the nervous system are studied.  The leaders of such laboratories are forced to take on the unpleasant mission - the constant execution of hundreds and thousands of experimental frogs. <br><br>  12. Ichthyologist - accountant <br>  One of the most nasty duties of an ichthyologist is to keep counting fish.  It is most difficult to do this during spawning: tens of thousands of fish pass before the eyes along the river and the scientist needs to calculate them and in the process determine their affiliation to a particular species.  After spawning, ichthyologists for a long time cannot get rid of the image of fish constantly jumping before their eyes. <br><br>  13. Taster smells <br>  People who evaluate the quality of the smell of the product work in perfumery, pharmaceutical and food companies.  Sometimes they are forced to make sacrifices ‚Äî not to wash for weeks, to check how a new sample of cologne or deodorant discourages an unpleasant smell. <br><br>  But there is no limit to scientific exploits.  American gastroenterologist Michael Levitt (Michael Levitt) is engaged in the analysis of gases, periodically released by a person after a meal.  Levitt developed a special device (a plastic bag tightly attached to the anus), with which he was able to save gases for a long time and create a scientific collection.  A courageous gastroenterologist feeds volunteers with various foods, collects the gases they emit into the bags and assesses samples for odor using their own nose.  Dr. Levitt claims that the analysis of the "gas component" in the near future will allow to diagnose many diseases of the stomach and intestines. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6192/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6192/</a></p>
