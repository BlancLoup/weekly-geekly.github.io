Only the New Year died down, the Day of All Lovers passed - and here, again: gifts to father, husband, brother, beloved, grandfather, friend ... However, why only girls?  We all buy gifts to relatives and friends of men, while trying to avoid the platitudes that have become memes. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/270896/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d65/409/504/d6540950462744a8a6c639d46bc550af.png" alt="image"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Men differentiation</font> </h2><br>  We in JD.ru also celebrate the Day of Defender of the Fatherland and know firsthand how difficult it is to please fastidious men of all ages.  In honor of the holiday, we prepared a small classification of men and picked up <a href="http://www.jd.ru/ru/act/mens_day.html">gifts</a> for them. <br><br>  Favorite category is <b>geeks</b> .  These are young, modern, advanced guys, well versed in technologies and knowing the price of stylish and functional things.  They choose convenience, utility and compliance with technical progress.  Sometimes it's hard to keep up with their preferences - after all, a new phone can be bought ‚Äúpurely to disassemble‚Äù, and the best gift will be the single-board computer Raspberry Pi.  For them, you can choose unusual innovations among smartphones, for example: a functional, beautiful glass phone IUNI N1, which we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/269174/">talked about</a> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9e/f66/d4d/d9ef66d4de0845ada93af0e3426fce5b.png" width="630" height="302"></div>

      or Highscreen Power Ice with a capacious battery, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/269782/">review of</a> which was already in our blog. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/830/fe6/04b/830fe604ba4245a18a2021ae82fb628d.jpg"></div><br>  A slim and powerful <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/269466/">Nubia My Prague</a> smartphone or a strong Huawei Honor 4C 16G, available on flash sale on February 21, is quite suitable for a business man. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/894/0c3/ec8/8940c3ec83ac4764acdf4fc729be4a72.png" width="496" height="396"></div><br>  The most expensive category for us is <b>dads</b> .  They are no longer so modern, but they are always happy to read the news on the Internet and play Angry Birds on a tablet or smartphone.  For many years they have spoiled us with their gifts and surprises - now it's our turn.  After all, how nice it will be to get your own tablet as a gift.  Or a simple and clear smartphone on Android, which is not afraid to drop or lose.  Such as Smartisan U1, the history and tactical and technical which can be <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/269590/">found in our blog</a> .  By the way, it is perfect for students - inexpensive, unusual and very functional. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/312/b68/e12/312b68e1239c40349b360c74076de083.jpg"></div><br>  Also, the pope will suit a set of hand tools that are useful both at home and in the country, and in the garage.  Believe me, there are no extra screwdrivers and attachments to them - they have the unpleasant property of losing, and at the most inappropriate moment.  On February 20, in the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/ru/act/mens_day.html">festive section of JD.ru</a> you can order such a set here: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cb6/5fd/b1a/cb65fdb1af914816b2e0223b18e4d424.jpg" width="450" height="450"></div><br>  The next no less favorite group is <s>our smaller</s> brothers, <b>still very small men</b> , brothers, and someone already has schoolchildren sons.  They courageously resist dishwashing, lessons and trips to school, endure enduring and gambling consoles, are ready to protect us from the flying snow and harmful chocolates.  Such courage cannot be ignored.  In addition to the already mentioned Smartisan U1, you can make your child happy with a new computer mouse or with stylish and interesting electronic watches, which will be available in the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/ru/act/mens_day.html">special section</a> on February 18 and 22. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/401/0ef/608/4010ef608e9548509ae02ba5c12360a7.png"></div><br>  The most emotional category is our friends: reliable and loyal, able to support and incapable of betraying.  We travel with them and conquer the mountains, raft on rafts and go to May Day picnics, get together in the evenings and kill nights for board games, men‚Äôs and various conversations.  We saw each other by any and are always happy to see smiling.  Therefore, February 23 is another reason for cute surprises.  Monopod will be a good and always necessary gift (it will be available on February 17), original and cool binoculars for smartphones (February 18), warm and useful touch gloves (discount will be February 21).  And yes, do not forget the most non-drinker and "behind the wheel", give a cigarette lighter splitter (flash-sale February 17). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/185/fc7/ebf/185fc7ebfca240388644def61356b6ba.png"><br><br>  Of course, the division is comic - each of our friends, relatives, and friends we know in a special way, no matter who it is, best friend or forever evil boss.  Guys appreciate male friendship, girls - reliability, parents just love for what we are.  Choose a gift, it turns out, quite simple.  It is enough just to think what the one whom you congratulate loves.  And there is always a solution.  Does grandpa like to cook omelet and bake pancakes for breakfast?  - Present a mixer (even there will be a flash action within the framework of the <a href="http://www.jd.ru/ru/act/mens_day.html">main sale of February</a> , namely February 20).  Does the younger brother play in a rock band and constantly wear hair?  - Give him a new hair dryer (February 16). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">And what else can you choose?</font> </h2><br>  Yes, almost anything.  From February 15 to 23, a brutal sale will be held on JD.ru, dedicated to February 23.  These days it will be possible to purchase a huge number of gadgets, devices, devices, tools and everything else with favorable coupons. <br><br>  JD.ru will feature products of various categories, some of which will be sold in flash-sales format daily from February 15 to February 23.  The quantity of goods at reduced prices as part of flash-sales is limited.

The most valuable prize, quadcopter, will be drawn between users who have made a one-time purchase worth more than $ 1000. <br><br>  You can turn on the snob and start arguing that the holiday is only for those who served.  This is wrong - in peacetime, too, there is something to protect and protect.  Yes, in the end, there is just another reason to say kind words and please with a pleasant surprise. <br><br>  By the way, men, while girls are looking for gifts, you can have time to choose and pre-order gadgets at a promotional price.  March 8 is not far off, and our girls are also those geeks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367927/</a></p>
