      But new experiments showed that two months after implantation, the lungs were still functioning, and the pigs had 100% oxygen saturation, which meant that all their red blood cells carried oxygen through the body. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dn/_b/4m/dn_b4m_afvnmkxetfkegwb6qjys.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Transplantation of bioengineered lungs to a pig in real time</i> <br><br>  The method will help solve <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/11749503/Organ-donation-crisis-threatens-hundreds-of-lives.html">the organ donation crisis</a> in the UK.  There are about 7,000 people on the waiting list, of whom 350 need lung transplantation due to cystic fibrosis and emphysema, but a quarter will die without getting the right organ. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur ultimate goal is to provide new opportunities to many people waiting for a transplant,‚Äù said Joan Nichols, professor of medicine at UTMB. <br><br>  "In the future, we will take human stem cells and grow an organ that will be their organ, without immune suppression, and it will function as their own lungs." <br><br>  Uakin Cortiella, director of the Laboratory of Tissue Engineering and Organ Regeneration at UTMB, said: ‚ÄúI would say that in five to ten years we will receive patients with bioengineered lungs.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/uj/ag/hsujag0qz8uzytwq8zbyvyfz8dy.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Joan Nichols and Uakin Cortiella in the lab</i> <br><br>  To grow organs in the laboratory, scientists took the lungs of pigs and deprived them of blood and cells using a special mixture, so that only the skeleton remained. <br><br>  They then created a cocktail of nutrients and pig lung cells that would receive the graft, and placed it in a reservoir with an organ skeleton. <br><br>  The lungs were raised for 30 days and implanted to four pigs that were kept alive for 10 hours, two weeks, one month, and two months to see how blood vessels develop. <br><br>  All pigs that received bioengineering lungs remained healthy. <br><br>  Two weeks after transplantation, bioengineering lungs formed a network of blood vessels necessary for the life of the lung.  And there was no pulmonary edema that could cause respiratory failure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/sa/xr/vfsaxr2a-jbdetmntbpo3zxjyw8.jpeg"><br><br>  <i>Bioengineering lungs on the eve of transplantation</i> <br><br>  Currently, donated lungs need to be adjusted according to the size of the patient‚Äôs lungs, and the recipient needs to take immunosuppressants to reduce the risk of organ rejection.  But if you sow the skeleton of an organ with its cells, there will be no immune response. <br><br>  In the near future, lung frames will be obtained from donated organs, but it is possible that in the future they will be printed on a bioprinter. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have grown a much better vascular network in the lungs, which was not there before,‚Äù said Dr. Cortiella. <br><br>  "We also moved from small animals to large ones with large lungs." <br><br>  ‚ÄúBioengineering lungs can be grown at any time, so a person does not need to wait until a good organ is found.  You can grow them both for a child and for an adult. ‚Äù <br><br>  The next step is to keep the pigs alive for as long as possible so that the bioengineering lungs are fully matured and taken root, but the researchers say they will begin testing in the terminally ill within the next five to ten years. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAll the work took 15 years of research, our team did an incredible, with minimal finances and a surprisingly dedicated group of people,‚Äù said Professor Nichols. <br><br>  Publication in the journal <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/10/452/eaao3926">Science Translational Medicine</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/419779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/419779/</a></p>
