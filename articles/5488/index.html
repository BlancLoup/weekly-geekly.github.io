      I am the president of <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> , a company I founded about a year and a half ago.  As a founder, I have to be torn between some kind of ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù problems ‚Äî daily concerns and the company's strategy ‚Äî developing plans, determining what the company will be in 6 months, in 3 years, etc. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  <b>A couple of years ago you said: ‚ÄúDo what you love, what you cannot do, and money will appear.‚Äù</b>  <b>Do you still love Wordpress?</b>  <b>If it's not a secret, are you satisfied with the income that he brings and related projects?</b> <br><br>  Definitely, I still love Wordpress - and the community that has evolved around it.  And Automattic works fine: the company is developing steadily. <br><br>  <b>Wordpress was your breakthrough.</b>  <b>What do you think, in what direction should young programmers work now to make such a breakthrough?</b> <br><br>  I think: the more people agree that a certain field is occupied and that a certain class of products is brought to perfection, the greater the chances for the emergence of certain new ideas and innovations.  Being a pioneer in some field is a great achievement, because you are not bound by any stereotypes, other people's opinions about how and what should work. <br><br>  If I started now, I would join the open source project.  I just can‚Äôt imagine how it is possible in another way to gain invaluable experience and knowledge from professionals who work with you in one project. <br><br>  <b>Have you received offers from large corporations?</b> <br><br>  You know, it was the case.  And I worked at CNET for a year, but now I work in an excellent startup where there is freedom for creativity, so I don‚Äôt know if I want to return to the ‚Äúcorporate world‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Do you remember the very first line of code written by you?</b> <br><br>  No, I definitely don‚Äôt remember, but there must have been at least three mistakes. <br><br>  <b>What are your favorite blogs?</b> <br><br>  Recently I enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.webworkerdaily.com/">www.webworkerdaily.com</a> , <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/">www.simonwillison.net</a> and <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/">www.horsepigcow.com</a> .  In general, the set of my "favorite" blogs varies throughout the day - depending on the mood.  And I subscribed to 345 blogs that I read regularly. <br><br>  <b>A few technical questions about wordpress.</b>  <b>First of all, when will native OpenID support appear in the engine?</b>  <b>How do you even rate OpenID?</b> <br><br>  I think OpenID has the potential to become a very cool thing.  Wordpress already has its support through plugins, Wordpress MU will also support it soon - with the help of the plugin we developed.  So far, I doubt the need for his native support: just not many people use it. <br><br>  <b>There is an opinion that Wordpress was created under the influence of Drupal.</b>  <b>It was a long time ago, and now Wordpress has become more popular.</b>  <b>If you were a newbie, which engine would you choose?</b> <br><br>  No doubt wordpress.  I don‚Äôt even remember that I was playing with Drupal when I was working on WP.  I was more impressed by Textpattern, Movable Type, vBulletin, PostNuke, OS Commerce and all that.  Naturally, I learned from them how NOT to do. <br><br>  <b>Wordpress has been developed for a long time, but it still does not work correctly with UTF.</b>  <b>Everything is solved by adding <i>$ this-&gt; query ("SET NAMES utf8");</i></b>  <b>in line 66 of the wp-db.php file.</b>  <b>What is this - a difference of opinion between users and developers, or are there other reasons?</b> <br><br>  Not sure, but it seems that this is all due to compatibility issues with older versions of MySQL.  Generally, if it really interests you, look at <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/">trac.wordpress.org</a> to <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/">see</a> if there is a flaw there - and write your opinion. <br><br>  <b>And finally: Still feel unlucky in cards?</b> <br><br>  Yes!  I am the most unlucky poker player. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5488/</a></p>
