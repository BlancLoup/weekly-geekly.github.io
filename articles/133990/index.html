  <section class="page js-page"><h1>OpenOffice COM Automation: Reading Clipboard Content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Part One (I hope not the last) </h2><br>  For a long time for me, OpenOffice remained a thing-in-itself.  I knew that it is perfectly automated by pythons and BASICs, but, behold, I could not find a suitable tool for PHP.  Quite by chance I discovered such an interesting feature of OpenOffice: accessing the contents of the Windows clipboard.  Then I really lacked the ability to write simple CLI scripts that process text in a buffer in PHP.  Therefore, I decided to thoroughly understand how you can steer the open-office with php from under Windows. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Here is the decision </h2><br><pre><code class="php hljs"><span class="hljs-meta"><span class="hljs-meta">&lt;?php</span></span> <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">// PHP OpenOffice:   COM- $oo = new COM("com.sun.star.ServiceManager"); $clipboard = $oo-&gt;CreateInstance( "com.sun.star.datatransfer.clipboard.SystemClipboard"); $converter = $oo-&gt;CreateInstance("com.sun.star.script.Converter"); $contents = $clipboard-&gt;getContents(); $flavors = $contents-&gt;getTransferDataFlavors(); $result = false; foreach ($flavors as $mm) { $mime = $mm-&gt;MimeType; // echo "$mime\r\n"; // DEBUG if ($mime=="text/plain;charset=utf-16") { $data = $contents-&gt;getTransferData($mm); // "com.sun.star.uno.TypeClass.STRING" ==&gt; 12 $result = $converter-&gt;convertToSimpleType($data, 12); break; } } echo $result;</span></span></code> </pre> <br><br><h2>  How it all works </h2><br>  First, the service manager component, <code>"com.sun.star.ServiceManager"</code> , is created, which is needed to connect the buffer and converter components, since it <code>"com.sun.star.datatransfer.clipboard.SystemClipboard"</code> impossible to directly create the buffer component <code>"com.sun.star.datatransfer.clipboard.SystemClipboard"</code> .  The manager is responsible for dispatching calls to UNO functions.  As a result, in response to <code>CreateInstance()</code> requests to a higher ‚Äúinstance‚Äù, we get full-fledged instances of the COM components we need. <br>  The contents of the buffer is retrieved by the <code>getContents()</code> method.  This content is very cleverly arranged, presented in several different formats (in taste and color).  The full set of <s>flavor</s> formats is <code>getTransferDataFlavors()</code> method.  As a result, we have a composite object, the elements of which can be <code>foreach (..as..)</code> in a <code>foreach (..as..)</code> . 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Each element in itself is also no less tricky.  Using the <code>MimeType</code> property, the content type is determined.  This content type is returned as a regular string.  We will be interested only in <code>"text/plain;charset=utf-16"</code> . <br><br>  To get the transferred buffer data, you need the <code>getTransferData()</code> method. <br><br><h3>  And, here we are waiting for the first bummer: </h3><br>  Unlike <code>MimeType</code> , which is a simple text value, the result of the method is not given as a <i>string</i> (which you could then simply transcode with the <code>iconv()</code> function into the desired encoding), but as an <i>alternative</i> type that is not so easy to make friends with in PHP . <br><br>  Most likely it is done this way, because besides the text content, the buffer may contain pictures, music and other multimedia, and it‚Äôs not always kosher to display it as a string. <br><br><h3>  Conversion </h3><br>  This problem is solved by a special converter component <code>"com.sun.star.script.Converter"</code> , which is also created by the manager. <br><br>  The converter has a method that converts variant values ‚Äã‚Äãto simple types <code>convertToSimpleType()</code> , which you need to feed the variant itself, and pass the "magic" constant <b>12</b> ( <code>"com.sun.star.uno.TypeClass.STRING"</code> ) corresponding to the usual strings. <br><br><h3>  But, here - the second bummer: </h3><br>  The result is a string encoded in <b>Windows-1251</b> , which can lead to a distortion or loss of the original characters (in Unicode encoding) that do not fit into the Procrustean bed of the Windows code table. <br><br><h2>  Disclaimer </h2><br>  In my opinion, the decision turned out to be quite elegant, but I expect to receive the opposite reaction from the real programming gurus that, again, like, they say, a new generation of PHP-Bydlokoderov shambles sitting in the Windows command line and writing Helloord for Habr√© appears office COM automation to just read the text from the buffer. <br><br>  In general, the place for this topic should be in <b>the Q &amp; A</b> blog, and its content was artificially inflated to the size of a ‚Äúfull-length‚Äù article. <br><br>  Unfortunately, in the Habra-Sandbox interface, it is not possible to specify a preferred blog for posting. <br>  Also, from the <u>Read-Only</u> account there is no possibility to write a letter directly to any Habrayuser asking to post a question on the Q &amp; A blog. <br><br><h2>  Here are the questions themselves: </h2><br>  1. Are there any other <b>alternative</b> ways to get access to the contents of the Windows clipboard, similar to OpenOffice, without connecting additional php extensions via COM-automation, for example, some <b>MS-Office</b> or even <b>Internet Explorer</b> ?  The article would have been more interesting if the reader was offered a choice of several different ways to solve the problem, and the ability to automatically access the contents of the buffer in any way possible, depending on what specific additional software was installed in the system.  That is, to provide some kind of cross-platform (well, or "cross-office", if you want). <br><br>  2. Well, we somehow learned to read the buffer, but how now <b>to write</b> something in this buffer?  Immediately forced to warn that the decision to write to the buffer will not look so elegant and transparent.  At least, I couldn‚Äôt succeed in ‚Äúbicycling‚Äù the solution of this task on my own.  And, of course, the description of the inverse operation is simply obliged to be present in the full-fledged article.  Although, once again, I repeat that I myself first needed to <i>read the contents of the text buffer</i> , and the Windows-1251 encoding fully corresponded to my appetites. <br><br>  3. Well, if, with the textual contents of the buffer, everything is clear, then what about the <b>graphics</b> ?  I would very much like to get the graphic contents of the buffer, for example, in the form of a GD2 object, and, also, so that you can ‚Äúdraw‚Äù directly in the buffer, that is, be able to synchronize the contents of the buffer with the state of the GD2 object.  I remember how, even at the time of Windows 98, one of my friends made an indelible impression on me by pasting a <i>FILM</i> copied from the Media Player in playback mode into MsPaint from the clipboard.  I was then just shocked when I saw a moving image on the background of an open pattern.  At that time, I still didn‚Äôt understand how Windows was arranged, and I perceived it as real magic. <br><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  The article, of course, would be more useful if it described <u>universal</u> read-write access to any type of content, so that, for example, you could export the contents of a particular type into files of the appropriate format. <br><br>  I really hope to find in the comments to the article the answers to all these questions, or at least these questions themselves, kindly transferred by the interested readers of this article to the Q &amp; A blog if this topic does not succeed in leaving the Habrabox sandbox. <br><br>  I repent that I did not give <u>references</u> to reputable sources of inspiration, I hope that this flaw will be compensated in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133990/</a></p>
