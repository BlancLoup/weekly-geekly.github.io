    <h2>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project </h2><br>  Technopark called "IT-Crimea".  His idea is to combine startups, research projects and large IT companies in one place to create conditions for the exchange of experience and best practices. <br><br>  Tenants will be provided with office space, a platform for events, residential apartments and laboratories.  According to the development plan, the entire infrastructure will appear in the park by 2020. <br><br><h2>  What has been done </h2><br>  An IT park is created <a href="https://yandex.ru/maps/959/sevastopol/house/ulitsa_vakulenchuka_29/33.489796,44.588725/">on the territory of the</a> former radio engineering design bureau, where there are four buildings.  In July of this year <a href="https://xn----otbhitj0e.xn--p1ai/news/zavershena-protsedura-pokupki-glavnogo-zdaniya-tehnoparka-it-krym/">, the</a> first, largest, and second corps <a href="https://xn----otbhitj0e.xn--p1ai/news/zavershena-protsedura-pokupki-glavnogo-zdaniya-tehnoparka-it-krym/">were purchased</a> .  Negotiations on the two remaining buildings are underway. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.comnews.ru/digital-economy/content/114717/opinions/2018-09-03/tehnopark-it-krym-innovacionnaya-ploshchadka-v-sevastopole">to</a> Dmitry Gachko, General Director and founder of ‚ÄúIT Crimea‚Äù, the project of the main building was completed and the reconstruction of the building began: the entrance group and the first two floors are a fan zone, co-working and food zones. <br><br>  Designers of the project have completed the concept of the adjacent territory and will soon begin to think over the plan of its arrangement.  Including planning for the same type of subsequent floors.  There is also a design of communications (electricity, water, heating and ventilation), since the old components are in unusable condition. <br><br>  On the basis of "IT-Crimea" is already running a training center that trains specialists in the interests of the residents of the technology park.  In June, the technopark <a href="https://xn----otbhitj0e.xn--p1ai/news/it-krym-i-sevgu-podpisali-soglashenie-o-sotrudnichestve/">signed a</a> cooperation agreement with Sevastopol State University (SevSU).  Joint educational programs have already been created and are being finalized, under which resident experts will train university students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/_f/md/ae_fmdsmfugbir53rs3ncd8jlyy.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ photo by <a href="https://ru.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB:2862180_495f661b.jpg">Stufford</a> <a href="">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  Senior students and graduates of the university will be able to undergo internships in the technopark, and after they graduate - to get a job for the residents of ‚ÄúIT Crimea‚Äù.  According to Dmitry Gachko, seven people who work for one of the residents have already been trained in the IT park. <br><br><h2>  Future plans </h2><br><blockquote>  Construction <a href="https://www.comnews.ru/content/113060/2018-05-16/sevastopol-obzavedetsya-it-parkom">is carried out</a> in several stages.  The first stage will be completed at the end of 2018.  The main building will be put into operation, in which offices, coworkings and the data center of the technopark will be placed.  The whole building is <a href="http://forumyalta.com/news/194/">designed</a> for 900 people. </blockquote><br>  The second stage will end in mid-2019.  Building B will build a conference room for 300 people.  In addition to the venue for events, in the same building will place a food zone, space for entertainment and its own brewery.  Also at the second stage, the territory adjacent to the buildings will be turned into a park. <br><br>  The third stage will be completed in the third quarter of 2019, when the business incubator building will open in IT Crimea.  It will accommodate additional office space.  The last stage of the technopark construction will end in 2020.  The fourth building will start working, where they will place another conference room, apartments for guests and employees, as well as laboratories (for example, to test prototype devices). <br><br>  A sports complex will also be built on the territory of the technopark.  The details of the project are being discussed with the city government, therefore the completion date of the construction of the sports center is still unknown. <br><br>  Technopark will provide companies with server capacity and services DevOps.  Startups will help with the promotion, recruitment and legal clearance.  In addition, IT Crimea plans to open a venture capital fund.  As Dmitry Gachko <a href="https://www.comnews.ru/digital-economy/content/114717/opinions/2018-09-03/tehnopark-it-krym-innovacionnaya-ploshchadka-v-sevastopole">said</a> , the company will invest in startups in the sowing round.  And successful projects will help find investors for the next stages of financing. <br><br>  Technopark will <a href="http://www.interfax-russia.ru/Crimea/main.asp%3Fid%3D933556">support</a> not only startups, but also research projects.  IT Crimea will finance research initiatives and help researchers with the organization of experiments. <br><br>  Residents will receive tax benefits from the city authorities, and in the future, the technopark is planning to make a zone with a special legal regime similar <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">to the High-Tech Park</a> in Minsk, where companies are exempted from corporate taxes and pay insurance premiums at a reduced rate. <br><br><h2>  Residents of "IT Crimea" </h2><br>  The first residents of the technology park were companies from Sevastopol, engaged in software development.  One of them <a href="https://www.comnews.ru/digital-economy/content/114965/news/2018-09-19/tehnopark-it-krym-predstavil-startap-po-avtomatizacii-biznes-processov">is</a> Startup Simple, which creates its own ITSM-system - an analogue of solutions such as BMC, ServiceNow and Micro Focus. <br><br>  The system development team includes graduates of the Sevastopol State University and a branch of Moscow State University.  M. V. Lomonosov.  All of them were participants of the incubator, working on the basis of technopark. <br><br>  At the same time, individual specialists can become residents - for this there is an opportunity to join already working projects.  There are not so many vacancies now, but over time there will be more.  Therefore, all resumes of specialists are stored in a single database in order to later invite these people to work in other projects. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bufnm6m7yn0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  To become a member of a technopark, a company or specialist needs to leave contacts in the form on <a href="https://xn----otbhitj0e.xn--p1ai/">the</a> project <a href="https://xn----otbhitj0e.xn--p1ai/">website</a> . <br><br><hr><br>  <i>PS Some fresh materials from our corporate blog about IaaS-technology:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/novosti/kak-dela-u-vmware-obzor-novyx-reshenij/">"How are VMware?": A review of new solutions</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/tendencii/besservernye-vychisleniya-v-oblake-trend-sovremennosti-ili-neobxodimost/">Serverless computing in the cloud - a trend of modernity or necessity?</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/kejsy/onlajn-uslugi-dlya-b2cb2b-iz-oblaka/">How to place 100% of the infrastructure in the cloud IaaS-provider and not regret it</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/proizvoditelnost/testirovanie-diskovoj-sistemy-v-oblake/">How to test disk system in the cloud</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/423997/">https://habr.com/ru/post/423997/</a></p>
