  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three ways to worry less</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  When I went to kindergarten, I forgot to undress: I was sitting in the locker room and thinking about my own.  When I went to school, I forgot my briefcase.  When grown up, the situation did not improve.  Willy-nilly has to adapt.  One way is to not be distracted by the rest.  On what worries at the moment.  In other words, worry less.  Here are my three ways (about others somehow later, if you like these). </p><br><br><h2>  Worry Less # 1: Disconnect the second line </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/710/793/7eb/7107937ebc4a4283c863e6aa8c5d50b1.jpg" alt="Telephonist and man with panties Bratz"><br><p>  Could not choose one photo and pasted both </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><p>  I spent a lot of effort to get fewer calls.  Why are calls evil?  If your job is only to receive calls, this is normal.  In other cases, they tear you away from something important.  Therefore, mostly friends and relatives call me (it is useless to explain to them - they will not understand and will still be offended), and that is not often.  Sometimes I spend the whole day without a single incoming call.  And sometimes I get two or three, and, according to the law of meanness, all three at the same time.  Here comes the second line.  Infection, invented by telephone companies to increase the duration of calls and earn more.  For subscribers, this is pure evil: a <i>parallel line spoils both conversations</i> , and creates a bunch of unnecessary things: </p><br><ol><li>  You need to interrupt the interlocutor: I'm sorry, I have a different line. </li><li>  You need to interrupt the second interlocutor.  Before he said that he wanted, you need to insert: "Sorry, I'm on the other line, I'll call you back." </li><li>  Sometimes it does not help - on the second line a person is inflexible.  He still tells what he was going to. </li><li>  Switch back and remember what they were talking about. </li><li>  Do not forget to call back. </li></ol><br><p>  Add failed calls on the first or second line due to poor communication or non-obvious management interface.  Hence the question: why does such a vile service exist on the market at all?  I think because of the human fear of missing something important.  Plus, because the operators include it by default, supposedly for free. </p>

    <p>  Therefore, it <b>must be disabled</b> .  It turns on on Beeline every time I change the tariff - it has to be turned off again.  But nothing - it's worth it. </p><br><br><p>  As you can see, it removes a lot of problems from me.  And what is the one who calls you?  You can choose how to deal with them: </p><br><ol><li>  Do not call back. </li><li>  Call immediately when you receive a text message about a missed call </li><li>  Call back later - start a timer (see method number 3). </li></ol><br><h2>  Way to worry less ‚Ññ2: Seal the watch in the car </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb6/b8d/d79/fb6b8dd7959b310222b0f13e6706e260.jpg" align="left" alt="Glue the clock"><p>  Imagine yourself standing in a traffic jam and late for a meeting.  You can't do anything with the situation itself: you won't remove the cork.  <i>It remains to change the attitude to the situation</i> .  To do this, I <b>stuck my watch in the car with a plaster</b> .  Arriving at the meeting, I look at my watch (on my cell phone) and if I'm late, I apologize.  It's all.  The result is the same, only without nerves.  Right? </p><br><br><p>  One but.  It would be nice to warn people that you are late.  To do this, we come to the aid of the timer (method number 3): before you leave, start it so that it rings for 5 minutes before the meeting.  The timer rang, called those who are waiting for you, is free.  Listen to podcasts, make eyes at girls in Peugeot, or just admire your city. </p><br><br><h2>  Worry Less # 3: Start a Timer </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/25f/60e/57b25f60e8157863035fed34ff52d56d.jpg" align="right" alt="Start a timer"><p>  A person is ill-equipped for a number of things.  For example, we swim poorly: the floundering of even Olympic champions cannot be compared to a swordfish, which has a spear to reduce drag and develops a speed of 130 km / h.  Another person badly remembers something at the right time.  We say that we will call you back in 10 minutes and we forget.  This is normal.  <i>Let's put up with it</i> and think how to be. </p><br><br><p>  My option is <b>to start a timer</b> .  When you say you call back, start a timer on your phone.  Sometimes the interlocutors are surprised that I called back on time, and that I even called back - so rarely does someone succeed. </p><br><br><h2>  So what? </h2><br><p>  Have I become a must?  Not.  I received the third duplicate of rights in three years, managed to confuse two performances at the Royal Opera and found 500 euros in my inner pocket of the jacket (which I had obviously lost before).  I had to start (and close beyond hopelessness) a special service in order to cope with ordinary things.  But, at least, I do not worry, standing in a traffic jam, do not interrupt the telephone conversation and call back on time. </p><br><br><p>  Update: Many people write, but what if a call is urgent?  I answer: <b>urgency - poison.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d1/55f/2a8/4d155f2a8bb1db802b153af15f24e8e2.png"></p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123427/</a></p>
