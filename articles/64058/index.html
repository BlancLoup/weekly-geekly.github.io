The proportion of comments of one type or another depends on the message subject. <br><br><h4>  We study specific examples: </h4><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At the time of writing this text in the article " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/63868/">Introducing the Google Chrome operating system</a> " there were 180 comments, of which 69 were approved by the plus, 23 were denied by the minus and 88 were not marked.

    <h5>  3 comments with the most advantages: </h5><br>  homm July 8, 2009, 14: 12 # <br>  +106 <br>  &gt; As with the browser, we had to start development from scratch with Google Chrome OS <br>  WebKit engines, Linux kernel.  This is called "from scratch".  Well, be smart. <br><br>  Gero July 8, 2009, 14: 21 <br>  +39 <br>  Interestingly, the antitrust committee will prohibit them from delivering Google Chrome browser integrated into the Google Chrome system? <br><br>  Denysh July 8, 2009, 14: 14 # <br>  +29 <br>  after such a title, I ran my eyes over the text in search of the download link))) <br><br>  Let us consider the comments leaders.  None of them is emotionally dry, it makes smile. <br><br>  The first comment has an informational and emotional part.  The phrase ‚ÄúThis is called‚Äú from scratch ‚Äùcreates tension, it seems to the reader that the author may fall for abuse.  Instead, he writes words that are easily agreed, both supporters and opponents of Google: "Well, fuck it up."  Thus, homm also hides its own addictions. <br><br>  In the second comment, a witty joke is clothed in an interrogative form.  Whether Gero is a Google fan or not is not clear from his phrase. <br><br>  Comment Denysh has a pronounced humorous form.  The author himself emphasizes this, completing the phrase with three closing brackets.  This joke is positive in its content.  The author laughs not at someone else, but even, perhaps, at himself.  However, recognizing themselves, readers actively support the recognition of Denysh.  The answer to this comment, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve reached my ranks,‚Äù continues to ‚Äúuncover‚Äù the joke and collects 16 pluses. <br><br><h5>  3 comments scored the most cons: </h5><br>  securer July 8, 2009, 16: 33 # ‚Üë <br>  ‚Äì17 <br>  google_chrome_os is worth moving to CITY <br><br>  barsuki July 8, 2009, 14: 21 # <br>  -13 <br>  now exactly vindekapets <br><br>  The_Vicont July 8, 2009, 14: 25 # <br>  -ten <br>  It should have long been expected. <br>  Microsoft's hegemony in the OS market should end. <br><br>  Since the first comment given here is a response to the parent, it makes sense to reveal its content.  dohlik writes: "Eeeh, we will not have Internet channels in the province soon enough for such an OS ... But it will still be interesting to feel what it is ...".  The answer of securer cannot be called either informational or, even more so, interrogative, it is exclusively emotional.  At the same time, the phrase contains a bright message about their own preferences and an indirect insult to the previous commentator.  The word "city" is written in capital letters, it reinforces the negativity of the message and concentrates it at the end of the phrase. <br><br>  Comment barsuki is a striking example of "hats".  The author does not try to explain his position, expresses it categorically and odiously. <br><br>  The first sentence of the third comment can be considered informational.  The second sentence is formulated poorly.  It is impossible to understand unequivocally whether the author expresses his personal position about the hostility of Microsoft‚Äôs dominant position or makes a prediction for the future.  It is likely that the majority of readers who negatively noted this comment interpreted it as a statement of personal position.  In this case, the author really expressed his thoughts in a very sharp form, using the emotionally colored word "hegemony" and peremptory "must." <br><br><h4>  Conclusions and tips: </h4><br>  On Habr√© highly appreciated comments that carry additional information directly related to the main text of the article, expressed in a light, but not in a clown form. <br><br>  Negative attitudes are caused by abusive, "cap-and-seek" and peremptory statements.  Also, the minus is marked by empty messages like ‚Äúwhat for ...‚Äù, ‚Äúyes well on ...‚Äù, ‚Äúwah!‚Äù, Etc.  More cons can make not funny jokes. <br>  In the vast majority of cases, the use of offensive language reinforces the negative effect of a message. <br><br>  It is better to write a negative comment in the form of a question that is able to disguise the true moods of the author.  Of course, it‚Äôs not enough to put a question mark after the words ‚Äúnow exactly Windows‚Äù.  You need to completely reformulate the phrase to get, for example, "Do you think Chrome OS will press Windows?". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64058/</a></p>
