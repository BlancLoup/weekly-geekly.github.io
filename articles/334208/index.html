  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Universal advertising campaign for all types of businesses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi habr.  My name is Oleg Patsay.  The last four years I live in the advertising offices of social.  networks.  I spent more than 300 advertising campaigns in 108 different directions.  Through the target, I conveyed to the people a variety of information.  What I observe in the reaction of people to advertising messages gives me the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a universal advertising campaign.  I thought about creating such a creative, which would work perfectly in any projects. <br><br>  Of course, this is a utopian idea, but still, it is possible to identify some patterns of human behavior and create such patterns for creatives that would work flawlessly.  In some way I even managed it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Personal appeal </h3><br>  The most effective advertising was when a potential buyer had the impression of a dialogue.  When the brand addresses the consumer directly.  One on one.  Without any abstruse slogans, without too much.  And with a simple question in the subtext: "Do you even need this?".  To which the consumer had the answer yes or no. <br><br>  I continued my search.  I wanted to create a campaign that would immediately hit the target.  Without much effort.  How to convey to the person that I appeal to him?  How to make it work for everyone and at the same time was a personal appeal?  And then I remembered the legendary advertising campaign of the Red Army.

And I realized that the most important thing in them is the index finger.  Show the person a finger and ask.  Is he the concept that I'm looking for?  I started to just focus on the finger.  I tried different creatives with a finger. <br><br><h3>  And in the end, found the one </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5c/d2d/286/a5cd2d286c544b634aad7848f4426108.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the photo you see only a few niches. <br><br><ul><li>  Credit cards </li><li>  Services to configure Yandex Direct </li><li>  Songwriting for lovers </li><li>  Bankruptcy of individuals </li><li>  Quarry repair services </li><li>  Original Hand Made Gifts </li><li>  Discount Coupons </li><li>  Realtor Services </li></ul><br>  Through the target, I spoke with different segments of the target audience.  In completely different niches, price segments, B2C and B2B sectors.  And this concept worked effectively again and again.  Only the offer was changed.  Only the question has changed.  The teaser for attracting attention remained the same.  In some niches advertising campaigns work and now for more than two years.  And this finger still drags them customers. <br><br>  Of all the niches where I tried it, then in 60% of cases this teaser was the most effective.  And it seems to me that somewhere in nature there is a universal advertising campaign that would work as efficiently as possible for a larger percentage of businesses.  Perhaps this is just another picture of the index finger? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/334208/">https://habr.com/ru/post/334208/</a></p>
