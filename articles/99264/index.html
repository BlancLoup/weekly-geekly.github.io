  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first public electric refueling station appeared in the USA</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.coulombtech.com/images/ChargePoint-CityofSF2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently (yes that there, almost constantly) on Habr√© appears quite a lot of information about alternative power sources, electric cars and electric refueling.  Usually they write about all this as concepts, however, more and more new technologies appear in everyday life, and not just at hi-tech exhibitions.  But let's get down to the topic of the news itself - the first public electric filling station has opened in New York.  Refueling is designed and built by experts from the company <b>Coulomb Technologies</b> .  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was also present at the opening of the filling station, who always showed his concern about the state of the environment of the city and surrounding area.  By the way, in New York the number of electric cars is constantly increasing.  It seems that with the advent of a network of gas stations will be more. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The cost of electric refueling, according to the company's management, is several million dollars (how much exactly it cost, not reported).  Moreover, additional refueling will appear soon, after all, about 37 million US dollars were invested in the project, of which 15 were provided by the government.  More precisely, $ 15 million was provided by the US Department of Energy.  On the website of the company (link to it is given below) you can see exactly where it is planned to place additional electric filling stations.  Generally speaking, it is planned that such refueling will appear in Texas, Detroit, in the same state of New York, Florida, California, Washington and the District of Columbia.  As you can see, the network of gas stations is quite extensive, covering the most problematic, in terms of the number of automotive emissions, regions.

      In general, the company management even provided more or less specific plans for the deployment of a network of gas stations.  By the end of 2011 several hundred (!) Electric stations should be ready.  Interestingly, all these refills will be compatible with Tesla Motors, Chevrolet Volt cars, and all Ford and Mercedes electric models. <br><br>  It is interesting to hear the word "compatible" in relation to gas stations.  So it seems, as with each car a network adapter of a certain type is sold, as with cell phones.  I would like to know if all cars have a single standard of refueling, or are there still differences on which manufacturers are going to earn? <br><br>  By the way, the newest devices for charging car batteries will already be installed at gas stations - instead of the usual 12 hours of recharge, the car will charge from 20 minutes to 4 hours.  Of course, for now this is a rather significant drawback of electric vehicles - after all, few people can find 4 hours for a full refueling.  But who knows, I think that in the near future there will be batteries with the possibility of ultra-fast refueling, as happened with batteries of portable devices. <br><br>  In any case, the initiative was made, now we are waiting for the appearance of stations in Europe (or is there already, who knows?).  I am silent about the CIS, everything is clear here - most likely, electric vehicles and electric refueling will appear at least after five years.  It's a pity. <br><br>  Here is the site of the company <a href="http://www.coulombtech.com/">Coulomb Technologies</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99264/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99264/</a></p>
