  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Teenage girl created a business that brings a million dollars a year.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ashley Coolls doesn't look like a typical high school girl.  Maybe because in their 17 runs a business that brings $ 1 million a year.  Ashley runs the site at whateverlife.com, which she opened at the age of fourteen, borrowing $ 8 from her mom.  Now the site brings about a million dollars annually.  This money allowed Ashley to buy a large house, on the ground floor of which is the office of her company, writes <a href="">news.yahoo.com</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ashley's interest in graphic design came at the beginning of the popularity of social portals.  Ashley did design for her friends pages hosted on Myspace.com.  It turned out funny, colorful pictures with the image of hearts, so loved Ashley.  They were accompanied by quotes from popular songs, reflecting the direction of the site.  A total of 3,000 pages were created using <a href="http://whateverlife.com/">whateverlife.com</a> , a third of which Ashley drew herself. <br><br>  About a million people visit the site daily.  This circumstance attracted the attention of advertisers.  Ashley received her first check for $ 2,700.  The second - for 5 thousand dollars and the third - for 10 thousand. When the first money arrived, Ashley's mom doubted that you could earn money all the time.  But Ashley was confident that she would succeed.  She was right.  Checks came one after another, the business grew, and eventually they had saved enough money to buy the four-bedroom house they now live in.

      Ashley hired her mother, Linda, to help her run the business.  Linda is proud of her daughter.  She says that Ashley used to be so shy that she was embarrassed to order pizza by phone.  However, now she makes presentations in front of businessmen. <br><br>  Business has complicated the life of a teenager.  He demanded more time, and as he developed, Ashley, who was an excellent pupil, had to leave school to devote all time to whateverlife.com <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have to work on a very tight schedule: it is necessary to keep track of finances, devote time to employees and, of course, follow the design direction.‚Äù  Ashley created the design for the songs of popular artists, in particular, Britney Spears.  In addition to her mother, Ashley hired three more of her friends.  She taught them designer skills, and each now has to do at least 25 design works per week. <br><br>  Bra Newby says Ashley is a wonderful boss, much better than the ones she previously worked with.  ‚ÄúIt's great when your boss is your best friend at the same time,‚Äù Bre says.  ‚ÄúShe does not stand above your soul, like, for example, the supervisor at McDonalds.‚Äù <br><br>  Robb Lippitt, an internet expert who advises Ashley, says he had doubts about whether he could work with a teenager.  But the girl dispelled them at the first meeting. <br><br>  ‚ÄúShe thinks like a mature person and she doesn‚Äôt have to say all the time that it‚Äôs necessary to develop a business, otherwise it will stop growing,‚Äù Robb says.  Unlike many adults, Ashley did not succumb to the temptation that comes from wealth.  She set a salary of 3 thousand dollars a month.  And besides the house, did not make any big purchases. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to explain this,‚Äù says Ashley.  But the initial realization that you have a lot of money goes away with time.  Yes, of course, you can buy something cool, but the fact is, I don't need much.  I like to invest in my business. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18900/</a></p>
