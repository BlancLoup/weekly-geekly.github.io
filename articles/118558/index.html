    <h4>  What am I talking about </h4><br>  From time to time events occur in the reality surrounding me, tearing my personality ruined by IT technologies from the flow of work, technical information, communication on computer-related topics and other finger-pointing on the keyboard.  Well, for example, a friend will buy a cool bike.  Or give a birthday aquarium with fish.  Or at work will arrange a championship in table tennis.  In order not to look like a complete profane in conversations, you have to open Google and spend some time studying the topic.  And here the discoveries begin! <br><br>  It turns out that for all these tales, fish and tennis there are not only sites, there are whole worlds, and there are ‚Äúworlds‚Äù - universes, the existence of which I have never known before!  Some completely different people live in them who use some completely incomprehensible slang (you can read several pages of the forum and not understand a word, although the language seems to be familiar).  These worlds have their own geniuses and madmen, there are pros and lamers, there are classic books and authoritative authors, there are their own trolls, holivars, objects of adoration and general hatred, there are some modern trends, news and a whole lot of everything else.  And the most striking is the scale of this all.  The same fish, bikes and tennis on a global scale is engaged in people much more than ours with you IT.  And, accordingly, sites, blogs and forums on them are also a dime a dozen.  Millions, tens of millions of people hang out there!  And I never knew about them.  I sat in my cozy world consisting of Habr and a dozen more IT-related resources and thought that I was aware of what is happening in the world today, what people live with.  FIG there, it turns out! <br><br>  But the discovery of the fact that there is much in the world, besides computer technology, is striking as much as an understanding of the fact that even the familiar IT world seems to be divided into separate parts, which are not very strongly connected.  Take, for example, a system programmer and designer, or a sysadmin and a theoretical theoretician.  These people do not overlap in their work, they understand little what the other one does, they do not know how to use his tools and do not represent the scale of his field of activity.  All of them, nevertheless, identify themselves with the world of computers, they often think that they see the whole picture in the industry as a whole, they take it upon themselves to judge, draw conclusions and advise. <br><br><h4>  Why am I leading all this? </h4><br>  Often on Habr√© thoughts in the spirit run through: <br><ul><li>  Operating system <b>A</b> is super, the rest are nafig. </li><li>  The future is in object (functional / dynamic / custom) programming languages. </li><li>  Technology <b>B</b> steeper technology <b>C</b> </li><li>  Soon everything will be exclusively in the clouds (clusters \ mobile devices \ multi-core systems \ tablets \ own version) </li><li>  Encoding style <b>A is</b> better than encoding style <b>B</b> </li><li>  In no case can you do this or that. </li></ul><br><br>  And now I do not understand how people themselves do not understand that all these thoughts are nonsense.  No one who has expressed such a thought sees the full picture of the world.  Moreover, no one sees the full picture of the IT world, because today it‚Äôs too big a world.  A person does not have enough time, energy or brain resources to recognize him at least 10%. <br><br>  Do you like the OS <b>A</b> ?  So, there are a lot of people who legitimately prefer the operating system <b>B</b> , because it does something better (and you never come across this use case and will not encounter it).  Do you program in <b>X</b> and think that you can write a damn bald man for a couple of days and a bottle of vodka?  So, there is a huge class of tasks that are solved in a different language much faster and easier than in <b>X.</b>  And a bunch of people who write in this language.  Do you think technology <b>B is</b> steeper than <b>C</b> ?  So, do not even doubt that a lot of software has been created on <b>C</b> , which does a whole bunch of things and will continue to do this for another 10 years, even after the cessation of the development of this technology.  It means that we need specialists in it, books on it, etc.  Not looking at your opinion, nor at the opinions of the heaps of "specialists" from other areas. <br><br><h4>  So why am I still? </h4><br>  Do not deny the existence of parallel worlds.  Even in such a seemingly hundred times familiar field as information technology.  Do not think that you see the whole picture.  You only look at some small piece of it and the better you know this piece, the less it actually is.  When advising \ visits / disputes \ mats in a dialogue with an interlocutor, do not forget to clarify the circumstances and the range of tasks that are related to your statement.  Absolute statements are always wrong.  You can indicate this fact to the interlocutor and should be prepared for a similar remark from him. <br><br>  Once again - do not assume that you see the whole picture.  It's impossible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118558/</a></p>
