  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Email Marketing 3.0 - the community around the product</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://sendpulse.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c3/53a/2e9/0c353a2e93864098bb096c72ed8fbeee.jpg"></a> <br><br>  E-mail marketing since its inception is developing by leaps and bounds.  And if once regular sending mailings on behalf of the company could surprise someone, now this channel does not use just lazy.  As a result, the level of information noise in the mailboxes of recipients is growing, interest and involvement are falling. <br><br>  According to the Radicati Group, the <b>number of email users in 2015 was 2.6 billion</b> .  Email account is the basis for further interaction with Internet capabilities: registration in social networks takes place by email address, an email address or an account in a social network is needed to use Internet services, an account in an email client is needed for correspondence on work.  And while there is such a demand, email marketing will not die.  But efficiency can lose if it is not developed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2015, each user of the network received an average of 122 emails per day, of which only 88 were delivered.  Do not forget about spam.  12 emails out of 88 received were sent without the consent of the recipient. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Simple arithmetic: it takes an average of 30 minutes a day to view mail from an office worker. <br><br><h3>  30 minutes / 88 letters = <b>20 seconds / message</b> </h3><br><br>  At the same time, many mailings are deleted unread.  Spam does not open in principle.  And the decision whether to read the newsletter takes only 8 seconds.  Can we talk about achieving a high level of engagement in such a short time?  Hardly. <br><br>  Undoubtedly, the user will spend more time on more interesting and expected mailings.  And the others who do not invest in the 30-minute limit will go to the Trash unread or will be marked as spam (which is even worse). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b76/c61/420/b76c614205dc41a7afc8a40a4f27ecad.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br><ul><li>  Reduce the information in the mailing list so that it can be understood at a glance.  This is especially true of advertising mailings. </li><li>  Do not part. </li><li>  Responsibly approach the issue of content. </li><li>  Segment the base. </li></ul><br><br>  The last is the most important. <br><br>  Remember, at the inception stage of the advertising industry, there was an opinion that you need to sell everything and everyone.  Advertising was based on this principle ( <i>this incomprehensible video "Ma-aa-als" on TV, which advertised the wrong product, not the company</i> ). <br><br>  Later, with the development of marketing, they began to realize that <b>ALL of</b> this particular product may not be needed.  Began to explore the target, to determine the main segments and build advertising messages based on the interests and needs of the most interesting in terms of sales and profit segments. <br><br>  So why in email marketing still many companies send mailings at once on all list?  Are you sure that the proposal will be interesting to everyone? <br><br><h4>  <b>For reference: Foreign branded online stores send a mass mailing to only 25% of the address book.</b> </h4><br><br>  This is exactly the case when the conversion from one can exceed the result from a mass mailing on the entire list.  And most importantly - fewer complaints about spam, less clutter in the mailboxes of subscribers. <br><br>  Marketing is directed to the consumer, and not to sales, to his comfort and feelings towards the company or product. <br>  Segmentation of mailings, data personalization, selection of dynamic content is the second stage of email marketing development in any company.  When marketers remember that their goal is not a profit, but a client. <br><br>  But this is not the limit! <br><br>  The ideal promotion model is to create a community around a company or a product with a common interest and friendship.  <b>At that moment, when the marketer can become a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù to each subscriber and forgets about promotion solely for promotional purposes, there will be more sense from email marketing</b> . <br><br>  Well, do not forget about segmentation, dynamic content and data personalization (not just the name).  The more carefully you select the list for distribution using criteria, the more relevant content you provide to subscribers.  And this is the direct key to ensure that it is spending 20 or more seconds on your newsletters.  Nobody will donate their time for promotional mailings.  The world is tired of direct advertising.  Get over it and adapt to new standards and trends. <br><br><h4>  <b>The secret of effective mailings in a small database of subscribers, about which you know almost everything!</b> </h4><br><br>  Encourage the answers of subscribers to the newsletter, engage in dialogue with customers.  Turn mailings into a person-to-person conversation, not with an automated mailing service, as Baremetrics does, for example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e3/445/2b0/5e34452b09a74f9c9f90fb24f934f866.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f6/7b6/80b/2f67b680b6bf4a6c846de807bf079f79.jpg">  Irina Chugay, merchant marketing service <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296654/</a></p>
