True, the buyer was always right, but only in front of the cash departments of stores or in the queue for the return of goods.  Today the network makes an elementary connection between buyers and sellers.  Savvy management companies, in particular, from Silicon Valley, carefully listen to their customers, using their opinions to create and develop new products, try to maintain long-term relationships with customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Call it the era of continuous bilateral business.  <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> relies on customer reviews to make its services more convenient than a traditional store.  <a href="http://www.lego.com/en-US/default.aspx%3Fdomainredir%3Dlego.com">Lego</a> offers software downloads, and buyers can design their own sets of software and then buy them online.  <a href="http://lindenlab.com/">Linden Labs</a> subscribers in Second Life are starting to invest in virtual landscapes, improving them so that the environment becomes even more attractive to other subscribers.  <a href="http://www.medtronic.com/">Medtronic</a> doesn't just sell you a heart activity stimulator.  He sells you a heart implant that sends information with updates about your health to your doctor.  This allows you to keep in constant contact with the doctor and this gives him a constant connection with Medtronic. <br><br>  <b>Ahead of the whole planet</b> <br>  Amazon.com - Buyer Product and Service Reviews <br>  Apple - face-to-face sales and customer service <br>  Medtronic - working with electronic heart stimulants online <br>  Netflix - a recommendation system based on the tastes of customers

      Not surprisingly, in most cases, this trend is associated with companies that do most of the online business.  Take <a href="http://www.netflix.com/Register">Netflix</a> .  The Cinematch system of this resource advises choosing films based on user ratings of other films and how other like-minded people rate movies.  Buyers can also get recommendations based on the preferences of their friends.  The result expands user tastes, supports independent cinema ‚Äî and reliably binds Netflix users to resource services.  Now Netflix is ‚Äã‚Äãa permanent meeting place for film fans who can refer to someone else's ratings and film requests.  These buyer-buyer contacts only reinforce communication between buyers and companies, their cooperation is firmly affirmed with the slogan "Friends will not allow friends to leave Netflix." <br><br>  Customer loyalty to the company, born of a two-way business, reduces price sensitivity, this is a possible reason for the failure of Wal-Mart Netflix-like service with lower prices.  Linking customers online also helps you learn more about them, which means identifying new products that can be sold to them.  Amazon, for example, uses the habits of book buyers to recommend everything from DVD to clothing.  At the same time, for customers, a sense of closeness with the company can quickly lead to feelings of betrayal: when <a href="http://www.manuelsweb.com/netflix.htm">news</a> of the fact that Netflix has a system that delays sending DVDs to users who hire most DVDs for hire has become known, the indignation spread instantly through blogs and forums .  And when one user leaves Netflix, his friends can leave with him. <br><br>  Since the feedback between the buyer and the seller is increasingly used, shop windows are also becoming more interactive.  Buyers with cell phones or pocket computers will be able to access device instructions, instant technical support, read user reviews and possibly place orders for devices that are not already on their shelves - or those that online store servers offer not only on your past purchases, but also on what your friends enjoy. <br><br>  In other words, the time will come when all the stores will work with customers through feedback.  Even those in the supermarkets. <br><br>  Daniel Akst, Wired 04/15/07 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/30969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/30969/</a></p>
