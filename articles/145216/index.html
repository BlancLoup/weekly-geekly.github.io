  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Computex announced devices on Windows 8</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The time is coming for the release of the release version of the new Windows, very soon the store shelves will be filled with new laptops, tablets, all-in-one PCs with this OS.  In the meantime, Asus, MSI and Acer showed off their new gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/535/210/7aa/5352107aa9aeff634839f5615919182e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  First of all, Asus with a monoblock, whose monitor can be used separately (!) As a tablet, with support for loading two operating systems (!!), Android and Windows, attracts the attention!  ASUS <b>Transformer AiO</b> has an 18 inch touchscreen that can be ‚Äúunfastened‚Äù from the docking station and used as a regular tablet.  The docking station has ports USB 3.0, Thunderbolt, HDMI, Disk drive.  The device will boot to Windows by default, and when you press a certain key, Android will boot.  Asus has not yet announced more detailed specifications (including the processor architecture - ARM or x86). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cfe/780/b40/cfe780b402cef4f173ef9e1aa7817c26.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Acer is also pleased with interesting new items.  First of all, this is a 27-inch monoblock <b>Aspire 7600U</b> , Full HD display of which is able to handle up to 64 (!) Simultaneous keystrokes.  The monoblock stand allows you to rotate it 90 degrees in portrait mode, as well as in a horizontal position parallel to the table.  The monoblock, with a case thickness of about 3.5 cm, has two USB ports, a combined audio input, a slot for SD cards, and a compartment for optional installation of a Blu-ray drive.  Another attractive feature is the sound subsystem with Dolby Home Theater surround sound technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6d6/dbc/0b0/6d6dbc0b0462b6fce4b1dd45d96d1d13.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The next interesting device is the <b>ASUS TAICHI</b> laptop with two displays!  In the open (notebook) state, this is a regular laptop with a keyboard, touchpad and display.  In the closed state, an external touch screen is available, which also supports work with the stylus.  Both screens work independently and can be used by two users at the same time.  At the heart of the laptop uses Intel Core i7 processors with the architecture of Ivy Bridge, up to 4 gigabytes of memory, SSD.

New items are positioned as the thinnest and most compact, respectively, models of ultrabooks with a touch Full HD screen.  Ultrabook will offer a long battery life: 12 hours for the 13.3 inch model and 9 for the 11.6 inch model, respectively.  Like all new ultrabooks, this one will ship with new Intel Core processors (Ivy Bridge). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3d/18c/3d9/b3d18c3d9b8ed7aecb9031187c453328.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Asus also announced the <b>Transformer Book</b> .  By analogy with the Transformer Pad, the display can be used separately, like an ordinary tablet.  Models with a screen diagonal of 11.6, 13 and 14 inches are presented.  The devices will use Intel Core i7 processors (Ivy Bridge), SSD or classic hard drives, the amount of RAM is limited to 4 gigabytes.  There are also front and rear 5 megapixel camera. <br><br>  The model with the same form factor, but with an ARM processor (nVidia Tegra 3) is called the <b>ASUS Tablet 600</b> .  It has a 10.1-inch Super IPS + display with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels.  Carries on board 2 gigabytes of RAM and 32 gigabytes of eMMC for user data.  There is a 2 megapixel front camera and an 8 megapixel rear camera.  A nice addition will be the GPS and NFC modules, a gyroscope and a digital compass.  Almost full copy is the <b>ASUS Tablet 810</b> .  Of differences: Intel Medfield platform, 11.6-inch diagonal with a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels, 64 GB eMMC memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d5/fcf/022/5d5fcf0220cb77ffbade42269c750a6a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  A similar model introduced Acer.  <b>Iconia W510</b> has a 10.1-inch IPS touch screen with a docking station in the form of a keyboard.  According to the manufacturer, Iconia W510 can work up to 18 hours from one charge (with a docking station).  The device is also based on Intel processors and has slots for SIM-card and microSD, micro-USB and HDMI ports. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/841/aa8/837/841aa8837763323f6111c84206071e95.jpg" alt="image"><br>  MSI presented its vision of a laptop-transformer.  <b>The MSI Slider S20</b> is an ultrabook with a multi-touch screen of 11.6 inches in a slider format.  Thus, the screen can be shifted and work as with a laptop, or folded and get a tablet.  Weight is 1.3 kg and thickness is less than two centimeters.  The device is based on the platform of a new generation of Intel CULV Chief River (Ivy Bridge). <br><br>  As you can see, autumn will be rich in interesting new items with new Windows.  The devices are presented in various formats, so that everyone can choose something most suitable. <br><br>  Interestingly, manufacturers prefer the x86 version of the OS, it is logical fear that most buyers will want to use familiar programs written for older versions of Windows with a classic interface.  But we will wait for news from other manufacturers, perhaps, they will present more devices on Windows on ARM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145216/</a></p>
