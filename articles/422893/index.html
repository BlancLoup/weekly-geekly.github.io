Since the release of this platform in 2009, it has become extremely popular and today plays a very important role in the field of web development.  If we take as an indicator of the popularity of the number of stars that a certain project gathered on GitHub, then <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node">Node.js</a> , which has more than 50,000 stars, is a very, very popular project. <br><br>  Node.js platform is built on the basis of JavaScript engine V8 from Google, which is used in Google Chrome browser.  This platform is mainly used to create web servers, but its scope is not limited to this. <br><br>  Consider the main features of Node.js. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçSpeed</font> </h3><br>  One of the main attractive features of Node.js is speed.  JavaScript code running in Node.js can be twice as fast as code written in compiled languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike C or Java, and orders of magnitude faster than interpreted languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike Python or Ruby.  The reason for this is the non-blocking architecture of the platform, and the specific results depend on the performance tests used, but, in general, Node.js is a very fast platform. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçEasy</font> </h3><br>  Node.js platform is easy to learn and use.  In fact, it is really very simple, especially noticeable in comparison with some other server platforms. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçJavaScript</font> </h3><br>  In the Node.js environment, code written in JavaScript is executed.  This means that millions of front-end developers who already use JavaScript in the browser can write both server and client code in the same programming language without having to learn a completely new tool for moving to server development. <br><br>  The same language concepts are used in the browser and on the server.  In addition, in Node.js, you can quickly switch to the use of new ECMAScript standards as they are implemented on the platform.  You do not need to wait for this until users refresh their browsers, since Node.js is a server environment that the developer fully controls.  As a result, new language features are available when you install a version of Node.js that supports them. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">V V8 engine</font> </h3><br>  Node.js, among other solutions, is based on Google‚Äôs open source JavaScript V8 engine from Google Chrome and other browsers.  This means that Node.js is using the work of thousands of engineers who have made Chrome's JavaScript runtime incredibly fast and continue to work towards improving the V8. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç Asynchrony</font> </h3><br>  In traditional programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(C, Java, Python, PHP), all instructions, by default, are blocking, unless the developer explicitly takes care of asynchronous code execution.  As a result, if, for example, in such an environment, to make a network request to download some JSON code, the execution of the stream from which the request was made will be suspended until the response is received and processed. <br><br>  JavaScript greatly simplifies writing asynchronous and non-blocking code using a single stream, callback functions (callbacks), and an event-based development approach.  Every time we need to perform a heavy operation, we pass the callback to the appropriate mechanism, which will be called immediately after the completion of this operation.  As a result, in order for the program to continue, it is not necessary to wait for the results of such operations. <br><br>  A similar mechanism originated in browsers.  We cannot afford to wait, say, the end of an AJAX request, without being able to respond to user actions, such as clicking on buttons.  In order to make it convenient for users to work with web pages, everything, and downloading data from the network, and processing button presses, must occur simultaneously, in real time. <br><br>  If you have ever created an event handler for clicking a button, then you have already used asynchronous programming techniques. <br><br>  Asynchronous mechanisms allow a single Node.js server to simultaneously process thousands of connections without loading the programmer with thread management tasks and organizing parallel code execution.  Such things are often sources of error. <br><br>  Node.js provides the developer with non-blocking basic input-output mechanisms, and, in general, the libraries used in the Node.js environment are written using non-blocking paradigms.  This makes blocking behavior an exception rather than the norm. <br><br>  When Node.js needs to perform an I / O operation, such as loading data from a network, accessing a database or a file system, instead of blocking waiting for the results of such an operation the main thread, Node.js initiates its execution and continues to do other things until until the results of this operation are obtained. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç Libraries</font> </h3><br>  Thanks to the simplicity and convenience of working with the package manager for Node.js, which is called <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/npm/">npm</a> , the Node.js ecosystem is thriving.  Now in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm registry</a> there are more than half a million open source packages that any Node.js developer can use freely. <br>  Having reviewed some of the main features of the Node.js platform, let's try it out in action.  Let's start with the installation. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Installing Node.js</font> </h2><br>  Node.js can be installed in various ways, which we will now consider. <br>  So, the official installation packages for all major platforms can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a> . <br><br>  There is another very convenient way to install Node.js, which is to use the package manager available in the operating system.  For example, the macOS package manager, which is the de facto standard in this area, is called <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> .  If it is on your system, you can install Node.js by running this command from the command line: <br><br><pre><code class="hljs sql">brew <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">install</span></span> node</code> </pre> <br>  A list of package managers for other operating systems, including Linux and Windows, can be found <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">here</a> . <br><br>  A popular version manager for Node.js is <a href="">nvm</a> .  This tool allows you to conveniently switch between different versions of Node.js, with its help you can, for example, install and try a new version of Node.js, after which, if necessary, return to the old one.  Nvm is useful in a situation where you need to try out some code on the old version of Node.js. <br><br>  I would advise beginners to use the official Node.js installers.  I would recommend macOS users to install Node.js using Homebrew.  Now that you've installed Node.js, it's time to write ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">First Node.js application</font> </h2><br>  The most common example of the first application for Node.js is a simple web server.  Here is his code: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> http = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'http'</span></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> hostname = <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'127.0.0.1'</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> port = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3000</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> server = http.createServer(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-function">(</span><span class="hljs-params"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">req, res</span></span></span><span class="hljs-function">) =&gt;</span></span> { res.statusCode = <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">200</span></span> res.setHeader(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Content-Type'</span></span>, <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'text/plain'</span></span>) res.end(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Hello World\n'</span></span>) }) server.listen(port, hostname, () =&gt; { <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">`Server running at http://</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${hostname}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">:</span><span class="hljs-subst"><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-subst">${port}</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string">/`</span></span>) })</code> </pre> <br>  To run this code, save it in <code>server.js</code> and execute the following command in the terminal: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">node <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">server</span></span>.js</code> </pre> <br>  To check the server, open any browser and enter http: <code>http://127.0.0.1:3000</code> in the address bar, that is, the address of the server that will be displayed in the console after its successful launch.  If everything works as it should - the page will display ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù. <br><br>  Let us examine this example. <br><br>  First, note that the code contains the command for connecting the <a href="http.html">http</a> module. <br><br>  Node.js platform is the owner of a wonderful <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/">standard set of modules</a> , which includes well-developed mechanisms for working with the network. <br><br>  The <code>http</code> object's <code>createServer()</code> method creates a new HTTP server and returns it. <br><br>  The server is configured to listen on a specific port on a given host.  When the server is ready, the corresponding callback is called, informing us that the server is running. <br><br>  When the server receives a request, a <code>request</code> event is raised that provides two objects.  The first is the request ( <code>req</code> , the <a href="&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiVok1hnHJ-2BCApdCXdQYes_dU6w#http_class_">http.IncomingMessage</a> object), the second is the answer ( <code>res</code> , the <a href="&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiVok1hnHJ-2BCApdCXdQYes_dU6w#http_class_">http.ServerResponse</a> object).  They are the most important mechanisms for handling HTTP requests. <br><br>  The first provides information about the request.  In our simple example, we do not use this data, but, if necessary, with the help of the <code>req</code> object, we can access the request headers and data transmitted in it. <br><br>  The second is needed to form and send a response to the request. <br><br>  In this case, the answer to the request we form as follows.  First, set the <code>statusCode</code> property to <code>200</code> , which indicates that the operation was successful: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs">res.statusCode = 200</code> </pre> <br>  Next, we set the <code>Content-Type</code> header: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs vhdl">res.setHeader(<span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">'Content</span></span>-<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Type</span></span>', <span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">'text</span></span>/plain')</code> </pre> <br>  After that we finish preparing the response by adding its contents as an argument to the <code>end()</code> method: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">res.<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'Hello World\n'</span></span>)</code> </pre> <br>  We have already said that a powerful ecosystem has developed around the Node.js platform.  Now let's discuss some popular frameworks and support tools for Node.js. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Node.js frameworks and support tools</font> </h2><br>  Node.js is a low-level platform.  In order to simplify the development for it and make life easier for programmers, a huge number of libraries were created.  Some of them have become very popular over time.  Here is a small list of libraries that I consider well done and worth exploring: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>  This library provides the developer with an extremely simple but powerful tool for creating web servers.  The key to the success of Express was a minimalist approach and focus on basic server mechanisms without attempting to impose a certain vision of the ‚Äúonly correct‚Äù server architecture. </li><li>  <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/meteor/">Meteor</a> .  This is a powerful fulsteck framework that implements an isomorphic approach to developing applications in JavaScript and using code on both the client and the server.  Once Meteor was a standalone tool, which includes everything that a developer may need.  Now it is also integrated with front-end libraries, such as <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/react/">React</a> , <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/vue-introduction/">Vue</a> and <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a> .  Meteor, in addition to the development of conventional web applications, can be used in mobile development. </li><li>  <a href="http://koajs.com/">Koa</a> .  This web framework was created by the same team that works on Express.  During its development, which was based on years of experience with Express, attention was paid to the simplicity of the solution and its compactness.  This project appeared as a solution to the problem of making major changes in Express, incompatible with other framework mechanisms that could split the community. </li><li>  <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/nextjs/">Next.js.</a>  This framework is designed to organize server rendering of <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> applications. </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/zeit/micro">Micro</a> .  This is a very compact library for creating asynchronous HTTP microservices. </li><li>  <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> .  This is a library for developing real-time network applications. </li></ul><br>  In fact, in the Node.js ecosystem, you can find a supporting library for solving almost any task.  As you understand, building a similar ecosystem takes a lot of time.  Node.js platform appeared in 2009.  During its existence, a lot of things happened that are worth knowing to a programmer who wants to learn this platform. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">A brief history of Node.js</font> </h2><br>  This year, Node.js is 9 years old.  This, of course, is not so much if we compare this age with the age of JavaScript, which is already 23 years old, or with the 25-year-old age of the web, which exists in a form in which we know it, if we consider the appearance of the Mosaic browser. <br><br>  9 years is a short time for technology, but now it seems that the Node.js platform has always existed. <br><br>  I started working with Node.js from earlier versions of the platform when it was still only 2 years old.  Even then, although there was not so much information about Node.js, it was already possible to feel that Node.js is very serious. <br><br>  Now let's talk about the technologies that underlie Node.js and briefly look at the main events related to this platform. <br><br>  So, JavaScript is a programming language that was created in Netscape as a scripting language designed to manage web pages in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a> browser. <br><br>  Part of Netscape's business was the sale of web servers, which included an environment called Netscape LiveWire.  She allowed to create dynamic web pages, using server JavaScript.  As you can see, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing JS for server development is much older than Node.js.  This idea is almost as old as JavaScript itself, but in the times in question, server-side JS has not gained popularity. <br><br>  One of the key factors due to which the Node.js platform has become so widespread and popular is the time of its appearance.  So, a few years before this, JavaScript began to be considered a serious language.  This happened thanks to Web 2.0 applications, like Google Maps or Gmail, which demonstrated to the world the capabilities of modern web technologies. <br><br>  Thanks to the browser browser war, which continues to this day, JavaScript engine performance has increased dramatically.  The development teams behind the main browsers work every day to improve the performance of their solutions, which has a beneficial effect on JavaScript in general.  One of these engines is the already mentioned V8 used in the Chrome browser and used in Node.js.  It is one of the results of the desire of browser developers for high performance JS-code. <br><br>  Of course, the popularity of Node.js is based not only on a successful set of circumstances and on the fact that this platform appeared at the right time.  She presented to the world an innovative approach to server-side development in JavaScript.  Consider the major milestones in the history of Node.js. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2009</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  The appearance of Node.js </li><li>  Creating the first option <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/npm/">npm</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2010</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  The appearance of <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/express/">express</a> . </li><li>  The appearance of <a href="https://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> . </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2011</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  Exit npm 1.0. </li><li>  Large companies, such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> , started using Node.js. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2012</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  The rapid rise in popularity of Node.js. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2013</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  The advent of <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> , the first major publishing platform using Node.js. </li><li>  <a href="https://koajs.com/">Koa</a> release. </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñç2014</font> </h3><br><ul><li>  This year there have been dramatic events.
