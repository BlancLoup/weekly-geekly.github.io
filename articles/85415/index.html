Even those who publicly speak.  It looks quite sadly from the outside: a person from the stage (from the round table, in the deliberation room, in the classroom), at best, speaks to someone who is sitting close or in general nowhere.  From this everything else becomes uncomfortable.  They feel superfluous. <br><br>  Moreover, the speaker can really strain, even almost shout, but still he can not be heard from behind.  What does this come from?

      As a rule, due to the inability to banally manage their ligaments and throats (hussars!) There are 2 common mistakes: <br><br>  1. Trying to speak loudly so that everyone can hear, the person is very tense ligament.  What are ligaments?  That's right, muscles that literally squeeze your throat!  Well do we have?  Strong tension of the lungs, pharynx, mouth and ... squeezed, shrill voice.  Beautiful, is not it? <br><br>  2. The person tries to speak loudly, but he still sends the sound to himself!  As if you need to stun a nearby listener.  And it's awkward for everyone. <br><br>  What can be done about it? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To get rid of the first mistake, you must learn to speak with a relaxed throat.  This is taught to all singers and actors without exception.  And not by chance: the loudest, strong, stable and unbroken voice comes out just this way. <br><br>  As an exercise, I recommend: try to talk or sing in a low voice, gradually lowering it while you can.  A low voice is the maximum resonator, i.e.  all lungs should be ‚Äúdissolved‚Äù (relaxed and filled), throat relaxed.  Practice at least once a day.  This, by the way, is also a good exercise to increase lung volume. <br><br>  Additionally try to breathe out full lungs as fast as possible, but at the same time making a sound.  This will only work with uncompressed ligaments.  Feel this state. <br><br>  Finally, fix it in your subconscious: practice talking (singing at least one sound A or O) as loudly as possible, but without ‚Äúlifting up‚Äù your voice to the falsetto (very high, squeaking), while keeping the ligaments relaxed.  (Better in splendid isolation, in the car or in the shower) <br><br>  You should feel: resonating lungs, high air flow, ‚Äúringing‚Äù head (neck, sky, or crown) depending on the pitch, you can experiment) and a really loud voice. <br><br>  <i>Replica to the side: We had an excellent teacher in the theater: Misha Figlev.</i>  <i>He had a completely crazy, loud bass.</i>  <i>Usually he spoke softly, concisely, but if someone got him, it was enough for him to just say ‚ÄúSO!‚Äù ... People fell silent, the glass rang (by the way, if there is where to practice with wooden windows is also a good criterion), the <s>birds fell dead</s> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>He almost never swore: it was not necessary.</i> <br><br>  Well, what to do with the second misfortune?  It's all pretty simple: the whole thing in vowels.  It is no secret that vowels serve as a separator for consonants.  Part of vowels can be deleted on paper and at the same time one can guess what is written.  Those.  meaning bear more consonants.  But we hear them thanks to the vowels.  So, in order to send the sound further, to the back rows, to distant listeners, you just have to stretch the vowels more and more.  Remember when you call someone in the forest?  This happens automatically.  And the longer we pull the vowels, the ‚Äúfarther‚Äù we try to make a sound.  You can imagine a parabola, which would describe the object, emitted from the mouth.  He must "fall" on the last row.  What it will be for the subject - let your imagination and humanity tell you. <br><br>  It remains to combine the two skills: do not pinch the ligaments and slightly more than in the usual, "short" conversation, pull the vowels.  Do not be afraid that this may seem ridiculous.  It does not seem (if you do not exaggerate too much), but it is more than compensated for by the gratitude of the back rows, the majority of which are. <br><br>  And then you will not have to retell 2-3 times and the conversation will be more confident and calmer.  (It seems, about the fact that it is not necessary to hurry, I already told :) <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85415/</a></p>
