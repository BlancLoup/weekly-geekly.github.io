In that publication, I noted that I had observed an increasing number of web user interfaces resembling news feeds common to financial markets.  And I assumed that in subsequent years this phenomenon will only spread more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This is what the New York Times magazine is now noting through Clive Thompson's excellent article: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

        </script>
      <br>
    <blockquote>  He [Zuckerberg (Zuckerberg)] created a News Feed feature - built-in services that should actively notify each of the user's friends about changes on his page.  Students no longer need to spend time figuring out what's new in the pages of their friends.  Instead, youth need to log on to the Facebook network.  The News Feed, a page similar to an 18th century secular newspaper, will immediately appear on the screen.  It will contain the latest news about friends, and, constantly updated.  ‚ÄúThis is a description of everything that happens in their lives,‚Äù says Zuckerberg himself. </blockquote><br><br>  The news feed on Facebook appeared in September 2006, and at first it was annoying with too much information.  However, some time later, users are accustomed to the service, and, according to Thompson, now it is the heart of Facebook. <br><br>  In addition, the service is considered the heart of Twitter, Friendfeed, and the foundation of other services.  We also have clients like Twhirl who place all social feeds on the desktop of the computer, or applications for the iPhone like Twinkle and Twiterrific, thanks to which there are also feeds on the phone.  (How not to have such applications for BlackBerry!) <br><br>  This aggregation of information in the news feed is now used by many new online services that appear almost every week.  I would even say that this is the most common user interface online or the main page of the site that we meet today.  Services like <a href="http://outside.in/">outside.in</a> , whose home page resembles the front page of a newspaper, and which was launched a couple of years ago, also use the User Interface feed. <br><br>  Facebook staff created a <a href="http://outside.in/radar">outside.in radar</a> news feed that talks about news in your area.  What I particularly like about this ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù feed is that all the news is interesting and close to me.  For example, the news about guacamole in Los Dados was sent to a friend Alex Lines by a person unknown to me.  But it's not hard for me to find out who this person is (like on Twitter or Facebook).  The story of the fashion show designer duo Rag and Bone is interesting because the blogger Gotham Gal and other friends of the ladies visited him.  The Spotted Pig and Magnolia restaurants mentioned in the news are the most popular in the area.  The Standard Hotel, which is under construction, is already an integral part of the landscape in our area. <br><br>  As I wrote in my article in spring 2006: <br><br><blockquote>  Many people who have grown up with the design of newspapers and magazines may look at this user interface and find it ugly and boring.  But it seems to me that it is very useful. </blockquote><br><br>  The Internet is growing, and the search for some necessary things in it is becoming increasingly difficult.  Search engines have become the first solution to this problem, and today they are one of the integral elements of the Internet.  Feeds have become the second solution, and I believe that they will become an equally important factor when using the Web.  If you take a look at my analytics on Google, you'll note the following.  Search attracts only 29% of all visits to this blog, while links to it attract 40% of visits. <br><br>  And if you examine in detail the traffic generated by links to the blog, you will understand that the first 10 links are feed-oriented user interfaces (all but this blog and the stumbleupon site).  They attract almost 20% of the traffic to this blog. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  A source </th><th>  Number of visits </th><th>  Visits,% </th></tr><tr><td>  Google reader \ igoogle </td><td>  5677 </td><td>  6.60% </td></tr><tr><td>  Techmeme.com </td><td>  3708 </td><td>  4.30% </td></tr><tr><td>  Avc.blogs.com </td><td>  3447 </td><td>  four% </td></tr><tr><td>  Hacker news </td><td>  2357 </td><td>  2.70% </td></tr><tr><td>  Friendfeed.com </td><td>  1302 </td><td>  1.50% </td></tr><tr><td>  Twitter.com </td><td>  1267 </td><td>  1.50% </td></tr><tr><td>  Netvibes.com </td><td>  918 </td><td>  1.10% </td></tr><tr><td>  Bloglines.com </td><td>  643 </td><td>  0.70% </td></tr><tr><td>  My.yahoo.com </td><td>  642 </td><td>  0.70% </td></tr><tr><td>  Stumbleupon.com </td><td>  581 </td><td>  0.70% </td></tr><tr><th>  General feed data </th><td>  - </td><td>  19.10% </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  That is, feeds can be considered a great way for users to work on the Internet and find the right information.  I believe feeds will become stronger over time, and more users will rely on them.  It is clear that you are all one of their early followers.  And the traffic that feeds attract to this blog is much more significant than on some of the top websites. <br><br>  But think about the generation of Facebook.  My kids grow up using news feeds as their start page.  (These are not Yahoo portals, and not a search engine from Google.) Perhaps over time, feeds will even become more popular than search. <br><br>  That is, anyone who considers it impossible to monetize social networks, I advise you to pay attention to the feed and think about the possibilities. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39452/</a></p>
