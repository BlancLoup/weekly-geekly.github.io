  <section class="page js-page"><h1>4th meeting of Moscow startups. Investor Report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, on Sunday, November 9, we took part in the 4th meeting of <a href="http://startupoint.ru/">Startup Point</a> startups in Moscow, which was held at Ikra club.  Although the meeting was already 4th, we took part in it for the first time.  However, we immediately succeeded in joining the ranks of active participants: we were pleased to present our report ‚ÄúA successful startup: what and why go to an investor‚Äù and with even greater pleasure participated in the discussion of the submitted projects.  Actually, they will be discussed further here, since  investors were interested in the opinion of many, but we didn‚Äôt find it possible to give a detailed answer at once.  Under the cut details and accompanying photos. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, here we are talking about this event: <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/0000a8p7/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2fe/478/87a/2fe47887abc60bec91c8c355e778de70.jpg"></a>

      <a href="http://www.crabiza.ru/">Crabiza.ru</a> Game entertainment network.  The project is quite interesting and has the right not only to exist, but also to succeed.  However, the authors should more clearly identify and present in a favorable light their advantages and UTP, which will allow more specifically to calculate the costs and future income.  The rather abstract "million dollars" and "millions of users" voiced by the speaker, we, as investors, were not convinced.  It is clear that this entire million is planned to be spent on TV advertising, however, with the development of a clear advantage and advantage in this project, it can be widely distributed without ‚Äúextreme measures‚Äù. <br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/00004rbx/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a34/889/e4d/a34889e4d501de6c7bffc07bdb8cac17.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://yourmart.ru/">Yourmart.ru</a> Alternative to Yandex-market for regional online stores.  The very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking the search for products from online stores more relevant is very noble, but everything here is very dependent on performance.  The guys presented the alpha version, so, unfortunately, they failed to demonstrate clear advantages over the same Yandex.  However, it is clear that the authors believe in their project.  Therefore, the success that they have achieved to date (stated about 500 stores participating in the project) is quite understandable.  For our part, we can advise you to work out the technical side more clearly, so that the advantages become more obvious. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/000058sq/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/690/46f/7b8/69046f7b859120ffbd9682896ca37b6e.jpg"></a> <br>  Look around.ru - Mobile dating, geo-targeting.  The project is at the idea stage.  And I will tell you a very good idea.  In vain its author ran away without waiting for a start-up lynch, we counted on a slightly more detailed discussion :-) Yes, the idea is in the air and many now want to realize it, including the famous giant of the Internet dating market Mambu.  However, the author of the idea needs not to bury his head in the sand and not be sad about <br>  that Mamba, with their traditionally large-scale advertising campaigns and a huge number of users on projects, he would never surpass.  Everything is possible, if you think of a way to conveniently all the technical implementation and determine their advantages.  By the way, the author of the project has learned about Mamba‚Äôs plans from the audience.  In this regard, I would like to note the importance of communication and discussion of projects, because  inventing something in relative information isolation, the author risks to invent a bicycle. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/00006638/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/832/314/30d/83231430db57e6b815a5259b3d5bc823.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://news4people.ru/">News4People.ru</a> News about everything from everyone, for free and .... And, perhaps, it is still useless.  In the presented form, the project, unfortunately, is an analogue of many and many services that provide the opportunity to publish your news for free and enjoy the result.  The author of the project does not plan to take money from anyone or for anything.  And rightly so.  There is nothing to take, because. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/00007cq4/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e7/42d/49a/8e742d49afc18405b8bcfcfbf6b0a772.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://megaplan.ru/">Megaplan.ru</a> Task Scheduler, CRM for small business.  Obviously, the most significant and most successful (already today) project presented at the meeting.  The only thing that its authors should do is, perhaps, to define their Central Asia (and its varieties) more clearly and draw up promotion plans for each of them.  Because  the director of a small LLC is clearly looking for solutions for business planning in other ways than individual individuals who want to streamline their daily routine and plans for the year. <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/00008ae9/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b63/9ba/b84/b639bab84bbbd6b189b6775d635c7b34.jpg"></a> <br><br>  As a result, I can say that we were very happy to participate in such an event (separate respect to the organizers) and hope that this will not be the last time.  Moreover, our report was listened with attention <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/00009tbh/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ab/e91/15d/5abe9115d94abb582808ab21c603bcdb.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And we have already agreed to contact the projects that interested us.  So, who promised to call - call, and to those whom we promised to write - we will write <br><br>  Smiles of the participants at the end: <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/0000bxkq/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/116/a47/aa9/116a47aa973e8135aa59e647ae0b98f7.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And representatives of <a href="http://www.egenius.ru/">AVK-media</a> <br><br> <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/double_whiskey/pic/0000czgb/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88b/1e4/673/88b1e4673a8f2a8c4692c7f4470e4186.jpg"></a> <br><br><habracut><br><br><habracut></habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44286/</a></p>
