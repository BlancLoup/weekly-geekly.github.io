  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bios Urc Incubator Bios Urc will grow a tree from the ashes of deceased relatives and friends</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The bright memory and a handful of ashes in the urn under the fireplace - all that remains of their loved ones after death.  An alternative way to show respect for the departed and perpetuate their memory was offered by the company from Barcelona Bios Urn.  ‚ÄúWhen someone dies, he dies physically, but people close to him remember him,‚Äù says co-founder of the company, Roger Moline.  ‚Äú... Why not try to revive life from the ashes, give your loved ones a new life, embodied in a living tree that will decorate a house or garden?‚Äù In March-April of this year, the company completed a marathon at Kickstarter, where 356 backers were entrusted with their savings.  The company raised $ 73,000, exceeding the target of $ 60,000 by $ 13,000. We will tell you more about the project, so unexpected even for this crowdfunding platform, in our today's publication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/13f/929/405/13f929405c44fd70612e6ae2c8d53bfa.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To implement their ideas, the developers proposed using modern plant growing technologies in combination with their unique engineering methods.  At once we will specify that its similar development is a bio urn (Bios Urn) of the same purpose, but with the possibility of transplanting in a large forest and other open areas, the company already presented in May of last year.  At the same time, for several weeks in California, company representatives conducted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DstnFgIusJu0">preliminary survey of</a> many people of different generations, among whom Bios Urn was willing to purchase and was met with almost complete understanding and approval.  This was another confirmation that the chosen concept does not contradict the ethical principles of the majority of the respondents and the priorities of the Bios Urn team itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c94/551/74f/c9455174f29cb2b63b1f1b374e8bbf65.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Biodegradable urn Bios Urn</sub></i>

      According to the information provided on the official page of the project, the number of Bios Urn kits sold by the company for the year exceeded 60,000. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e7c/aa3/85b/e7caa385bff4c1d01110e3e9e37b16e4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Statistics and geography of sales Bios Urn</sub></i> <br><br>  We can say that the creators of <a href="https://urnabios.com/urn/">Bios Urn</a> came out on Kickstarter already having an impressive practical experience in implementing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúman-made reincarnation‚Äù.  A new project, this time being implemented in a home greenhouse, like the eponymous ‚Äúgadget‚Äù - an incubator, was named <a href="https://urnabios.com/incube/">Bios Inube</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78a/d3e/c01/78ad3ec01c91ebb52c3e9c3842573269.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBios InCube was designed for city dwellers with limited access to natural land, those who are looking for an alternative to traditional burial methods, as well as for people who want to connect meaningfully with their deceased loved ones,‚Äù says the Kickstarter project page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e19/c85/5ec/e19c855ec7ce6f38ae61c168e7858980.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>Incubator Bios Inube</sub></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/355/4f0/3dd/3554f03ddd8baa2c654d4b457ab08b92.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>The control unit with sensors monitoring the main modes</sub></i> <br><br>  The Bios InCube intelligent core, which provides the maintenance of the necessary modes when growing a particular tree, is represented by a circuit with sensors for the level of illumination, electrical conductivity, temperature and humidity of the soil and ambient air.  Data collected in real time is transmitted to a special application installed on the smartphone.  Thus, it is possible to monitor and, if necessary, make directional adjustments to the mode parameters using a smartphone, at any time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e96/5ff/e47/e965ffe47e15f50b0037ef8dbe0e05d0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The 76 cm high Bios InCube design has a diameter of 33 cm. The dust is placed in a special compartment in the lower part of the volume, the electronics unit and the seed of the tree placed in the urn are ‚Äúloaded‚Äù from above.  The biodegradable urn Bios Urn is made of paper, cellulose and carbon is a relatively small cylindrical bag with seed and soil mixture.  The growing root system, having developed from a seed placed in an urn during the decomposition of the latter, with time occupies the entire volume of the outer cube, and the soil is mixed with a layer of ash, which serves as a nutrient material for the future ornamental tree. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e17/1e2/176/e171e21762b28ed771ea5d8c362b236e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The outer walls of the Bios InCube are separated from the internal soil massif by the second wall.  Thus, between these two walls, a hollow space is formed, filled with water in a volume of 11.4 liters.  The water pump located in the lower part and the humidity sensor on the electronic control board - in the top in a pair, provide the dosed supply of fluid, its distribution and moistening of the entire volume of the soil mixture.  In addition to moisture control, an optimum conductivity sensor is supported by an electrical conductivity sensor that controls the level of fertilizer concentration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a92/6e9/995/a926e9995fe43940d3bced37e6032f48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For each tree, an application selects its own mode, according to which the growth process is monitored in real time.  In case the humidity sensor detects a critical level of moisture, the water pump is activated, forcing water into the inside of the tank through a special system.  On average, according to test data, a completely filled volume of water is enough to germinate a seedling within 20 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e72/89d/7d0/e7289d7d02b9ba2a316f6780a9d82e26.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Information is exchanged between the control unit and the smartphone via the home Wi-Fi network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/990/4ae/30e/9904ae30e3aec017962a41ecacc5da50.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At some point, the root system will take up the entire volume of the external container and the tree will slow down, and then stop growing altogether.  However, says Moline, the Inube owner can change such a scenario and plant the contents of the incubator in the forest or in the garden, and use the Bios Inube to germinate another tree - due to or independently of the original purpose.  As a soil mix for Bios Inube, as well as for Urn, ordinary coconut peat from coconut shell and vermiculite, which holds water, is used. <br><br>  As Roger Moline noted, the company maintains close contacts with its first and subsequent customers, who have already tested the early development - the Bios Urn urn.  If the hopes and expectations of the first Bios Inube customers come true, for which there is every reason, they will receive incubators in November of this year.  From March 2017, all interested customers will be able to purchase an incubator. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPPBB1QPP88%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhid6Y5dCswxBWEhL2YtIJ1OOGOsyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i><sub>Project page on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/biosurn/bios-incube-the-worlds-first-incubator-for-the-aft/description">Kickstarter</a></sub></i> <br>  <i><sub><a href="https://urnabios.com/">Project promo site</a></sub></i> <br>  <i><sub><a href="http://www.livescience.com/54924-gadget-turns-human-ashes-into-trees.html">Publication on the portal Live Science on May 31, 2016</a></sub></i> <br><hr><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for choosing sophisticated <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> equipment.
