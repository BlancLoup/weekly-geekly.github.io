Some problems.  Many settings are not suitable for real use, the installed design template cuts eyes and is not translated into Russian, it is not very clear where and what information to add.  We also found that in all the themes for this CMS there are obvious flaws: problems with localization, errors of plug-ins and scripts, non-working modules. <br><br>  At the same time, none of the Russian hosting providers provide CMS with design templates adapted for real-world goals and the necessary functionality of the site.  Usually, everything is limited only to installing a clean CMS on the hosting - the client should do the rest.  We conducted a special study and found that as a result, untrained users simply refuse the service.

      We decided to meet the user and fix the main problems of WordPress.  To do this, we have developed a comprehensive service "Ready solutions for creating a site based on WordPress."  Below we will talk about why this was done and how the development process took place. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#000"><b>Why we need ready-made solutions for creating a site based on WordPress</b></font> </h1><br><h3>  Fact one </h3><br>  WordPress is one of the most popular CMS in Russia, it has created more than 35% of sites in the .RU zone and almost 25% in the zone. RF.  This is not surprising, because the platform has a lot of advantages, including a simple and intuitive interface, a huge number of ready-made templates and add-ons (most of which are free), documentation in Russian, provides good indexing by search engines. <br><br><br><h3>  Fact two </h3><br>  A user with a small budget doesn‚Äôt have many opportunities to create a quality website.  You can use the services of a web studio, but even regional contractors charge for work on average up to several tens of thousands of rubles.  Therefore, all stages of creating a web resource lie on the shoulders of its owner - from the preparation of materials to the choice of design. <br><br><br><h3>  Fact three </h3><br>  In the West, there are specialized companies that are engaged in the production of design templates for WordPress.  For example, one of the world's largest manufacturers of design templates TemplateMonster offers more than 2000 themes for this platform. <br><br><br><br>  Based on these facts, we decided to make a single convenient solution for Russian-speaking WordPress users, combining the simplicity and elegance of this system with the best templates created by the international community. <br><br>  In a sense, the REG.RU team undertook to do a typical work of a freelancer or company, to which the customer comes with the requirements for the design and functionality of the new site.  The basic wishes are already taken into account in our decisions and give the client a ready answer to the question: ‚ÄúHow to create a high-quality website?‚Äù. <br><br><br><br><h1>  <font color="#000"><b>What kind of work have we done</b></font> </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a5/e7d/632/8a5e7d63230b28764aea749cec30c113.png" alt="image" align="right"><br><h3>  <font color="#000">Structure and functionality</font> </h3><br>  The REG.RU team identified the main types of sites that are created on WordPress, identified the main features of themes and plugins, and analyzed customer requests. <br><br>  According to the results, the most popular types of solutions were identified: a blog, a portfolio, a company website, an online store. <br><br>  Next, the basic requirements for each type of solution were formed, a list of typical site structures was compiled, and the necessary functionality was determined. <br><br>  For example, a ready-to-use online store has the following important features: <br><ul><li>  quick add product; </li><li>  creating categories; </li><li>  convenient shopping cart and order form; </li><li>  description of the properties of goods with the possibility of ordering with the selected parameter; </li><li>  filters and sorting of commodity items; </li><li>  delivery and payment methods are indicated in the basket; </li><li>  quick registration upon purchase; </li><li>  the ability to make discounts and promotions; </li><li>  sales statistics; </li><li>  Customer notification of the order of the goods; </li><li>  comments to the goods; </li><li>  static sections of the site and a number of other functions. </li></ul><br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#000">Design</font> </h3><br>  We found a well-established producer of design templates WooThemes and adapted its solutions for the Russian consumer: we translated the administrative part, created the main sections of the site, removed unnecessary modules and added the necessary ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad7/c99/013/ad7c99013dd5d630ee0a6f63415fb1fa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The topics were chosen with the expectation that the user has a minimal set of skills in site management, which means that only the most necessary and understandable modules in use should be present in the template. <br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#000">Hosting</font> </h3><br>  We took the choice of hosting characteristics for each option very seriously.  The user should not overpay for the extra services and facilities that he will never use, and at the same time receive the most reliable and high-quality solutions.  Therefore, REG.RU specialists carefully analyzed the needs of various types of web resources and for each type of ready-made solution they formed <a href="https://hosting.reg.ru/">special hosting rates</a> that ensure the most efficient and reliable website operation. <br><br>  For all hosting tariffs, we include a modern and convenient ISPmanager control panel, fast communication channels with a capacity of over 100 Gbps, unlimited traffic and much more.  Hosting is also protected by a free service ‚ÄúProtection against DDoS attacks‚Äù, which is activated automatically in case of a threat.  Data safety is provided by a backup service and a monitoring and emergency alert system.  REG.RU uses only SuperMicro fault-tolerant servers and data centers of Tier 3 class (2N), so the average server uptime is 99.9%. <br><br>  Hosting is the only thing the user pays for by purchasing the ‚ÄúReady-made solutions for creating a site based on WordPress‚Äù service, the chosen CMS-based solution is provided free of charge.  Therefore, we have tried to ensure the best quality hosting at balanced rates. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d6/730/869/5d67308693b1b251e233b115c5a6b6b4.png" alt="image" align="left"><br><h1>  <font color="#000"><b>What we did</b></font> </h1><br>  Now everything is quite simple for the client.  The service connects to an existing domain in just a few clicks.  You just need to choose the type of site and design template.  Further on, access to the administrative part of the site will be sent.  It remains only to add the necessary information - and the project is ready. <br><br>  In addition to ready-made solutions, REG.RU also offers specialized hosting for professionals - these are two options for automatic installation of a ‚Äúclean‚Äù version of WordPress to prepared hosting: classic virtual hosting from REG.RU and cloud platform Jelastic. <br><br>  When you connect a ready-made solution, the client will receive an instruction ‚ÄúHow in 10 minutes to familiarize yourself with the possibilities and bring the site up to date‚Äù.  In addition, the REG.RU support department will always be able to provide timely and qualified assistance to all customers who have activated the service, and answers to frequently asked questions will soon be posted in the FAQ section. <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ac/410/4e6/2ac4104e6db272f54bc98212228838f0.png" alt="image" align="right"><br><h1>  <font color="#000"><b>And we do not stop there.</b></font> </h1><br>  At the start, REG.RU offers a basic set of site templates, but in the future, more than 50 templates will be included for each type of ready-made solution.  In the near future templates from GavikPro, ElegantThemes, Themify and many others will be added. <br><br>  In addition, the functionality of each type of solutions will be improved based on incoming suggestions from users.  We strive to bring the quality of development and management capabilities to the level of popular designers, we add even the unusual content management capabilities for WordPress: Drag &amp; Drop and WYSIWYG directly on the site‚Äôs pages and others. <br><br>  In the coming months, we will also add ready-made solutions for creating websites based on other well-known CMS: Joomla, 1C-Bitrix, PrestaShop and others. <br><br>  The time for simple, "naked" services has passed.  Specialized hosting tariff plans and the installation of standard CMS versions are no longer so interesting for the mainstream client.  Users want to get a high-quality and customized product that will help solve a specific business problem, and we are ready to help. <br><br>  The main goal of REG.RU is to create the most useful product for users, therefore we are always open for comments and suggestions.  We will be glad to read your comments about the service and opinions about what other modules and types of solutions can be useful for creating a site based on WordPress :) <br><br><br>  More information about the terms of service available <a href="https://hosting.reg.ru/web-sites/cms/wordpress">on our website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226855/</a></p>
