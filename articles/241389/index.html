  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technology from Yandex, which will save us from paper movie tickets and queues at the box office</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You can buy movie tickets online for a long time.  But so far this has one major drawback in Russia: the electronic ticket has to be exchanged for a paper one at the cinema.  Often, you even need to defend the queue. <br><br>  We believe that this should not be so.  Paper tickets are an atavism of the past, an electronic ticket must be a pass to the cinema hall. <br><br>  Therefore, today we begin to install special scanners in cinemas, thanks to which you will no longer need to go to the cashier, stand in line to her, call the cashier your order number and receive a paper ticket.

      Today, such scanners appeared in the Formula Kino Horizon cinema, and by the end of the year they will be installed in another 20 cinemas of this network.  Now it will be possible to enter the hall using the QR code that ticket sellers always send to you online.  We came up with a solution that will make this opportunity a mass one. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6c/5af/b6a/c6c5afb6a14b4c638a9cda87e0509184.png"></div><br><br>  The technology is called Smartpass - in fact, it is just an application that runs on iPad mini, recognizes QR codes and sends data to the cinema system.  Its main advantage is that the cinema to install such a scanner at the entrance to each room is ten times cheaper than existing industrial solutions.  And Yandex even helps cinema to adjust everything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/d7d/d1f/25dd7dd1fa8c47f1a6218f2d2935a726.png"><br><br>  By itself, this idea came to us when we launched Yandex. Tickets, a service that aggregates the sellers' data and allows you to buy a movie ticket.  While working on it, we thought that in fact e-tickets are not that electronic - they still need to be printed and you still have to go to the cashier.  Everyone knows that there are industrial scanners that can let people into the hall by code, but they have too high cost and multiplex cinemas are expensive (from 80 tr.), Require complex coordination and long installation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9d/f4b/130/c9df4b1309e141468f510c2bced51c44.png"><br><br>  To recognize QR codes, Smartpass uses the <a href="http://zbar.sourceforge.net/">ZBar</a> library.  We tried many different and settled on it.  After scanning, the data is sent to the UCS Premiere system, with which most cinemas work.  Having printed a ticket, the cashier always tears off the spine from him before giving it to you.  It is called a strict reporting form, and the cinema must keep it for five years for reporting to the inspection bodies.  Smartpass can print the form remotely at the cashier - your participation is not required for this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8c/666/446/c8c666446f474a959a0266373c2a722f.png"><br><br>  Now the share of sales of electronic movie tickets in Russia is 6%, and in the West - up to 40%.  The main reason for this gap is low penetration of plastic cards in our country.  But we hope that people who did not go to the cinema, fearing queues or talking to cashiers, thanks to Smartpass will more often get out for interesting sessions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7f/f50/fbe/c7ff50fbe60b48f1ae531a979b58ed95.jpeg"><br><br>  Experimental series of scanners Smartpass, as I have already said, we will install in the Formula Kino network.  By the way, it was she who started the first in Russia to sell electronic tickets in Russia and has the highest share of their sales - 10.5%.  In January 2008, when the opportunity was just launched, Formula sold 83 such tickets, and now sells almost 90,000 per month.  Within a month, we will install scanners at 20 cinemas in the network in Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ryazan and Krasnodar, and early next year in St. Petersburg, Novokuznetsk, Murmansk and Syktyvkar.  But we really want technologies to develop and as many people as possible get the opportunity to go to the cinema without queues and extra printouts.  So we are ready to put Smartpass in other cinema networks that will turn to us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241389/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241389/</a></p>
