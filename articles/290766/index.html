  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How long should a cold call script be?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  Imagine for a moment a pretty young woman who hurries along a crowded street for some sort of business.  Her face is tense, her eyes are focused somewhere forward, between people scurrying everywhere and making it difficult to move. <br><br>  Here, someone on the left is trying to stick her advertising booklet.  After 10 meters, the beggar pulls her hand in the direction of her movement - ‚Äúfor God's sake, apply for treatment‚Äù.  All this is very annoying, but the tension has become habitual and chronic.  And now, in the middle of the street, a young man is catching up with her ... </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You probably think, and where is the woman, the people, the young man, if the publication is about ‚Äúcold calls‚Äù?  I started with this example so that you better understand the psychological state of the person to whom you will call ‚Äúon a cold one‚Äù.  This condition is very similar to the one I described above, the difference is only in context. <br><br><h4>  Gatekeeper </h4><br>  In the role of the gatekeeper, most often, the secretary.  It should be noted that the psychological tension of this, the first character on your path, is quite low.  He has to make only two decisions during the working day: to skip the caller further or not to miss.

      Yes, he has a number of instructions from the director, incoming incoming calls from time to time.  Most of all the mood of this character depends on the mood of the director.  If the director is in high spirits, this does not mean that it will be easier for you to pass this obstacle.  But it will definitely communicate more easily.  Otherwise <br><br><h4>  Director </h4><br>  As a rule, the director is a very busy person who has to make a large number of decisions during the day.  From minor to very serious.  This is exhausting, and it is this that explains the external rigidity of many directors and their brevity in conversations.  They simply save their time and energy, trying not to be distracted by insignificant and minor tasks during the day, if possible, entrusting them to their subordinates. <br><br><blockquote><h4>  What is there with our rushing woman? </h4><br>  So, in the middle of the street, a young man is catching up with a clear intention to meet her.  With a quick glance, she appreciates him - yes, on the whole, a handsome, pleasant man.  What next? <br><br>  <b>Mistake</b> <br>  He is attached next to and tries to start a conversation without a clear duration.  It is not at all clear how long he plans to go along with her and carry on a conversation.  In this case, with all the sympathy that the woman felt at the first moment, she would try to complete the conversation as soon as possible.  As for her, an uninvited satellite is just another distraction. <br><br>  Do not forget - that she did not just go for a walk.  She is in a hurry about her business and she doesn‚Äôt manage it so easily. <br><br>  <b>The right approach</b> <br>  He is attached nearby, quickly takes the phone number to call at a more convenient time for conversation and quickly disappears. <br><br>  Will a man get a phone or not - this is a matter of fact, a technical one.  It is important in this case that the man makes the repeated contact more easily, since he did not look like ‚Äúirritants‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúCold call‚Äù is this one, the first contact with the client.  Which is tense, somewhere in a hurry, is engaged in some important matters.  It is important to understand - <b>he does not wait for your call</b> .  And when you make it - you look like another distraction. <br><br>  Professionally developed script for the "cold call" - very short.  2-3 pages of A4, not more.  At the same time, the conversation algorithm itself can take no more than 1-1.5 pages. <br><br>  This short script takes all the details into account: <br><ul><li>  "Magnet" </li><li>  A greeting for the gatekeeper </li><li>  Reason for missing a decision maker </li><li>  Greetings for decision makers </li><li>  Key points of the scaling algorithm </li><li>  List of possible customer questions </li></ul><br><br>  It is important to clearly understand that the purpose of the initial call is to create interest sufficient for the client to agree to spend 30-60 minutes on our sales manager.  Do not hope that one of the clients will make such sacrifices in the first touch. <br><br>  But on the second touch, you also have an intrigue, which you, I hope, have caused in the first touch.  And the reason for the client to spend more time talking with you. <br><br>  Nonprofessionals often do not understand this and try to throw out a whole flurry of information on the client at the very first touch.  As a result, they become just another irritant, among others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290766/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290766/</a></p>
