    <a name="habracut"></a>  What is an auditor?  This travels to customers, and therefore inevitably work with a laptop that you have to carry with you. <br>  And at least a mouse, a calculator and an additional digital block are required for a laptop (if the laptop manufacturer has not provided for it, which happens quite often).  Yes, there are still moments when the calculator comes in handy.  Sometimes you need to do a couple of arithmetic operations, for the sake of which it is simply inadvisable to run excel or a calculator for Windows ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01d/04b/545/01d04b54562171bf48351597f49fb013.jpg"><br><br>  And here it appears on the horizon IT (IT? They?).  And the mouse, and calculator, and a digital unit in one bottle.  For all its apparent inconvenience, I experienced a rare feeling for myself, in common people called ‚Äúshut the f ** k up and take my money‚Äù, and ran to the store.  It cost me 1 575 rubles. <br><br>  What promises us for these 1,575 rubles, except for the combine itself? <br><ul><li>  Dimensions - 120x60x27 mm </li><li>  Weight - 106 g (83 g without batteries) </li><li>  Wireless Type - Bluetooth 2.0 </li><li>  10 digit LCD screen </li><li>  Laser sensor with an accuracy of 1200 dpi. </li><li>  PC and MAC support </li></ul><br><br>  So, taking advantage of this miracle, I suggest you <s>listen to</s> read what this device is of itself in a more detailed form. <br><br>  Before us is a box with the coveted device.  Inside, we see two AA batteries, a bunch of instructions in many different languages, and the mouse itself. <br>  What we do not see?  And we do not see the receiver, that is, the little thing that usually comes with a mouse to communicate with a computer.  After all, a bluetooth mouse. <br><br>  Cursing foully at his unprofessional inattention, he ran to the store for a blue-toothed adapter (yes, my laptop turned out to be without this happiness). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4fe/dd9/fae/4fedd9fae27c280d8580a478fc18cd49.jpg"><br><br>  Connecting the mouse turned out to be simple to disgrace - press the pen or paper clip (the button is recessed to accidentally press) the button on the back of the device and the adapter begins to see the new device, which is immediately connected, quickly installed and ready to work.  Additional drivers are not required (installation was on win7). <br><br>  The first thing you notice when you take the mouse in hand is the extremely high surface mark.  All the buttons immediately covered with fingerprints, visible to the naked eye. <br><br>  The mouse itself in the hand sits quite comfortably, although the corners of the palm are felt.  It is heavy, but personally I like it. <br>  The mouse is suitable for any palm due to the fact that the main buttons are very large and have a stroke that is the same with the edge and closer to the base. <br>  The mouse clicks out loud.  So loud that if you use it at night next to a sleeping person, you can wake him up.  But in the conditions of office work, it seems that this shortcoming is completely uncritical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a87/6e5/0cb/a876e50cb5c9fa3ea9b4aec40848006f.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard works in two modes - a calculator and a digital block.  Moreover, it is possible to input the data received in the calculator directly into the computer thanks to the Send button. <br><br><blockquote>  That is, it is necessary for me, roughly speaking, to write in the report the difference between 100 and 10. When calculator mode is on, I do the calculation, and when 90 appears on the screen, I will press the Send button and see this number in my document. </blockquote><br>  The keyboard keys have a nice move, but unfortunately, they are still small enough for comfortable blind input.  Although it may be just a matter of habit.  I still work with it with one or two fingers, looking at the small display (it shows the entered numbers even when it works in the digital block mode). <br>  Before ordering, there were big concerns about the fact that the number keys would involuntarily be pressed with the palm of the hand, but they turned out to be completely in vain.  The buttons are designed so that you do not accidentally click on them. <br><br>  Use the mouse wheel comfortably, but it only works in two directions.  Not enough, of course, technology free rotation Logitech SmartShift Technology, but it is not fatal. <br><br>  The laser sensor works perfectly on all surfaces that I could find: wood, paper, office chair fabric, home sofa fabric, and even glass.  The cursor is positioned perfectly, the delay after idle is minimal (literally a fraction of a second). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01e/236/a86/01e236a86f2af065411d101ea96ead3c.jpg"><br><br>  The battery consumption could not be estimated, because it did not use for long.  But here I have a suspicion based on the use of bluetooth devices that <s>changing the</s> battery will have to charge the batteries quite often. <br><br>  <b>We turn to the conclusions.</b>  As a mouse, the product is very good, although weight and angularity can frighten someone.  There is nothing to say about the calculator - take a regular calculator of this size and get the same sensations.  well ... almost the same.  Due to the bending of the mouse, the buttons are located in the ladder, which is perhaps not typical of ordinary calculators. <br>  The digital unit is expectedly a little disappointed, although it may take a little more time to get used to it. <br><br>  Who can advise?  People who do not want to carry a periphery trailer with them.  Very suitable for owners of netbooks, which not only surf on them on the Internet.  Perhaps suitable for those who want to stand out with an unusual computer accessory.  Not bad as a gift to inexperienced users. <br>  For those who work stationary with full-size keyboards, such a mouse is useless. <br><br>  <b>Now briefly about the main thing.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/31a/090/875/31a090875b7be390ddb30047ff4bdff5.png">  Pros: <br><ul><li>  multifunctionality; </li><li>  lack of receiver; </li><li>  work from ordinary AA batteries; </li><li>  attractive and unusual appearance; </li><li>  accurate and all-surface laser sensor; </li><li>  relatively fast response after downtime; </li><li>  suitable for both right and left; </li><li>  not picky about palm size. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f4/2cf/0ba/4f42cf0bacce1f825d088ebc2e43684b.png">  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  the keyboard could be more comfortable; </li><li>  lack of receiver; </li><li>  weight is not for everyone; </li><li>  the scroll wheel only moves in two directions; </li><li>  mark working surface; </li><li>  there are no already become familiar buttons "forward" and "back"; </li><li>  loud "clicks". </li></ul><br><br>  The lack of a receiver is in the pros and cons.  Because, on the one hand, if your laptop supports blue teeth, you don‚Äôt have to warm your head about busy usb ports and its transportation.  But if there are no embedded blue teeth - not only will you have to spend additional money on the adapter, you will also have to think about how not to lose it, because there are no cavities in the mouse for their transfer. <br><br>  As for me, I am satisfied with the purchase. <br><br>  ===================== <br>  <u>upd</u> <br><br>  At the request of workers real photos: <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/storage2/00c/ea7/162/00cea716232321910061eda0830e6814.jpg</a> <br>  <a href="">habrastorage.org/storage2/5bb/93b/fbd/5bb93bfbd167c4d4a492ab0fc9e73854.jpg</a> <br><br>  ===================== <br>  <u>upd_2</u> <br>  After two and a half months of active use (every working day, 8-10 hours), the mouse ate 2450 mAh fully charged batteries before use. <br><br>  ===================== <br>  <u>upd_3 after semi-annual operation</u> <br>  From the mouse, I still refused.  And that's why he refused: <br>  1. Sometimes it loses touch.  I would not say that this happens often, but even rare losses are not pleasant.  Ordinary mice, after all, completely devoid of this shortcoming. <br>  2. Under certain conditions, begins to stupidly wildly.  One of these conditions, to my surprise, was the ipad.  When it is turned on next to it, the mouse fools around (and even though for the sake of experiment, I even switched the ipad to airplane mode). <br>  3. Loud clicks still tiring <br>  4. And most importantly - a keyboard unit. <br>  Firstly, I was not used to it. <br>  Secondly, some clicks on the numbers are ‚Äúswallowed‚Äù.  That is, they are not displayed on the screen in the digital block mode to the computer. <br>  Third, he did not want to be friends with the software that came with the laptop.  Each time you press a button on the block appeared on the screen the inscription "num off" |  "Num is included". <br><br>  And yet, as a gift, I can still recommend the mouse.  To inexperienced users, my inconvenience will seem ridiculous, but it still produces the wow-effect. <br>  Several clients I worked for wanted the same in their accounting department :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147167/</a></p>
