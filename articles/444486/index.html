In addition to Russian scientists, specialists from the USA, Germany, France, Italy, Belarus, Great Britain, Canada and the Czech Republic will take part in the program. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe scientific program is in draft form.  Now it has more than 450 pages, it has more than 70 scientific studies, ‚Äùexplained the scientific coordinator of the experiment, Sergey Ponomarev.  ‚ÄúNow work is under way to compile a cyclogram of the experiment.  All studies need to be put in a four-month program.  This issue is now being addressed by Russian and American specialists.  I hope that in September the final version of the program will be formed, which will be held by biotic commissions in both Russia and the United States. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the NASA application, there are about six studies in a four-month isolation experiment, and they are so extensive that if you break them down in directions, more than 20 experiments will be released.  Discussion of joint Russian-American research will be held in September. <br><br>  <b>August 2, 2018.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe plan that on January 15, 2019, preliminary studies will start, ten-day isolation will begin.  On March 1, 2019, the crew of the expedition will enter the Ground Experimental Complex for four months of isolation.  Transfers are possible, but within one or two days, everything is going according to plan, ‚Äùsaid Mark Belakovsky, general manager of the project, head of the department of the State Scientific Center of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (RAS). <br><br>  The scientific coordinator of the experiment, Sergey Ponomarev, clarified that the preparation for the experiment is proceeding on schedule, almost all the equipment necessary for the SIRIUS experiment is already in place.  ‚ÄúIt remains only to adapt some of the software systems, to bring some of the equipment from other countries, but by 90% everything is ready,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Mark Belakovsky also informed that about 70 candidates applied for participation in the experiment.  "To date, approximately 50 Russians and 20 foreigners from the USA, France, Belarus, and India have expressed a desire to take part in the SIRIUS experiment."  So far, there is no firm agreement on how many foreign participants will be in the experiment, but three candidates have already expressed a desire to take part in an eight-month isolation experiment, which is scheduled for early 2020. <br><br>  <b>October 8, 2018.</b> <br><br>  NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/sirius-1819-seeking-participants-for-a-4-month-mission-in-russia">invites US-speaking US citizens</a> to participate in the SIRIUS project, which starts next year in the Russian Federation, simulating a six-man crew flight into space.  The US space agency expects to complete the selection of participants by early November. <br><br>  In addition to American citizenship, candidates must have a number of characteristics: age 30-55 years old, not more than 180 centimeters tall, weight restrictions, good health.  The applicant must also speak not only oral Russian and English, but also be able to write, the presence of flight military training, scientific or technical education is welcomed. <br><br>  <b>December 7, 2018.</b> <br><br>  In the period from December 04 to December 6, 2018, the operability of the medical-technical ground-based experimental complex (NEC) of IBMP was checked.  The purpose of the test was to determine the readiness of the complex after its modernization for the 4-month experiment "SIRIUS 18/19". <br><br>  Works performed at NEC in preparation for conducting experiments on the SIRIUS program: <br><br><ul><li>  The LED developed biorhythmic controlled lighting system was developed and installed in all experimental installations of the NEC to ensure the optimal psycho-physiological state of a person; </li><li>  a digital video surveillance system was designed and installed, consisting of 84 cameras, of which 66 cameras were installed inside the premises of all experimental installations and a simulator of the planet's surface; </li><li>  in order to improve safety, the system for maintaining the atmospheric composition in experimental facilities (EC) has been improved;  a system for supplying oxygen and nitrogen to the EC with the help of appropriate generators was developed and installed; </li><li>  In accordance with the objectives of the experiment, an internal secure digital network is installed in each module; </li><li>  for greater confidence in the landing and work in space suits created an imitation of the lunar surface. </li></ul><br>  The EU-50, EU-100, EU-150, EU-250 modules with all life support systems, including the newly created systems of LED dynamic lighting and digital video surveillance, passed the test. <br><br>  The NEC operability test and evaluation of the equipment placed in the modules was carried out by a group of testers (commander - cosmonaut, Hero of Russia EI Tarelkin), who were in a sealed complex for 2 days. <br><br>  As a result of the audit, it was established that the medical-technical complex, life support systems, ground control center and service systems are fully operational and ready for the SIRIUS 18/19 experiment. <br><br>  <b>January 30, 2019.</b> <br><br>  The start of the SIRIUS-19 model insulation experiment is scheduled for March 19, 2019. <br><br>  The main and backup crew consists of pilot-cosmonaut Yevgeny Tarelkin, Polina Kuznetsova, Anastasia Stepanova, Darya Zidova, Artem Knyazev, Dmitry Glukhikh, Stefania Fedyai (all - Russia), Daniil Dubari (Republic of Belarus), Reinhold Poviljaitisa (Reinhold Pivilovi-iphiolaus), Daniil Doubari (Republic of Belarus), Reinhold Poviljaitisa (Reinhold Pivilov Ichilov). started background research and training sessions.  The arrival of another crew member - Allen Mirkadyrov (Allen Mirkadyrov, USA) is expected in the coming days. <br><br>  <b>February 25, 2019.</b> <br><br>  The scientific program of the experiment "SIRIUS-19" <br><br>  Currently, at the international level, issues related to the development of near and far space objects are being addressed, options for flying to the Moon and the Moon, the construction of orbital lunar stations, and planetary bases are being considered.  Mankind is preparing to make a super-long flight to Mars. <br><br>  To accomplish such ambitious tasks, an integrated modern system of medical and biological flight support is required, which has been developed in ground-based model experiments and on board the international space station (ISS). <br><br>  The four-month isolation experiment ‚ÄúSIRIUS-19‚Äù is carried out within the framework of the international project ‚ÄúSIRIUS‚Äù (a joint project of the SSC of the Russian Federation - IBMP RAS and HRP NASA with the participation of the space agencies DLR and CNES, as well as specialized organizations of the space industry from Russia, USA, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Belarus and other countries) and is one of the stages of preparation for the development of deep space. <br><br>  The main objective of the SIRIUS-19 experiment is to study the adaptation mechanisms of the human body to the conditions of 120-day isolation in a germobject with an artificial habitat simulating a space flight with the development and testing of various means of preventing the negative effect of a complex of insulating factors. <br><br>  The main objectives of the project: <br><br><ul><li>  to assess the effect of long-term isolation of a person in a germobject on the psychological and psycho-physiological state, mental and physical performance, as well as on the basic physiological systems of the body; </li><li>  provide monitoring of the health status of testers, as well as the environmental parameters and sanitary and hygienic conditions of isolation; </li><li>  to test experimental equipment in the germobject that is available and being prepared for delivery onboard the ISS; </li><li>  to assess the adequacy of the isolation model in comparison with the real space flight as it is based on the various physiological systems of the body; </li><li>  create an integrated database of scientific data obtained during the implementation of the project; </li><li>  conduct research cooperation between various research centers at the international level; </li><li>  to work out mechanisms for the creation and functioning of international cooperation, which is responsible for setting the scientific tasks of promising flights to the moon; </li><li>  to gain experience in implementation and a scientific and organizational basis for subsequent joint long-term isolation experiments with a mixed crew. </li><li>  The total number of experiments is 79 (psychology - 27, physiology - 24, immunity - 5, metabolism - 9, microbiology and hygiene - 12, telemedicine - 2). </li></ul><br>  <b>March 11, 2019.</b> <br><br>  At the meeting of the credentials committee for the selection of test volunteers to the international isolation model experiment ‚ÄúSIRIUS-19‚Äù, chaired by Academician Orlov OI, Director of the State Research Center of the Russian Federation - IBMP RAS  The question of the distribution of functional duties among the crew members was considered. <br><br>  By the decision of the credentials committee, it is accepted to approve Evgeny Igorevich Tarelkin as a test crew commander, Djarova ipravkaevyeevna test engineer-flight engineer, Stephanie Olegovna Test engineer, Crew tester-doctor Povilaitis Reinhold (Reinhold Povilaitis), test researcher, Stepanova Apov Reyhold tester, Reinhold Povilaitis test-researcher, Stepanova Aryan Reyhold tester (Reinhold Povilaitis) ) a test researcher.  Dubar Daniil Aleksandrovich and Kuznetsova Polina Grigorievna were appointed doubles. <br><br>  <b>March 19, 2019.</b> <br><br>  On March 19, 2019, the 120-day isolation experiment SIRIUS-19 was launched at the State Scientific Center of the Institute for Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, conducted jointly by SSC RF - IMBP RAS and NASA HRP in cooperation with partner organizations with a wide participation of specialists from Russia, USA, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Belarus and other countries. <br><br>  Going beyond the Earth's orbit and conducting manned research of the nearest objects of the Solar System (with the prospect of creating extraterrestrial orbital complexes and planetary bases) is a new stage in human exploration of outer space.  It requires solving the technical, physiological and psychological problems that the crew may encounter during the trip. <br><br>  It is necessary to better study all possible risks of a long-term space expedition, as well as to develop biological and psychological technologies for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of astronauts and astronauts. <br><br>  All these factors are fully studied in the framework of the international project "SIRIUS" - Scientific International Research In Unique Terrestrial Station (Scientific international research in a unique ground complex), which includes a series of isolation experiments with durations of 4, 8 and 12 months for five years. <br><br>  SIRIUS is a continuation of the medical and psychological research begun in the Mars-500 project and the current development strategy of Russian manned spacecraft in preparation for the development of deep space for work on board a circumluminal orbital station. <br><br>  The proposed scientific program is also a continuation of the NASA HRP mission to provide space exploration beyond low-Earth orbit, which will reduce the risks to human health and health through a targeted program of basic, applied and operational research that promotes the development and maintenance of human health standards and preventive measures. <br><br>  The SIRIUS-19 experiment scenario is aimed at choosing a place for a future lunar settlement and will reproduce the main characteristics of a real space flight to the moon, including operations in orbit and on the surface of the moon. <br><br>  During the mission, the crew will perform tasks related to space flight operations, such as daily medical monitoring and in-depth health assessment, regular physical training and events corresponding to the flight scenario. <br><br>  In addition, the crew will carry out a research program in physiology and psychology to study the effect of isolation in a confined space on human psychology and physiology and group relationships, with the aim of assisting in preparing for a long-term space research mission. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Draft concept of a series of model experiments based on NIBP with international participation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>The overall goal of the program:</b> <br><br>  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the State Research Center Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IBMP) have a long and successful history of collaborating on joint research related to human health and well-being. space.  Both NASA HRP (Human Research Program) and IBMP are conducting research to identify preventive measures and technologies to protect the health of astronauts and cosmonauts during space flight. <br><br>  Based on this common task, collaboration between NASA HRP and IBMP presents opportunities for collaborative research on scientific issues to facilitate the experimentation of each of these organizations and the cooperation of partner organizations.  NASA HRP and IBMP propose to use controlled, isolated environmental conditions for conducting research on human psychology and human performance, in order to support research aboard the International Space Station (ISS), as well as to reduce risks in space interplanetary missions. <br><br>  Medico-Technical Ground Experimental Complex (NEC) IBMP has unique means for conducting model studies of space flight.  NEC is an analog platform with multifunctional experimental segments capable of accommodating from 3 to 10 crew members. <br><br>  Research conducted at the NEC usually requires isolation and a stable environment, which is provided by local life support systems, and is carried out over a long period in order to study the effect of isolation and enclosed space on the mental health of the objects of study. <br><br>  NEC can be used to study life-support systems, space activities, medical prevention equipment, crew performance and dynamics, crew autonomy, effects of isolation, and associated physiological stressors.  In addition, the NEC can provide unique resources, such as variable volume of residential compartments, special day-night cycles and innovative working environmental conditions for research in accordance with the needs of testers. <br><br>  Thus, joint research at NEC provides a unique opportunity to effectively address the risks of manned space flight.  NASA and IBMP unite the efforts of both organizations and are interested in consolidating with other international partners in the use of NEC for critical research related to psychological and physiological reactions to long-term isolation. <br><br>  Understanding these reactions will provide information to joint research to develop prevention tools that reduce the undesirable effects of prolonged isolation.  Successful means of prevention, developed in ground-based studies, will then be tested on the ISS to assess their effectiveness in order to use them in long-term orbital flights and the system of medical and biological support for promising interplanetary missions. <br><br>  <b>International project "SIRIUS":</b> <br><br>  These tasks will be fully studied in the framework of the international project "SIRIUS" - Scientific International Research In Unique Terrestrial Station (scientific research in a unique ground complex), conducted jointly by the Russian State Research Center Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the American Human Research Program NASA in cooperation with partner organizations with the broad participation of specialists from Russia, Italy, Germany, and other countries. <br><br>  The program of the SIRIUS project is designed for a period of up to five years.  During this time, it is planned to conduct a series of isolation experiments of approximately two to three weeks, four months, eight months and twelve months. <br><br>  The proposed research program based on the NEC was developed on the basis of the proposed draft concept and strategy for the development of Russian manned space vehicles in the period up to 2035 and is a continuation of studies of medical and psychological risks in the Mars-500 project during long autonomous manned space flights and the operation of orbital and on the planetary bases. <br><br>  <b>Brief rationale for the approaches to the formation of the IBMP scientific program:</b> <br><br>  The long-term fruitful comprehensive studies of the health status, behavior and activities of crews in isolation, conducted in the USSR and Russia based on the needs of medical and psychological support of long-term space flights, were overwhelmingly focused on the study of test activity of a human operator. <br><br>  Under the "test" activity refers to the implementation of various methods for assessing the state of health, physical, mental and professional performance.  At the same time, the practically unexplored area remains the actual behavioral aspects of a person‚Äôs stay in conditions of limited volume, sensory deprivation of a person - that is, what happens between the test activity of the subjects and takes most of their life. <br><br>  Without a thorough continuous study of the activity of the crew in artificial habitats, it is almost impossible to answer the questions of optimizing the size, layout, ergonomics, health standards, necessary prevention regimes and food resources for future interplanetary ships and planetary settlements.  Without a behavioral analysis of crews of different composition and length of stay, the answers to these questions will be very approximate. <br><br>  In part, the lack of comprehensive behavioral research was associated with a clear focus on the aspects of the operator‚Äôs professional readiness to perform the tasks, in part, with ethical restrictions.  In addition, to solve these problems, there was an acute lack of methodological and instrumentation equipment - portable wearable wireless devices, which allow continuously and invasively register daily activity and location of the subjects examined in relation to each other and specific thermocamera objects. <br><br>  In recent years, the development of computer technology has led to the emergence of wearable portable recorders-actigraphs, allowing not only to continuously record daily locomotor activity of a person, to determine the duration of rest periods and night sleep, but also to keep records of physiological parameters (pulse, skin resistance). <br><br>  The tremendous opportunities that are opening up to scientists for their use have already prompted NASA to collect data on the astronauts' daily activity, duration, and sleep quality (for example, the ‚ÄúSleep‚Äù experiment).  Similar studies to collect background information regarding microgravity conditions were carried out by Americans and ESA in the Mars 500 project and continued in the Hera project. <br><br>  In addition, over the past three years, various countries (Russia, Germany, USA) have developed portable wearable sensors for positioning a person in a hermetic volume.  They make it possible not only to determine the coordinates of a person in a confined space, but also the direction of his gaze, the relative position of people and objects at each moment of working and free time.  During sleep, it became possible to record body position and motor activity, which complements the traditional registration of heart rate, ECG, blood pressure and allows you to assess the quality of sleep. <br><br>  The combination of the described technologies will allow to conduct a full-scale analysis of the behavior of the crew that is mixed in gender composition in the containment under prolonged influence on the body and psyche of limited space, sensory deprivation, monotony and limited communication with the outside world.  The significance of such work can hardly be overestimated in the light of space crews' upcoming projects for flights of mixed crews and deployment of bases on other planets. <br><br>  Another important area of ‚Äã‚Äãresearch is to work out in ground conditions abnormal situations that may arise in real space flight.  In this regard, there are several important tasks: <br><br>  1. Providing qualified assistance to non-specialists in cases where, for a number of reasons, the crew doctor cannot perform this function.  The described situation requires careful study on the ground and the development of certain algorithms of the crew in emergency medical situations, including the use of telemedicine technologies. <br><br>  2. The action of the crew in the event of various kinds of technical malfunctions that can lead to an accident with serious consequences that threaten the life and health of crew members.  In this regard, it is advisable to comprehensively study the effect of stress on behavior, performance, as well as the physiological and psychological state of health of volunteers, testers, to develop instructions and recommendations for the crew‚Äôs actions in emergency situations, and also to develop a system of tests that would determine the relationship between individual stress tolerance and health .  The information obtained during the execution of these tests could not only help in drawing up algorithms for the crew‚Äôs actions in an extreme situation (for example, it is personalized to dose the shift time of an on-board engineer who fixes a technical problem), but also to compile individual workload graphs depending on the psycho-physiological reserves of the body. <br><br>  <b>Project tasks:</b> <br><br>    ,           , , -      ,   : <br><br><ol><li>      ( , , )         .               -  ,    . </li><li>                 ‚Äì          ( ). </li><li>         (   )         ,       ()  . </li><li>    ( )           ,         .

Evaluation of the content of harmful impurities in the gas environment is carried out by methods of sampling and analysis of air samples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ma/fl/06/mafl06tkjtabzci2rp0-sxze2he.jpeg"><br><br>  The modules provide: <br><br><ul><li>  visual observation of the activities of the crew and control of the experiments; </li><li>  automatic maintenance of the temperature of the gas environment and the possibility of its regulation within the specified limits at the choice of the crew or in accordance with the conditions of the experiment; </li><li>  automatic maintenance of a given relative humidity of the gaseous medium within the prescribed limits and removal of excess moisture from the gaseous medium. </li></ul><br>  In each compartment, a constant automatic monitoring of gas environment parameters is carried out with data transfer to the ground control panel and the EU-150 control panel. <br><br>  In accordance with the agreed periodicity, the level of microbial contamination of the gaseous medium and the dust level are monitored for compliance with the requirements of GOST R 50804-95. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w4/oa/47/w4oa47q7-yrcst4udbsvwcjs3me.jpeg"><br><br>  Why is it about the flight to the moon, and the project is called SIRIUS? <br><br>  The name was chosen for a long time - there were 106 options. <br><br>  We stopped at this - Scientific International Research In Unique terrestrial Station (Scientific research in a unique ground complex) - that is, SIRIUS. <br><br>  Sirius - star system, which is located in the constellation Canis Major.  The brightest star of the night sky.  Many ancient cultures emphasized this brightest star. <br><br>  The IBMP explains: the name symbolizes the purpose of the project - to shed light on the understanding of human performance in long flights to other planets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4c/sy/ev/4csyevkdzxq2brssrha9hnhwbww.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2020, an eight-month experiment is already planned at IBMP, and in 2021, an experiment for 12 months is planned. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI allow the crew of the international experiment to start the experiment,‚Äù said the director of the institute, Oleg Orlov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe will be back soon,‚Äù replied Yevgeny Tarelkin, the captain of the crew, who accompanied him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u3/oy/el/u3oyeluby-qqgcd1myc3swnn7ze.jpeg"><br><br>  Coming out on the simulated surface of the moon, the commander of the crew Tarelkin will be together with the tester Povilaitis. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhile one exit is planned, there may be more there,‚Äù said the commander.  According to him, during the exit they will take soil samples, will remotely control the rovers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/mu/ev/7ymuevbqmleoq5kgvqwswukahws.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/me/xg/nqmexg7cyrx80sr4q0uw9omh3sg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yc/km/6a/yckm6aviolphsk7cp3lzthl_dda.jpeg"><br><br>  According to Tarelkin, the participants in the experiment are completely isolated from the outside world - to the extent that they are taken away by cell phones.  ‚ÄúThis is one of the psychological conditions: no communication, complete isolation.  The only thing is that it will be possible to communicate with the family by e-mail once or twice a week, ‚Äùhe said. <br><br>  Any member of the lunar crew has the right to leave the experiment, if suddenly it becomes unbearable.  He will simply be considered "lost."  Strictly speaking, this is the main goal of the experiment on any simulation, including the flight to the moon.  As experts emphasize: not technology, but man is the main link in space flight.  Regardless of its complexity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444486/</a></p>
