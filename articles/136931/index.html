      The main advantage of this constructor is that the creation of games does not require any knowledge of programming languages, everything is done through the construction of actions in the built-in event system. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think many of you are thinking about creating your own game, but by itself, the game is a difficult task, but for those who are not at all familiar with programming, it seems like a dark forest. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e1b/906/90a/e1b90690a369ab958aa861133891d207.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A team from <a href="http://www.scirra.com/">scirra.com</a> has recently distributed two of its constructors: <br><br>  - Construct Classic (Windows) Absolutely free <br>  - Construct 2 (HTML5) Shareware (with restrictions) <br><br>  Well, now let's talk about the distinctive characteristics of each. <br><br>  The first one, namely Construct Classic is distributed absolutely free of charge and allows you to create DirectX games for the Windows platform.  Its main advantage in the open source code, that is, when creating a game, you can safely sell it and use it for other commercial purposes.  However, this does not make it weaker as a constructor.  The capabilities of Construct Classic are perhaps in many ways greater than those of Construct 2, but this is more likely due to the shortcomings of the second and so far limited capabilities of html5. <br><br>  Here, for clarity, the debut video, revealing the possibilities and what is Construct Classic. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/N3VYSQZ28FI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhSIODxObYlRts0puclZWsToV2-aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A variety of genres in the designer really happy, for me it is just perfect for creating platformers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/987/d13/d7e/987d13d7e62a9dab03b6c4a5d13f95da.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The simplest example of creating a platformer in Construct Classic goes like this: <br><br>  - Adding a pre-drawn (or downloaded from the Internet in the form of a sprite) character, and then the animation of his movements.  The disadvantage is that you can add animation only on individual frames, and not the whole (as for example, in .gif format).  But if you, for example, draw the animation in Flash yourself, the problem is solved by frame-by-frame saving. <br>  - Assign a special Platform behavior to your character (in this behavior, you can edit such properties as movement speed, jump speed, gravity, assignment of control buttons, etc.) <br>  - Creating a surface (support) for the character on which he actually will run. <br>  - Adding background on a separate layer. <br>  - Adding enemies, game points, sounds, etc. <br>  - Adding events and actions to the Evevnt Sheet Editor (for example: if a character touches an enemy, then the character takes life). <br><br>  The designer does not limit you in fantasy over the abilities of your character, having a detailed understanding, you can easily teach your character to fly, climb walls, swim, etc. <br><br>  If someone is interested, then the detailed process of creating a platformer is discussed in this article: <br>  <a href="http://scirraconstruct.ru/guide/articles/quick-start/platformer-for-5-minutes/">Create a platformer in Construct Classic in 5 minutes</a> . <br><br>  Here are some examples of games developed in Construct Classic <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bNmBGXaURx4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjt5A2Ee6xIOxguZUV_cqpZfRt7gw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJPYqD0v9cM&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi2Gy3Ki71WZWm60kcvMcnZZH5HoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In addition to games, the designer has the ability to create simple applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db6/795/663/db67956639e970776b47c68658fcb058.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now let's talk about the second brainchild from Scirra, which allows you to create games in HTML5.  Namely, about Construct 2. At the moment it is distributed in three versions. <br><br>  The first option is free.  You are given a designer with limited functionality and without a license.  In this embodiment, creating a masterpiece rather will not work, because the limit of 100 events and the limitation of the number of layers will not allow the toy to unfold to its fullest. <br><br>  The second option costs $ 79 and includes the creation of an unlimited number of events and layers.  And also has a limit license, if your income from the game or application does not exceed $ 5000. <br><br>  The third option provides all the same as the second, only the license is acquired (as far as I understood) completely and this option will cost 375 green. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e29/703/ae1/e29703ae1a4a7c6d45e6e98a2158fd2e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Construct 2 is primarily different from Construct Classic with its slightly reduced capabilities.  At least, there are very few objects and behaviors in it, unlike its predecessor.  But meanwhile the designer himself has become even friendlier to the user and has mastered the live dragging of images into the program using the means of drug and drop.  And most importantly, the ability to create games for devices that support HTML5, including support for touch controls (Hi iOS). <br><br>  An example of the initial creation of a platformer in Construct 2. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/5RlSmkSbleI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhLwGJhS73PgJ9AJjUphuRRc2KRoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Physics in Construct 2 (also available in Construct Classic), Box2D is used as an engine. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fASJyCABFMU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhinu1s_HDSQXCjWn3EXcc-61l7Mfg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In conclusion, I can say that one of the main drawbacks of both designers is that they only work under Windows.  This of course does not prevent you from trying to launch a program in Wine or Crossover, but still the fact remains.  As a result, you can get together with a small company of several people and try to create something ‚Äúyour own‚Äù and maybe even release that ‚Äúyour own‚Äù into the light.  Alone working on the game is possible, but it is difficult, if it is said simply, this does not mean quickly.  At a minimum, you need to think about creating game mechanics, graphics, music, and then implement it all.  But the process of building the game, the interaction of game mechanics, linking the main events with the actions, is implemented in Consctruct at a very high and accessible level for the user to understand.  Of course, this is not the first such game constructor, (take GameMaker for example), each has its own advantages and disadvantages, but in its simplicity of developing 2D games for Windows, at least Construct Classic clearly takes the lead. <br><br>  All for the same interested: <br><br>  <a href="http://construct2.ru/kontent/obuchenie/uroki/bystryi-start-sozdaem-tds-igru-za-5-minut.html">Lesson on creating TDS games in Construct 2</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://www.scirra.com/construct2/demos">Examples of games created in Construct 2</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136931/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136931/</a></p>
