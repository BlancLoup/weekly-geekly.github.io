Some try to attack as many people, companies and large organizations as possible, after which they become very popular and famous all over the world.  These are the great villains of the Internet. <br><br>  Today, we recall hackers whose cyber crimes made them famous around the world, but eventually led to imprisonment.  Some of them even switched to the other side, saying goodbye to the dark side of the Internet. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>1. ‚ÄúCracka‚Äù: a mysterious British teenager who hacked into the database of the director of the CIA</b> <br>  The latest cyber-criminal who has attracted enormous media attention is a 16-year-old teenager from the UK who <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/10/18/stoner-high-school-student-says-he-hacked-the-cia/">managed to hack the</a> personal correspondence of the CIA Director, the head of the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence.  He was also able to crack the telephone accounts of the Director of National Intelligence, identifying the 31,000 agents of the US government (the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security). <br><br>  In fact, the identity of this child is not revealed, but we know that he calls himself ‚ÄúCracka‚Äù and declares that he is a member of a group of hackers called ‚ÄúCrackas with Attitude‚Äù who advocate for the Palestinian movement.  ‚ÄúCracka‚Äù was arrested last month in the south east of England. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6b/bfd/08c/c6bbfd08cf9e46f28dbe48806fa77c14.jpg"><br><br>  <b>2. ‚ÄúHomeless Hacker‚Äù who betrayed Bradley Manning</b> <br>  <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lamo">Adrian Lamo</a> is also known as the ‚ÄúHomeless Hacker‚Äù because he always travels, connects to the Internet and carries out attacks via WiFi in Internet cafes and other public places where there are access points to the Network.  Although he started his hacking career quite legally: analyzing security threats for such large companies as Microsoft, Fortune 500, Bank of America or Yahoo !, he was later arrested for stealing data from more than 2,000 The New York Times subscribers. <br><br>  In 2002, he was sentenced to six months of house arrest and two months on probation for the above crime.  He is also remembered for the betrayal of US soldier Bradley Manning: in 2010, he surrendered Manning to the Federal Government for stealing classified information about the US Army and its subsequent transfer to WikiLeaks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/479/405/0bd479405d744664b92c8cedee31ced1.jpg"><br>  <i>Adrian Lamo, Kevin Mitnick and Kevin Poulsen (2001).</i> <br><br>  <b>3. ‚ÄúSoupnazi‚Äù: 170 million bank cards were hacked from Miami Beach</b> <br>  Albert Gonzalez is a hacker who is hiding behind the alter ego "Soupnazi" and is the person responsible for one of the biggest thefts of personal data in the history of the Internet.  He got access to accounts and stole over 170 million bank cards of users from all over the world. <br><br>  This <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story%3Fid%3D8374399">hacker was arrested in 2008 at a Miami Beach hotel</a> and in 2010 was sentenced to 20 years in prison by the Federal Court of New Jersey.  It is believed that Gonzalez worked with hackers hiding in other countries, making them very difficult to catch. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/758/4b9/e1c/7584b9e1cc38404fb37b11f976343465.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. A hacker from St. Petersburg stole $ 10 million from Citibank</b> <br>  After the end of the Cold War, St. Petersburg became one of the main hotspots of cyber crime.  In this city, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2592%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Vladimir Levin</a> made an amazing career that could be the script for the next James Bond movie. <br><br>  In 1994, after graduating from the St. Petersburg State Institute of Technology, Levin managed to steal $ 10 million from Citibank clients, and he did all this from his apartment in St. Petersburg.  Unfortunately for Levin, Interpol tracked him down and arrested him at Stansted Airport in London.  He was extradited to the United States, where he was sentenced to three years in prison and fined $ 240,015 (plus a refund of all the stolen money).  It is believed that Levin could be a member of an organized group (the leader of this group or the person taking orders) associated with the Russian mafia. <br><br>  <b>5. Most wanted cyber criminal in USA</b> <br>  The case of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">Kevin Mitnick</a> is perhaps the most controversial case in the history of the Internet.  In 1983, he managed to hack the Pentagon network and systems of very large companies (such as Nokia or Motorola).  He combined the techniques of social engineering, hacking computer and telephone networks.  This made him the most wanted cyber-criminal in the world, which led to a highly publicized investigation, and two years later he was arrested. <br><br>  After serving five years in prison, Kevin Mitnick decided to leave the "dark" side of the Network.  He <a href="http://club.cnews.ru/blogs/entry/shpionit_za_pismami_v_vashej_kompanii_mozhno_takzhe_legko_kak_podklyuchit_optikovolokonnyj_kabel_v_bukvalnom_smysle_">became a security consultant for</a> several companies and began to hold information security conferences in universal forums.  He currently runs his own security consulting company, Mitnick Security Consulting, LLC. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5d/5c7/1e3/d5d5c71e309d45d0b23eaf09c939cf96.jpg"><br><br>  This is our Top5 hackers. <br>  In your opinion, who is the greatest hacker? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280091/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280091/</a></p>
