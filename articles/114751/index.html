  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How the payment reception companies in Ukraine work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that, due to the nature of my current activity, I often have to use electronic money (calculating with freelancers, buying domains, advertising services, replenishing mobile phones, etc.). <br>  Since lately I have slightly moved away from using bank cards, I use ordinary payment terminals for these purposes. <br><br>  Frankly speaking, only for the last 2 months of use, I was a little shocked at the quality of the services provided, it seems that the activities of companies that provide money transfer services through payment terminals are not controlled by anyone from government bodies, respectively, and the quality of services is far from perfection: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - some of the payment terminals ‚Äúforget‚Äù to issue a check due to the lack of paper in them to print it (and for one individual machine, this can continue for 1-2 weeks) <br>  - some terminals successfully ‚Äúforget‚Äù that the user has deposited money, and accordingly ‚Äúforget‚Äù to charge them to the specified account <br>  - the work of the support centers of these terminals is simply terrible (the operators are completely incompetent, calls are not accepted during working hours, it is impossible to extract a response on the complaint, etc.) <br>  - general literacy and the work of the operators of payment acceptance operators (from ‚ÄúTV‚Äù on one of the terminals, up to 404 errors on the operator of the payment acceptance operator when selecting the section ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù).

      I would like to describe one of the most fun situations that happened to me so that others would not make mistakes. <br><br>  An evening, a large shopping center in the center of Kiev, an account replenishment terminal from the EasyPay company ( <a href="http://easypay.ua/">easypay.ua</a> ; <a href="http://easysoft.com.ua/">easysoft.com.ua</a> ) with the inscription ‚ÄúTilevidie‚Äù in one of the menu items on the screen. <br>  I do not know who invented adding ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù (easy) to the name of the enterprise, but, IMHO, this was a clear overkill. <br>  We try to replenish the wallet in the Webmoney system, indicate the wallet number, the terminal offers to feed it with money, we insert the first bill ... <br>  And here we will find disappointment, the terminal delays the bill, thinks for a long time and again shows the start page with a suggestion to choose where we want to pay ... Neither error messages, nor cash voucher (which, by the way, is required for ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù more than 20 hryvnia in accordance with the legislation of Ukraine). <br>  We try again to choose Webmoney, we enter the wallet, the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù terminal offers to enter the bill again, but, for some reason, it can no longer be pulled into it. <br>  We call the center, the girl offers to indicate her terminal number, wallet ID, thinks for a long time and says that, unfortunately, now she can‚Äôt see anything, and, obviously, money will be credited to the account within 12 hours. <br>  For the next day, I check the accrual ... for some reason I am not even surprised, there is no money, we call the center again, wait 5 minutes until the operator deigns to answer, now the response strategy has changed: ‚ÄúWait 5 working days.  Collection will be made, after that we will call you back and let you know when funds are transferred. ‚Äù  Well, let's wait, I already wonder what this will all end with. <br><br>  It takes more than 5 working days, of course, that no one ever called me. <br>  I decided to remind myself about myself, I called the number of the call center indicated on one of the terminals for 10 hours, but for some reason no one responds at all, in response just to ‚Äúlong beeps‚Äù, we start to search the network for other numbers of this wonderful office.  We find, call, explain the essence of the question, wait a few minutes while the operator thinks about the essence of the question, then, finally, the operator clarified the number of the wallet and terminal, thought for a moment and gave the answer ‚ÄúYou know, we didn‚Äôt see your payment.  When asked how I can receive the funds I deposited and why the terminal did not give me a cash receipt for depositing funds, which is a violation of the law, the operator did not give birth, but she advised <a href="http://easysoft.com.ua/About/ContactUs.aspx">me</a> to look at their website <a href="http://easysoft.com.ua/About/ContactUs.aspx">easysoft.com.ua in the</a> section Contacts, which was done. <br>  Try to follow the link, this is not the result of habraeffect, it is just someone forgot or did not want to specify the contacts of the organization. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/42/49/4249151f1d4189823782204dd5238411.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Total: <br>  - the money has gone somewhere (where the official representatives of the company cannot say) <br>  - there is no place to complain (there are no contacts) <br><br>  What makes me happy in all this: <br><br>  - although I had to replenish my wallet with a substantial amount, but I began to replenish from a small denomination note (how I felt) and so we can assume that I did not fly <br>  - gaining invaluable experience about possible jambs that can lead to loss of funds. <br><br>  Ps.  All of the above reflects the real situation, the name of the company is real, I see no reason to hide it, the country should know its heroes by sight, especially considering the fact of serious logos (Thawte, PCI certified, Nod 32, etc). <br>  If representatives of the company are present at Habr√© and want to speak out and comment on this wonderful fact, no one forbids them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114751/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114751/</a></p>
