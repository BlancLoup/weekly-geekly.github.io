      <i><b>Disclamers</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>The following information is for guidance only and is not a guide to action.</i>  <i>Any use of the following means violates the license agreement and leads to criminal liability.</i>  <i>I do not bear any responsibility for your problems with the law, hardware, software and brains.</i>  <i>Enjoy reading.</i> <br><br>  The topic is based on the <a href="http://forum.ru-board.com/topic.cgi%3Fforum%3D55%26topic%3D9756%26start%3D1980">branch about activation on the board</a> (registration is required) <br><br>  Out of habit, I went to the board.  I hoped to see a simple tool that works on the principle of a single button, providing 100% performance.  It turned out that not everything is so simple in the pirate kingdom.  So that you do not have to reread hundreds of pages of text, I give an overview of the main trends and means. <br><br>  I will consider with pluses and minuses that pirates for Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2 are currently offering us. <br><br>  <b>How does Windows work?</b> <br>  After installing the operating system, you have 30 days - the trial period.  During this period, you can use the operating system with full functionality.  After this period, the system will remind you of activation by a pop-up window, an inscription on your desktop, and a black screen.  Microsoft provides a legal way to reset activation.  This reset can be performed 3 times.  To perform activation reset, we need to open a console (command line) with administrator rights and execute any of the following commands: <br><br>  <b>slmgr / rearm</b> <b><br></b>  <b>sysprep / generalize</b> <b><br></b>  <b>slmgr.vbs ‚Äìrearm</b> <b><br></b>  <b>rundll32 slc.dll, SLReArmWindows</b> <br><br>  It should be noted that napalm in its activator provided a way to reset this counter.  So we get a perpetual trial that needs to be maintained every 30 days.  At the moment it is the most painless way to live without activation.  The system will not be different from the original installed and will live forever.  I dare to note that not everyone wants to throw off the activation every 30 days (you can use the scheduler).  Since this method is not suitable for everyone, the following methods exist: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/09e/6ab/e83/09e6abe83a211be30686b432dc6e1b10.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>1. Activation with the Key Management Service</b> <br>  I will describe the technology itself.  There is a server that is activated by a special key.  After that, it becomes able to activate other operating systems that access it with a request.  The request can be either in automatic mode (internal network with DHCP, DNS), or manually (by entering several commands).  The technology is intended for corporate users.  Please note that no software is required to install. <br><br>  Pirates have expanded the idea with the server and provided 2 options to choose from: <br><br>  <i>A) A dedicated server</i> that you run in a virtual machine and activate the operating systems you need.  Convenient for those who do not want to rely on others, for the local network of a small enterprise.  A computer is required.  Able to run a virtual machine from time to time (additional 512 megabytes of RAM) <br><br>  <i>B) "Chinese server".</i>  Several activation servers are available on the network.  To activate, you will need to register the IP address of one of these computers and periodically monitor whether this server is alive.  It should be noted that the disadvantage of this activation method is that it is necessary to have an Internet connection. <br><br>  After the activation is completed, it does not work for life, it is periodically checked and updated.  The maximum activation period is 180 days.  This means that you need to connect to the Internet more often than in 210 days (activation + 30 days period). <br><br>  Apply a simple way and a complete description is in the corresponding branch on the board. <br><br>  <i>+ Ease of use</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ Reliability</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Not all OS versions break</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Temporary activation (up to 180 days)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Internet access is required (or the ability to run virtual machines</i> ) <br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c8/AwardBIOS_CMOS_Setup_Utility.png/200px-AwardBIOS_CMOS_Setup_Utility.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. BIOS firmware</b> <br>  The following 2 activation methods are based on the principle used by OEM manufacturers of computers (Sony, Dell, Lenovo and others).  3-step technology.  To complete the activation, you must comply with 3 points: <br><br>  <i>A) The presence of a key</i> to activate <br>  <i>B) Availability of the</i> manufacturer‚Äôs <i>certificate</i> in the operating system <br>  <i>C) The presence of SLIC</i> tables in the BIOS. <br><br>  Manufacturers prepare in a special way the bios of the computer, stitching data into it, which the operating system then receives.  This allows the system to verify that it is running on genuine hardware and to perform activation.  This data, flashed into BIOS, is called SLIC. <br><br>  History: For whist table version 2.0 was required.  The new generation of operating systems requires version 2.1. <br><br>  The next step, the manufacturers prepare a special image of the operating system into which the manufacturer's certificate and other garbage are implanted (a bunch of very necessary trial software, drivers).  Usually this disk is applied with a laptop and users should install the OS only from it. <br><br>  Pirates modify the BIOS for your motherboard (by adding the SLIC table), you flash it and get an indistinguishable from a legal computer.  Next, you need to install the certificate (using a modified distribution or activators) and activate the system. <br><br>  On the same board and several other resources there are ready bios.  You can ask more experienced colleagues to prepare a bios for you. <br><br>  <i>+ 100% reliability of the method.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ Activation of life, you can not be afraid to put updates.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Not all BIOSes and computers are supported.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- BIOS flashing operation is dangerous</i> <br><br><img src="http://apcmag.com/system/files/images/vista_ubuntu_13.article-width.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3. Emulation markers through the loader.</b> <br>  The most popular method of hacking at the moment.  The technology is identical to the previous method with the only difference that instead of integrating the SLIC table into the BIOS, we emulate it at the software level.  In the general case, a boot loader is installed (or broken), which at the stage of system launch slides a SLIC into it.  There are 2 main types of this method: <br><br>  <i>A) Using a third-party loader for emulation.</i>  As a rule, GRUB is used, known to many Linux users.  He loads an already standard system, but she doesn‚Äôt suspect that he is working on the left hardware.  The problem with this bootloader is that it works very poorly on raids by some manufacturers.  The second disadvantage of this system is that additional time is spent on launching to display the new bootloader. <br><br>  Examples of such activators are: <br>  Windows Vista / 7 Activation Installer (x86 &amp; x64) (Based on vistaloader`a 2.1.2 and Patched Bootmgr) <br>  Windows 7 Loader (x86-x64) - Orbit30 and Hazar (Based on vistaloader`a 2.1.2) <br>  Windows.7.Activator - HAZAR (Based on vistaloader`a 2.1.2) <br>  Windows 7 Loader Release 5 - Orbit30 (Based on vistaloader`a 2.1.2) <br>  Windows 7 Loader Safe Edition v2 - napalum (Based on vistaloader`a 2.1.2) <br><br>  <i>B) Modifying the standard Windows bootloader.</i>  There is no shortage of this method with the increase in OS startup time.  On the other hand, there is a greater chance that the system will not break the first time and you will get a black screen after a restart. <br><br>  In both cases, there is a chance that with the next update of the system the machine will stop loading.  Also in some cases, activation may not work and you will get a black screen.  Will have to rearrange the system.  With the decision of the last point, many try to cope in various ways. <br><br>  Examples of such activators are: <br>  Windows 7 stupid activator v.1.0.1 - stupid_user <br>  Windows 7 Developer Activator v1.1.3 - despite the name of Microsoft has nothing to do. <br><br>  It should be noted that all activators are recommended to activate only the Ultimate version of the operating system. <br><br>  <i>+ Availability</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ Simplicity</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- There may be problems with updates.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- May not work on some systems</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Increased load time</i> <br><br>  <b>3.1 Napalm Activator</b> <br>  The activator, which our compatriot spreads - napalm, stands apart.  This miracle combine is called simply - Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3 <br><br>  It is a kind of combine, which includes several activation methods at once.  The main advantage is its safety and automatic operation.  You just need to run the activator and spit into the ceiling for 45 seconds.  Then he will do everything himself.  The main disadvantage is the intractability of the main developer.  Anyone can ask the author a question and hope to get an answer in their own language, which pleases. <br><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/7a/98/7a98dac658b4f8a50c44399b77f8a03c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I will describe a few points that a neophyte might encounter: <br><br>  <i>Loader</i> - at startup, a loader menu will appear, which will give the opportunity to choose whether to load the system without a hack or with a hack.  This is a precautionary method and guarantees the loadability of the system in any case.  Also in the default mode, the system will not be activated when using Hibernate.  To solve both these problems, you should activate the system in the advanced settings using the Safe mode (the default is Safest mode).  More information about this can be found in the FAQ to the program, which is all in the same forum thread on the board. <br><br>  <i>Internet</i> - suitable for activation only corporate versions.  In essence, this is the first method described by me.  The only difference is that the automatic mode is used and the servers are selected according to the list included in the program. <br><br>  <i>Certificate</i> - suitable for owners of computers that have a SLIC table in their BIOS.  These are owners of computers on which the new operating system has already been preinstalled. <br><br>  <i>49516 Trial Days</i> - uses an activation method taken from Windows Hyper-V Server 2008 R2.  This method was originally planned for servers, now left for review.  I do not recommend that they activate client operating systems. <br><br>  <i>Trial Reset</i> - reset all activation counters.  I wrote about this method earlier. <br><br>  <b>4. Patching</b> <br>  For the activation of the operating system are responsible 2 services and several files.  The technology of patching is that the program blocks the launch of these services and patches (or renames) the files.  So we get rid of the screen reminders about the inactivity of the OS, get rid of all the shortcomings of other methods.  At the same time, Windows Update remains operational and the system is authenticated.  It should be noted that this method is still young and is not recognized as effective by many developers of activators. <br><br>  Now there are 2 solutions based on this method: <br><br>  <i>A) RemoveWAT.</i>  Picks out the activation system with the root.  The main disadvantage of this system is the impossibility of removing / adding system components without the demolition of the activator. <br><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/a8/f0/a8f09d63cf47c0991c80ac014292f3a9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>B) CHEW-WGA.</i>  A completely new product, now being tested by a large number of people, including me.  No flaws were detected.  It should be noted that the program works on 2008R2.  Recommended for use uncle Qia. <br><br><img src="http://smages.com/i/22/2c/222c4ccba3556224f4dbb875c0ded950.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>+ Maximum simplicity</i> <i><br></i>  <i>+ Works everywhere</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- There is a theoretical impossibility to install some updates.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Ease of banning this solution.</i> <br><br>  <b>What I did not consider:</b> <br>  I did not consider the activation of computers that are sold with Windows 7. The technology is to slip another key, but to get computers with such a system until the 22nd will not work.  The bottom line is to buy a system with the weakest version of the OS and install Ultimate in its place. <br><br>  There is a legal way to get the key.  To do this, you need to register on the special site as an African engineer engineer.  After 2 weeks, you have the opportunity to go to their store, add the Windows 7 Pro distribution to your cart, get a legal key and activate the operating system.  It should be noted that it activates only the PRO version.  If you drive this key in Ultimate, then after activation you will receive a PRO with the appropriate functionality.  Works in any localization of Windows.  I did not describe this method, since our black brothers are already afraid of such an influx of African engineers with Russian IP-Schnick.  He who seeks finds. <br><br>  <b>FINDINGS:</b> <br>  When I see a lot of text, I automatically flip through to the bottom to see the cherished "conclusions" and not read all that nonsense that the author graphed. <br><br>  So, what is the use of a mere mortal?  Now my advice is to wait, if possible, on October 22 and see what will please us with the new ones.  An avalanche of updates is expected and some activators may stop working. <br><br>  If you can not wait to activate the system, then I advise you to use CHEW-WGA.  It is simple and reliable.  If you do not want to change the system files or you really want to activate Windows - the best choice would be Windows 7 Loader eXtreme Edition v3 from napalm, which is worth using in automatic mode. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for attention.</b> <br><br>  <b>Post scriptum</b> If you can, buy an operating system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72798/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72798/</a></p>
