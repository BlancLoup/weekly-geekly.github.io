  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Read Habr in the mail. results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On October 1, an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/238795/">article</a> was written about the service that was made to work with Habr's posts.  The service downloaded new post titles and, upon request, sent a ready downloaded post to the post. <br>  Today I stopped the service.  All active subscribers turned off. <br>  I share information in figures and service results. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Honestly the results of the service is not satisfied. <br>  First of all, there were a lot of mistakes, which, although corrected, did not correct until the end. <br>  Secondly, did not wait for habraeffekt, though I hoped. <br><br><h5>  Errors </h5><br>  I will simply list the errors that were and which have either been corrected or not corrected so far: <br>  1. All new downloaded article titles along with the link went to the database.  And when a request was received for obtaining an article, a link was pulled out of the database by the article number.  However, a situation arose in which there were requests for an article that I did not download, i.e.  articles that were published before the launch of the service and which are not in the database.  In this case, the service did not download the article itself, but the main page of the site (where the best publications of the day are).  As soon as I found it, I fixed it. <br>  2. New articles like mailing list came in the mail.  Time passed, the article was unexpectedly closed on Habr√©.  If in the browser I went to the link and saw the page ‚ÄúAccess to publication closed‚Äù, then for some reason this page was not downloaded in my service and an error fell out.  Not corrected so far. <br><br><h5>  Observations </h5><br>  1. The service, working with test mail and receiving requests, kept only the ‚Äúsubject‚Äù and ‚Äúsender‚Äù from the request letters.  As soon as the letter was saved in the database, it was immediately removed from the mailbox.  Those.  I did not keep the body of the letter anywhere.  Therefore, I apologize for the fact that perhaps the users wrote something in the body, maybe they asked questions, I did not see it. <br>  2. Most users did not immediately understand that the commands needed to be written in the subject of the letter, and not in the body of the letter.  Therefore, the first letter from them was wrong.  After the service sent a response that the command was incorrect, the user was corrected and there were almost no problems.

    <h5>  Numbers </h5><br>  9 days (round-the-clock) the service worked. <br>  56 hubs were used to get new articles. <br>  465 new post titles were saved in the database (for mailing). <br>  113 users who used the commands and sent requests to the mail. <br>  64 users who have subscribed to the newsletter receiving new articles. <br>  357 requests received from users. <br>  265 requests were correct, the rest contained incorrect commands in the subject line. <br>  12 requests - at most the number of requests from one user. <br>  37 users made only one request and that's it. <br>  4 users were surprised by the originality of their mailboxes (anonim0101 @, ya.terminator48 @, cloaca @, idontwannatellyoumyemail @) <br><br>  I‚Äôll not be able to run it back yet.  Someone liked someone not.  First I want to get feedback from everyone in the form of comments or suggestions.  To this end, a letter was sent to anyone who had sent the request at least once to offer their comments and suggestions. <br>  And by the results we will see. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240011/</a></p>
