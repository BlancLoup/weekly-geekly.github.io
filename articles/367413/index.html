What seems incredible to us now can become everyday reality in five years.  Before you my assumptions about how our future will look like.  So, the first startup: <br><br><h4>  "Live Free" or "Live Free" </h4><br>  The legislation of developed countries is becoming more complicated every year.  You have created a popular startup, and you have a lot of money?  Congratulations, along with a bunch of banknotes, you received a couple of thousand people who are actively trying to sue you this money.  How not to make a mistake and not to fall into the trap of lawyers, with the speed of a machine gun releasing confused laws?  The answer is obvious - install the Live Free mobile app. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/246/4ba/8fc/2464ba8fc96847d0b7e023a1fb8e95c8.jpg" alt="image">

        </script>
      <br>
      How does it work: <br><br>  Suppose you are stunned by the shape of your new secretary, who has emphasized them with a strict but tight business suit.  Trying to give the girl a compliment, open your mouth and ... spit it out sharply: <br><br>  - You are late for 5 minutes! <br><br>  The secretary is quenched, and you try to smooth out your rudeness, but it turns out: <br><br>  - A lot of work, waiting for the plan of my day.  - And your voice is some kind of unnatural barking. <br><br>  The girl is already thinking about a job change, turns around sharply, and you make the last attempt, trying to gently stop her by the elbow.  However, you miss and clumsily fall near the trash can. <br><br>  This is how the Live Free app protects you from possible accusations of sexual harassment in the workplace using your position.  Implanted into your nerve paths, the chip supplied with the application cleverly controls the nerve signals that go to your muscles.  With intelligent automatic video processing, Live Free Artificial Intelligence is able to recognize patterns of current events.  Using the latest Big Data advances and connecting to IBM Watson, smart AI at the physiological level hinders your illegal behavior.  In controversial situations, you can send a formal application and get or not get permission for your specific action in a particular situation.  Algorithms are constantly being improved.  Now, each of your actions must be approved by the lawyers "Live freely."  Did you think Orwell wrote a dystopia?  As if not so. <br><br>  There is a nice bonus plus: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, in the evening you leave the office of your more successful competitor after failed negotiations.  Overcome with envy, you can't resist and steal the purple Maserati of your business foe from the office parking lot.  If the application ‚ÄúLive freely‚Äù mistakenly allows you to commit an illegal act, then you are officially exempt from criminal liability, regardless of the severity of the crime you committed.  Whatever you commit.  And continue to be free.  All responsibility is the company "Live Free".  Agree, it is very convenient. <br><br>  In conclusion, I note the subtle humor of the developers of the application, who had the irony to call it that way. <br><br><h4>  "Perfect family" </h4><br>  The demographic situation in developed countries suggests that fewer people of reproductive age are going to have their own children.  On the other hand, adoption lines are only getting longer. <br><br>  How to make the adoptive family and the orphan find each other?  There are about eight thousand different factors that allow you to choose the right pair.  Psychological compatibility, family dwelling in the area most favorable for the development of strong baby skills.  Financial position.  All these factors are calculated.  Big Data with cluster analysis to help you.  Happiness is near.  However, not all so simple. <br><br>  Remember how in childhood, offended by your parents, you wanted to leave home?  Or when parents said: ‚ÄúYou will behave badly, we will give you to another family.‚Äù  Dreams Come True.  We must be careful in their desires. <br><br>  A law will be passed allowing children of any age, when requested through the ‚ÄúIdeal Family‚Äù app, to change parents.  Why such a law will be adopted?  It's all about enhancing child care.  There will be technologies to determine the ideal "family" compatibility.  As soon as this becomes possible, the question will arise: "Why does a particular child have to spend at least an extra hour in a family that is not ideal for him?"  Human rights come first.  Serfdom parental rights will be forgotten, like the ugly ghost of the past. <br><br>  Now answer the question - are you sure that your child will resist the temptation?  In the future, having good children will not be beneficial.  After all, the better the child, the greater the number of successful parents will want to take him into their family.  So the better your child, the harder it is for you to compete.  Get ready now, develop your parenting skills. <br><br>  Or "Improve your parent skills," as they say in Silicon Valley.  I lived there for some time and had access to amazing technologies that are already getting implemented. <br><br><h4>  Sixth Sense </h4><br>  You walk with the bride in the magnificent winter Petersburg.  Thaw on the street.  And suddenly a big icicle falls from the roof, threatening your wedding, to which 500 guests have already been invited.  Obeying the Sixth Sense, you rush at the bride with the agility of James Bond, fall with her into a melting snowdrift, and a lump of ice crashes down on the place where you have just been. <br><br>  The bride, moving away from the shock, asks: <br><br>  ‚ÄúDear, how did you find out about the threat?‚Äù <br><br>  You are a little embarrassed, admit: <br><br>  - I felt the right buttock ... <br><br>  This is how the Sixth Sense application works.  The fact is that the whole street is controlled by video cameras with motion sensors.  Cameras see people and a falling icicle.  It is reasonable to immediately send an alert to these people, for example, on a cell phone.  However, as long as a person gets a smartphone out of his pocket, reads a message, understands what to do ... In general, during this time a whole iceberg will fall. <br><br>  The developers of the ‚ÄúSixth Sense‚Äù acted wisely and created a microchip that is implanted under the skin.  Chip is recommended to implant it in the buttocks.  I do not know why‚Ä¶ <br><br>  After installing the application and implanting the chip, the learning process begins.  The chip sends a spectrum of various signals.  Your ass literally burns until you try to understand what is required of you by trial and error and do not perform this action.  After a couple of months of adaptation, you become a superman and react to a variety of life situations automatically, without even realizing what is happening, and without using the mind.  Indeed, when you are led by the ‚ÄúSixth Sense,‚Äù you do not give yourself an account of your actions.  This is just a new instinct. <br><br><h4>  "Forcibly nice ... you will be" among the people the application is also known under the name "In love" </h4><br>  What is the biggest possible tragedy in the life of a particular person?  Maybe the wrong choice of profession?  Harmful habits in youth, undermined health?  Or, say, the loss of a large inheritance due to a lawyer's mistake? <br><br>  All tragedies pale before the most important.  In fact, we all live for love.  Love, if it exists, pervades every moment of life, no matter how long it is allotted to it.  People who have experienced this high feeling say that without thinking they will choose six months of life in love than a long rich existence without it.  True love visits a person at best a couple of times in a lifetime. <br><br>  If you think well, it becomes clear that the greatest tragedy in life is unrequited love.  Unhappy love sucks all the colors of the world, making life empty and worthless.  Therefore, it is difficult to overestimate the usefulness of the application "Forcefully ... you will be." <br><br>  The application must access the implanted sensors inside the person you want to fall in love with.  Either it is necessary to equip a dozen drones, hung with the most advanced sensors of contactless reading of biological parameters. <br><br>  Work begins: <br><br>  At a time when the object of your lust is watching movies, when its gaze stops on billboards with attractive images of people, when it turns around following a vending passerby, tricky software analyzes readings of pressure sensors, tracks the slightest changes in pulse, blood glucose level, scans width pupils in each moment, takes into account the level of cortisol and endorphins, the degree of sweating and thousands of similar parameters.  Then artificial intelligence compares biological reactions with seen images of people.  As a result, we get a template of a person with whom your goal is ready to fall in love. <br><br>  Then, using special capsular viruses, your DNA is changed in such a way that you look like a generated pattern that appeals to your chosen one. <br><br>  It remains a trifle.  A software simulator using game mechanics pumps your communication skills, behavior, reactions to stimuli in a couple of months, so that when he sees your new image, the chosen one immediately falls without feelings from admiration. <br><br>  For an extra dollar, the application organizes the perfect first date so that your grandchildren and your grandchildren will share a melodrama about it. <br><br><h4>  "Good people" or "Put thanks in your pocket" </h4><br>  Already, cars are produced by robots, sending retired assembly shops to workers.  Soon, we‚Äôll get the clothes out of the printers, bypassing the entire production chain.  Test tests have already passed robots that create robots, it is not difficult to imagine what this will lead to.  Smart cars drive around California, threatening taxi drivers and truck drivers. <br><br>  The future is already near, however, what is the place of man in it?  It is clear that there will remain creative, as well as intellectually complex professions.  But why does the world need a lot of good movie directors?  Competition in the creative profession rolls over.  The same situation with programming: only one thousand people from Google serve the entire population of the earth.  What to do to others who can not program or invent? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3be/9bc/9c1/3be9bc9c173f489b970125622efae884.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a solution - to receive unemployment benefits.  However, experience shows that urban areas in which a large percentage of people live on benefits are marginalized.  Drugs, crime growth - as a result, a socially insecure group of people begins to pose a danger to society as a whole.  That is why governments are starting to introduce "Put Thanks in Your Pocket." <br><br>  Did you post the seals on facebook and didn't have time to master the professions of the future?  Then ‚ÄúGood people‚Äù is special for you. <br><br>  The application comes with Google Glass lenses and a set of miniature implantable cameras that provide panoramic video fixation around the person.  Now, artificial intelligence scans the video and counts the number of times the application carrier has been told ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù.  Helped open the door to the pensioner - get thanks.  He translated a schoolboy across the road - keep it up thanks.  Come on someone's foot - catch a minus.  The most interesting thing happens then, during the payment of unemployment benefits.  After all, the benefit amount is directly linked to the account in the Good People application. <br><br>  The app is really cool.  Without using violence, it will help to completely eradicate crime and make people be good.  Needless to say, ‚ÄúPut thanks in your pocket‚Äù will quickly learn to distinguish fake thanks from the real ones - AI is an insightful thing. <br><br>  It‚Äôs hard for us to imagine what services the app users will invent for passersby and household members in order to increase their earnings.  Let's better think about whether we want to use such an application in retirement and serve the young insolent majors of the future. <br><br>  In the comments it would be interesting to hear the opinion about how realistic you consider the introduction of such technologies and whether they will make our life better or worse. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367413/</a></p>
