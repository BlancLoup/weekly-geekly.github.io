We are extremely happy that our project <a href="http://mnogologo.ru/">ManyLogo</a> received so many responses.  Your comments and suggestions will definitely be taken into account, we also tried to fully answer all the questions that came in during the discussion (under the cat a small compilation of the most important questions and answers for all interested).  Also for your convenience, we have screwed the opportunity to publish their further comments on the project using the Reformal system, you are all sure about it. <br><br>  We want to share some figures for the past few days: <br><br><ul><li>  site traffic has grown to 12,000 people; </li><li>  the number of registrations exceeded 100 user designers; </li><li>  the number of published works came close to the 200th. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a>  The number of questions we were at first slightly embarrassed, but then we realized that they all got to the point so much that we must answer some of them separately.  It's great that you give advice on improving the project's usability and dwell on certain shortcomings.  The launch of any new project is usually accompanied by errors of various kinds, our project is no exception, we will fix everything that does not work, we will put in order the interface and add many more features and features.

      You were interested in the question of copyright in downloaded works - of course, this question is of fundamental importance - therefore we decided to change the contract with the designers (Offer) to a legally more competent agreement. <br>  The uniqueness of the loaded works is carefully checked by our specialists, in the near future we will introduce a mechanism that will allow users-designers to also participate in the rating of works. <br>  The pricing issue also caused controversy: the designers themselves set prices for their work.  We believe that over time, due to competition, the cost of work should level off by itself. <br>  Also in the near future we plan to introduce the possibility of dollar payment for goods and services (thanks to our Ukrainian and Belarusian design friends). <br><br>  We noted a lot of questions about the similarity to other resources of a similar subject.  We want to note the main differences of our service from the rest: <br><br>  <b>Free-lance.ru</b> - only a user with a PRO account, which is paid, can use the ‚Äústore‚Äù, in addition, there is no selection by various parameters. <br><br>  <b>Ogologo.ru</b> - the service aims to develop individual projects that require performers, and not finished work. <br><br>  <b>99designs.com</b> - basically the site aims to create a design based on a competition, but there is also a ‚Äústock‚Äù - a feature of which is 2 purchase options: non-exclusive design (the original version remains on sale and can be sold as many times as you like) and exclusive (liked design can be redeemed entirely for a large amount). <br><br>  <b>Istockphoto.com</b> is a service for the sale of various types of content (photo, video, audio, etc.), the rights to use it are also not exclusive. <br><br>  And now the promised bonus is that <u>all designers registered before March 31 will be able to use graphic highlighting for 1 (one) of any of their work, and from April 1 they will be assigned to the top works for a period of 2 weeks.</u>  <u>You just need to click on the "Select" button on the page of your work and choose any period and cost of selection - this operation will be performed absolutely free of charge.</u> <br><br>  <a href="http://mnogologo.ru/">ManyLOGO</a> waiting for new designers and their work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116343/</a></p>
