  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Pirate Bay Case</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The famous Swedish "Pirate Bay" (The Pirate Bay) in the near future will be officially charged in the case, which began scandalously a year ago.  Recall, on May 31, <nobr>2006</nobr> , during the raid of the Stockholm police, three people (administrators) were detained and the site ThePirateBay.Com was closed, which, according to IFPI, hosted the world's largest index of the BitTorrent file-sharing network;  186 servers were also confiscated. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This action followed similar events in May in Germany and Bulgaria and was immediately supported by two international organizations - the IFPI and MPAA;  according to MPAA executive director Dan Glickman (Dan Glickman), it was supposed to serve as a reminder to the pirates of the whole world about the punishability of copyright infringement.  Then the Swedish pirates behaved calmly and, not afraid of 50 police officers who conducted the raid at the same time in 10 districts of Sweden, posted an announcement on the main page of their already closed site that he would resume his work in a day or two.  At that time, the site was used daily by one and a half million people around the world - they downloaded music and movies for free, causing the industry quite large losses. <br>  The actions of the Swedish police were perceived as a pretext for unleashing a ‚Äúwar of generations‚Äù - 600 thousand young users of The Pirate Bay from Sweden considered that the ‚Äúold men‚Äù are thus trying to maintain the primacy of big capital in the sphere of culture and entertainment and, even worse, do it under US pressure.  The latter was particularly striking to those who disagreed, since the raid took place a week after the visit of the Swedish delegation to Washington, and the Minister of Justice of Sweden, who personally authorized the police to conduct it, was even accused of exceeding official authority.  The result - hundreds of lawsuits against senior police officers and the minister, hacker attacks on the websites of government agencies and thousands of demonstrations in several cities at once. <br>  The owners of the Pirate Bay (which at that time were 20 years old) kept their promise, and after a couple of days, who had gone to move the site to friendly servers in Amsterdam, their brainchild started working again - with a new bold logo.  Immediately, loud statements came out that the authorities, they say, had already lost the war to the pirates, who were always happy to wait in other countries, and visitors to the site did not even notice the police trying to thwart them.  In fact, everyone was interested in the issue of the essence of the charges that The Pirate Bay can make - because music and movies were not physically located on its servers, the site only contained links to other resources, where all this is located, so formally copyrights Swedish "pirates" did not break.  At the same time, one of the Swedish prosecutors, a month after the raid, publicly compared the activities of the Bay with armed terrorism. <br>  Now, the same prosecutor has issued a statement that he will indict specific persons related to The Pirate Bay before June 1 to punish "those who violate copyrights, those who help others to violate copyrights, and those who going to break them in an organized way. "  Representatives of the ‚ÄúBay‚Äù and calmly react to this news: ‚ÄúWe do not think that there is anything to fear.  Of course, we expected this, but we do not think that they will succeed.  Most likely, we will be acquitted, because our site does not contain copyright infringing materials, but merely places links to them.  But regardless of the results of this trial, we will continue to do our work.  If we are outlawed in Sweden, we will act in another country. ‚Äù <br>  At the moment, the public prosecutor is not yet ready to announce the names of the accused, or at least give their exact number.  Moreover, he has already announced that he may not meet the deadlines for the accusation given to him, since in order to draw up the final version of the documents he still needs to interview several witnesses.  The authorities in Sweden have already acknowledged that as a result of last year‚Äôs police raid, some companies and individuals unrelated to The Pirate Bay were partially affected.  Now the question of whether to pay them compensation;  also, the question of the possible abuse of judicial powers by the Minister of Justice has not yet been closed. <br>  Meanwhile, Pirate Bay is officially supported by those whose rights, according to IFPI, it violates: on the eve of the release of their new album, the popular group Nine Inch Nails posted their songs in free access on The Pirate Bay, which did not prevent the new record from taking second place on the Billboard charts.  <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/295716.php">Security lab</a> </div>
