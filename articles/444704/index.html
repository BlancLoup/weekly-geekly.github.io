The article describes a practical example of using the program nanoCAD SPDS Construction site in the project of the device of the underground passage through K. Marx Avenue in the historical center of Omsk.  The main task solved during the implementation is to ensure security in the intersection of Ch. Valikhanov Street and K. Marx Avenue.  The task was repeatedly postponed due to the complexity of implementation. <br><br>  The media wrote: ‚ÄúA road collapse is expected in Omsk: the authorities block Marks Avenue‚Äù, Omsk mayor Vyacheslav Dvorakovsky said that the construction of the underpass at the intersection of Chokan Valikhanov Street and Karl Marx Avenue is ‚Äúinconsiderate and expensive‚Äù due to a large cluster of communications.  However, the project was destined to take place, SK ‚ÄúIdealStroy‚Äù St. Petersburg LLC took over the implementation. <br><br>  Difficulties that builders had to face:

    <ul><li>  it was necessary to carry out the work without blocking the movement along K. Marx Avenue, the main artery of the city; </li><li>  a large amount of old underground communications, residential buildings, infrastructure and pedestrian areas around the construction site. </li></ul><br>  To reduce the time and minimize the risks, it was decided to use the software product <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">nanoCAD SPDS</a> for the implementation of PIC and CPD projects. <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">Construction site</a> .  Today, reconstruction and construction projects in cramped conditions are relevant for many cities of Russia and the CIS countries - we hope that our experience described in this article will be useful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bb/yi/vn/bbyivngrrcpajouxn74xco1vaaw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#696969">Opportunities nanoCAD SPDS Construction site in construction and reconstruction projects in cramped conditions.</font> <font color="#696969"><br></font>  <font color="#696969">On the practical example of the project of the device of the underground passage in a residential area</font> </h2><br><br>  Each projected object is implemented at the construction site.  And the more intricate a building or structure is, the more difficult is the organization of the space where everything should be in due time, in its place and in the right amount.  The quality of the object being built and the time spent on construction depend on this.  The company Magma-Computer produces the program nanoCAD SPDS Construction site, allowing to develop sections POS (construction organization projects), PPR (projects of works), TC (flow charts), HDD (horizontal directional drilling).  The program is constantly expanding the boundaries of its application.  Currently, it works on any of the three platforms: nanoCAD, AutoCAD, ZWCad, which allows you to actively apply it throughout Russia, in Kazakhstan, Ukraine and other countries. <br><br>  The program nanoCAD SPDS The construction site allows you to organize construction processes for a variety of objects: small buildings or structures;  buildings designed in cramped urban environments;  large-scale facilities, designed for several stages and construction phases.  A tool such as a <i>Project Manager</i> will collect information from several dwg files and combine it into a well-defined hierarchy of works.  Works are created by the user or taken from the provided bases of the GESN and ENiR, they are assigned such characteristics as completion dates, scope of work and units of measurement, number of workers required.  Different tabs of the <i>Project Manager</i> use a single list of works, but they contain more detailed information about prices, equipment, building materials. <br><br>  On the <i>Technics</i> tab, the <i>machinery</i> used is assigned to work in the Project Manager, and then placed on the drawings.  Although it is possible, and vice versa, we first draw the construction plan to later assign equipment from the project to work.  This relationship gives tangible advantages if necessary, for example, replace one tractor with another.  The <i>Replace Position for the entire project</i> command reassigns this position in all works, and also replaces all graphic displays of this technique in all drawings and in all dwg-files related to this project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/yr/w4/luyrw4kqyc9zjn0x1pmr3a-oezc.jpeg"><br><br>  With each new version of the nanoCAD SPDS Construction site is expanding the base of objects. <br><br>  And at the moment it contains the following types of construction equipment: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Lifting (tower, car, pneumatic and crawler cranes) <br>  ‚Ä¢ earthmoving <br>  ‚Ä¢ dump <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pipelaying <br>  ‚Ä¢ Piling <br>  ‚Ä¢ Drilling Technique <br>  ‚Ä¢ Concrete mixing plant <br>  ‚Ä¢ Concrete pump <br>  ‚Ä¢ Auto-lift <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automotive <br>  ‚Ä¢ Motor graders <br>  ‚Ä¢ Rollers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Asphalt pavers <br>  ‚Ä¢ Loaders <br>  ‚Ä¢ HDD installations <br><br>  If, nevertheless, there is still no specific crane or lift, then this gap is easy to fill.  Since the nanoCAD SPDS Construction Site already includes the SPDS application, you can use the <i>Object Wizard</i> tool.  It enables the user at any time to replenish the existing database of parametric objects on their own.  In addition to this developer constantly updates the database at the request of users for free.  All these additions to the database are available on the website spds.club. <br><br>  The <i>Materials</i> tab in the project manager is one of the new features of the <i>nanoCAD SPDS Construction Site</i> .  Thanks to her, it is possible to assign the required materials to work.  The position of the material can be taken from the provided base or create your own.  It has all the necessary parameters to further calculate the area for storage and draw the recommended schemes for the storage of goods.  Also, these materials can be placed on the construction plan in the form of storage facilities, and their actual area will be taken into account by the project manager. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rl/zm/cd/rlzmcdcfpexdlvch8uil3q-aopk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wz/d9/dc/wzd9dcdolrgiy6pzok8xgkriz_0.jpeg"><br><br>  Let's turn to practice.  For example, the project "Construction of the underpass" in the city of Omsk, we consider the creation of a construction-genetic plan and a flow chart for blocking a tongue.  Its complexity lies in the fact that construction takes place on one of the central streets of the city with a high density of buildings and existing communications, despite the fact that it was decided not to block traffic on it. <br><br>  The list of works was divided into stages and captures, which further allowed us to create a calendar plan for the production of works or some other report for a specific stage.  The organization, which is carrying out the construction of the crossing, decided that the blocking of the ‚ÄúLarsen-500‚Äù groove would be performed by the self-made SVA-1 svavdavlivayuschim installation.  Accordingly, for the introduction of this technology into the project, an object was created in the nanoCAD database of the construction site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/1f/wd/dl1fwdthpzs3yiutynjr1-izzr0.jpeg"><br><br>  After being assigned to the ‚ÄúConstruction of construction pits fence‚Äù of the pile press and tractor, they were placed on the plan of the pit.  Due to the limited space, the crane runway VCA-1 is set differently for each grab.  What is displayed in the sheets of the project.  Slopes, fences, existing and temporary buildings are also marked with objects nanoCAD SPDS Construction site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hc/d6/_p/hcd6_pqmvonj2x4pkd5cyyirjtm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ya/rl/wm/yarlwm_s8m5gjdwsi5z7k-8fkqu.jpeg"><br><br>  Further, the table of symbols, explications of buildings and structures are generated automatically.  On the basis of information from the project manager, a calendar plan of work production, a schedule of the need for machines and mechanisms, and other reports are created, which significantly saves the designer‚Äôs time, who no longer needs to calculate them by hand. <br><br>  <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">nanoCAD SPDS The construction site is</a> focused on designing with parametric objects, following the normative documents of the Russian Federation as much as possible, but at the same time it has the capacity to adapt flexibly to the requirements of the enterprise standards and non-standard design conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s-/oa/qk/s-oaqkjpzufv2n1wht4hr3aek2w.jpeg"><br><br>  About the company-developer, LLC IC "IdealStroy" (idealstroy.com).  The company has been operating in the Russian market since 2013.  Specialization - complex improvement, construction of large, technically complex objects. <br><br>  More information on <a href="https://spds.club/funkcional-nanocad-spds-stroyploshchadka">spds.club</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444704/</a></p>
