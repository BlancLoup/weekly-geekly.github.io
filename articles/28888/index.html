And here are my five kopecks in the piggy bank of ideas for those who want to once again gather friends into a circle, through seven hands, in order to understand that the world is small.  Immediately make a reservation and advertise that this article could not start without Nikolai Gromov, who in his blog posted a <a href="http://nicothin.ru/socialnye-seti-druzya-i-vragi.html">note about friends and enemies in the networks</a> and my wife, with whom we had an interesting conversation on the topic. <br><br>  What is the original idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsocial networking?  It seems to me - to unite friends for better interaction, not to lose contacts and to be always in the know and in touch.  Now, often, ‚Äúfriends‚Äù call everyone who is not falling, even strangers who knock on your contacts and whom you have marked as a friend.  Such a motley audience simply must be combed and laid out on the shelves. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Friend categories </h2><br>  So, I will highlight a few categories that, I think, completely describe the friends of any modern person: <br><ul><li>  friends; </li><li>  relatives; </li><li>  Colleagues; </li><li>  client - performer; </li><li>  subordinate - the head; </li><li>  foes; </li><li>  neighbors; </li><li>  studied together; </li><li>  teacher - student; </li><li>  served together; </li><li>  network acquaintances; </li><li>  acquaintances. </li></ul><br>  Moreover, the category of "friends" is so vague that it can be interpreted in a completely different way.  Otherwise it would be possible to call this category ‚Äúother‚Äù, all those who were not included in the previous ones are included there; sometimes it is very difficult to describe the category of acquaintances. <br><br><h2>  Social graph </h2><br>  For mathematicians, there is such a thing as a ‚Äúgraph‚Äù; this is a scheme consisting of node-points and lines connecting these points in any order, with its help it becomes possible to solve many problems.  Let me try to draw on the example of the ‚Äúsocial graph‚Äù the picture that will come out when entering the categories of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù: <br><br><img src="http://laradice.ru/image/social.jpg" width="500" height="400"><br><br>  Even this small piece of information can already tell a lot about each of the participants-points of this social graph.  Just like in life :) <br><br><h2>  Practical use </h2><br>  I do not know, my dear start-up, how will you use this information, which can eventually come out - I would recommend using this scheme to everyone, from <a href="http://www.odnoklassniki.ru/">Odnoklassniki</a> to <a href="http://leprosorium.ru/">Leprozoria</a> (which, of course, no, dear% USERNAME%).  It doesn't matter how people interact, it is important that they get from this interaction. <br><br>  <strong>First</strong> , a person gets the opportunity to control the access of each category of ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to information and contacts.  This feature is implemented in principle by <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/">VKontakte</a> .  But, unfortunately, they did not further develop such a powerful idea. <br><br>  <strong>Secondly</strong> , a person gets a tool to find the people he needs and most importantly a very effective search.  I will give an example: <br>  There is a man <em>X.</em>  He desperately needs consultation of the person <em>Y.</em>  <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> have three friends in common.  Moreover, <em>A</em> is the wife of <em>Y</em> and a friend of <em>X</em> , a classmate of <em>X</em> and a network friend of <em>Y</em> , and <em>C</em> is a colleague of <em>X</em> and a friend of <em>Y.</em>  If <em>X</em> needs a professional consultation <em>Y</em> , then he has a direct path to <em>C</em> , so that he has brought them together. <br><br>  <strong>Thirdly</strong> , there is a feeling of approaching reality.  Now, looking at your friends, you realize who is who.  And you feel the real benefits of the contact directory.  My wife told me today that she would gladly smash all her acquaintances into categories, catalog them all, write down contacts so that her friends could go one way, and hairdressers and plumbers the other. <br><br>  <strong>Fourth and fifth,</strong> I would love to hear from you, my dear reader.  I am sure that this method of sorting "friends" has great potential. <br><br><h2>  PS The mechanism of "frending". </h2><br>  And in conclusion I would like to be indignant - mutual ‚Äúfrending‚Äù is a complete insanity!  There are a lot of examples in life when we give what we desire to the real, when one person thinks he is different, and he considers the first one to be just a network friend. <br><br>  Therefore, our social graph should be directed. <br><br>  Happiness to you, do not be fooled. <br><br>  <font color="#888888">PS And a little advertising of my <a href="http://laradice.ru/">blog with a</a> light font, from which this article itself and where else there is something to read.</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28888/</a></p>
