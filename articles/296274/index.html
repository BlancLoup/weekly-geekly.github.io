No recent episodes of your favorite TV show.  ‚ÄúWhat a nightmare!‚Äù - you will surely rebel.

      However, this is exactly what happens if no one is engaged in content.  Content management is basically the receipt and placement of digital content, such as text, photos, video, etc.  - on the website.  The main stages include the creation, editing and publication of digital materials. <br><br>  First you need to familiarize yourself with a content management system (or ‚ÄúCMS‚Äù), such as WordPress.  This includes, for example, teaching admin panel management, creating and editing messages, formatting content, and so on. <br><br>  There is much to learn here, but it's really easy to get started.  And since almost every company or organization uses web content in some way today, you can turn even basic content management skills into a real advantage in your current job or when looking for possible options. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>2. Photo Editing and Design and Design Skills</b> </h4><br><h6>  Currently there are millions and millions of websites, so your company will definitely want to stand out with its website on their background. <br><br>  One of the best ways to create a website that Internet users will like is to make it beautiful and easy to use.  This is where you can not do without the skills of photo editing and graphic design. <br><br>  With photo editing you can make great images and graphics.  And by tracking the number of visitors, looking at sites with similar themes, you can best tailor the site to the needs of Internet users and design other sites.  Add design concepts such as fonts, color theory and the golden section, and you will soon be able to design websites from scratch - and even newsletters - that is, what is in fact very much in demand .. <br><br>  To get started in photo editing, you will need to learn how to use different software, such as Photoshop.  As for web design, you need to learn how to deal with UX and design as such. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>3. HTML</b> </h4><br><h6>  Perhaps interested in sites, you want to know exactly how they are created from scratch.  What are they built on?  Just on HTML or hypertext markup. <br><br>  Such special terms can be puzzling at first, but in fact it is just an HTML language used to upload content to a web page and structure it. <br><br>  Since HTML plays a significant role within the global network, mastering the basics of this technique will most likely allow you to become more successful.  You can not only start creating or changing the content of a web site, but also create ezines that go beyond simple text or use even more features of CMS. <br><br>  It won't take you long to start working with HTML, but the consequences will be significant.  After you learn about all the elements and attributes, you will be ready to improve your skills and actually start building web pages and websites from scratch. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>4. CSS</b> </h4><br><h6>  The fourth and final skill that will make you the favorite of any HR manager and employer is CSS. <br><br>  CSS is the abbreviation of Cascading Style Sheets, and also the code that is used to create web content.  But with CSS, it‚Äôs not the content and main structure that is written, but the style is created.  In other words, this is what makes web pages unique in their own way, these are color, background, fonts, etc. <br><br>  So we returned to the theme of beautiful sites, which all successful companies dream of.  When you possess skills in the field of CSS, you can create such sites.  And, as with HTML, you can use CSS to create constructs, complicating them with a CMS. <br><br>  CSS consists of rules that affect the content of HTML content.  This means content properties (i.e., colors, backgrounds, fonts, etc.) and its meanings (for example, a particular image, or Helvetica).  Learn how to use CSS and you can create awesome sites, in addition, you will have real skills that can be offered to companies. <br><br>  So, this is what we have at the moment.  There is no need to rush to start trying to acquire the above skills, seeking to become an expert.  However, there is no doubt that owning them will help you get the job you are dreaming about. <br><br>  And, if you don‚Äôt have any of them yet, download our free recommendation ‚ÄúHow to acquire the most demanded technical skills in the company‚Äù to get started.  You can learn more about something bigger from Blueprint Skillcrush Career. <br><br>  With such knowledge, you will feel completely independent on the web, because you no longer have to rely on a developer or designer to achieve a goal.  And this means that you will offer any company much more for their own benefit.  In addition, you can grow in your skills and move quickly up the career ladder. <br><br>  Also, you will be a few steps away from amazing digital magic - for example, you can later create Rails web applications or mobile versions of sites. </h6><br><br>  <i>And also very cool if you were able to tell a story about yourself during the interview.</i>  <i>About your experience, education and career.</i>  <i>For this <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/zolotye-pravila-storitellinga/">you need to become a real storyteller and we even know how</a> !</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296274/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296274/</a></p>
