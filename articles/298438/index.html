And this is, in fact, a big problem.  Most services still do not know how to integrate with each other, although the relevance of such a decision on the market is just going off scale.  Companies spend on outdated solutions and get just a meager return. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Online consultants, email marketing services, pop-ups - they offer to ‚Äúwork with the user‚Äù almost blindly.  They do not know anything about each of your users: at what stage of the purchase is located, what actions they performed on the site, what product they are interested in, etc.  Without this data, all internet marketing is just guesswork and monetary risk. <br><br>  If you need to increase the conversion rate of the first or resale, then you probably thought about it yourself.  There is a solution.  Knowledge of each of your users makes it possible to personalize and make more accurate communication with them.  This directly affects your sales.

      We made a service that combines the most important tools of internet marketing.  And due to their merger, new hacks appear.  This is what is called Marketing automation.  In short, the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna"><b>Carrot Quest</b></a> service allows you to track the actions of each user on your site (what he did, where he came from, what he watched, etc.) and based on this data, manually or automatically lead everyone to the purchase. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dd2/9c8/ba3/dd29c8ba36eb6cece599b4801cba2191.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>e-CRM and personal analytics</b> </h4><br>  Imagine that you know everything about each user.  All of his key actions on the site, what product he added to the basket, what function he used in the service, what article he read, what he talked with the operator, read the email newsletter, where he came from and how much money he brought for the whole life cycle. <br><br>  With this data, you know what interests your user and how you can really be useful to him.  As a result, successfully bring it to the sale, both the first and the second one (create letters with a suggestion, prompt in the chat, show pop-up windows, etc.). <br><br>  Marketing becomes meaningful and effective only when you know your users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/5bb/8db/1fe/5bb8db1fe37bed9a14f0cc2ab7c96a82.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All users are concentrated in the Lida section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/408/2c4/ba0/4082c4ba06ee4629f4e10ebf685469ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Here all your users are laid out on the shelves.</b>  <b>They can be divided into segments by any data and actions that they did on the site:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ by the source of the transition to the site (domains, utm-tags); <br>  ‚Ä¢ by city and region; <br>  ‚Ä¢ on actions that they did on the site (for example, they registered, added goods to the cart, subscribed to the newsletter, paid the subscription twice, did not return to the site for 14 days or came again, and any other action); <br>  ‚Ä¢ according to the data they left on the site (the presence of mail, name, etc.) <br>  ‚Ä¢ on loyalty and willingness to purchase (scoring users by points); <br>  ‚Ä¢ by the amount of money the user has brought; <br><br>  All these parameters are easy to configure.  We made it so that any marketer could customize our service for their tasks without the help of a programmer.  Plus, <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna">in the blog,</a> we constantly provide various cases that help customers use the Carrot Quest to the maximum, and when registering, we will send 9 useful lessons on effective Internet marketing. <br><br>  Of course, it is important to know how many users you have who, for example, bought more than 3 times and never returned to the site.  But it is even more important to return them and bring them to re-purchase. <br><br>  <b>You can choose either one user or the whole segment and send him 3 types of messages:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Post to chat; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pop-up window; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Email. <br><br><h4>  <b>3 simple cases, how chat, pop-ups and emails work in a team</b> </h4><br><h5>  Case A </h5><br><br>  <b>Problem:</b> In the service, you noticed that some users have already visited a page of a product several times (which interests them), but it does not buy it and does not register it.  You can not send such users a letter, because  do not know their address, but you can solve this situation differently. <br><br>  <b>Solution:</b> Set up an automatic pop-up window that will be shown to this segment if it enters the card of the same product for the 4th time.  In the pop-up window, you attach a bonus that will push an uncertain client to purchase. <br><br><h5>  Case B </h5><br><br>  <b>Problem:</b> The client wrote us a chat from a mobile phone and left.  For almost any chat, this client would be lost, but not for us. <br><br>  <b>Solution:</b> Although the client has left, we reply to him in the chat, and the message is duplicated by his mail, and he continues from there to communicate with us.  When he re-enters the site from any other device, we will recognize him, and the entire history of correspondence with him will be available in the chat. <br><br><h5>  Case C </h5><br><br>  <b>Problem:</b> We send an automatic message to the user if he did not complete the registration (or added the product to the basket, but did not buy it).  In the letter we offer him a bonus with a promo code if he completes the registration or buys it.  The user goes to the site, forgets about the promotional code and leaves. <br><br>  <b>Solution:</b> When a user goes to the site, we use a pop-up window to remind him about the bonus - we show this promotional code.  Thus, we use different tools to promote it through the sales funnel.  Such scenarios work automatically according to the actions of visitors. <br><br>  One of our tasks is for marketers, sales and support staff to play complex scenarios of communication with users and bring them to the sale, while not using the help of programmers. <br><br>  Here is a small table of the features of the teamwork of chat, pop-ups and emails. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/65c/d76/c9b/65cd76c9baaaeccd2b3a12774c2137a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, what could be "communication" without evaluating the effectiveness?  Full analytics is available for all types of messages.  For example, for mailings these are all important actions: open rate, click rate and replay rate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/01b/8f9/a18/01b8f9a1894ecda6c24afc75a0676cfe.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And you can see right here who exactly did this action, go to the card of this user and see what he did next, after reading the message. <br><br>  As a result, you set up automatic messages in the chat and e-mail, do manual mailings and get all the answers in one service. <br><br><h4>  <b>Measure the conversion of each action</b> </h4><br>  Your main goal is to increase profits.  Therefore, it is important not only to know, but also to constantly monitor a bunch of indicators: how promotion affects sales, where customers lose, how efficiently operators work, etc. <br><br>  Carrot Quest collects data on the actions of all your visitors, so you can easily customize the funnels that are relevant to you and constantly monitor work performance. <br><br><br>  This is the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_term%3Dsoldatov%26utm_campaign%3Dtribuna">product</a> we make.  The way we had to go is not easy, but we are proud of our every step. <br><br>  Subscribe to our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carrotquest">group on Facebook</a> , we constantly publish useful and interesting materials on internet marketing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298438/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298438/</a></p>
