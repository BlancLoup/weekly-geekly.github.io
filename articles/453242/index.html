  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Platform for summer events</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Last year, when we launched a <a href="http://coderfactory.ru/">summer programming school</a> in the village, several people turned to us with a proposal to hold their events at our base.  The infrastructure available at that time did not allow holding other events at the same time as the school - therefore, the proposals could not be accepted. </p><br><p>  This year we decided to create a <a href="https://hutorium.ru/">summer playground</a> on the territory specifically for such events.  Under the cut - details and announcements planned for 2019 events. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cu/ru/et/curuetphnnb8bbxvmtrdapb4k8k.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><p></p><br><h2>  Barcamp </h2><br><p>  The first event was Barcamp - an intellectual picnic from the 7x7 company, taking place in several regions.  In the Kirov region there has not yet been a permanent site, and the guys offered to hold it with us. </p><br><p>  It would not be very justified to create an infrastructure to use it one day a year.  We talked with local companies, and immediately showed some interest in this format.  A few more events have long wanted to hold their own - therefore, the most reasonable would be the creation of a universal platform operating during the entire summer period. </p><br><h2>  The brand </h2><br><p>  Last year we used the ‚ÄúHutorium‚Äù brand for the summer school of programming, which hinted at a combination of countryside, intelligence and some challenge to the existing order of things. </p><br><p>  Later, when we tried to scale the training to <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it_poselok/blog/432612/">regional schools</a> , the name had to be changed - it turned out to be too creative for this audience.  Some counterparties could not pronounce it correctly, and some perceived it as some sort of indecent hint.  Therefore, we changed it to CoderFactory, and the brand Hutorium was free. </p><br><p>  When we approached the question of the name of the future site, it turned out that ‚ÄúKhutorIum‚Äù was ideally suited.  It very accurately reflects what we are trying to create - the center of intellectual activity in the countryside. </p><br><h2>  Concept </h2><br><p>  The site provides two main services. </p><br><p>  The first is an opportunity for a city developer to spend a week in nature.  During the day, work in co-working with good internet, and walk around in the evening - without enjoying the sound of chanson radio from cars of neighboring guests and without stumbling about their bodies a few hours later. </p><br><p>  The second is the event.  Every weekend, an intellectual focus event is held in Hutorium ‚Äî most often IT-related topics, but sometimes also from other areas (business, society, training, etc.).  The criterion for the selection of events is precisely the intellectual component (in this case, we do not hold weddings, even if there are intellectual contests in the program, and not just jumps in bags). </p><br><p>  We expect that the combination of these two components will make it possible to influence the development of intellectual activity in the region - will help the participants to make a lot of new acquaintances, gain new knowledge, and popularize IT among young people. </p><br><h2>  Infrastructure </h2><br><p>  This season for construction we are limited to a too short period between the snowfall and the first event.  Therefore, we have decided so far to abandon some of the ideas, focus in the first season on key sites and try to bring them to maximum readiness. </p><br><p>  In general, we considered infrastructure as a tool for solving four main tasks - accommodation, food, work and recreation. </p><br><h3>  Accommodation </h3><br><p>  For the first season, the main mode of accommodation in Hutorium is its own tourist tent.  The number of events like BarCamp (300+) simply leaves no other choice.  Naturally, this method of placement is accompanied by the required number of bathrooms and washbasins. </p><br><p>  In addition, we expect to offer a more convenient way of accommodation - in the clement tents.  Glemping (glamour camping) is an actively developing tourism direction that combines outdoor accommodation with more comfortable conditions than an ordinary tent. </p><br><p>  In the sleeves, the tents are usually much more spacious.  There you can straighten up to its full height, there is electricity for charging devices, normal floor, bed and minimal furniture.  Sometimes bathrooms are placed in clement tents, but this is not yet our budget. </p><br><p>  As a prototype, we decided to take the A-form model from one of the western manufacturers.  It seems quite simple to build, and after the implementation it should look something like this: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/mm/jt/c6mmjtoyfilr5_satuhaont8pe8.jpeg"><br><p>  Probably, in a few weeks we will be able to publish a photo of what we did in the form of a standard comic book ‚ÄúWaiting - Reality‚Äù. </p><br><p>  While the frame of the tent looks like this: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vb/x-/0-/vbx-0-ixgax87xn9frksbiyjbqo.jpeg"><br><p>  The tent assumes an awning covering, which together with all internal filling is dismantled for the winter - this allows you to make its construction much cheaper due to the operational costs of dismantling and storage. </p><br><h3>  Nutrition </h3><br><p>  Last year, we used catering for a large local restaurant to feed students of the programming school.  This year we want to go a little further - along with catering, we offer several food service providers a format for off-site trade. </p><br><p>  To do this, we are doing something like a summer cafe, simultaneously used for coworking.  Technically, it consists of two zones - a hall (as well as a glomping, is closed by an awning roof dismantled for the winter), and a permanent unit - there are sanitary facilities, an area for event organizers and a summer kitchen area. </p><br><h3>  Work zone </h3><br><p>  For the working area, we plan to make a large awning with a stage and footprints.  At the moment, this is the least developed question - its construction has not yet been launched. </p><br><h3>  Recreation area </h3><br><p>  For the improvement of the recreational zone, we chose a piece of the coast, strongly hit by a borshevik.  We leveled this piece, covered it with geotextile, and covered it with a thick layer of sand - so we got rid of the Hogweed and got a small beach. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nw/zs/ki/nwzskitydvt4qasvcmpbrbqfmyo.jpeg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/xi/dw/apxidw1wxk-zz43tx9r1o9att4u.jpeg"><br><p>  <em>Beginning of beach dumping - geotextiles, sand on top</em> </p><br><h4>  Decorative pond </h4><br><p>  Between the cafe and the beach was a hefty pit, broken by some heavy machinery.  Instead of efforts to level it, we decided to turn it into a small pond, after consulting with specialists in permaculture. </p><br><p>  The soil in this place is solid clay, and the water should not leave quickly.  - we expect to bring to it one of the drainage ditches from the field and see whether it will work in this format or not. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/25/2v/nt/252vntmu9rxp5_xmrhmtzlqye3w.jpeg"><br><p>  The outer side of this pond is something like a mini-dam.  On it, we plan to make ledges in the form of benches, steps on which it is convenient to sit in the evening with a book or watch the sunset. </p><br><h2>  Schedule 2019 </h2><br><p>  Here is an incomplete schedule of events for the 2019 season.  Some of them are still in the development stage, and some are already open registration, i.e.  can reserve a place.  We will talk about the most interesting events in separate articles. </p><br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><thead><tr><th>  date </th><th>  Event </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  June 15 - August 31 </td><td>  <b>Summer School of Web Development</b> <br><p>  The course is focused on the complete passage of the cycle of modern web development.

The course is divided into weekly races with power on - you can take from 1 to 4 weeks and complete your education online. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/aj/te/ueajtef1dpcdylyx2txzhjogysq.jpeg"><br><br>  Details - on <a href="http://coderfactory.ru/"></a>  <a href="http://coderfactory.ru/">http://coderfactory.ru</a> </td></tr>
