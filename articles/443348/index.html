  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The device of old cars and signal rope as a prototype of the local train network</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Let's go over shortly on the evolution of the car.  Very quickly and superficially, in small interesting pieces without long periods of finishing touch.  Let's start with the brake line and conductors.  The brake air line of the train was invented far from immediately.  At first, there were such places for the slowers (they were immediately called conductors in the French manner): on the brake platform of the car there was a man who was waiting for a triple whistle.  It was a signal to turn the brake.  After stopping, he waited for the signal to turn off the brake.  In the photo of the reconstruction of the Museum of Railways of Russia in St. Petersburg it is not visible how much he tried to wrap himself in clothes.  They are very cold: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p7/wj/sc/p7wjsc2cs6d8atpmz-4qbutma-8.jpeg"><br><br>  The outgoing signal was also.  The conductor could give a signal to the engine with the help of a signal rope passing through all the cars.  Here is its mount on top of the mail car:

He saw the flashlight flash and looked out at what had happened.  Then they talked flags: all the conductors, if necessary, leaned out and read the signs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Why was this important?  Because the engine simply could not stop the train because of banal physics. <br><br>  The brakes of only one engine could not quickly stop the train, in this process it was desirable to use at least some of the cars. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jb/kx/km/jbkxkmdx-xecbth5zxtms_md1ac.jpeg"><br>  <i>Workplace of the conductor with folding seat.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a3/an/us/a3anus55jnoyoto5bjwbpot9mpi.jpeg"><br><br>  The brakes didn't always do the job right, so they needed automation.  Invented automatic brakes in the XIX century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j6/vi/on/j6vionebut9bqmmelqb0gbcv934.jpeg"><br><br>  Currently, indirect brakes are used: when charging the brake line with air (now up to 5 atmospheres), the brakes are released, and when the pressure drops, the brake pads are pressed against the wheel rims.  If the car broke away from the train - it immediately braked, and the entire train also braked due to the pressure drop in the line.  It is possible to apply emergency braking by actuating the brake valve located in the car. <br><br><h3>  Freight wagons </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/rl/dc/zsrldcmf6ojqjshyhmt4mx8ksgs.jpeg"><br><br>  This is how heavy four-axle freight cars looked like.  In wartime, removable military devices for transporting people or, if necessary, horses could be put inside the car.  In peacetime, the car was used as a cargo.  Distinguishing a dual-use carriage is very simple: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sg/xf/0c/sgxf0c3s8tabcm-8snannxcvheu.jpeg"><br><br>  If there are windows in the freight car, it is definitely dual-use.  Here is the difference between the old sample and the more recent one. <br><br><h3>  Post car </h3><br>  The post cars were very important.  They carried mail and money across the Russian Empire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q2/s_/ea/q2s_eaiyril7td7ssdgekdvjrg8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p-/vq/cy/p-vqcykragmpxa2qwzzamqajl9q.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gl/ni/ou/glniougou2otaaht5vijfvsck-o.jpeg"><br><br>  Mail is sorted inside the car as it travels. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4u/7t/bo/4u7tbo9qtbtcpa0ryr63jglobhm.jpeg"><br><br>  There is a mailbox so that a person can send an urgent letter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/t0/nf/rf/t0nfrfevjt005-kqtg2bc4mo08e.jpeg"><br><br>  He waited for the train at the station, came up, put the letter straight into his box.  The train left with the letter.  But the money bag: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/ig/w8/ocigw8f-2oglmxgdmew_58z3dws.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Military cars </h3><br>  It was convenient to place artillery and antiaircraft guns on the cars. <br><br>  In the twentieth century, railway transport was used to defend the country: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/rt/-h/fvrt-hk5efdptd2nrtjc9q4paa8.jpeg"><br><br>  In the foreground are two anti-aircraft armored sites designed for air defense.  The battle railway missile complex is located in the background: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qr/gb/a7/qrgba7ir6gjqr-gzllnt381k-bw.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to the powder start like a mortar (first, the rocket is thrown into the air by charge detonation, and then it bends down and gives a jet stream so that the car does not overturn), there is one more feature: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fe/q_/9z/feq_9zguydf5rynnqqhae2-x2yi.jpeg"><br><br>  With this device, the contact wire above the train was set aside so that the rocket could be launched. <br><br>  Here is an interesting areal conveyor for transportation of heavy and oversized cargo, often - equipment for the railway, for example, transformers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/2u/ak/iz2uako9vfyxx4gh3t2a-brgasc.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Passenger cars </h3><br>  The first passenger cars of the Tsarskoye Selo railway were with separate doors that went from the compartment directly to the street.  But such a layout in our climate has not taken root.  First, the cars were cold, easily blown by the wind.  And, secondly, the passage along the train was difficult.  Therefore, passenger cars with entrances through terminal open sites began to be used at the Petersburg-Moscow Railway.  Here are the interiors of the museum copy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/af/qr/dg/afqrdg3qq2xizkjhjexr4xq-wmy.jpeg"><br><br>  They had spittoon - a very necessary thing for cultural leisure.  There was no Wi-Fi and outlets then, but there was chewing tobacco: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/jl/8y/zajl8y2ioizblf4uvj9ezi8a1t8.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is much later passenger cars that could be used to transport the wounded: the leading angle was made with the help of the same half of the door in the old cars that never opened in the vestibule. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lj/zm/fj/ljzmfjxa-pt8iiad0s2o0esmhue.jpeg"><br><br>  At first there was no boiling water in the carriages, he was recruited at the stations, so the passengers drank tea after departure.  Now there are titans who were once a super modern technique: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mb/pq/5p/mbpq5pwm0pjimtem8jtu0kjeda0.jpeg"><br><br>  The passenger compartment compartment of the first half of the 1950s looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/sx/wv/lfsxwvj5ixc0ebzvkoasxwlbc8s.jpeg"><br><br>  Passenger cars of the late 19th century in many cases had metal frames and wooden bodies lined with thin sheets of iron on top. <br><br>  The lighting in the cars was candlelight at first.  Here is a candle lantern, his burning tube goes up: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fj/pi/cp/fjpicpslxqs3k_gk10r0xjgknaa.jpeg"><br><br>  The photograph shows a service saloon car used in the second half of the twentieth century. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h4/st/h6/h4sth6l0e66r471u1f53oogsnhu.jpeg"><br><br>  The cars evolved in many ways: we once wrote about the fact that they are changing.  It should be borne in mind that these processes cannot be considered in isolation from the rest of the development of railways and technology in general.  For example, the same local network of a train has undergone many changes since the signal rope.  Or the principle of arrival at the station: first, mechanical semaphores were used to determine where to go.  Then electric lamps appeared, which gave a much clearer indication.  Then in the USSR they began to give codes on rails, and on the locomotive there was a reader and a panel with colored lamps duplicating the signal.  A lot of influence on the cars had the development of materials and the economy.  For example, the transition from 16-ton wagons to 40-ton wagons with a large number of axles helped to use the roads more efficiently when the supply was ready to choke. <br><br><h3>  Last changes </h3><br>  A little more about the evolution of cars we have already written <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/427617/">here</a> .  This is the third post of the cycle about Tverskoy railcar, here is another about the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/419701/">device power systems of cars</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/421057/">in general about them</a> .  And here is <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/tuturu/blog/426779/">about the work station</a> . <br><br>  From the most recent updates, it is worth noting that on February 14 new data appeared on how the cars will look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uk/lp/yq/uklpyqx25mgiv9tinunsoe5uwoo.jpeg"><br>  <i>¬© FPK</i> <br><br>  Top shelves and table cleaned.  Bottom shelves turn into sofas with headrests.  Will be safe: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mo/yq/4r/moyq4rlpesec8hicw1halz_4peq.jpeg"><br>  <i>¬© FPK</i> <br><br>  In the toilets, the shower will be a separate cabin, and not just a watering can behind a hidden camouflage panel, as it is now. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443348/</a></p>
