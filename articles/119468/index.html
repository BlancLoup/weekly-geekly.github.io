This is how you can briefly describe the last three models of gaming portable consoles from the company Ritmix, which will be discussed in detail in this review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2d8c832c/cde8e951/f4b1c762/7d60bd15.jpg"><br><br>  Console games of the last century had the opportunity to "breathe" a second time after the development of emulation on computers, and after a while on smartphones.  But after the rapid development of the gaming industry on the PC, the interest of "gamers" to console games of the last century began to fall gradually, although some of them still remained popular, mainly due to smartphones.  But‚Ä¶.  no wonder they say that Apple shoots rarely, but accurately.  After the release of the first apple phone, the design of smartphones began to change rapidly - the screen of smartphones began to grow, displacing the buttons and reducing their number.  And one touch screen for console games is not enough - it is the presence of ‚Äúhardware‚Äù buttons that is important.  So gradually they began to forget about the games that millions of people had once played.  And here, due to the implementation of emulation on portable consoles, it was possible to raise interest in console games (for the third time, perhaps the last);  in particular, Ritmix has released a whole line of portable consoles.  These devices allow you to emulate games from stationary consoles Nintendo and Sega, and from a series of portable Game Boy consoles, and some others - more on this below.

      Here I would like to talk about three models - RZX-30, RZX-35 and RZX-40.  In total, Ritmix has released 10 different game consoles, but these three are of the most interest, since they make it possible to flood games into memory, and not just be content with pre-installed games. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Outwardly, all three consoles resemble the ‚Äúelongated‚Äù Game Boy Advance SP, thanks to a folding design and a similar arrangement of buttons.  All consoles screen is located on one half of the case, and all the buttons and connectors for connecting cables - on the second half. <br>  Below is more about each console separately (in order of their appearance on the market) <br><br><h5>  Ritmix RZX-35 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/f80da35f/44b500c4/acd0ba14/e09a6709.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ec824b53/8abfa4c2/4ceb7c0a/a53543b6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/551daae5/9fd00706/0690c207/e552930f.jpg"><br><br>  The most dimensional console of the trinity.  Black plastic case, with a glossy and very branded finish.  This is the only model that has side ‚Äúshifts‚Äù; in the following models, other buttons on the front surface perform their function.  Despite the fact that the body creaks slightly, and the side "shifty" dangle, due to its low weight, the prefix easily suffers from random drops, which are likely in the case of using the prefix by representatives of the target audience (ie, children).  The screen opening is 180 degrees, there is a ‚Äúrefinement‚Äù in two extreme positions, in the middle positions the screen does not dangle due to the relatively tight attachment.  The prefix indicator is placed under the cover, so that in the closed position it is difficult to understand whether the console is on or not.  Buttons are black with engraved inscriptions; in fact, the paint from the buttons eventually begins to peel off.  At first it seems that there are two speakers on the top cover at the edges, but this is only an imitation, the real speaker is located on the lower half of the case. <br><br><h5>  Ritmix RZX-40 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9944b851/c29f8813/40a365f5/fac77b38.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/65c861d9/c7b51f0e/5c2867ff/f122bdbf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b9edbf7b/c474e113/76518c0e/d4be0d4f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/70d3ed7d/68f9556b/9474ea3c/59654c62.jpg"><br><br>  Compared with the previous model, the prefix lost 5mm in thickness and slightly ‚Äúgained weight‚Äù.  There are streamlined edges, and the plastic is now coated with Soft-touch, which seems soft to the touch, due to which the console is just nice to hold in your hands.  Such a coating is sometimes called "rubberized" plastic;  It is not susceptible to minor scratches and there are almost no fingerprints on it. <br>  This model of the console causes a feeling of a strong and reliable device, nothing creaks and does not play.  The screen opens even more tightly than the screen of the previous model.  The work indicator is now rendered out.  The screen in comparison with the previous console has become more widescreen.  Due to the fact that the buttons are now made of transparent plastic, and the inscriptions on the buttons are inside, now, in theory, should not be scraped off. <br><br><h5>  Ritmix RZX-30 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8bdb1638/6329e0fa/4a2b01e5/3c5ec01d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/fbffb1d1/8fbdc1bc/376e000f/59156d2e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ecaa8817/49b4169f/ea35dcf4/e27f7f35.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b2c80993/6bcb9ab3/a28451a1/828261a3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d794e505/c9d40c12/090b520a/e199ccaa.jpg"><br><br>  This is almost a reduced copy of the previous model, with some changes.  There are new buttons to control the audio player when the console cover is closed.  In previous models, closing the lid did not turn off the screen, but now there is a small button that turns off the screen when it is closed (as in laptops).  A second mini-USB connector appeared (its purpose is described in the table below).  The aspect ratio of the screen returned to the proportions of the RZX-35.  Some changes in the design - the buttons are now with a metallic coating, on which the names are embossed (it looks surprisingly beautiful), and on the lid the metal logo Ritmix appeared. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  The table below shows the comparative technical characteristics of the three consoles, and also shows a significant aspect - the differences in the controls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/64a1425d/1ed9a8f8/d00548f3/00ec0f8e.png"><br><br><h4>  Introduction to the menu </h4><br><h5>  RZX-35 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d24a7fcd/74232de6/1fd40179/be864bfa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9d7d3446/9cf2f9e5/2ef8396a/fa30a0bb.jpg"><br><br>  The menu is made in the form of a strip of icons that can be scrolled in different directions.  The main window contains the following elements: Games, Music, Video, Photo, Camera, Radio, Settings.  In the menu items, some labels do not fit completely.  About the fact that the battery is discharged, the prefix reports a ridiculous message - "Low pressure". <br><br><h5>  RZX-40 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/94809cd9/b1a10924/23b59de0/1d415d2b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a1980b3f/b6e3862e/0093b4a1/de1fb5ee.jpg"><br><br>  Explicit "zakos" under the apple.  The main window contains the following elements: Pictures, Books, Sound Recorder, Music, Camera, Video, Calendar, Games, Alarm, Settings, Radio, Explorer.  The translation is correct and all the inscriptions fit perfectly on the screen. <br><br><h5>  RZX-30 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1de79977/ba44901d/de45687a/442e4bed.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e97a75d6/c6674db1/7f1a3700/704d64ff.jpg"><br><br>  The menu is the same as in the 40th model. <br><br><h4>  Life is like a game </h4><br>  It is on the game component that I would like to dwell in more detail and incidentally touch on the history of the development of console games. <br><br><h5>  Nintendo Entertainment System. </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0f08eef6/ae2e306c/244592ff/368b410f.jpg"><br><br>  Under this name, this console was known in the United States, and in Japan it was called Famicom (FAMily COMputer, FC).  This is a third-generation, 8-bit console that was popular in the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s.  At the same time in Russia was the popular console Dendy, which was the unofficial clone of the NES. <br><br>  Bestsellers: <i>Super Mario, Battle City (famous ‚Äútanchiki‚Äù), Battletoads, Bomber Man, Contra, Chip 'n Dale, Black Cloak, Prince of Persia, Final Fantasy, Super Contra, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> , etc. <br>  Roma Extensions: NES, FC <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6a66f4e7/b1561b3b/7d3cf199/1fd762ad.jpg"><br><br>  All the games from the list of bestsellers, which is listed above, and some others, were launched on all consoles.  Emulation is at a height, there are no brakes, there are no problems with sound either, which in principle was expected - the console is old and does not require large resources for emulation (note: to emulate the console usually requires more resources than the console itself needs).  All games look great on all three consoles. <br><br><h5>  Super Nintendo Entertainment System </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c7de0dcc/6e323e2f/e15779fb/b87847d0.jpg"><br><br>  Also known as Super Nintendo, Super NES and SNES is a fourth-generation, 16-bit game console that was released in late 1990.  In Japan, it is known as Super Famicom. <br><br>  Bestsellers: <i>Super Mario World, Donkey Kong County</i> , etc. <br>  Roma Permissions: BIN, SMC <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/15f53e47/7eb2a49b/0fecfee7/c9af4d66.jpg"><br><br>  Ritmix RZX 35 is not able to emulate this console;  the RZX-30 slows down the picture and distorts the sound, the game turns into a slideshow;  but the RZX-40 really emulates normally.  For the test, I ran a dozen games on it, mostly ‚Äúfights‚Äù (it was after the release of the 16-bit SNES and SMD consoles that the games in the style of ‚Äúfighting‚Äù began to flourish).  All games started and worked fine. <br><br>  For example, the masterpiece Donkey Kong County (its graphics are noticeably different from other games for this console), goes perfectly on the RZX-40 and looks very nice (on the RZX-30 - you can still play, but without much pleasure, it slows down).  All games from the Mortal Kombat series on the RZX-40 also went great, the picture and sound do not slow down. <br><br>  Problems with buttons were observed only in individual and rare strategies - it turned out that there are two functions on one button and it is not clear how to play. <br><br><h5>  Sega mega drive </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7cd2af3c/d499593d/d3adf429/46a38eaa.jpg"><br><br>  The 16-bit console, known worldwide as the Sega MegaDrive, except for North America - there this console is registered under the Sega Genesis trademark.  It was released in late 1988 and remained popular for 10 years. <br><br>  Bestsellers: <i>Sonic the Hedgehog, Mortal Kombat, FIFA 97</i> , and others. <br>  Roma Extensions: BIN, SMD, GEN <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/31a50094/cd5a28e1/45539561/1478cada.jpg"><br><br>  As in the case of SNES, Rimtix RZX 35 was powerless.  At the same time, the RZX-30 almost keeps up with the performance of the RZX-40 and both of them perfectly emulate this console. <br><br>  In the course of testing, I noticed that the consoles do not open ‚ÄúRoma‚Äù with the extension SMD and GEN, but this problem is solved very simply - you need to change the extension on the computer to BIN. <br><br>  When testing gave the highest priority to various fighting games, as well as a series of games Sonic the Hedgehog.  All games start, but sometimes you have to watch a dark screen when you start for 10-20 seconds.  But in general, consoles gave a very good result. <br><br>  The Mortal Kombat series is not very different from the one on SNES, but now both consoles (RZX-30 and RZX-40) cope with them, you can play with pleasure. <br><br>  The Sonic the Hedgehog series made the greatest impression on me, it looked particularly good on both consoles due to the beautiful graphics and good music.  I was even more surprised when I launched Sonic 3D blast (Isometric).  According to the experience of running the HP rx3715 on a PDA, the Sonic 3D blast was the most ‚Äúhard‚Äù to emulate, and therefore low fps values ‚Äã‚Äãon consoles were assumed beforehand (the game differs from many other games of this console by the presence of 3D polygons).  However, it went perfectly on both consoles (while the RZX-30 lacked just a few fps to RZX-40). <br><br><h5>  Game boy </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/ed3a3c85/3ba73670/5dbb01d5/3028f09a.jpg"><br><br>  This is a whole line of portable consoles from Nintendo. <br><br>  The first one, that is, the Game Boy (fourth generation) was released in 1989.  She allowed to play 8-bit games, but, unfortunately, they were black and white.  The color version of the first ‚Äúgameboy‚Äù - Game Boy Color (fifth generation) was released only after 9 years. <br>  Roma extensions: GB <br><br>  Recall the black-and-white games ‚ÄúWell, wait a minute,‚Äù ‚ÄúMerry Cook,‚Äù and others, each of which was a separate device.  In fact, these were clones of the first ‚Äúgameboy‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c5a6b045/5071cb75/fa73a119/a61f0735.jpg"><br><br>  Bestsellers: <i>Alone in the Dark, Darkwing Duck, Grand Theft Auto 2, Heroes of Might and Magic, Super Mario Bros.</i>  <i>Deluxe, Worms Armageddon</i> . <br>  Roma extensions: GBC <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bb740735/c6170873/42c27c04/70f582d6.jpg"><br><br>  On the consoles for the test, several dozen Game Boy (Color) games were launched, including the famous ones (see the bestseller list a few lines above). <br><br>  All three consoles did an excellent job with almost all the games, except for one - Grand Theft Auto 2, on which the RZX-35th slowed down a bit.  Also, the RZX-35 produced slightly less fps in all games than the other two consoles, and the loading of games was slower.  Hardware buttons on consoles was quite enough. <br><br>  Note that the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color screen had a diagonal of 2.36 ‚Äù(significantly less than that of our consoles).  Therefore, the image on the RZX-35 and RZX-40 does not look very clear, somewhat grainy, but on the 30th game they look very good, its screen size is only 2.8 ‚Äù.  In addition, the 40th has an elongated screen compared to the 30th and 35th and the Game Boy (Color) itself, so the image on it turns out to be stretched horizontally.  This is especially noticeable when playing Grand Theft Auto 2 - because of the stretched image, it seems that the car in the game goes horizontally faster than vertically. <br><br>  In 2001, Nintendo moved to a new level of "portable games" and released the Game Boy Advance, a six-generation, 2-bit portable console with a wide color display.  In 2003, the Game Boy Advance SP was released (the consoles discussed in this review are most similar to this model), and in 2005 - the Game Boy Micro. <br><br>  Bestsellers: <i>Pokemon, Sapphire, Max Payne, F-zero, Baldur's Gate, etc., also improved games from other platforms: Mortal Kombat, the version of Sonic games</i> and many, many others (the full list of bestsellers would take up too much space). <br>  Roma Extensions: GBA <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/01dd2b23/b4c96394/1a1f04b2/69c158e6.jpg"><br><br>  At the time of the start of testing games for this console on our consoles, I already had the impression that the RZX-40 is leading in terms of performance, the RZX-30 is close to it and only slightly behind, but the RZX-35 "nervously smokes on the sidelines."  But the GBA games have turned everything upside down. <br><br>  Static games such as strategies, quests, and simple strollers are equally well emulated by all three consoles.  The differences begin when the picture changes quickly and fast texture processing is required from the console, i.e.  in dynamic games. <br><br>  Almost all games were launched on consoles (exceptions will be discussed below).  And at the same time, the RZX-30 turned out to be the clear leader, almost all games run very smoothly, they rarely slow down, mostly only at boot time.  Apparently, changes were made in the emulation algorithms, since the games on the RZX-30 SNES were slowed down, and the GBA, on the contrary, ‚Äúfly‚Äù (compared to the RZX-40). This is a reasonable optimization, since for GBA there are a lot more games released than for SNES. <br><br>  RZX-35 and RZX-40 are lagging behind in terms of performance of the RZX-30 in these games, I would not say that much - most games are equally good on all set-top boxes, the differences are only on the most ‚Äúheavy‚Äù ones for emulating games.  RZX-35 is rather lacking at times a few fps to the 30th model, with some underestimated fps always holding on, so you gradually get used to it if you only play RZX-35.  But the character of the RZX-40 is somewhat different - this is the ‚Äúmixture‚Äù of the 30th and 35th models - the number of fps periodically changes from the 35th to the 30th. <br><br>  There are some of the most popular dynamic games that refused to run on consoles or slowed down a lot during the game.  For example, GTA Advance did not start on any of the consoles (when loading the first level, the game restarts).  A somewhat similar story with the series Need For Speed ‚Äã‚Äã(from the first Underground).  On the 35th and 40th models, these games sometimes do not start at all (hang in the menu), and sometimes you can somehow get to the gameplay itself, but there is a solid slideshow ... Then the 30th model behaved better than the other two, but all the same, it is possible to play though - but not comfortable, because of the strong ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù. <br><br>  However, this does not mean at all that it will not be possible to play 3D games on consoles.  Just the opposite - Driver, a series of racing F-Zero, great go to all three.  And the 30th model allows you to play Max Payne and Tony Hawk Underground with pleasure (which can't be said about the other two consoles). <br><br><h5>  Sunplus </h5><br>  For the above consoles over the years of their existence, thousands and thousands of games managed to come out.  The manufacturers of the Sunplus processor (namely, such processors are on the considered consoles) made several dozen games, ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù specifically for this processor.  It is these games that are originally in the memory of consoles.  On the Internet you can find around 30 such games, and, apparently, the line of these games will not be updated anymore.  The games are mostly simple and not particularly remarkable, and some even slow down, despite the ‚Äúnative‚Äù processor. <br><br><h5>  Flash </h5><br>  Flash is supported on the RZX-40 and RZX-30.  It is very difficult to find games that would support the buttons and be adapted to the screens of consoles.  But you can watch flash cartoons (one such cartoon initially lies in the memory of the console).  Given the number of games that are available for supported consoles, Flash support can be safely left only for watching cartoons and animations. <br><br><h5>  Save </h5><br>  All consoles have the ability to save in games at any time convenient for you.  In each game, you can have only one save (a file with the same name and the extension SAV is created near the location of the "Roma"). <br><br><h5>  Buttons </h5><br>  Separately, we will focus on the buttons of consoles, since this is the main ‚Äúworking tool‚Äù.  Below is a small comparative analysis of the results of testing. <br><br><h6>  RZX-35 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/dd7e3970/81da21c3/5f94dfff/1e3c3c6f.jpg"><br><br><h6>  RZX-40 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6efbb6bb/2040590e/2a3ff899/937e2f2e.jpg"><br><br><h6>  RZX-30 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5899796d/16ae6572/2c7a0e6c/fb9bdf87.jpg"><br><br>  For games from the NES, GB, GBC consoles, differences in the number of buttons in the prefixes do not matter, because there are joysticks and ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù buttons everywhere, and the rest of the buttons do not participate in the gameplay. <br><br>  But for games from other consoles (SNES, SMD, GBA), sometimes ‚Äúshifty‚Äù (side rear buttons) are very important.  The RZX-35th has them, but the 30th and 40th models don't have them anymore.  However, they were not just removed, but moved.  The ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù buttons on the 30th and 40th set-top boxes are the same ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù on the 35th model, and the ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù buttons are the same L "And" R ".  So you just need to get used to a bit of an unusual arrangement, that's all. <br><br>  I was able to notice the not quite correct operation of the ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúOK‚Äù buttons in only one game from the ‚ÄúMetroid‚Äù series (from more than 100 tested games). <br><br>  A very essential control is the joysticks.  They are differently implemented in these three consoles.  In the case of the 35th model, we have a cast 8-position crossbar button.  In the older model (RZX-40) we have two joysticks at once, one made from 4 separate buttons, and one analog (about it separately below), and in the 30th model we have one 4-position joystick (made from four separate buttons , as in the 40th model), but now there is no analog joystick. <br><br>  In some games, you need to be able to confidently perform clicks "diagonally" - in fighting games, shooters, as well as in 3D (Isometric) games (in which the main movements are made diagonally). <br>  In the RZX-30 with the ‚Äúdiagonally‚Äù clicks, the worst part is that the buttons are small and in order to execute such pressing, you need to simultaneously press two buttons.  If the game is calm, then you can cope with this, but the game is dynamic and requires quick reaction, or you can not press two buttons at the same time (as a rule, it‚Äôs three (or even 4 buttons). <br>  The 35th is already significantly better with clicks on the diagonal, but the joystick could be done with a tighter move, and the move itself could be increased - you can still get punctures with clicks "diagonally", although perhaps this is just a matter of habit. <br>  But the RZX-40 is best with the clicks "diagonally", you can optionally perform them with a cross (4-way joystick), but I liked the analog joystick more.  Typically, such joysticks have a hinge at the base and do not move along the surface of an imaginary sphere (for example, as in the case of an analog joystick on the Xbox), but here is a slightly different design (the joystick moves as if on a plane).  You get used to such a joystick very quickly, and with it it was most convenient to play dynamic ‚Äúshooters‚Äù or ‚Äúfighting games‚Äù like Mortal Kombat, as well as Isometric games (Max Payne, Baldur's Gate, Sonic 3D Blast, etc.) <br><br>  At the end I would like to note that there are no complaints about the other buttons in terms of convenience (in terms of false and double clicks). <br><br><h4>  Window to the virtual world </h4><br>  Below is a comparative table of prefix screens, as well as the original consoles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4a80e620/bef1f592/e69516d5/0386083e.png"><br><br>  From the table it is possible to draw conclusions, which are confirmed when checking "live": <br><br>  For the RZX-35 and RZX-30, the NES, SNES, GB, GBC and GBA games are slightly ‚Äústretched‚Äù vertically, and SMD games are displayed perfectly. <br><br>  And for the RZX-40, rather, the opposite situation takes place - the games NES, SNES, GB, GBC and GBA are stretched vertically, and the SMD games, although much smaller, are still slightly stretched.  It should be noted that during the gaming, such a change in proportions, as a rule, does not interfere at all, and for the entire testing time there was only one time that such a stretch was noticeably noticeable - on the RZX-40 console when playing GTA II (since the apparent relative speed of the car changed). <br><br>  Games from NES and GB (GBC) do not look the best way, because of the small resolution of the original image. <br><br>  The saturation of colors is the best in RZX-40, while in RZX-30 and RZX-35 it is slightly worse (and approximately the same).  The screen brightness is the biggest in the RZX-30, while the RZX-35 and RZX-40 are slightly lower (and about the same).  You can not change the brightness of the screen on any of the consoles.  In general, the screens produce a positive impression, the backlight is uniform, the color is good. <br><br><h4>  Prefix as a joystick </h4><br>  It is necessary to mention this possibility, and at the same time recall the old consoles, in which children played the joystick while looking at the TV screen - there is something similar here.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Included with each console is a 3 tulip wire - a minijack, which is inserted into the output on the console, and the tulips are inserted into the standard composite AV input on the TV. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you connect the set-top box to the TV using this cable, it can only be used as a joystick (the screen will go out). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If there is no color on the TV, select the appropriate mode (PAL or NTSC) in the console settings.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Audio player </font></font></h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c42e5ea0/dc4843cc/11fea1cf/8c1fb88f.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Test results showed that the RZX-35 as an audio player sounds much better than the RZX-30 and RZX-40. The 30th and 40th models sound flat and unremarkable (partly this problem can be solved with an equalizer, which, UK, unfortunately, has only preset settings), but the bass is still weak. But the 35th model with sound quality is much better, there is no failure on the bass, and in general we get the sound of a budget player, which is quite good, considering the price and the fact that the main purpose of this device is still games, not music .</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of the audio formats, RZX-35 understands only MP3, AAC. Older models have learned to play a wider range of audio formats: MP3, WMA, WAV, AAC, APE, FLAC. But, as already mentioned, this is of little use - on these consoles it is almost impossible to feel the difference between mp3 and llessless. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Unfortunately, although the RZX-35 has the best sound quality from the considered consoles, it has an inconvenient control - to switch to the next track, you must first use the joystick to press the "forward" or "back" button, and then the "A" button, and so on Raz.V 30th and 40th models of this annoying flaw corrected. Even the RZX-30 has its own ‚Äúfeature‚Äù - these are additional buttons on the case. They are designed to control the audio player when the console cover is closed. These buttons perform their functions correctly.</font></font><br><br><h4>  Video player </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b757739e/150cf2f7/b902b498/1c2b6fc1.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The RZX-35 lags far behind in terms of audio playback capabilities of the other two consoles - it allows you to play only AVI and MP4 with a resolution of up to 640x480 (video with high resolution will not play the prefix - ‚Äúthe format is not supported‚Äù). To sometimes have the opportunity to pass the time while watching movies / cartoons (or to achieve a half-hour period of silence and peace from a child) these possibilities are quite enough. However, with the aspect ratio of the picture video 16: 9, we get some difficulties, because the prefix screen has a ratio of 4: 3. This problem can be solved by cutting off the boundaries of the video on the computer - but this option will not suit everyone. The same problem is inherent in the 30th model due to the similar aspect ratio.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RZX-40, thanks to the elongated screen (aspect ratio approximately 16k9), a more powerful processor and support for a wider range of video formats (AVI, FLV, WMV, MP4 resolution up to 1280x720) can already be positioned as a portable video player. According to the test results, the RZX-40 prefix reproduces the following formats without any problems: </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">1) AVI files with a total stream (video + audio) up to 7MB / s; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2) MP4 - with a stream of up to 4-5 MB / s; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">3) WMV - with a stream of up to 5-6 MB / s; </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">4) FLV - with flow up to 4MB / s.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For comparison, a PDA (all the same HP rx3715) with a screen resolution of 320x240 and a diagonal of 3.5 ‚Äù(at 480x272 and 3.6‚Äù, respectively) and a 400MHz processor (at 300MHz, does not ‚Äúpull‚Äù AVI video with a stream above 2-3) MB / sec, and for such a PDA it is crucial that the video be under the screen size - otherwise it will slow down.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, there were some shortcomings - the prefix cannot boast a large number of settings in the video player. Rather, they are almost none - you can only set the original video size or stretch to full screen. And here the problems begin - if a video with a 4k3 aspect ratio, then when choosing the option ‚Äúfill the entire screen‚Äù the video will stretch horizontally. As mentioned above, it is better to prepare video files with the desired aspect ratio in advance on a computer. It is also advisable not to forget about the conversion before copying movies to the console, or to specially download special ‚Äúreduced‚Äù versions of the films - then there will be no unnecessary problems with playing them on the console.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The RZX-30 is slightly better in terms of performance than the RZX-40 (due to the identical processor and smaller screen). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, unfortunately, the screen has a 4k3 aspect ratio, and the screen itself is very small - 2.6 ‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Watching movies on this screen is a very dubious pleasure. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But at the same time, the RZX-30 reproduces video in HD format with almost no problems. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Note that all models of the prefixes remember the place where the playback was interrupted and when repeated playback, they kindly ask whether to continue playback or start over.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ‚ÄúI always take a video camera with me‚Äù </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I remember once I had a motorola smartphone, whose native battery was already rather weak. There was a question about buying a new battery of increased capacity. I found a guy who sells batteries, he bought them in China. And then I learned that the Chinese are directly saying: tell me what capacity to write on the battery itself, we will write it, but in reality the capacity will still be no higher than a certain one. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It was remembered when I tested cameras on consoles - starting with the 40th model, the specifications say that the camera is 5Mp, although in fact, it‚Äôs still the same 1.3Mp as the 35th model.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">More precisely, the RZX-40 allows you to take pictures with a maximum resolution of 1280 x 720 (96 dots per inch, color depth - 24), which gives 0.92 megapixels, and not 5 megapixels at all (there is also such an inscription on the butt end of the console) , according to one appearance of the camera, it is already clear that the pictures will be very mediocre and suitable for viewing from the screen of the set-top box itself. It's just a way to give your child the opportunity to practice shooting, before buying him the first ‚Äúsoap box‚Äù. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Surprisingly, the mode of photography is replete with a variety of settings (on all consoles), from which, for the most part, there is very little sense (therefore I will not dwell on this in detail). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RZX-35: You can choose the resolution of images: 320x240 or 640x480 (JPEG). Video can not be shot.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RZX-40 &amp; RZX-30: You can choose the resolution of images: 480x272, 640x368, or 1280x720 (JPEG). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Video: 320x240 or 640x480. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(MPEG 4. At a resolution of 640x480 - 25 frames per second, the speed of the total stream is 3213 Kb / s, and at a resolution of 320x240 - 30 frames per second, and the speed of the stream is 1117 Kb / sec).</font></font><br><br>  Sample photos: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/acf43fa7/229bef36/96cb8827/79c3575d.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All photos are reduced to approximately the size in which they can be viewed from consoles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The pics show that they are "purely symbolic." </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Video recordings on consoles are the same ‚Äúsymbolic‚Äù as the photos, and are only suitable for viewing from a small screen of the console.</font></font><br><br><h4>  Additional features </h4><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Actual for all consoles </font></font></h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e78f5210/fb442bc9/600a9df9/a6e5d508.jpg"><br><br><h6><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> View photos </font></font></h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All consoles have a simple ‚Äúviewer‚Äù of pictures. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is nothing special in it, so I will not dwell on it in detail. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we assume that his main task is to watch photos and videos taken with the built-in camera - for this he is quite suitable.</font></font><br><br><h6>  Radio </h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This feature is well implemented on all consoles. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In Moscow, the reception is confident and I would even say - excellent. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On all consoles both automatic and manual search of radio stations with a 0.1MHz course are implemented. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can also save radio stations - up to 20 presets. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All models have FM band: 87.5-108MHz.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Only relevant for RZX-30 &amp; RZX-40 </font></font></h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/af2a81cd/f84d8c0f/de70fb25/ef893ceb.jpg"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> These additional functions are equally implemented on both consoles. </font></font><br><br><h6>  Reading of books </h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The reader is saddened by its ‚Äúunfinishedness‚Äù - it is stated that the prefix (both RZX-40 and RZX-30) reads only the txt format in KOI-8 (!) Encoding, which corresponds to reality, and the prefix really performs this task well - it opens instantly text files, regardless of size (for example, a 30 MB test file opened in a couple of seconds), does not slow down while browsing. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are not many settings - you can save / load a bookmark, and also enable / disable the automatic page turning mode. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, now there are practically no texts in this encoding, they have to be specially ‚Äúprepared‚Äù. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The choice of this particular encoding, rather than the standard encoding of Windows-1251, seems somewhat strange.</font></font><br><br><h6><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Dictaphone </font></font></h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Recording consoles is actually not bad - for recording conversations are great. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is not enough noise, the voice is audible quite distinctly and clearly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Information about the test recording: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Format: AAC, VBR </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Duration: 00:37 </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quality: 16 kHz, 67 kbps </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Size on disk: 301.70 kb</font></font><br><br><h6><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Radio recording </font></font></h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here is information about the test recording: </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Format: AAC, VBR </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Duration: 02:11 </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Quality: 44 kHz, 103 kbps </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Size on disk: 1.57 Mb</font></font><br><br><h6>  The calendar </h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Simple, beautiful calendar. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are no functions other than the display of the present day and moving by months and years.</font></font><br><br><h6>  Alarm clock </h6><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the player‚Äôs menu, you can set any song on the alarm clock, and in the alarm menu, you can enable or disable the alarm and set the time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The alarm clock works correctly - at the right time, the console will turn on itself and start playing the pre-selected song. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The volume of the alarm will be the same as the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù volume, that is, it is advisable not to forget to check the volume before turning off the set-top box.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Memory expansion </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">RZX-35 supports USB mini flash, unfortunately I don‚Äôt have such flash drives, so I couldn‚Äôt check it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But with the RZX-30 and RZX-40, the manufacturers obviously modestly said that they understand only micro SD (T-Flash) (up to 8 GB) - because the prefixes ‚Äúdigested‚Äù the micro SDHC for 16GB (with I did not check, and there is no need - their cost exceeds the cost of the set-top box itself). </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the memory from the cards is used in a very peculiar way - if the internal memory is set as ‚Äúmain‚Äù in the settings, then the contents of the card are not visible, and if the card‚Äôs memory is set as ‚Äúmain‚Äù, then the contents of the internal memory are not visible. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When you connect the console to the computer, you can see and change the contents of the card.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Check weighing </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The table summarizes the main findings. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9a200d2a/8a92047a/17ff0549/483647b7.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the consoles reviewed in this review proved to be a good one. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can play many games from old consoles, and in the vast majority of games without lags. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pleases the presence of a large number of additional functions - viewing photos, videos, listening to audio, photo and video shooting, radio, etc. Some of the drawbacks of the type of incorrectly working reader are not too significant, especially considering the low price of devices. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Such a prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãsuitable as a child who is just attached to the virtual world, and more adults who were once fans of old games and want to remember the past.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119468/</a></p>
