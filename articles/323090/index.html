As <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/277887/">promised a year ago</a> , we did our <a href="http://www.eastbanctech.ru/calendar/ru/">2017 calendar</a> completely different from the previous one.  It turned out, it seems, the warmest and very real.  The whole truth about EastBanc Technologies in our post today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f5/665/25a/0f566525a4774adf889036a3963a19bb.jpg"><br><br>  Conceiving the calendar, we wanted to tell our partners and friends that behind our technical solutions are living people who are passionate about their work.  According to the plan, the main theme of the calendar was to be a story about the real life of our team - about how our developers' eyes are burning, when you need to quickly solve an interesting problem.  As we sometimes fight, conquering kicking new technologies, as we argue over solutions, how we gather will into a fist when we need to hand over a project in a short time.  We wanted to tell about all this in our calendar.  But how to remove all this in the photo? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  While the thought process is going crazy in a developer‚Äôs brain, while he comes to the delight of his find, to despair from the complexity of the task, or to the rage of someone else‚Äôs ugly piece of code, the outsider sees only the programmer who is still sitting at the computer for 5 hours.  All adventures occur in the space of intelligence.

      Therefore, we decided to tell about our work through images from the non-working life of our employees, because in it they show the same personal qualities as in professional activities.  This is how the concept of the calendar was born - we decided to make the most lively emotional photos without photoshop about what purposeful, gambling, versatile people work in our team.  In each plot, the key emotion captured in the frame is a story not only about the hero of the photo itself, but also about the principles and strengths common for EastBanc Technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd1/1ff/08b/cd11ff08b41940f399e1918438ea0a92.jpg"><br><br>  Having decided to take a photo of the ‚ÄúJewel of the Moment‚Äù, we wanted to tell you that in our work sometimes we really shouldn‚Äôt miss an important moment.  You either do it now and become the first, the best, or someone takes your place.  It is impossible to postpone something for later because of laziness, the expectation of someone, ‚Äúunimportance‚Äù ... Our credo: ‚ÄúIf you see an opportunity, realize it.‚Äù <br>  The hero of the photo was our developer Danil, because he, as a young father, is well aware of the uniqueness of the moment.  He entrusted to us the most expensive - the first ever photo session of his daughter Karina, who was only 3 months old.  Karina became the only model in the calendar who fell asleep during the filming.  But we managed to make the same frame. <br><br>  Memorable moments are only separate episodes in our work.  Much more hard work in it, in which you need to complete the project, no matter how difficult it may be.  Even if the customer has replaced almost a dozen developers before us, and we are the last one who could make a quality product.  Even if the work required twice as many resources as planned.  Writing a program is only half the battle, it is much more difficult to reach the end, correct mistakes, test in real combat conditions, implement.  About this readiness to reach the end in each of our venture the following photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c4/75f/6bb/5c475f6bbd2a4764bf617f2c7cf5d097.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo are the developers Peter, Konstantin and Nikolai on the North-Chuisky Range in the Altai Mountains.  ‚ÄúIt was my first ascent to such a height,‚Äù says Peter.  - We climbed on the ice.  Most of the way we walked along the ridge, where the right or left abyss.  It was not terrible, because there is no time for thinking about fear.  You have to think about every step.  Because of the lack of oxygen, you spend a lot of energy on any movement. ‚Äù <br>  Konstantin in the group of climbers was a novice, so the climb was difficult for him: ‚ÄúBut I liked it.  Therefore, in the same year I took up additional physical training and went to Belukha.  The second climb was much easier for me.  Now we are planning to go to Crete and go down there to the 7 most interesting canyons and gorges ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb8/a0d/6d5/bb8a0d6d54f94bbd80c57a4cfd25abdf.jpg"><br><br>  In the next photo of our calendar, we wanted to talk about trusting each other.  Maybe it sounds a little pompous, but in technical work one cannot do without good human relations.  Our customers trust us, and we trust each other, our team.  To make a working business application, you need to communicate directly with future users of the systems.  And our customers provide access to all their business processes.  We come to our partners and in real conditions we study the business process that we have to automate.  Reliability of processes in the business of customers depends on the reliability of our software solutions without any exaggeration.  We take on this responsibility to our partners because we have a team that we trust. <br>  When we thought about trust, we had a story about the dance, in the shooting of which our developer Alexander took part together with his girlfriend.  They not only take a great interest in dancing, but also teach Brazilian dance Forro, which is rare for our northern latitudes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/dfe/2d2/717dfe2d211544f5843a513fecd250b7.jpg"><br><br>  People far from development, do not even imagine what kind of excitement you can experience sitting at a computer desk.  No less than some are gambling.  You should have seen the luminous eyes of our tester Lyuba when she applied deduction and found where the dog rummaged in the logs of one of our customers.  And with what excitement <a href="http://www.eastbanctech.ru/calendar/ru/">we thought out</a> for the student master class on IoT-decision the controller of the light bulb and taught her to turn on from the smartphone through the service in AWS.  It is the excitement that we dedicated to this photo. <br>  One of the heroes of the photo was our development director Dmitry - a very reckless man, like his three daughters, who regularly beat him at poker and another in a bunch of nastol.  At home, with my family, or at work, with colleagues, our people are people who live and work with excitement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e2/a7f/a06/6e2a7fa065854a6aa500b97b910e9241.jpg"><br><br>  To make a finished software product, you need the hard work of many participants.  When the layout designer translates the layout into the finished page, trying to take into account every nuance, or when the developer corrects bugs and brings the product to perfection, these processes can be compared with cutting out on wood - they also require extreme concentration.  That is why to shoot a story about our skills, we wanted to find a very warm idea about something done with a soul.  The plot of the hobby of our tester Elena, who is keen on woodcarving, turned out to be suitable. <br>  The mastery of a programmer, of course, is not only in the ability to ‚Äúmeditate‚Äù for hours in front of a monitor screen.  Now we need to quickly develop together with modern technologies in order to produce an ultra-modern result.  Sometimes it is not easy.  For example, when developing the server part of one of the projects, we decided to use the latest Angular2 platform.  As it turned out, the platform was not able to do everything that we needed.  But despite the technical difficulties, in the end the decision was successfully released. <br>  Another example of our willingness to keep up with the times is the release of our own framework.  This year, we paid our debts to the open source community with <a href="https//habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/315558/">our Right-Angled library</a> to optimize the tables that business applications abound. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eee/a51/117/eeea51117be8488283f9beb133eb333b.jpg"><br><br>  We love to fight - for results, for quality, for speed.  This is our next story.  In the photo our colleagues during the game in the corporate basketball team.  In the photo, project manager Natalya against developer Alexey and other players of the basketball team EastBanc Technologies.  Yes, our girls are in no way inferior to men in their willingness to fight even on the sports field, even in heated debates on work issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67e/fea/d19/67efead195ea44409d421ebbb932de60.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo, our designer and part-time amateur astronomer Daria.  To find a particular star in the sky, Daria has to study its location in specialized sources beforehand, and then patiently tune the telescope until the desired celestial body gets into focus.  We removed this story about readiness for patient search for the calendar because it is exactly about us.  We are interested in approaching each task from the perspective of a researcher, discovering new things, inventing, expanding borders, including for our clients.  For example, sometimes a customer comes to us for a solution that allows you to simplify only one local process and already learns from us that today there are complete systems for optimizing the complex of their tasks right away. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/f24/543/72ff2454329d4b0c9b9b4f8da0159861.jpg"><br><br>  In the photo, our developer Danil, who swims and works very technically.  Technique requires constant training.  Therefore, we have no time to relax, we are constantly learning and introducing new technologies.  For example, we started living according to the principles of devops and continuous integration long before it became mainstream and continue to improve these practices.  We are increasingly implementing code review and optimize testing and bugfixing processes.  And constantly improve the quality of our code and our products.  Our specialists are certified in key technologies, which gives us gold partner statuses, and with them licenses for Microsoft products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/ce3/92a/723ce392a10e4eb1b6594aea35798e20.jpg"><br><br>  There are projects from the series ‚ÄúFloated - we know‚Äù, and there are those that challenge and open up completely new horizons.  These are the second - the most valuable.  They teach us something new and make us more experienced.  Therefore, we undertake for them, even if it is difficult.  We love the development.  When there is a really exciting project, sometimes you forget about rest and food.  To remove the story of this passionate love for the development was the hardest. <br>  The heroes were our developers and part-time sailors.  These shootings were the most epic adventure.  Although the guys in windbreakers portrayed relaxed skiing in the Mediterranean, it was actually hellishly cold.  The sun and the sea in the photo look like real ones, but the air temperature is +7 and the water is +12.  And the sun is Siberian, and the sea is Ob. <br>  Behind the scenes was a boat from which the shooting was conducted.  The boat was driven by professionally cutting circles around the yacht, the brave Dina, head of the design department.  At some point, Dina began to manage too bravely, drove up close and with a wave from the boat laid the yacht on its side, at the same time almost dipping the photographer and 800 filmed photos.  Dina mentally prepared an excuse for management to drown two valuable developers.  But it turned out that the guys didn‚Äôt see such a thing, they instantly leveled the yacht, after all, they have the third category in yachting and they are winners in the ‚ÄúSailing Cup of Siberia‚Äù. <br>  So the plot turned out that the sea and development are our elements.  Although sometimes they give surprises: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5q7WWzZ0cAs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b51/dc4/aa9/b51dc4aa9d004badabaaa08898ee3ffa.jpg"><br><br>  We are as multifaceted as our people are.  Sometimes the result exceeds expectations.  For example, starting a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/eastbanctech/blog/282658/">project to create a mobile application for inspecting a car</a> , no one could assume that it would be so effective that it would become the industry standard.  And recently we surprised ourselves when we moved to a new level of work with Front end - developing not just interfaces, but a single design language for a complex of customer projects.  The result was the creation of a single ecosystem of dozens of customer applications, more manageable for the owner and more user-friendly.  To tell about what unexpected talents sometimes open to our team, we chose a story about an unusual hobby of our iOS developer Mark. <br><br>  Mark is interested in organizing Pop-up cinema nights.  This is a street entertainment for those who like to watch movies and dance.  Every Saturday, Mark and his friends chose some unexpected place every Saturday, for example, a beach, a forest clearing or a parking lot, turned it into an unusual location with a screen and hundreds of light bulbs and showed everyone to the film.  Viewing ended with a disco in the open.  For a new event, a unique idea was invented: ‚ÄúEvery time we changed the locations and the whole style,‚Äù says Mark.  - We did the scenery, full entourage.  I was inspired by the idea to make something new at lightning speed, create a moment and enjoy living with friends. ‚Äù <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SMDnYCBtk6g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  By the time the calendar was filmed, the open-air cinema season was over.  But we were so excited about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a story about our creativity that we decorated an unfinished house especially for the photo.  The decoration took about a thousand light bulbs! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1a/5ab/9c5/b1a5ab9c574a4564b32a99a96e8c9544.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b01/340/a4e/b01340a4e28b4c68a967a0fb807aa0f9.jpg"><br><br>  Our partners appreciate us for having our own view on any project.  Of course, we always listen to the customer very carefully, but we offer our vision and our own solution to the problem, based on knowledge of technology, market knowledge, our experience and common sense.  In the photo, our main ideologist and part-time leader - Director Dmitry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7be/f40/f1f/7bef40f1f0a0428d91921c4737eb0c28.jpg"><br><br>  And finally, we are not only our colleagues, but also our families.  Supporting loved ones is the best source of strength.  For children and their parents, we are happy to make special events and prepare gifts. For example, this New Year children invented mittens in the form of EBT-men (our talisman) and found knitters who manually tied more than 60 mittens and gloves according to the individual patterns of our palms children. <br><br>  The next calendar has become our favorite creative project, in which we, as well as in all our developments, have invested not only efforts, but also soul.  In our work people who make it are very important.  Millions of lines of code are living creative guys that you can rely on.  That is what we have tried to tell in our photo story about the real, live EastBanc Technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323090/</a></p>
