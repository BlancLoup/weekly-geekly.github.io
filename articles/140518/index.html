  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to create your own game: the main question of any juzverej</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How to create your own game: I often see such a question in search queries.  There are a lot of game engines and designers, and they are all so incomprehensible ... I would just like to think, and the game has already been created, and all the sprites are drawn, and the code is written.  What a pity that this is impossible. <br><br>  But still there are ways by which you can easily and quickly create your game so that it is playable and meets all the requirements of a computer game. <br>  And in this topic, I will tell you how to choose the engine for the game. <br><br>  Became interesting?  Welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, it would be worthwhile to understand why computer games are needed: for some it is entertainment, for others it is a way of recreation, some even earn money by playing them!  Maybe you want to brag to a friend that you got a new level, or maybe you are just tired after the working day and want to rest.

      So, the ideal game must meet all the requirements of the player.  But a lot depends on the engine. <br><br>  If you look from the side of the game developer, then the ideal engine should be light, with a lot of possibilities, and so as not to require any cash investments.  Many game developers think about the graphics - 2D or 3D?  If you want to quickly and easily create a game, then 2D is more suitable.  But if you have nerves of iron (although they are necessary for any game), and you are ready to make the game for six months: then you can study 3D modeling.  But we take 2D. <br>  Let's take a closer look at 2D-engines. <br><br>  <b>1. GameMaker.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/742/dbc/e42/742dbce42ae6d6b8e1044ecefc0caa5c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I think many people know about this popular game designer.  This is a good tool for beginners, but it is not practical. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  Suitable for novice developers </li><li>  Creating games without programming </li><li>  It is possible to create pseudo-3D games </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  It requires a long learning, very incomprehensible </li><li>  You can‚Äôt create a normal game, no one will know about it, except the users of the forum on which you set the game </li><li>  Few opportunities </li><li>  Downloading the game is required, you will not play in the browser </li></ul><br>  So, Game Maker is not suitable.  Go ahead. <br><br>  <b>2. HTML5.</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c94/d9a/40a/c94d9a40a91a713f4b19fface083c1cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  HTML5 is a new generation of HTML, and now you can make games with it.  With it, you can create a game, but it is also complex and incomprehensible.  Perhaps in a few years it will be sufficiently suitable for igrostroy, but now ... <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  You can play games directly in the browser </li><li>  Many tools for creating games </li><li>  Games are beautiful if you try </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Open source, the game can "clone", and does not protect against it </li><li>  The game is integrated into the page, it is difficult to transfer it to another site (as opposed to a flash) </li><li>  Creating HTML games is difficult, there are few tutorials for creating games on it. </li><li>  Almost all HTML game designers are paid. </li></ul><br>  So that HTML is not suitable.  But there is a solution ... <br><br>  <b>3. Flash!</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e8e/9c4/741/e8e9c4741f8322f92e817a1dc6679c83.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Flash is currently the best platform to create a game.  With it, you can create games in the shortest possible time, for it there are a lot of programs and numerous frameworks, a lot of tutorials on these same frameworks, and it is universal! <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><ul><li>  Versatility </li><li>  Many lessons </li><li>  You can earn good money with it </li><li>  You can even make 3D games </li><li>  Can be placed on many sites, is played in the browser <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  You need to learn, you can‚Äôt do a normal Flash game without programming </li><li>  There are many Flash games, almost all ideas are busy, you need to look for something that has not yet been </li><li>  Without frameworks it is very complex. </li></ul><br><br>  My choice is Flash.  It is very suitable for creating games. <br><br>  To write a game, I use tools like Flash Develop, the Flixel library, and if you use them very skillfully, you can create a whole hit.  So - dare, and someday create your game! </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140518/</a></p>
