Since anything can be fantasized <s>and wait for this year</s> , it will be better to focus on one particular aspect.  With graphics, sound and other goodies, and so everything is clear (you give the game in guided dreams!), But about the " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582">game artificial intelligence</a> " is not so simple.  In this regard, it was decided to search the Internet for interesting articles, read, summarize and finalize the final opinion. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Before this, I would like to mention that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãin particular handles such things in games as: <br><ul><li>  movement of bots (rectilinear movement, movement with acceleration and turns, movement in a group, movement taking into account physics, jumping, coordinated movement in a group, control of engine operation in auto-simulators) </li><li>  finding the path (Dijkstra's algorithm, A * search algorithm, hierarchical finding the path) </li><li>  decision making (decision tree, finite automata, fuzzy logic, Markov systems, purposeful behavior, rule-based systems, scripting) </li><li>  learning (quite a hot topic in AI, currently being solved by modifying parameters, predicting actions, improving decision making, improving decision tree, reinforcement learning, and of course artificial neural networks) </li></ul>

      After a few hours of googling, thoughtful reading, thoughtful looks into the window and the intelligible design of my stream of consciousness, I decided to simply present the opinions of people who are actually engaged in AI in game development. <br><br>  <b>Chris Elion</b> (AI Havok Team Lead): <br>  ‚ÄúThe first big step would be standardization of the main set of low-level services for AI.  These services will be such things as high-speed generation of the navigation grid, dynamic deflection, character movement, etc.  Such services are flexible enough to come in handy in a number of game genres, such as FPS, TPS, MMO, RTS, auto, moto, air and space simulators, etc., and will work in all kinds of environments, including fully dynamic environments or huge open worlds. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúHavok has made significant progress in the interaction of low-level AI and dynamic environments.  Some of the results that are already available to game developers are pretty cool.  For example, you can see a sudden change in behavior, when the characters do not just move around each other, but also hang out next to the terrain being destroyed. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Eric Plante</b> (product manager for character animation from the Autodesk gaming technology group): <br>  ‚ÄúAnother amazing thing is the connection between AI and animation.  Today you can find character <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_(%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">mesh</a> in online libraries and shops, you can find animations, but the behavior, and even more easily customizable behavior, is not to be found. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Matthew Titelbaum</b> (Monolith): <br>  ‚ÄúAI systems in the future will help players to immerse themselves in the game.  However, based on the experience in creating games of the FEAR series, the game AI will improve not the human-like behavior of the NPC, but rather unpredictable behavior. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt used to be acceptable for AI to have complete information about the environment.  Now we have stimulus and sensory systems for more accurate modeling of what the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcan learn.  We also use planners, hierarchical finite automata, and trees for behaviors. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Bruce Wilcox</b> (main development engineer from Telltale Games): <br>  ‚ÄúAI in games is not developing as rapidly as we would like, since the efforts of developers are mainly focused on graphics.  This situation may change.  At some point the game will begin to compete with someone better AI.  We already see it in Asia, where companies are trying to improve the NPC in their MMOG.  They have optimized everything that is possible in their games and are now looking for how to improve the AI.  Even Unreal buyers are looking for tools to improve the AI ‚Äã‚Äãof the characters. ‚Äù <br><br>  Well, from myself add that it would be nice to use speech recognition and facial expressions.  And it would be interesting to read from knowledgeable people the possibility of AI calculation using GPUs, as well as the possibility of parallel or distributed AI calculation, say in the MMOG. <br><br>  Regarding the ‚ÄúFuture of Computer Games,‚Äù I think the future is in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">MMOG</a> . <br><br>  ps: the translation is slightly free ... <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="http://www.develop-online.net/features/1427/AI-getting-smarter">www.develop-online.net/features/1427/AI-getting-smarter</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6283722/the-future-of-ai-in-games">www.gamespot.com/features/6283722/the-future-of-ai-in-games</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.industrygamers.com/news/ai-building-smarter-games/">www.industrygamers.com/news/ai-building-smarter-games</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Programming-Brian-Schwab/dp/1584505729">"AI Game Engine Programming"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/130729/">https://habr.com/ru/post/130729/</a></p>
