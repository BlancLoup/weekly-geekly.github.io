It seems to be all right and what to wish next?  Well, they put things in order: around and in the head, and then what? <br><br>  What do you think could be next?  Maybe an attempt to make life more active. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After talking with different people on the topic of the last topic, I brought a couple more ideas that can help people ‚Äústalled‚Äù in motivation and laziness :-) <br><br>  First and foremost.  We are all somehow lazy.  Only necessity compels us to do something, be it work, cleaning, helping others.  And what if to turn a duty into a necessity?

      I myself am a lazy person in my life, when it comes to physical labor.  Except for construction.  I love to design, build, swing an ax, and more.  It's just that I like it and it does not matter that it is also physical labor - the process itself is a pleasure. <br><br>  So why can't I do something else with the same enthusiasm?  The whole thing is part of laziness.  No dacha - nothing else where I could engage in construction, I do not have.  Therefore, I am asking for friends who are at the stage of building a summer house (or rework).  And we work there at least together, with rare exceptions, I'm alone. <br><br>  Hence the second reason - collectivity.  If you do not one, but the company (more than 1), then less laziness and more joy. <br><br>  In childhood (when it was 8-16 years old).  My friends and I often "rummaged" around the neighborhood.  Fortunately, we lived on the outskirts of the town and the expanses of the homeland in winter and summer were available to us.  The very childhood was still in the USSR, so we knew the neighborhood well and our parents ‚Äúalmost let us go‚Äù.  Naturally, we left the crowd a few kilometers from the house, but the parents did not know it (Yes, dad, I went for a walk very far - more than a few blocks from the house :-)).  Over time, when the time to study began to go away, we stopped walking, but the need for ‚Äúfresh air‚Äù remained.  Then we gathered in groups and made evening runs (3-4 km each).  And not by the stadium, but by the surroundings.  (By the way, according to the phys-re, everyone was fine in the end, and I then weighed 100 kg). <br><br>  There is another reason why people are not active.  I‚Äôll call it Girlish Paranoia.  ‚ÄúHow can I go and do / do something /, and if I don, then everyone will look at me.‚Äù  Actually, after the institute and the army, people partly cease to fear public opinion.  Often there is a "pontovoy zakompleksovannost" - is the same.  You can talk a lot here, but I feel I touch some of the things alive.  I will give only an example. <br>  My daughter, if the strazik gets unstuck from jeans, that's all - everyone is looking at her and showing her finger, she is already ugly and fat, and so on :-) <br><br>  Familiar? <br><br>  Now apply it to yourself!  There is no such thing with you?  That's when we say: ‚ÄúYes, what will I go then?  What should I do there, I don‚Äôt want / don't know how / don‚Äôt know ‚Äù- remember these lines :-) <br><br>  And what to do now? <br><br>  I'm not saying that now there should be no one behind the monitors (aha - only vacuum slam from a sharply moved body).  But to think about the activity in life is worth how.  An excuse to NOT do something can always be found.  But try to take and make.  Everything has to be decided, somewhere, of course, you have to force yourself, BUT. <br><br>  It was a good idea, in my opinion, even in Habr√©.  People were going for jogging, cycling, roller skating and so on.  So why not revive it?  Everyone can have a ‚Äúcolleague‚Äù capable of making a ‚Äúmagic pendel‚Äù at a specified time. <br><br>  Find additional cases for yourself that do not leave you a chance for more than 30-60 minutes to sit / lie in your spare time from sleep / work. <br><br>  Everyone has friends or acquaintances whose working hours coincide with yours.  Cooperate, because you can not only run, jump, pedal, but also play a long-forgotten game - Siskin, catch up, "hog" and so on.  This is also an activity !!!  And who cares that "10 healthy guys and bearded guys will be hooting with a dirty rag around the yard with a hoot"?  Yes, and can you seduce that you, too, give the "magic Pendel" colleague? <br><br>  In general, try for yourself and for others! <br><br>  Shl.  After the previous post, I began to systematically increase the pedaling time on a stationary bike.  I try not to succumb to laziness regarding housework. <br><br>  ZYY.  Advise in what thematic blog to send? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96060/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96060/</a></p>
