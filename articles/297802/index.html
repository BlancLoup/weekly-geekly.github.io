  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Look At Me project is restructuring and acquiring new owners.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/01/11/623530-deripaska-sovladeltsem">to</a> Vedomosti, the founders of the online publication entered into an agreement with the Forward Media Group publishing house, which is led by Polina Deripaska, the wife of the famous Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska.  According to the contract, the rights to the online publication of the Look At Me project, as well as other subsidiary projects (The Village, Wonderzine, Furfur) are transferred to the joint venture LAM Publishing.  At the same time, the content on the ‚Äúmain‚Äù site has not been updated since the last day of last year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Aleksey Ametov, one of the founders of Look At Media holding, LAM Russia retained control over its project.  The amount of the transaction is not reported.  It is known that the post of managing editor will keep Alexander Suvorov, and the chief editors of other company sites will also remain in their posts.  The deal with the Forward Media Group publishing house is part of the restructuring of LAM.  As the co-founder and managing director of the holding Ekaterina Bazilevskaya notes, in 2015, the company structured its assets in accordance with current business lines, which will allow for more efficient management of subsidiaries and successfully search for investments. <br><br>  Forward Mediag Group, the agreement was commented by Pablo Vazquez Martin, the general director of the publishing house: ‚ÄúThe deal is part of the FMG digital development program, which is currently the most strategically important for us.  We have long watched the LAM project in the context of a serious business partnership perspective. ‚Äù <br><br>  The Look At Media publishing house was founded in 2007 and during that time turned from an unremarkable street fashion blog into a well-known online resource that later acquired subsidiary projects: Furfur, a portal for modern men, the urban Internet newspaper and web website for girls called Wonderzine.  Currently, the holding consists of three divisions: Hopes and Fears, an English-language media in the United States, GRID publishing platform and, in fact, LAM Publishing.  Last year, the holding faced financial problems, being unable to pay fees to freelancers.  In the penultimate week of last year, December 25, LAM Russia filed an application with the Moscow Arbitration Court to declare itself bankrupt, at the same time announcing the closure of the project Look At Me.  According to the founders, the site will continue to work, but without updating the content.  This will not affect the work of other projects. </div>
