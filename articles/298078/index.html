  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ABBYY enters the US search market, and ABBYY LS launches the marketplace for translators: employee comments</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Russian IT company <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBYY">ABBYY is</a> launching a new large-scale project.  In the United States, the <a href="http://beta.findo.io/">Findo</a> search engine <a href="http://beta.findo.io/">begins</a> .  The key differences Findo company founder David Yang calls the ability to search for information in the cloud storage, social networks and user devices (computers and smartphones). <br><br>  Another difference is the ability of the search engine to process requests in human languages ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, on the query ‚Äúfind me a presentation made in December‚Äù, the search engine finds a file on your computer that matches the parameters). <br><br>  Findo - designed based on the <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/isearch/compreno/">Compreno</a> platform.  This is a text analysis system that ABBYY has been developing for over 10 years.  Over $ 80 million was spent on its development.  As planned, ABBYY Compreno can find the necessary information not only with the help of the search query words, but also with the help of the connections and context between them.

      According to a study by ABBYY, about 20% of users did not immediately find the information they needed, Yang explains.  Findo offers a way out - combine all sources of information and index them. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Findo has competitors, but they either know how to search only for one type of storage (cloud or local), or they don‚Äôt understand natural language and don‚Äôt see the connection between objects, Yang <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/01/21/624846-abbyy-ssha">tells</a> Vedomosti. <br><br>  Modern search engines understand the essence of the question posed in a natural form, and now work is under way to understand the questions posed by the voice, director Grigory Bakunov of Yandex‚Äôs technology distribution director said.  Creating a search engine that can search for information on the Internet, in the cloud photo album, in sms messages, and in desktop documents, Bakunov calls it a difficult, but achievable task. <br><br>  Findo will be focused on the mass market - as long as with an English-speaking audience.  Now the product is testing about 1000 people.  ABBYY invested $ 1.5 million in Findo, and in 2016 will invest another $ 1.4 million.  Now you can search only in English, but Yang does not exclude that ABBYY will add other languages ‚Äã‚Äãdepending on demand in different regions. <br><br>  In accordance with the adopted freemium monetization model, the base product will be free, but users will have to pay for additional options.  Paid service will cost about $ 5 per month.  Another way of earning money is licensing Findo to third-party manufacturers, says Yang.  According to him, now ABBYY is negotiating with two companies with a large audience in need of intellectual search. <br><br>  Yang believes that Findo will make a profit with 2.2 million users, if 2-8% of them will pay for using the service. <br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABBYY_Language_Services">ABBYY Language Solutions</a> , a subsidiary of ABBYY, went a little different way, but it didn‚Äôt manage without free ‚Äúbuns‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe [ABBYY LS] refuse to sell licenses to our cloud platform to automate SmartCAT translation.  This is not a freemium model: for corporate clients, full access to the platform is free.  For freelance translators, the platform has been and remains free, ‚Äùtold Sergey Kornilov, ABBYY LS PR director, told Megamozgu. <br><br>  Previously, the platform worked on the model of paid licenses for one workplace.  The company plans to earn at the expense of the commission from transactions and additional services: extended technical support, implementation services, and so on.  According to estimates of ABBYY LS specialists, in about a year, the proceeds from the commission will be about $ 1 million per month. <br><br>  Sergey Kornilov explained why additional services should bring profit and what customers are willing to pay for: <br><blockquote>  Such services are important for translation agencies and companies, in whose business processes translation plays an important role.  Companies need certain guarantees from our side for system stability under high loads and for support.  In addition, clients are willing to pay for an individual approach in the form of a personal manager, which is a single point of contact, some system refinements for the required processes (the so-called ‚Äúcustomization‚Äù), as well as for regular training of new employees on SmartCAT. </blockquote><br>  In addition, as part of SmartCAT, a marketplace opens in the Russian market, in which more than 50,000 translators from 100 countries can be found.  SmartCAT will charge 10% of the payment amount.  The SmartCAT platform was originally designed for freelance translators.  According to representatives of the company, this made it possible to attract such a number of specialists from around the world in a short period. <br><br>  Marketplace allows business to work and pay for translators, editors, proofreaders directly.  You can choose translators and organize your own team according to the following parameters: language pairs (for example, English - Russian and others), knowledge of topics, native language, tariffs, tests passed, number of completed projects, activity on the platform and feedback from customers, the <a href="http://abbyy-ls.ru/news/21-01-2016">press said -release</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298078/</a></p>
