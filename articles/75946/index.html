      I will describe in detail each type of word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) marketing. <br><br>  <b>Rumor Marketing (Buzz Marketing):</b> <br><br>  Rumor marketing is a technique aimed at turning every meeting with a consumer into a unique, spontaneous personal exchange of information instead of an advertising message carefully thought out by a professional advertiser.  Initially, rumor marketing campaigns are designed as real theater performances.  The advertiser shares product information with only a few ‚Äúknowledgeable‚Äù people - representatives of the target audience.  Purposefully initiating one-on-one conversations with people who have a significant impact on people in their circle, such marketers launch a sophisticated word of mouth campaign in which consumers feel flattered to be included in the elite community of ‚Äúinitiates‚Äù and willingly spread information among their friends and colleagues. <br><br>  Although rumor marketing is far from new, Internet technologies have changed the way it is used.  Rumor campaigns today originate in conversational forums where marketing representatives portray involvement in the target audience to promote their product.  Personal Internet blogs are another popular tool for electronic rumor marketing campaigns: advertisers find the authors of the ‚Äúright blogs‚Äù and promote their product with them.  Online messaging (IM) tools are also used by people or IM robots promoting the product to conduct rumor marketing campaigns.  As in the case of other similar campaigns, the IM model is built with the expectation of the influence that a particular person has in an established small network - in this case, it means the list of his contacts.  As rumors' email marketing technology continues to improve, and software makes it easier to count delivered messages, some advertising experts predict that rumor email marketing will be a standard component of all advertising cross-media campaigns. <br><br>  Here is an example of marketing rumors in action (but not on the Internet). <br><br>  If this summer you become a regular ‚Äúregular‚Äù cafe in Sunset Plaza, Melrose or Third Street, you will surely meet a group of sleek, incredibly attractive bikers who, it would seem, will study you with genuine interest over the top of an ice-latte.  If you compliment their Vespa scooters, sparkling in the sun on the edge of the sidewalk, they will readily get a notebook and put in the address and phone number ‚Äî not your own, but the local shop where you can buy your own Vespa, as recently ( according to their assurances) they made rap star Sisko and the cinema queen Sandra Bullock.  And here you will understand that your meeting is far from being an accident.  These biker models are on the balance of the Vespa, and hired them to spread word-of-mouth about favorable rumors about newly-released European motorcycles. <br><br>  Welcome to the summer of burgeoning rumors! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75946/</a></p>
