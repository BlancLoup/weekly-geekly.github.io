  <section class="page js-page"><h1>It is contagious: tightening the screws in the information space of Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The week does not pass so that the introduction and closure of access to a particular resource in Russia has not been discussed several times in Habr√©.  Frankly, we in Ukraine read this with sympathy, but with some awareness that this does not concern us. <br>  It concerns gentlemen.  The question is only time, and the process is already underway. <br>  <i>Ukrainian lawmakers have prepared a new initiative to strengthen control over the dissemination of information on the Internet.</i>  <i>Registered last week, the draft law ‚ÄúOn protection of the information space‚Äù suggests obliging providers to block access to sites that promote interethnic hostility, cruelty, or violate civil rights and freedoms.</i>  <i>Market participants believe that the language in the document is blurred and can be used by security forces to close almost any resource.</i> <br>  (This is ‚ÄúKommersant-Ukraine‚Äù, <a href="http://www.kommersant.ua/doc/2208588">source</a> ) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Here is this project on the <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1%3Fpf3511%3D47242">website of the Verkhovna Rada</a> . <br>  Let us analyze the very controversial and vague proposals of the legislators of Ukraine, simply by comparing the version of the document - the current and the proposed. <br>  So, we find 10 differences. <br><br>  - Article 2 of the law proposes to expand the list of prohibited topics by adding to it, in addition to the propaganda of war, terrorist attacks and other obviously bad things, such as: <br>  ‚ÄúEncroachment on human rights and freedoms‚Äù. <br>  To this point we will return. <br><br>  - Article 5. The list of mass media is supplemented with the phrase ‚Äúalso in the form of electronic information resources‚Äù.  All OK.

      - Article 6-1 prohibits the placement in the Ukrainian segment of the Internet of information listed in paragraph 2 of the law (propaganda for war, terrorist attacks, etc.).  There would be nothing, but confusing language: <br><br>  <i>Business entities that provide services for the placement, storage and access to electronic information resources, operators and providers of telecommunications services that provide access to the Internet must: ...</i> <br><br>  Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but the hosting provider and the provider distributing the Internet to sufferers are completely different things.  What do operators and telecommunication providers have to do with forbidden resources and hosting in general is a question, but they are also obliged by this law: <br><br>  <i>... on the basis of a court decision on the appeal of a unit of the Security Service of Ukraine or a body of internal affairs about the removal of electronic information resources or their part as such containing products prohibited for production, distribution and circulation, remove such resources no later than one day from the date the decision enters court legal force;</i> <br>  Pay attention to a positive point: by court order.  However, the law does not indicate any dialogue with the owner of the resource: a request came to the court ‚Äî an order to the provider and forth. <br><br>  Next - the most interesting <br>  <i>provide, within 24 hours, at the request of a unit of the Security Service of Ukraine or a body of internal affairs engaged in the fight against computer crime, information on the type of telecommunication services, their technical characteristics, place and period of provision;</i>  <i>available data on the person-user (subscriber) services;</i> <br><br>  And what kind of user are we talking about?  Nowhere in the law does it say what is meant by a consumer / subscriber hosting.  Taking into account the above, about the obligations imposed on communications providers, according to this law, you can request information about any client of the provider, any connected apartment or office. <br><br>  And what is "technical specifications"?  Network activity in a certain period of time with the indicated hosts - is this also a kind of technical characteristic? <br>  At the same time, the provider does not have the right to inform the user that they have requested information about him (see the original). <br><br>  Brief summary: The proposed wording of the law strengthens the ability of law enforcement agencies to close unwanted resources, and the vague wording of the law makes it possible to officially and legally monitor the activism of users. <br><br>  It is unclear just how the law correlates with itself: after all, paragraph 2 of this law clearly states about the prohibition of harassment of human rights and freedoms. <br>  This is sad, gentlemen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182930/</a></p>
