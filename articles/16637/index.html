  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why do I take back from leadership schools</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I can not get rid of the feeling that many modern business trainings are engaged in makeup of a corpse.  Instead of letting the dead person quietly rotting under the ground and letting the already useless tissues and organs transform into a completely new life with new natural qualities and capabilities, they stubbornly mold trees from the dead, cling to artificial foliage and convince them to do photosynthesis. <br><br>  I am sure that for a person it is more efficient to go through the steps of social evolution through the natural natural transformations of the personality, as the caterpillar turns into a pupa, and then becomes a butterfly, only having completely exhausted the previous stage. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the same way, the whole person needs to fully comprehend the essence of hard work and to know his real possibilities of interaction with the physical world. <br><br>  Then, having already exhausted self-knowledge, turn to the knowledge of laws that are common to all people (knowing that each person is an individual).  This can be done only by doing business.  Only such an opportunity to constantly negotiate with a large number of completely different people can create a natural intuitive understanding of the desires and aspirations of the masses.  No textbook where it is written in plain text can make this knowledge natural without personal practice.

      And already having well-honed and familiar tools in the form of personal skills and understanding of the laws of society, it is natural to move to the next level - preserving values ‚Äã‚Äãand traditions, serving lofty goals and maintaining the Law.  It is this level of personal development, aristocratic, characteristic of real leaders. <br><br>  (There is a fourth level of personal development, but this is not about him now.) <br><br>  Leadership schools are just good traders who saw the trend and immediately formed a proposal.  After all, business people want to be influential and this is stupid for a merchant not to make money.  A formal approach to the question is enough.  Since people want to be leaders (looking at real leaders), why not make a training program for them that gives you the feeling that you are a leader? <br><br>  The very first puncture is that they treat leadership only as a technology for making profit (persuading the pupa that she is already a butterfly).  But profit is not the value of the world of aristocrats.  Their values ‚Äã‚Äãare law and honor.  And only therefore they can enjoy the support of the masses (and, accordingly, be called leaders). <br><br>  So there has been a gap.  Either you want to optimize your trade (there are such trainings) or you want to leave the world of chistogana into the world of traditions and laws, becoming a leader.  But when you are prescribed one medicine from both the head and the ... well, think about it. <br><br>  The second puncture for those who trade in the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù trend is the term ‚Äúcharisma‚Äù.  They all agree that this concept is vague and means something like the following " <i>Charisma is the exceptional qualities of a certain person. Exceptional precisely because not everyone possesses them. In addition, these qualities are combined in a leader in a completely exceptional, special way. Not only different from a person who is not a leader, but also from another leader too.</i> " <br><br>  The most serious trainers even raise the source (the Greek translation of the new testament) and formulate signs of charisma based on the methods of influencing people by Jesus Christ.  (At the end of the checklist published on the charisma of the leader, used in a developed business school. I highly recommend checking on this list before considering the leader of a businessman.) <br><br>  Nothing of charisma is relevant to making a profit.  So what are trying to sell us under the concepts of "leadership" and "success"?  To find out, we can get acquainted with the methods of "achieving success" and "the development of leadership qualities." <br><br>  So we understand the "Leadership".  According to the concept of all schools with which I managed to get acquainted: <br>  " <i>Leadership lies in two planes. Leadership in a group of people. And leadership in your life. And leadership in a group stems from leadership in your own life. Having learned to be a leader for yourself, your life, you get the opportunity to become a leader for others.</i> " <br><br>  At first glance, everything is logical and correct.  But I had to face the formation on this basis of the illusion of total control over my life, reaching the degree of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">solipsism</a> .  Recently, I heard a reassurance that ‚Äúthere are no circumstances in my life that I have not created‚Äù from one (it seems to be a permanent) participant of the ‚Äú100%‚Äù training. <br><br>  As for leadership in a group of people, learning is most often based on learning how to influence others.  It is debatable for me that Jesus or Buddha (undoubted charismatic leaders) learned to put pressure on the psyche of those around them and manipulate their instincts, but modern trainers do not seem to care about such things as ideology, like-mindedness and common ministry to high ideas. <br><br>  Now about the "Success".  This term is so erased that it will have to tinker a bit with its understanding and interpretation.  For me, ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is the result of an activity - you invented something, planned it, invested strength, and justified yourself.  This ‚Äújustified‚Äù is the only meaning of the word ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in my understanding.  Since this word ‚Äúcoaches of successful people‚Äù means something else, I will have to consider their definition of this concept before evaluating it. <br><br>  So in most cases business schools describe ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù as a victory in a competition.  And ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù is acquired by the determinant ‚Äúsocial‚Äù.  Thus, I conclude that success as a goal of trainees at such trainings is to improve social status and accumulate ‚Äúanal wow factors‚Äù (in the terminology of Viktor Pelevin).  That is, they tritely teach how to fight for resources with the same potentially successful and indirectly serve to intensify this struggle.  Whereas the goals of real leaders are not to manipulate the crowd, but to achieve a high goal (along the way, they attract people to their goals, but this is mistaken for the goal itself). <br><br>  And here we again see the conflict of a pupa and a butterfly.  The accumulation and systematization of values ‚Äã‚Äãis the work of an aristocrat, and the merchant, in essence, does not appreciate the work of art, but, roughly speaking, liquidity.  Therefore, the Rolex model of the current year is an attribute of a merchant, whereas an attribute of an aristocrat will be some library of insanely rare manuscripts of the 13th century. <br><br>  And how can the process of transforming a person from a merchant into an aristocrat can take place in a natural way? <br><br>  First, it can be stretched in time for generations.  A father-nouveau riche of new Russians with three classes of education can give their children not only a rich inheritance, but also an aristocratic education, including history, culture, art and discipline.  There are many such examples in history. <br><br>  Secondly, it is possible to walk such a path on your own if you constantly learn not only how to attract money more effectively, but also what is valuable in art, spend your time on creativity and knowledge of high values ‚Äã‚Äãand traditions.  This way is much more difficult than going to the training of ‚Äúeffective charismatic leaders‚Äù, but its value is incomparably higher. <br><br>  Application.  Checklist for leadership charisma. <br><br>  1. Pass through death <br>  2. Come by <br>  3. Appear suddenly <br>  4. Gain stigmata <br>  5. Have a mission <br>  6. Create a ritual <br>  7. Find superpowers <br>  8. Live the illumination <br>  9. Be able to fight </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16637/</a></p>
