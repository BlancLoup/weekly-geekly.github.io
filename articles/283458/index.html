A question that many developers approach with awe and apprehension.  Over the past couple of decades, many have tried to change this imperfect world and many have achieved success.  But one thing has remained the same - to create a secure application is still not everyone can afford.  The price of security is too high and includes studying dozens of standards and specifications, compiling tons of incomprehensible code, reading multipage monographs of cryptographic gurus.  We at Virgil Security are far from ambitious plans to change the world, we just want to make security accessible to everyone.  And here we are on Habr√©, hello! <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan affordable, secure way to share information has been in the air for a long time.  But, unfortunately, for many years she remained just a dream along with flying cars and landing on Mars.  We offer each developer a simple and reliable way to make this dream come true.  How?  That's what we are going to talk about. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sounds cool, to hell with the details, I want a little security right now!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  You are on the page with a description of the <a href="https://virgilsecurity.com/api-docs">Virgil API</a> . <br></div></div><br><br>  So what do we offer?  We offer an <a href="https://virgilsecurity.com/about/what-is-virgil">infrastructure</a> that allows you to make an experienced cryptographer from any developer.  Regardless of the language you write in, be it C, C ++, C #, ObjectiveC, Swift, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, Ruby or something else.  Regardless of the type of product you are creating: desktop or mobile application, cloud service or embedded system.  Regardless of the operating system on which you work: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS.  Using Virgil Security, you can add secure End-to-End encryption or passwordless authentication to your application with just a few lines of code.

      Have you ever wondered why security still remains such a serious problem? <br>  In short, mainly for four reasons: <br><ol><li>  Lack of high-quality, cross-platform implementation of cryptoalgorithms; </li><li>  Lack of infrastructure to make cryptography ubiquitous; </li><li>  Compatibility issue.  By implementing encryption in their product, developers are forced to sacrifice the compatibility of their solutions; </li><li>  Lack of flexible key management system. </li></ol><br>  And we think that we have a way to solve all these problems once and for all. <br><br>  <b>First</b> : Historically, the world of cryptographers and the world of software programmers practically did not overlap.  As a result, today a large number of a variety of cryptographic libraries and tools are available that are useless for most developers because of their complexity and fragmentation.  We concentrated our efforts on creating a single API, the use of which will allow the developer to add strong encryption to his project in just a few minutes.  Moreover, we wrote a lot of code to make the use of API possible in almost every programming language.  And we published all this code in <a href="https://github.com/VirgilSecurity">open access</a> under the BSD-3 license. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> : To create a system that uses certain algorithms or has limited functionality - this means repeating the mistakes of the last 20 years.  Instead, we provide a flexible infrastructure with which you can set up an encryption method for each message, file, or packet.  We have implemented <a href="https://virgilsecurity.com/about/specs">most modern elliptic curves</a> and you can use any of them.  Do you need to change the algorithm every hour?  Every minute?  After each encrypted message?  No problem.  You can build multi-layer encryption like RSA + ECIES.  And all this is just a few lines of code. <br><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> : Compatibility.  Despite the fact that many modern languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave a built-in implementation of the most common cryptoalgorithms, writing programs for the Internet of Things, where data can be read from sensors and processed on Android and iOS devices, can be a very painful task.  Virgil Security eliminates such problems.  We provide a single API that will work on any platform. <br><br>  <b>Fourth</b> : Unfortunately, users are still the most vulnerable point in any system.  Not all users are able to competently manage keys, moreover, users may not even be aware of the presence of keys.  Virgil Security provides an opportunity not only to use the global public key infrastructure, but also to create its own local infrastructure, available within one application.  The developer can allow users to save encrypted copies of keys in the private key storage, which guarantees the recoverability of data in case of loss of the key. <br><br>  So, as mentioned above, we are not trying to change the world.  We offer you an easy way to implement strong encryption and add it to your project.  Change the world and make it safer everyone can.  What do I need to do?  Choose a <a href="https://developer.virgilsecurity.com/account/signin">red pill</a> , of course. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283458/</a></p>
