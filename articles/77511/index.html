  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Semester totals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, another semester ends and I would like to talk about what is happening and how are students doing. <br>  I had two courses this semester.  First Linguistic and CAD software (LIPO) (second year), second TRPO (fourth year). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, I am a graduate student of the Siberian Federal University of the Institute of Space and Information Technologies.  In the framework of postgraduate studies I conduct classes. <br><br>  As part of the LIPO course, students did three (or rather, some still do) labs: <br>  1. Interpreter <br>  2. Graphic editor of raster graphics <br>  3. Editor block diagrams <br>  The second course is great.  There is also a charge of cheerfulness, zeal and positive.  In the next semester, we plan to develop the last lab to kursak.  The main direction is the simulation of the application using the block diagram. <br><br>  As part of the course TRPO was five labs, and the result was the TK for the development of a software product: <br>  1. Development of requirements <br>  2. Diagram UseCase <br>  3. The relational model <br>  4. Acceptance tests <br>  5. Project Plan <br>  Also, students in the framework of the TRPO made a prototype of their system using (optional): <br>  - Serena Prototype Composer <br>  - Sketch Flow <br>  - The development environment in which it is planned to develop the product <br>  Next semester, students will design and develop their product. <br>  In general, the course of TRPO should cover such things as software development processes, different methodologies.  But still, students wanted to give more practice.

      Also for students I tried to give a practical task for each lesson.  Not very complicated, but requiring development.  Honestly, I have already included such tasks at the end of the semester, which I regret.  For the fulfillment of the tasks I distributed the plus signs, three plus points - one laba with an automatic machine :-). <br>  Here is an example of one of the tasks, a simple program that allows you to create stickers on your desktop: <br><br>  Minimum requirements (for all +1): <ol><li>  The ability to add a sticker </li><li>  Stickers can be any number </li><li>  You can write text in the sticker </li><li>  Clear interface (independent evaluator) </li></ol>  Additional requirements first group (for all +1, if you received +1 for the previous group): <ol><li>  Resize Sticker </li><li>  Change the position of the sticker </li><li>  To fix the sticker so that it can not be moved </li><li>  Change sticker color </li><li>  Ability to draw in a sticker (only brush) </li></ol>  Additional requirements of the second group (Pros are considered only if you received a +1 for the previous group): <ol><li>  Strings in the sticker lined +1 </li><li>  Add the ability to set a reminder +1 </li><li>  The next time you start the program, restore the old stickers +2 </li></ol>  Bonus (counted separately from other groups): <ol><li>  Beautiful WPF +2 interface </li></ol><br><br>  In general, students need to be stimulated somehow, otherwise the picture is that during the semester we do nothing, but at the end we start to run.  As a result, from the next semester for fourth-year students I introduce such a system: <br>  - At the beginning of the semester, each is given 20 points. <br>  - Every week I follow their progress on the project plan. <br>  - Not completing or delaying the task entails subtracting one point. <br>  - To prevent disagreements, students for each task describe clear requirements, and I agree with them. <br>  - If there are no agreed requirements, then in any dispute of rights, I <br>  - If not all requirements are met for any task - minus one score <br>  - If at the end of the semester the student is left with zero points - the student did not pass the course <br>  It seems to me that such a system will force students to work during the whole semester, and maybe not.  Wait and see.  I wonder your opinion. <br><br>  Another very important communication with students outside the classroom.  To do this, for each group, I start my own Google group, in which I publish information about progress, give some additional tasks, get questions from students and some feedback.  I also started a group for all students of our specialty.  Development is slow, but I try (I hope the students will start too).  Unfortunately, students are difficult to stimulate to work with a group or some kind of communication.  We are a hidden people and notorious.  :-) <br><br>  In this way, and passed (almost) another semester.  I feel there will be deductions.  :-) It‚Äôs necessary to start sometime.  :-) <br><br>  PS: I would like to learn about interesting teaching methods and interesting tasks.  Share if that.  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77511/</a></p>
