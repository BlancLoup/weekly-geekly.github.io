Although it is somewhat incorrect to speak at different times and for various reasons, since most of them got into the reserve in August-September 2012, when Open Contact massively dropped domains that were illegally registered for a long time. <a name="habracut"></a>  The list of domains that have been auctioned can be viewed at this link <a href="http://hoster.by/about/news/1012/">hoster.by/about/news/1012/#.UGk8fWJntLI</a> I recall that a year ago the list of ‚Äúsaved‚Äù OAC domains was more than twice as large, and the domains listed in the article did not get to the auction (except for business.by) <a href="http://it.tut.by/246565">it.tut.by/246565</a> <br><br>  Let's return to the current list, which on September 27 was supplemented with the following domains: 09.by, body.by, eye.by, fax.by, find.by, for.by, get.by, okey.by, only.by, pass .by, street.by.

I think that during this time, an ordinary person will not be able to register a domain, especially considering the peculiarities of payment for services through the Hoster.by website.  Is it not by chance that Hoster.by left only the registration date in whois, removing the exact time? <br>  I will also add that in addition to these domains, added to the general list on September 27, there are also those that were registered in the same way, but for some reason they still don‚Äôt want to be auctioned.  Perhaps an unknown individual found them more valuable, perhaps they will be added later.  In order to be able to further verify the correctness of my guesses, I will give examples of such domains: spravka.by, torrent.by. <br><br>  I am not against charity and I am not against a charity auction, I would not like Hoster.by to follow in the footsteps of Open Contact and use its position as a technical administrator of the zone to intercept domains. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152915/</a></p>
