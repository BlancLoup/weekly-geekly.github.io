That is why designers should take this into account in their approach. <br>  When we think about the design of user experience, we often think about how the user feels the experience and solutions that he proposes to the user.  But, as psychologist John Whalen argues, they represent only two of the driving forces of user experience.  There are four other focus points that contribute, or not, to design effectiveness. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  “Language, orientation, emotion and memory are the things that are kind of at the center of knowledge, but not as obvious as deciding what people will do or what will be on the screen,” said Whalen, “This central part is now time is not sufficiently covered in the books and how we describe the design experience. ” <br><br>  Whalen, who holds a Ph.D. in cognitive science at John Hopkins University in California, right at the center of the dot-com boom, he realized the potential for applying the inner workings of the mind to the design community.  Currently, Whalen is the founder of the Brilliant Experience, a UX strategy company running DC, which adopts a “psychology-based approach” in the design process.

      He says that the UX design is a multidimensional and multi-sensory experience that knocks on these “six minds”.  Understanding these six minds is the future of UX. <br><br><h4>  1. Vision / Attention </h4><br>  Of all the minds, Whalen says that this is one of the best design chips, according to how she addresses the aspect of the UX user interface.  Nevertheless, he warns that designers think they can always appeal to the user, but this is not always the case.  That is why it is so important to explore other aspects in order to establish a deeper understanding of how the application influenced the overall experience on visual cues. <br><br>  Some questions to ask yourself: <br><br>  · Which visual features are paying attention? <br>  · Where are the eyes moving first on the page? <br>  · What words / objects are they looking for? <br>  · What is visual flow? <br><br><h4>  2. Orientation </h4><br>  Orientation refers to how the user moves from point A to point B. It acts in the information architecture, with built-in navigation prompts, content, and more.  Orientation is becoming increasingly difficult in the virtual world, and will continue to become more complex in virtual reality, and the interactive design continues to gain popularity. <br><br>  “In the new world of cell phones, where you can shake them, twist them or hit them, we use a variety of tools to make these Plates: Where am I now?  How can I get to the next place?  And “How do I know if I get there?” Said Whalen.  “We actually have a huge part of our brain dedicated to this, so the question is, how can we use it in ways that are so different now in the virtual space?” <br><br>  Some questions to direct you in the right direction: <br><br>  · What should users submit to tell them "are you here?" <br>  · How does the user expect to move in space? <br>  · What are their expected interactions along the way? <br>  · Are these interactions based on a clear model? <br><br><h4>  3. Memory / Semantics </h4><br>  Memory plays a huge role in orientation, but also in setting user expectations.  Whalen uses an analogy with a colleague, inviting her to spend happy hours after work.  She can think of a building with a smooth high-tech inside, while you imagine your neighborhood bar complete with graffiti on the walls. <br><br>  “And I would have waited every hour, but with very different expectations, just as you can expect interaction from your design,” said Whalen.  This also needs to be considered when designing a UX.  Users come with expectations based on previous experience models.  They expect things to work in a certain way (for example, like Amazon, Google or Facebook), and they want these experiences to make them feel natural and easy. <br><br>  Developers may ask: <br><br>  · What mental schemes are activated? <br>  · What does the user think about when they think about X? <br>  · Does the design give meaningful experience? <br>  · Are there active users who are already familiar with the product? <br><br><h4>  4. Language </h4><br>  Language is a very complicated thing.  It varies depending on the demographic situation, the user’s familiarity with the product and terminology, as well as ease of understanding.  Too often, companies make a mistake too openly.  They expect the user to have the same passion for the product as they do, and ultimately give too much information, interfering with the user experience. <br><br>  “In many cases, we want to simplify and simply trust the brand we work with,” said Whalen.  “Sometimes we are so absorbed in trying to tell people about all the little things, that in fact we even forget to think about how the final audience represents it.” <br><br>  Before going too far ahead in design experience, teams can talk about: <br><br>  · What words does our target audience actually use? <br>  · What is their vocabulary? <br>  · What terms do we use? <br>  · What tone is appropriate for the product? <br><br><h4>  5. Emotion </h4><br>  Like it or not, users bring emotional baggage to every experience.  They are real people with feelings, fears and disappointments.  They are afraid to make mistakes.  They are indecisive.  They wonder how some purchases will affect their career, goals or reputation.  All of these elements influence the decisions they make. <br><br>  “We often talk about quick emotions, which I am in this game, I’m excited or bored or I’m happy, but we also try to think about what these deep emotions are, which are also the main driving force,” said Whalen.  “If we go back to how we would like to represent a person, and what is most valuable to him, then suddenly we get very interesting answers.” <br><br>  In one example, Whalen studied high-income people to determine which banking needs they had underdeveloped.  He asked questions, starting with the purpose for which they had the credit cards they had in their wallets, what their goals were, and whether they really thought that these cards would increase the likelihood of reaching them. <br><br>  “Of the 24 interviews, three cried and six people hugged me and said it was a great therapy session,” said Whalen.  “We usually do not think to ask what is most important for the user in this world and how to make it get it in a natural way.  How do you direct people from level to level, that they are beginning to feel threatened for further progress? ” <br><br>  Whalen loves to appeal, strengthen and awaken movement. <br><br>  · What will attract them immediately? <br>  · What will provide lasting meaning and value? <br>  · What affects their deepest goals and desires? <br><br>  In his research and user interviews, he likes to explore what answers the user experience launches.  He looks at the user's fears and asks how we can dispel these fears and make a positive experience?  Understanding what underlies user emotions is very important and can provide a deep understanding of why users make the decisions they make. <br><br><h4>  6. Decision making </h4><br>  One of the questions number one is decision making, why do people not act?  It is part of the responsibility of the designer, UX factor in all the elements listed above, in order to make the decision-making process easier for the user. <br>  “There are a lot of people who talk about persuasive design,” said Whalen.  “How to get people to make a decision, be ready to respond to an ad, or finally make a purchase?” <br><br>  The designer tool predicts what the user will need before they need it, and then incorporating it into the overall experience strategy.  Some of the questions Whale recommends studying are: <br><br>  · How can we help the user make a decision? <br>  · What information do we already have? <br>  · What does the user need next? <br>  · How can we increase our “micro” solutions through design? <br><br><h3>  General user experience design </h3><br>  Together, these six minds are what Whalen calls the emerging user experience, a field that is at the junction of psychology and user experience of innovation.  A deeper understanding of how the user thinks and the cognitive aspects that use their solutions allows UX designers to create more optimal and meaningful human experiences for users and organizations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/316494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/316494/</a></p>
