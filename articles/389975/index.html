What is this device and where is Lenovo?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello friends!  In the next couple of months, the Z1, the first ZUK smartphone, will appear on the Russian market.  What kind of gadget is this, why are we writing about it on the Lenovo blog and why are we talking about it as a new device, while JD is already selling it in Russia - we‚Äôll tell you right under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/270462/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d2/c04/277/8d2c042775c14d2bb8e517b52ff2083d.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">What kind of ZUK is this?</font> </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.zuk.com/en/index.html">ZUK</a> is a young Chinese company that was incorporated on May 28, 2015.  She presented her first (and so far only) Z1 smartphone on August 11, 2015.  The gadget is very interested in potential users in China: soon after the announcement, the number of pre-orders for the ZUK Z1 exceeded 1.5 million. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">And what does Lenovo have to do with it?</font> </h2><br>  ZUK appeared with our direct participation: 70% of the company belongs to Lenovo, and the remaining 30% to other investors and employees.  However, this is not about a closely integrated business, like, for example, Lenovo and Moto, when the product lines complement each other and are focused on the needs of different audiences.  In the case of Lenovo and ZUK, it is more correct to talk about the coexistence of brands.  ZUK has its own separate business indicators and other goals.

    <h2>  <font color="#d8291e">And what's the trick of ZUK smartphones?</font> </h2><br>  A bet is made on a combination of good technical characteristics and an affordable price. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6db/c26/b52/6dbc26b524cc4dfd905e68377f9a812f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Okay, so what about the specifications?</font> </h2><br>  ZUK Z1 is a 5.5-inch smartphone with an IPS-screen, whose resolution is 1920x1080 pixels.  Inside the device is a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset with a frequency of 2.5 GHz, 3 GB of operational and 64 GB of permanent memory.  Memory card slot is not provided.  In AnTuTu the device is gaining an average of 47-49 thousand points. <br><br>  The resolution of the main camera is 13 megapixels, the front one is 8 megapixels.  At the same time, there is also a fingerprint scanner.  It is built into the bottom of the front panel and is actively used by Chinese users to confirm payment for purchases using the Z1.  The battery capacity is noticeably above average - 4100 mAh.  For charging and transferring files over the wire uses a USB Type C connector, and it comes to full support for standard 3.0.  That is, if in brief, and very detailed specifications <a href="http://www.zuk.com/en/specs/index.html">can be found</a> on the website ZUK. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/b06/29e/967b0629e68744dfaec88550f769e834.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Who will sell ZUK Z1 in Russia and what will be the price?</font> </h2><br>  Starting from March-April of this year, the Russian office of Lenovo will deal with the sale of Z1 in Russia.  At the moment we have planned a price of 19 990 rubles.  However, all of you probably understand that if the dollar in the spring will cost more than it does now, then you will have to adjust it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Wait a minute, but JD started selling this model with us at the end of last year!</font>  <font color="#d8291e">What is Lenovo‚Äôs official position on this?</font> </h2><br>  Indeed it is.  But you need to understand that so far the company JD has sold in Russia ZUK Z1 made for the Chinese market and not certified for Russia.  For example, in these devices there is no support for LTE Band 20, which is extremely relevant outside of Moscow, there may be some other functions missing. <br><br>  Now Lenovo's Moscow office specialists are engaged in Z1 certification for our market.  Immediately after the end of the process, we will officially import models that are adapted to the needs of Russian users and are sold through the online store <a href="http://shop.lenovo.ru/">shop.lenovo.ru</a> . <br><br>  JD will continue to sell ZUK Z1 in Russia.  Simultaneously with the start of sales of the Z1 at the <a href="http://shop.lenovo.ru/">shop.lenovo.ru</a> site <a href="http://shop.lenovo.ru/">,</a> JD will also start importing exclusively certified versions of this smartphone into our country.  The gadget will be sold as part of the JD Collection on the website jd.ru.  Thus, two official ways of purchase will be available to Russian users at once.  On other sales channels is not talking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c0/d37/bdf/3c0d37bdf37345cfb7de81ab41d636a9.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">But after all, JD prices in dollars, and Lenovo in rubles!</font> </h2><br>  True, a certain difference in cost cannot be avoided, but it will be within the framework of the permissible error.  The dollar price of Z1 at JD will correspond to the ruble price of Z1 in the Lenovo online store. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">And what about the warranty and service support?</font> </h2><br>  If you have already purchased a non-certified ZUK Z1 for the Russian market, then the problems encountered will have to be addressed directly with the seller.  This also applies to devices already purchased through JD. <br><br>  Buyers of certified Z1 at <a href="http://shop.lenovo.ru/">shop.lenovo.ru</a> will receive an official guarantee and access to the entire network of Lenovo service centers in Russia.  Users who order certified Z1 from JD, will receive absolutely similar benefits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/534/d5c/1b2/534d5c1b2c21432787b063bdb2019e2f.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Does ZUK plan to expand the model range?</font> </h2><br>  Now we can say with confidence that there will not be a large lineup, but 1-2 new smartphones per year are quite real. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">With China and Russia, things got a little clearer, and what are the plans for ZUK about other countries?</font> </h2><br>  In addition to the native market, the creators of ZUK are eyeing not only Russia, but also the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  In the last two countries, there is almost no retail gadget left, almost all the electronics there are ordered via the Internet.  And this is for ZUK a key sales channel.  On the shelves of classic stores, the Z1 will most likely never appear, as this will inevitably lead to an increase in cost for the end user. <br><br>  <i>On this, perhaps, while we stop.</i>  <i>But if we suddenly missed something important, we will try to answer your questions in detail in the comments.</i>  <i>Thanks for attention!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/389975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/389975/</a></p>
