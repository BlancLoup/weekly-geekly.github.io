What about your project?  Is it a castle or a city? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3t/js/yd/3tjsydfloypekhj0gmf4gx7-ud4.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Castle </h3><br>  The castle is large and built over time by hard work.  He personifies power, influence and power.  There is one Castle and it has a gate, a moat, perhaps a nice little garden, which is cared for by old men who mumble about dragons and their love for lemon trees.

      In the old days, the Castle was the only real way to build a large structure, mainly because everything built on a smaller scale, as a rule, burned, rotted or collapsed, usually taking the unfortunate inhabitants and their pigs and goats along with them. <br><br>  The device of the Castle is built as an infinite series of special cases that accumulate over time, sometimes destroyed or rebuilt, but always perceived as a whole.  There is no consistent structure, no regularity, only a plan that is always somewhat outdated.  It may take you many years to find out the location of the Castle and if you are not one of the main people in the Castle or a servant, then this search will be absolutely useless, as you cannot go anywhere without an order or permission. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The structure of the Castle has a large number of levels, and each level has as many components as it can withstand.  Each level has its own specialists, with a careful hierarchy, ranging from the dukes, ending with gardeners.  If you look at the Castle plan, then in fact you see a hierarchy of important people, since every space in the Castle belongs to some people. <br><br>  Thus, the layout of a large organization, the structural scheme of the organization is a map of people and relations between the main persons and their subordinates. <br><br><h3>  City </h3><br>  The city is also big and is built over time by hard work.  He also personifies power, influence, and power, and there is only one City.  However, the City is a collection of many small or large buildings scattered over a locality.  Cities are limited only by natural boundaries, and the more dense the land is (the denser it is, the taller the structure can be built, that is why skyscrapers are built on rocks, and the landscape of the modern City is, as a rule, the flip side of its geological map). <br><br>  The city has only a few levels and you can ignore most of them.  Mainly, it is a collection of buildings, each with a main entrance, walls, doors, roofs, and a variable number of latrines.  As soon as you understand the concept of ‚Äústructure,‚Äù you already understand almost everything.  You have an apartment, your family house, a single-family house having a common wall with a neighbor's house, a converted loft, a warehouse, a garage, an office.  This is not an endless variation.  In the future, in the process of creating new Cities, we use all the same examples of buildings again and again. <br><br>  A city can grow much, much more than a castle.  Thousands or millions of times more.  You can learn the city without studying it in detail, because by and large it repeats.  I do not mean the street layout, but rather the fact that there are streets connecting each building, for example.  In fact, as soon as you once learned the concept of a city, you can apply it to most cities on the planet. <br><br>  In the City you hardly see people.  There are still a few symbolic Castles scattered in a circle, but the vast majority of activity occurs in the free market.  People move at will.  They are self-organizing, and the City is an endless landscape of independent, but related works, and not VIPs.  There is no one at the head, which is terribly strange for anyone who came from the Castle. <br><br><h3>  Difference </h3><br>  The organization of the castle is based on control, unity, coherence.  City organization is based on a free market of problems and solutions.  Our human minds do not cope well with the despotic complexity of the castle and its many levels.  Cities, on the other hand, are very easy and even fun to explore. <br><br>  The castle brings together the work of one group of people, perhaps from a dozen to a hundred.  One building of the City brings together the work of a small number of people.  But since the City can contain an unlimited number of projects, the overall size of the community can be much larger. <br><br>  The model of the city is very much scaled, due to the fact that it is easier to study it attracts more people.  If it only takes you five minutes to understand the project model, you will most likely stay and read the README.  If it takes you a week, you will not do this if no one pays for it. <br><br>  To build a successful City, it should be easy for anyone to start a project, compete with people, and organize themselves around problems that arise over time.  As a generous dictator, you just have to set up enough rules and standards for the sewer to work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348252/</a></p>
