  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Convenient service for personal finance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.owlt.ru/static/img/owl_big.png" align="right"><br>  Recently, I once again thought about the complexity of being, in particular about where the money earned so quickly disappears.  It seems to be making quite well, but the money goes somewhere.  So, on trifles.  I wanted to see how much and what goes. <br><br>  To begin to look for ready-made solutions.  The simplest, at first glance, solution is a table in Excel.  It turned out quickly, but here is something wrong.  After tormenting for a couple of months, I decided to find a good service, but I didn‚Äôt like anything - a nondescript interface, or vice versa is too difficult.  Therefore, I decided to get down to business myself.  It was also driven by the fact that, as the survey of numerous acquaintances showed, I am not the only one who wants to improve financial relations with myself. <br><br>  To whom it is interesting - I will immediately say that this is all written in Python / Django.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What happened </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.owlt.ru/">Owlt.ru</a> is completely free, to work with it you need to register (except for the standard one, quick registration via social networks is also available).  Anyone who wants to begin to understand what a service is, can log in as a demo user, without registering.  In demo mode, you can play around a bit: add data and see what happens. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e7/b1b/36e/0e7b1b36e488b0ecf1ee97deee04511a.png"><br><br>  There is a mobile version that allows you to keep records even in cases when you are far from home.  The data is entered in the same way as in the version for the computer, and the interface is somewhat simplified - there are no charts and graphs.  It is very convenient when you are in the store and you can enter all expenses on the spot. <br><br>  There are Incomes, Expenditures, Budget (a plan, the implementation of which can be viewed by the end of the month), as well as Goals - for those who collect for a car, an apartment or a vacation. <br><br>  Information for clarity is given not only in figures, but also in the form of diagrams, graphs, percentages. <br><br>  On familiarization with the service you will need a maximum of 5 minutes.  Everything becomes clear after entering the first data. <br><br><h4>  More details! </h4><br>  Now more about the possibilities. <br><br><h5>  Costs </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a89/503/73f/a8950373fa60032cde1bc1db550f38bb.png"><br><br>  To enter the cost data, click on ‚ÄúAdd expense‚Äù and a window will open, where <br>  tv lines, you must enter the amount, the name of the expenditure item (‚ÄúTag‚Äù), make a description of the cost for yourself (and suddenly forget it), enter the date (which is convenient if you cannot fill in the table every day).  It should be noted here that it is better to fill in the ‚ÄúTag‚Äù line with the same articles (there is an autocomplete) - in order for your diagram to look appropriate.  For example, when you write down the cost of a car repair held on different days, do not write like this: <br><br><ul><li>  08/01/2012 "Repair of my girl" </li><li>  08/11/2012 "The Machine" </li><li>  08/16/2012 "My Car" </li></ul><br><br>  All these tags will fall on the chart.  It is better to combine them into one tag "machine". <br><br><h5>  Income </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ba/6fe/ace/7ba6feace37acea0a21ec634d46fd9d9.png"><br><br>  There is also a breakdown by tags.  Not everyone lives on the same salary :) Salary, income from advertising on Site 1, income from selling links on Site 2, computer repair in the next house, etc.  The principle of filling is the same - enter the same tags, and your chart will show with different colors that you are more pleased with this month. <br><br><h5>  Budget </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/051/e20/622/051e20622ffbb8a3fa2fc84bff02f118.png"><br><br>  Everything is simple here.  Click "Add budget" and fill in the required fields again.  You can make a budget for the day, week, month, year, and even for one specific event (for example, wedding budget, repair budget, gift budget for the New Year for the whole family, etc.).  You can go deep, draw up a budget for all your monthly items of expenses and incomes, you can for some particular types.  Put down the date, and that's all, it remains only to monitor its implementation.  For example, you have planned to feed 6,000 rubles a month, and you have already spent 3,000 rubles.  Go to the appropriate section and see that you have already spent 50% of the planned money.  If this is only the beginning of the month, then it is worth living more economically :) <br><br><h5>  Goals </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d41/dd9/cac/d41dd9cac524e50b4247124e606e5771.png"><br><br>  And this is the section that will stimulate you.  Here live your dreams of a country house or a new car.  You just need to set a goal and do not forget to enter data every time you save or withdraw money.  So you will see in percentage and money terms, how close your goal is, and how many days you have left for its implementation. <br><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  At any time, you can clear (delete all data) or delete (completely and irrevocably) your account.  Useful for paranoids :) <br><br><h4>  Reports </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd5/2cc/37b/bd52cc37b0d35138bcc5ee361637bbec.jpg"><br>  You can upload all your expenses / income to PDF or only for a certain month.  You can give your wife a check :) <br><br><h4>  Finally </h4><br>  Initially, all this was done for himself, but how it grew into a finished product could not help but share with others.  Waiting for your feedback, and maybe suggestions for improvement (you can here or in the form of the site). <br><br>  Come in, register, try. <br><br>  I am sure that you will still like your personal finance management and will teach you a lot.  I have already seen this. <br><br>  Project address: <a href="http://www.owlt.ru/">www.owlt.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149927/</a></p>
