Success in sales is provided by a win-win model. </h1><br>  For effective sales it is not enough to know all the functions of the service, you also need to be a little analyst.  This will help to quickly understand the needs of a business that wants to establish call tracking and find common points for mutually beneficial cooperation.

      Companies, most often, turn to us, but do not fully understand what our tool can give them.  But they are well aware of what problem to solve.  My task is to understand everything and make a preliminary assessment of the prospects for cooperation.  In order for work to be enjoyable and everything to be ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù in relations with customers, it is important to speak the same language with them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In this case, the WIN-WIN model of the Harvard Negotiating School is perfect.  Its essence lies in the fact that both sides either lose at the same time, if they do not achieve the desired goals, or at the same time win.  The success of our customers - makes our service a success, the only way. <br><br><h1>  2. Do not try to tell the customer everything you know about your product. </h1><br>  I never overload callers with unnecessary information.  If a person does not understand something, then I try to explain these work moments as simply and clearly as possible.  But forcing a potential client to listen to a whole lecture without being tied to a specific product is a loss already at the first stage of the sales funnel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/486/19c/73c/48619c73ca76d83c1a41e3bed8d4362d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to convey to the client important information for him, using the example of his business, how his offer will work.  As a result, he should have a minimum of questions on how the interaction takes place and what results he should expect, then the sales will be more like a partnership.  The client should understand that my task is not to sell at any cost, but to understand his need and solve his ‚Äúpain‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/544/fe0/885/544fe088569d270a1afffdbfccac2833.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  3. When working with clients, it is necessary to clearly outline the set of options available to them. </h1><br>  Small and medium business owners often actively apply themselves, as they seek various opportunities for growth.  I call them ‚Äúheated‚Äù because they are familiar with the product and they don‚Äôt need to be motivated to try call tracking. <br><br>  On the one hand, there are really few problems with communication with small and medium businesses, but not always such clients (especially small businesses) are beneficial to us.  When a company subscribes to the minimum tariff, but requires a full cycle of services (including a variety of settings, adjustments, etc.).  As a result, our costs for such clients are much higher than what they bring to us. <br><br><h1>  4. Transactions with large customers require prior, thorough preparation. </h1><br>  A completely different situation when working with large customers.  It takes a long time to find ways to talk with a decision maker in such a company.  In order for the transaction to take place, you need careful preparation to give the necessary and accurate arguments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f2b/4ec/4c1/f2b4ec4c14b5ca1f0cd97775645d9da9.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  I often come across situations when objectively implementing call tracking is necessary.  The company spends large sums of money on advertising, while not managing the conversion to calls.  But nevertheless, it is not always and immediately possible to find a common language.  The administrations of large companies often feel "stiffened" and not ready for the introduction of innovations.  We have to convince leaders of different levels, to conduct numerous negotiations in order to move away from the phrase ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need it‚Äù to more flexible. <br><br><h1>  5. Video conferencing can easily replace face-to-face meetings. </h1><br>  Sometimes it seems that sales in different countries of the world are complicated by the inability to schedule a personal meeting and clarify the necessary nuances of cooperation.  But when selling a Saas product, SkypeCall is quite enough for us.  On the one hand, there is visual contact, on the other hand, you can easily show your screen and explain on the fingers how our service works. <br><br>  Moreover, video conferencing also helps to avoid many problems with misunderstanding of the parties.  So you can organize SkypeCall with the participation of decision makers, as well as representatives of various departments of our client.  Due to this, it is possible to avoid the effect of "spoiled phone".  This is beneficial both to us and to our client, since we save time on specifying numerous details in the process of work. <br><br><h1>  6. Working with clients in Western markets is much easier than in Russia, Ukraine or Kazakhstan </h1><br>  Differences in sales between the CIS countries are insignificant.  The main focus of our users is on the fact that we have to solve all arising difficulties and difficulties during the installation and operation of call tracking.  Even if this does not imply their tariff plan. <br><br>  When working with clients from Europe or the United States, such questions do not arise, because there is an understanding of team results and joint responsibility.  In this format, we do not have to deal with non-core stages and concentrate on our product, which is more effective for all parties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/129/fc4/8df/129fc48df12e2cdbba5b0f68ac38b259.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h1>  7. To sell a complex product - you need to know more than your customer. </h1><br>  I came to Ringostat from a similar position, where my task was to sell a complex product to a business.  In this regard, only the industry has changed, everything else was not new to me.  I believe that one of the main qualities that make a sales manager effective is the ability to establish interpersonal contacts.  Simply put, he should be able to get along with people, find the right language with them, choose the right words. <br><br>  Sometimes there are funny situations when a newly registered customer calls me and happily reports ‚ÄúWe have already set everything up and are working.‚Äù  Moreover, to set up the call tracking, you need to set a code, assign phone numbers, etc.  Or there was a very interesting story when, when working with a client from Spain, I had to explain everything more than in detail.  If you once taught your parents to use the Internet and a computer, then you can imagine what our dialogue was like. <br><br>  But selling Saas products, you need not only to make connections coolly and patiently explain simple truths, you also need to dive deep into technical details.  I had to become an expert in call analytics in order to achieve effective sales. <br><br>  Learn more about call tracking on the <a href="http://blog.ringostat.com/">Ringostat blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299722/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299722/</a></p>
