  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About advertising and my disappointment 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Any site, no matter how good it is, should advertise itself.  Because without advertising, users simply do not know about this wonderful site. <br><br>  Advertising sites can be different.  It happens that some materials, opportunities, ie <b>content</b> are advertised.  It happens, the site introduces <b>a closed testing mode</b> , and the input - only testers, by invitation.  Another site can <b>become a sponsor of</b> another site, and receive traffic from the sponsored page.  In general, there are a lot of options ... In any case, advertising should be <i>fair</i> to the user - for if there is some kind of deception in advertising, then the user will not like it at all, but on the contrary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And when there are no honest advertising options, dishonest ones start.  The advertisement begins to say what is really not there, and many users, as a rule, are led to it.  If this option also does not work ... Then frankly <i>attracted</i> begins <i>:</i> we all heard the phrase ‚Äúcollect 10 caps many times ... buy 21 packs ... and we will give you ...‚Äù and you will be SCHASTye! ".  These phrases are often made loud statement, something like ‚Äúhurry!  the number of prizes is limited! ‚Äù. <br><br>  I do not know, maybe there are people who are under all this.  If there were no such people, there would be no such shares.  I even assume that all these prizes exist in reality (well, if not a Mercedes, then there‚Äôs one more bottle for sure).  And for sure there are people who have won at least something in such actions ...

      I do not understand the other.  Why lure people in similar ways?  No, I know, advertising is the engine of progress, and in general, in competition, all means are good ... Well, okay, we will forgive crackers and chips with such advertising.  That's why they are chips. <br><br>  But when one of the largest sites in the niche of the Runet site sent me the following letter ... At first I thought it was phishing.  But no, the letter is clearly present.  Here it is. <br><br><blockquote>  Hello FanXFire.  This is Memori.ru with short and curious information. <br><br>  Starting today, the site starts the action ‚ÄúInvite friends to Memori - get $ 100‚Äù.  Participate in the action can each registered user Memori.ru.  The conditions are simple - you invite your friends to register for Memori and the more friends you invite, the more truly your chances of getting a prize. <br><br>  The time of the action is from May 18 to June 18, 2007. <br><br>  The first 10 participants, by whose invitations the largest number of friends will register, will receive $ 100, the second 10 participants will receive $ 50 each, the third 10 participants will receive $ 25 each.  Thus, the first thirty active users will receive cash prizes. <br><br>  The essence of the promotion is simple - tell Memori to your friends and acquaintances, explain to them what the charm and convenience of social bookmarking is about.  No doubt, they will also enjoy using our service. <br><br>  Conditions of the campaign and statistics in real time, see the page of the contest - <a href="http://memori.ru/konkurs">memori.ru/konkurs</a> <br><br>  Take part in the action!  Invite your friends to Memori and get a prize! <br><br>  * - <br>  Regards, project administration <br>  Memori.ru <a href="http://memori.ru/">memori.ru</a> <br></blockquote><br><br>  To be honest, I was even upset.  <i>Why does the largest portal need such an advertisement?</i>  If the service is good (and he really is good), then people will use it and call for friends.  And if the bad one, then the friends will come running, they will get all their money ... And more friends will not come to this site.  <b>A good site needs to advertise its good features and advantages!</b>  And not frankly lure people with money. <br><br>  So I was disappointed in this site.  Anti-advertising turned out.  And what do you think? <br><br>  - PS All the above is my humble opinion.  If you do not like something or you disagree with me - write a comment.  <u>I wonder what you think about this!</u>  <u>;)</u> <br>  -------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------- </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8568/</a></p>
