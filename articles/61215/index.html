      Certification is provided by <a href="http://zend.com/">Zend</a> , this company was at the origins of the development of the PHP core, and still continues to actively promote and support new technologies in this area. <br><br>  With the growing popularity of PHP, there was such a problem - there are a lot of developers, but which of them is really a pro?  Disassembling is not so easy, so it was decided to create an industry standard for certification. <br><br>  For such a difficult task, the <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-5-certification/education-advisory-board">leaders of the PHP developer community</a> gathered, and they in turn chopped up the first version of the test for PHP4, a little later it was replaced by the test for PHP5.  Which I actually gave. <br><br>  There is a small remake.  In the West, in particular in the states, a certified specialist is valued much more than a non-certified, in Russia, the presence of a piece of paper confirming your status is rather a plus, but not a prerequisite. <br><br>  The question arises, why then do we need certification at all? <br>  For me personally, it was a challenge, a challenge, the challenge of which I decided to arrange for myself.  I wondered if I could pass or not, and in general, it‚Äôs useful to evaluate my level of knowledge / experience / skills.  Well, the status of ZCE is also not superfluous :-) <br><br>  No sooner said than done.  I registered on the site, I also purchased a <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/store/php-certification/zend-php5-certification-bundle">Certification Bundle</a> , this is something like an all-in-one kit, it costs $ 165 and includes the right to certification, 10 test tests and a <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/store/php-certification/study-guide">Certification Guide</a> .  On the website, <a href="http://vue.com/zend">PEARSON VUE</a> selected its regional testing center, set the date and time of the exam.  <b>PEARSON VUE</b> has regional testing centers in almost every more or less large city, so there should be no problems with that. <br><br>  Now for more about the format of the tests.  Trial tests (like certification itself) in English.  70 questions, everything about everything is given 90 minutes.  It seems that a little, but in fact this is enough.  A lot of questions will be said directly, ‚Äúwith a jump-hole‚Äù, where a comma will be missed, and where is a bracket, so you need to be very careful.  I especially remember the questions about the knowledge of functions, all the basic (and quite exotic) functions for working with strings, arrays need to be known, without this in any way.  And certainly understand the difference between <b>print ()</b> and <b>echo ()</b> :-) <br>  At the time will have to grow to the manual. <br><br>  For example, what will this script output? <br><br> <code>&lt;?php <br> echo '3' + '0.5' , print('2') + 1; <br> ?&gt; <br></code> <br><br>  Naturally you need to "fumble" in databases, SQL.  Understanding the intricacies of using PHP5 features in this area is simply <b>the must</b> .  At the exam in the light can get a question about PDO, MySQLi, SQLite, transaction, prepared statements, it should be like "our Father", -) <br><br>  Questions can be both ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù.  On "Open" you need to answer in a special input field.  On the "Closed" is usually offered 4 answers, of which you need to select the specified number of correct. <br><br>  Such a pressing topic as parsing XML documents was also not spared (SimpleXML, DOM, SAX).  As for SOAP, REST, XML-RPC, here at least you need to know how one differs from another, the practice is desirable. <br><br>  I was particularly ‚Äúpleased‚Äù with the abundance of questions about streams and network programming, I used to bypass this section before, and now I had to pull it up. <br><br>  Know how XSS differs from CSRF?  Well, if not, then you are welcome to read the special literature :-) This certification will be.  You must be ready to explain all the nuances of using the functions <b>htmlentities</b> , <b>htmlspecialchars</b> and <b>strip_tags</b> , etc.  etc.  In short sekyyurnosti given not the last place. <br><br>  By itself, knowledge of OOP and design patterns in the exam come in handy, because PHP5 has greatly improved work with objects. <br><br>  Naturally, even if a person has been working with PHP for a long time, he may not be aware of many of his features.  Therefore, reading the literature is necessary, alas, all the best in English. <br>  I will try to distribute the necessary list of books and resources: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>PHP Architects' Zend PHP 5 Certification Study Guide 2nd Edition.</b> </li><li>  <b>The Zend PHP Certification Practice Test Book</b> </li><li>  PHP Architect's Guide to PHP Design Patterns </li><li>  Pro PHP XML and Web Services by Robert Richards </li><li>  PHP and MySQL Web Development.  Fourth Edition. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, you need to know a lot, preferably deep.  It‚Äôs time to remember the saying: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to learn - it's easy to fight.‚Äù :-) <br><br>  It seems to have considered everything.  It remains to add that PHP certification is a great chance to improve and put your knowledge in order, so go ahead!  Everyone gets what to strive for. <br><br>  UPD: <br><br>  From the moment of publication, I received many questions on the habroacker, the answers to them deserve a separate article) <br>  Therefore, the continuation read on <a href="http://brainreactor.ru/2009/06/kak-stat-zend-php-5-certified-engineer/">brainreactor.ru</a> .  A series of articles on PHP certification is planned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61215/</a></p>
