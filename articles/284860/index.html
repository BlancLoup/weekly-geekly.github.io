  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT and government why not dialogue</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There was a period in my life when I had to communicate too closely with representatives of the authorities (officials, power structures) and some strongly pronounced criminal elements.  The attempt to forget it, like a bad dream, failed, but now I understand that this is an experience that others do not have and thanks to which I now know how to draw a rope from this category of people. <br><br>  Why am I sharing this with you? <br><br>  Because I see that the IT community in Habr√© excites in connection with the adoption of the 187-FZ, the government‚Äôs attempts to control the Internet.  And the impossibility of a constructive dialogue with the legislative component of power adds fire to all this. <br>  Many have already seen an example on the video in the post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/194576/">‚ÄúAbout how the authorities hear society, or Public discussion of the Anti-Piracy Law‚Äù</a> . <br>  And the fact that Wikipedia is on the blacklist of Roskomnadzor, for me, is the height of arbitrariness. <br>  Knowledge is my God, and Wikipedia is one of the sacred temples, in which I sometimes appeal with prayer (a search query for information) to my God (Knowledge), and always get an answer. <br>  This is the same as outraging the icon in the presence of the Orthodox.  Where does the law on the protection of the feelings of believers look?  I am insulted to the depths of my soul and grieve.

      And now emotions aside. <br>  Let's first understand calmly with the basic concepts: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. IT - representatives of the IT sector. <br>  Main characteristics: <br>  - humanists, <br>  - high level of intelligence, <br>  - poorly tolerate open rudeness.  If you are a professional troll, it does not mean that you will not be shaken by a public open aggression, covered with a seemingly smile and a benevolent tone. <br><br>  The purpose of the activity (work) is the result for money, someone has a quality one, someone has a hack (not without it) <br><br>  How to defend the interests of: <br>  - discuss acute problems on Habr√© and jointly seek solutions to them, <br>  - many are characterized by a high degree of adaptability to the situation, that is, avoiding open confrontation, <br>  - make the eyes, like a kitten from the cartoon "Shrek", <br>  - someone is trying to weave intrigue, but it looks like a hamster is trying to portray a hippopotamus to scare a fox, <br>  - rare bold representatives go for an open public dialogue <br><br>  2. Power - representatives of the authorities (officials, ministers, etc.). <br>  There is an opinion that their main characteristics are as follows: <br>  - for some decision makers, the level of intelligence is not lower than that of bright IT luminaries, only they use it for other purposes, <br>  - experience in open political debates, even if you show them a video of how they threaten someone with an ax, they will answer you with a deadly smile ‚Äúthis is taken out of context‚Äù, any objections to them easily turn against opponents, <br>  - the bulk is incompetent in matters of IT. <br><br>  There is an opinion that their goal of activity (work) is the lack of a result in order to extract personal benefit from it;  protection of interests of a limited approximate circle of persons;  stay in place, because nothing else in their life can not or do not want to do. <br><br>  There is an opinion that they defend their interests as follows: <br>  - use their connections, <br>  - adapt if the opponent is stronger and has more powers, <br>  - abuse of power. <br><br>  3. Constructive dialogue. <br>  This is when opponents engage in dialogue in order to work out a joint solution to a specific problem. <br>  In order to have a constructive dialogue and achieve results, you must first learn to recognize your feelings and emotions, so as not to be their slave and not be trapped in the provocative attack of your opponent, or, even worse, not to throw them out at your interlocutor, since this will not happen. for the benefit of a public discussion or can cause a response emotion, and a constructive dialogue will turn into a verbal scuffle. <br><br>  I believe that a constructive dialogue with these characteristics of opponents is impossible. <br>  And war, intrigue, blackmail is not our profile, we are intellectuals and humanists, we cannot afford to lose our face. <br>  Only one side is interested in the dialogue - IT, the government has already decided everything for itself and further discussion of the issue is not in its interests. <br><br>  What can be done: <br><br>  1. To agree and share with the authorities, I know many who successfully continue their activities in circumvention of many laws and from whose base there have already been attempts to interpret the law in their own favor with appropriate support.  But this is unreliable, temporary.  And many IT projects - a huge amount of sweat and blood, so to risk, and then be content with pennies from the result of their activities. <br><br>  2. To give a fitting rebuff.  The fact that only one party is interested in the dialogue, IT, we have already found out.  And in order to start a dialogue constructively, in order for the public to support, rather than turn away, we need to be on the same wavelength with our opponent, to be able to play adequately in his field.  As my practice shows, nobody can do this from IT.  As far as I can remember, all my leaders, when the issue could not be resolved without blood, put me on the front line, while they themselves went into the shadows for the time of the verbal battle.  For this, I got the corresponding not very biased nickname. <br><br>  3. I saw a lot of topics on the creation of alternative networks that will allow to exist independently of the government and censorship, but so far it is far from being viable, a lot of labor, and I want to eat every day. <br><br>  And do not forget that the IT sector is innovative.  Sometimes projects are created for which laws have not yet been written. <br><br>  And now a life example for those who have a need to engage in controversy with government officials due to the imperfection of the legislative framework. <br><br>  Characters: <br>  Dasha is me, the project manager. <br>  Peter is the CEO. <br>  Viktorov Vyacheslav Petrovich (GDP) - an official from Roskomnadzor. <br><br>  Venue: a profitable web service (which makes a profit and has long paid off).  The project is small, the number of permanent employees - 4 people.  The rest are attracted temporarily from friendly projects.  We work on the basis of a license for telematic communication services.  Service SMS mailing. <br><br>  Who worked on small projects knows what the load is and how much you have to do in order not to lose profitability.  And there is such an opinion that communication with state structures is always slow, inconvenient, as they are sometimes trivially incompetent. <br><br>  Roskomnadzor sends out a newsletter to anyone who has a license for telematics, demanding to acquire a corresponding electronic signature (EDS) and start unloading information about the sites to which they should block access by IP in automatic or manual mode according to a certain schedule.  We are allocated a manager (official) who will personally monitor us, how conscientiously we fulfill their requirements. <br><br>  We are writing a letter that we can do nothing to help them, since it is technically impossible to implement blocking sites from our service. <br><br>  Our manager (official) in Roskomnadzor dials up to my General and insists on execution. <br>  We went the first way, began to negotiate and adapt. <br>  Well, we bought EDS, reported that we bought, fulfilled the condition, we can upload data from their service about the sites for blocking, it‚Äôs not difficult for us to depict the type of active activity.  The main thing that all was good. <br>  One day, the General approaches me with a paper on which the cellular GDP number is written (official in Roskomnadzor) and looks at me like a kitten from the Shrek cartoon. <br>  And says: <br>  - Dash, call.  BUT? <br>  It was before the New Year, at work abdl, I come home a month after 11 pm.  Roskomnadzor was the last straw. <br><br>  I call. <br>  - Good afternoon, can I hear Viktorov Vyacheslav Petrovich? <br>  - Hello, listening to you.  - the voice is calm, full, slept and contented with life. <br>  - These are your wards; you previously communicated with my management, who delegated me a further decision on this issue.  - I call the company, I wait when I figure it out <br>  - Oh, yes, I remember, of course. <br>  - We bought the EDS, ready to proceed, tell me what to do?  - frankly mow under blonde.  Since one does not have to be especially gifted in order to understand what the official needs, when he got to the General, although the degree of inadequacy of their requirements was conveyed in every way. <br>  ‚ÄúWell, I told you already!‚Äù He attacks. <br>  - Sorry, we just do not really shine with intelligence, we did not understand.  - I do not retreat. <br>  He begins to describe to me the procedure for Internet providers. <br>  I answer: <br>  - Oh, you know, and we SMS helmet, we technically do not have the ability to block access to sites by IP. <br>  - But you have the same license for telematics!  - he objects. <br>  Went to our site to read the contract offer.  Once I realized that I couldn‚Äôt argue anything, I went on the attack and began to wonder if everything was closed under license, putting the communication center into operation, SORM, etc.? <br>  I answer: <br>  - And I do not know, it was before me, please list all the laws and regulations with which we must comply, I will convey to the leadership, so that it rechecks, because we really want to comply with the law. <br>  He listed, I asked several times to write down his words exactly. <br>  - So I did not understand, let's say we do not have SORM, we will solve this issue.  So what should we do with blocking websites by IP, which you insist on?  Do we start providing Internet services to the public to fulfill your requirement?  I spent more than half an hour of my time, but I did not understand. <br>  And then I erupt the verbal fountain: <br>  - I understand that you have never worked on a commercial project, and do not understand that as long as I spend time disassembling with you, I do not do work that brings money to our project.  If the project ceases to generate revenue, it will be closed.  I hope that you, as a decent person, will provide me with a job later, as I will lose it through your fault.  Do you know how much rental housing in Moscow is worth?  How fast can I get a job after first contacting you?  And in general, you receive a salary from taxes that we pay in good faith.  Personally, I am unhappy with your work.  I see from you only problems for our business. <br>  After that, his tone changes: <br>  - You are mistaken, I worked on a commercial project.  I understand that this is not your job, this should be done by lawyers and management. <br>  - Ok, I will escalate this question further.  - I added in a serious tone.  - Thank you very much for your comprehensive consultation, I hope she will help us.  Goodbye. <br>  - Goodbye.  - Already with notes of sympathy and tenderness he answered. <br><br>  If it was after the amnesty for those convicted of economic crimes, I would add the following: <br>  - At a time when the country is forced to go to extreme measures in order to raise the economy, releases convicts from prison who are able to raise business, you are trying to drive business into a noose!  - most importantly, at this moment to be sincere and really believe in your words, then it will work. <br><br>  I give to listen to the recording of the conversation Peter (General).  He wipes the sweat from his forehead and replies: <br>  - Well, why are you so close?  Maybe it would have worked out, and they would have forgotten about us later? <br>  ‚ÄúDo you yourself believe that?‚Äù <br><br>  The next day we receive a letter to the company‚Äôs box of apologies from Roskomnadzor, and that they are considering the possibility of removing the need to license services similar to ours.  Peter was frightened that I would continue, and answered them from the common box, signing with my signature: ‚ÄúThank you so much, GDP, for helping to resolve this issue.‚Äù <br><br>  For many, as well as for my leadership, my attacks will seem risky and in vain, but believe me, this is not the first time I've been pulling out a victory in this way.  Never lost. <br><br>  This is called playing on their field and their weapons.  On the field of actual lawlessness with the help of hypocrisy and verbiage.  It's simple, the main thing is to train regularly.  And the reasons for training after the adoption of the 187-FZ will be enough. <br><br>  I hope this will somehow help someone. <br><br>  Good luck! <br><br>  PS Naturally, the situation of life is fictional and has nothing to do with reality.  This is all my sick imagination. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284860/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284860/</a></p>
