We managed to do this with the help of standard SEO techniques, but it became clear that getting into the top 10 is not the key to success for the blades.  In the process of technical support of the site and the study of data Yandex.Metrics and Google Analytics, we noted a number of inconveniences faced by users on the site of the clinic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf9/cc4/954/bf9cc49543754769bd3d7c8b3b18da68.jpg" alt="image">

      For example, people often sent roughly the same messages to Feedback.  The question ‚ÄúDo you get rabies vaccinations?‚Äù Could come 5 times a day from different users, although the answer was published on the site.  In a special section, they also asked for additional information about services, procedures and prices for them (while the price list for clinic services at that time was laid out in an excel file for download). <br><br>  <i>The first conclusion: the site does not take into account the needs of visitors.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1a/db2/82f/b1adb282f2e54401a088772092a99e92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If we approach the issue of promoting a veterinary clinic more broadly, then how often and in what situations do people look for help on the Internet? <br><br><h2>  When do people look for veterinary clinics? </h2><br>  Points of care are sought much less frequently than the symptoms of pet diseases.  The situation is about the same as with the formulation of "diagnosis" and self-treatment after reading several forums and websites.  At first glance, they look expert, are issued on the first lines of the search engine, but recommend methods of traditional medicine without diagnosis.  These sites contain SEO-text written by freelance copywriters, and the portals themselves live at the expense of paying for the visits of visitors. <br>  Last month, 619 people were looking for a veterinarian in Novosibirsk.  For comparison, 1207 people wanted to get information about the sterilization of cats, and 554 people wanted to get the cat neutered in the screenshots below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c41/19e/502/c4119e502c774920b206aba57fc552ad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is possible not to look at the statistics, the doctors themselves know that, unfortunately, they are more often approached in extreme cases when they ‚Äúdid not pass by themselves‚Äù and the recommendations from the forum did not help.  Unawareness about animal diseases sometimes worries veterinarians much more than the position of their own website in search results. <br><br>  <b>Natalya Ulanova, Chief Physician:</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>Often, the owners delay a visit to the doctor, which later complicates the treatment process or even makes it impossible.</i>  <i>Therefore, we set ourselves the task of educating people about the symptoms of the most common diseases, to clearly designate situations in which you cannot postpone visiting the clinic, and to talk about appointments.</i>  <i>And partly thanks to the site, we successfully cope with this task.</i> </blockquote><br>  <i>Conclusion two: A simple website promotion in the top is not enough for veterinary subjects.</i> <br><br><h2>  Transition to an integrated approach to promotion </h2><br><br>  Therefore, we soon came to the conclusion that it is not enough to bring the site to the top for key queries in the subject area.  In addition, the veterinary clinic "BEST" is the leader in the SFD for technological equipment and the level of professionalism of the staff, and the site did not match this.  First, we set tasks for completions to third-party developers (who did the previous version of the clinic site) and performed work on SEO promotion and contextual support.  But soon, together with the head doctor Natalia Vladimirovna Ulanova, they came to the conclusion that a different approach is needed to promote the top and progressive veterinary clinic - an integrated one.  An incremental change of the site became impossible; it was necessary to create it from scratch, changing the structure, design and functionality.  The decision was made, we began to think over the new site and additional promotion channels, based on the needs of the target audience and the development direction of the blade. <br><br><h2>  What includes an integrated approach to internet marketing </h2><br><br>  We are sure (and constantly talking about this to customers) that it is necessary to approach the online promotion in a comprehensive way: use a suitable set of promotion channels for each specific case, pay attention to content, work with reviews, study user scenarios, look at analytics at least once a week draw conclusions from it and, most importantly, take into account the specifics of the business.  The option ‚Äúset up one channel and wait for sales‚Äù is definitely not for those who take their business seriously.  And we <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/eurostudio/blog/302352/">already wrote about it in a blog earlier</a> : the magic "pills" for sales still does not exist, even if you are offered them. <br>  So, taking into account the analysis done and the specifics of the work of veterinary clinics, we have developed an online promotion strategy that included very voluminous and long-term tasks.  Next we will tell what was done and what it led to. <br><br><h2>  Step 1. Connect social networks </h2><br><br>  In parallel with the writing of a technical project for the development of a new clinic site, we connected social networks as a tool for disseminating information and collecting feedback.  Vkontakte and Facebook groups were created for BEST, where news, interesting articles, tips and daily communication with subscribers are published.  Now there are almost 4,000 people in the group. <br>  We list the points that you definitely need to pay attention to if you develop social networks: <br><br>  <b>1. Optimized group name and discussion</b> <br>  The name of the group "Veterinarian BEST Novosibirsk |  Veterinary medicine online ‚Äù- optimized for search within social networks and search engines.  It has not only the brand name, but also reflects what the brand is doing.  For a couple of years, we tried different options, depending on the search algorithms.  By the way, social networks take additional positions in search engines for branded queries and squeeze out ‚Äúuncontrolled‚Äù resources, but on reputation further ... <br><br>  <b>2. Branded design</b> <br>  The group is visually framed in the style of the existing site vet clinics.  In the "Links" block the landing pages of the clinic site are attached, in the "Contacts" the hotline numbers are indicated.  The group has a menu where the main sections are posted with links to the site - ‚ÄúOur doctors‚Äù, ‚ÄúAsk a question‚Äù, ‚ÄúContacts‚Äù, ‚ÄúFrequently asked questions‚Äù.  Questions are categorized by species of animals.  Publications on the wall are separated by threads using hashtags. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/661/32c/15d/66132c15dd0447bfa80ab4d53604da44.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3. Useful content</b> <br>  When launching the group, mainly entertainment content was published to attract users; now the focus is on clinic news, new articles on the site, and feature articles.  For example, when the tick season begins, the group publishes collections of insect repellents, makes recommendations for bites, and other articles.  Content in the group aims to educate subscribers, increase awareness of animal diseases, treatments and new veterinary technologies. <br><br>  <b>4. Permanent online presence</b> <br>  The maximum activity in the group is concentrated in the topic "Ask a Veterinarian."  It has more than 6,800 questions and answers.  The topic is asked not only by subscribers from Novosibirsk, but everyone gets answers.  And this one also has results!  It happened many times when people from the Siberian federal district and even from Vladivostok came to treatment at BEST after receiving detailed advice and an invitation to the group. <br>  To get an answer on difficult issues, we contact the responsible clinic employee - the general practitioner.  The therapist transmits highly specialized questions to other specialists.  As a result, we get a qualified answer and continue to communicate with the subscriber. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d4/01c/3fd/2d401c3fd84d4b8a8e8d0214aa43da18.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>5. Work with brand advocates</b> <br>  Any brand that begins to be active on the Internet immediately has ‚Äúhaters‚Äù.  In our case, they were several former customers who were dissatisfied with something 2-3 years ago, and decided to speak out as soon as they found ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù in social networks.  Yes, Hayter much more active than those to whom you like.  But everything is solved.  In our case, animal protection, charitable organizations and active regular clients of the blades have become significant advocates of the brand, with whom they have managed to build fruitful cooperation online and offline. <br><br><h2>  Step 2. Improve the site </h2><br><br>  The site needed to be aimed at the user: to understand in what situations and why people are looking for information about veterinary clinics, to figure out how to keep them on the site.  Not for the sake of additional sales, but for additional information, people would not go to forums where inaccurate and contradictory information prevails, based on personal experience and subjective evaluation.  We list the main points on which the work was carried out: <br><br>  <b>1. User-friendly site structure</b> <br>  We added filters by clinic services not only by medical branches (therapy, surgery, ophthalmology, ultrasound), which may not be obvious to a person who does not have terms, but also by types of animals: cats, dogs, ferrets, birds, and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca7/954/e9a/ca7954e9ae4b4b7783041354a6957e75.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>2. Veterinary Encyclopedia - a directory in which we are sure</b> <br>  This section was introduced to solve the main problem faced by veterinarians.  Patients, receiving a certificate with a diagnosis or being in search of possible diseases for symptomatology, get on the forums where the same people tell stories of diseases and treatment of their pets.  On such resources, there is a high risk of accepting false information ‚Äúat face value‚Äù.  Therefore, we decided to add our own directory where you can get competent information on animal diseases and medical manipulations.  The section has an educational function and helps customers get the necessary information in one place. <br>  At the moment, the section competes with federal reference books and veterinary directories - for information requests.  By the way, earlier commercial and geo-dependent requests like "sterilization of cats" have already been transferred from commercial to informational. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/83c/8e8/94d/83c8e894d1ef46239bc0cc6b804c497d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3. Active sections "Question-answer" and "Reviews"</b> <br>  The ‚ÄúQuestion-Answer‚Äù section reduces the load on administrators and the call-center, and the ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù section is regarded by search engines as an additional resource with reviews, which gives an additional line to the blade in issuing. <br><br>  <b>4. Continuous update in the sections "News" and "Promotions"</b> <br>  According to the company's activity in the listed sections, site visitors determine whether the company is currently operating.  If the section with the company's news on the site was updated a year ago or even earlier, then much less potential customers will want to write or call you.  Also, according to the information in these sections, the client orientation and openness of the brand is read. <br><br>  <b>5. Emotional section of the ‚ÄúCase History‚Äù confirming positioning.</b> <br>  Emotional, he is in his own tone, because it describes the real stories of helping animals who were refused to be treated in other clinics, difficult cases of operations.  As if expressed in the IT sphere: this is a section with veterinary clinic cases.  They show the level of competence of the clinic specialists and confirm its positioning.  Here are published the history of the veterinary clinic, animal protection organizations and charitable foundations with which BEST cooperates.  Also in the section, visitors are invited to share their story by filling out a special form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea6/1f3/ac7/ea61f3ac7d174ed6ab63ab42f840e90f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6. Synchronization of updates with social networks</b> <br><br>  <b>7. Consideration of requirements for optimization at each stage of development</b> <br>  A special checklist has been created in our web studio, which contains the main points that should not be missed so that they will not return to them in the form of improvements or crutches.  Let's give an example of several points: <br><br><ul><li>  The presence of bread crumbs (no link on the last element) - for the maker-up, </li><li>  The presence in the design of the site for relink - for the designer, </li><li>  The presence on the main page of the site and on the internal pages of a text block with the possibility of editing, prescribing titles is for developers. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>8. Online chat with visitors</b> <br>  For those who need help here and now, and he is not ready to wait for an answer to the mail, but at the same time he cannot call, for example, because he is in a crowded place or at work.  In the online chat, you can check the availability of records to see a doctor, the availability of specific medications for sale and so on. <br><br><h2>  Step 3. Work with an online reputation. </h2><br><br>  We have already written above about working with reputation in social networks.  Therefore, here we talk about the actions that we have taken to work with reviews on Flamp.ru and sites-catalogs.  But first, let's talk a little about the specifics of the clinic's operating mode, which has repeatedly caused negative reviews. <br><br>  <b>Divide negative reviews into categories and find their reasons.</b> <br>  Having examined typical negative comments about the work of the clinic, we identified three main categories: <br><br>  <b><i>Forced write shifts</i></b> <br>  Veterinary clinic "BEST" works not only by appointment or as a store with goods for animals, but also in the ambulance mode.  And it happened when the clinic received up to nine emergency cases during the day during the spring catcap.  Naturally, placing the priorities between the planned vaccination by appointment and the dying animals, the doctors chose the second one, and therefore the first client was informed about the transfer of the reception.  However, not all people were ready for schedule changes.  And of them, the first category of clients appeared, leaving negative feedback on the work of the clinic due to queues and long waiting times. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5d/f5e/dde/b5df5edde7ac46cda60f97c5f50c734b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><i>Unwillingness to take responsibility for the health of the pet</i></b> <br>  The second category is ‚Äúuntrusted‚Äù clients.  When a dog is brought to the clinic for sterilization, the doctor first recommends taking a blood test and an ultrasound of the heart.  This is done to exclude, or to prepare for the effects of anesthesia.  However, some "untrusted" pet owners perceive these recommendations as a way to make money for the clinic and refuse.  In this case, the client signs a disclaimer and liability for the consequences of the operation.  But in case of problems with the pet's health during the operation, the client in any case will blame the doctor and the clinic. <br><br>  <b><i>Misunderstanding of the principles of the therapist</i></b> <br>  Different diseases may have the same symptoms.  And the attending physician has to begin to focus on more common diagnoses for these symptoms, while the results of additional examinations are being prepared, and prescribe treatment to the patient.  The doctor prescribes the scheme and appoints a second appointment.  However, when pet owners do not see any improvements within 3-4 days, they do not come to a second appointment, but immediately go to another clinic, believing that the doctor made a mistake because of his incompetence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70f/a15/734/70fa15734c35451c8f8faf9a9d5a9498.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And then other reasons. <br><br>  <b>What to do?</b> <br><br>  Reviews of the clinic are moderated.  We check the reality of the situations described, because the probability of falling under the machinations of competitors should not be excluded.  For urgent questions - we answer immediately.  Data on difficult situations is transferred to responsible persons who give a comment.  Usually, comments are given by the head physician, who always has videotapes from corridors, classrooms and operating rooms at hand.  We make out the explanations provided by the clinic in a business form and respond, we enter a dialogue with the commentator.  The answer is given to each comment left. <br><br><h2>  Step 4. Associate Internet Marketing with Offline </h2><br><br>  Yes, we are sure that it is impossible to do pure Internet marketing without receiving any data from offline.  Therefore, the veterinary clinic ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù is friends not only in social networks with animal protection and charitable organizations - animals from there can undergo treatment in the clinic on special preferential terms, and any subscriber won in ‚ÄúBEST‚Äù can donate to an animal in need of a shelter. <br>  There was a period when we saw a lot of similar negative reviews about the work of the clinic‚Äôs call-center, about responses in the online chat on the site.  To get our own data, we acted as secret buyers and independently verified the work of the call-center and chat.  It turned out that customers who leave reviews are not exaggerating, there really is a problem.  Information was immediately transferred to the head physician of the clinic, and the problem was resolved. <br><br><h2>  Step 5. Stay in place, plan and act </h2><br><br>  Due to the joint work and professionalism of the clinic, BEST does not conduct active advertising campaigns.  The media gladly publish interesting cases from the practice of the clinic on their sites, since BEST is the main newsmaker among veterinary clinics in Novosibirsk, who provides information openly and in an accessible form.  Doctors of the clinic communicate with patients, receiving feedback, follow global trends in veterinary medicine, and periodically study to improve their skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf6/1f2/8e8/bf61f28e870949a0a3a0c4b239165c95.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The clinic is constantly evolving, and therefore we are selecting new tools for its needs, developing the BEST website and social networks.  Soon the site will be implemented the function "Pay online", which will allow clients of the clinic to easily transfer donations for the treatment of patients from animal protection or charitable foundations.  Social networks are working on wiki pages.  Visitors to the site (subscribers of the group on social networks) are also oriented towards the publication of content in the Encyclopedia, showing activity in the Question-Answer column. <br>  In addition, in 2014, the clinic appeared a new activity - the Siberian Center for Postgraduate Veterinary Education.  This year, Sibvet has already held the first Veterinary Congress - an event that has not yet been analogous beyond the Urals.  A basic SEO optimization was carried out for the site, the functionality is being finalized with the development of the direction.  The project is also being promoted in social networks, more actively in Facebook, communities are professional and closed, as there are discussions of diseases inside and consultations are held to solve difficult cases - with photos and videos. <br><br><br>  <b>Natalya Ulanova, Chief Physician:</b> <br><blockquote>  <i>We need to grow constantly, as the pace of development of medicine and the market is extremely rapid, we are constantly learning, improving the qualifications of the specialists of the clinic, we practice a lot.</i>  <i>And we know that the experts of Eurostudio act in a similar way.</i>  <i>Every professional knows the nuances of his working field, so be sure to work on each task together.</i>  <i>With the promotion and development of the site - including.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  Bilateral interaction is important. </h2><br><br>  Secrets of getting good results - working in a team with a customer.  When a studio is not just a performer, but a participant and initiator of research, changes and innovations.  When feedback from the client is easy, because he knows what it is for.  When the client takes the initiative and is ready to listen and accept the proposals of the studio.  This shows not only the seriousness of the intentions of both parties, but also the responsible attitude towards the clinic's patients ‚Äî animals. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303644/</a></p>
