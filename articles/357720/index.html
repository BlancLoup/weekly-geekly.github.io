  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web development - where to start?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, on stack overflow, I saw a question in which a C ++ programmer asked what to start learning in order to later become a web developer.  From his words, he began by studying php, but on the advice of his acquaintances he switched to Java, at some point he discovered an angular, as a result, porridge formed in his head, and there was no understanding in which direction to move.  It is for people who have just come to the web and I decided to share this article so that they have a rough understanding of what is there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Any web application consists of two parts: a backend and a frontend.  Accordingly, programmers are also divided, in fact, they are two castes of developers not connected with each other. <br><br><h3>  Backend </h3><br>  Backend is the server part of the application that is not visible to users.  This includes: authorization, storage and processing of data, email distribution and the like.  Let's just say backend is what's under the hood. <br><br>  There are many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãhere, here are the most common ones: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      ‚Ä¢ Php <br>  ‚Ä¢ Asp net <br>  ‚Ä¢ Java <br>  ‚Ä¢ Python <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ruby <br>  ‚Ä¢ Node js <br><br>  I advise you to choose one, because with the current requirements for programmers to achieve the level of middle will take at least several years.  When choosing, you can familiarize yourself with the vacancies in your city, see which ones are more suitable, where they pay more and depending on what language they need and choose. <br><br>  The server is largely used to work with data.  Therefore, it will be necessary to learn at least one of the relational databases: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Oracle <br>  ‚Ä¢ MSSQL <br>  ‚Ä¢ MYSQL <br>  ‚Ä¢ Postgres <br><br>  In terms of complexity, this is about the same as mastering a programming language.  In all the listed databases there is a part that is the same everywhere - the so-called sql (query language), as well as a procedural language that is different in each database.  Since sql is nevertheless one, and it is the basis for everything related to data processing, switching to another database is not such a problem.  Therefore, you can choose any for the beginning, but even here I would go on the principle of analyzing vacancies. <br><br>  Personally, I put a plus in the direction of studying the backend, since the skills here are more static and having learned that once you can work on this for a long time. <br><br><h3>  Frontend </h3><br>  Front-end - the part working in the browser with which the user interacts directly.  These are dynamic interfaces, menus, events by user action, data exchange with the server part, in general, what is happening on the client. <br><br>  The programming language is one javascript.  On the one hand, this is a definite plus, because after studying it, you will open all the companies in your city that are engaged in web development, and now many are involved in this.  On the other hand, there are nuances. <br><br>  JavaScript currently has two standards that are widely used: ECMAScript 5 and ECMAScript 6. The difference between them is that ECMAScript 5 lacks a full-featured RP.  It is in ECMAScript 6, but since this standard has appeared relatively recently, most of the applications have already been written in ECMAScript 5, as a result of which both standards will have to be mastered and, as a result, two different approaches to development. <br><br>  Another point that needs to be borne in mind is that the same javascript code can work differently in different browsers and on different operating systems.  With the current requirements for applications, it will be necessary to write the so-called cross-browser code, that is, the code, the result of which will give the same result everywhere.  There is no specific script for writing such a code, in this case the forums help you and okay Google. <br><br>  The problem moments described by me are solved in modern js frameworks (for example, such as angular and reaction).  But in projects that are written without the use of frameworks, these moments remain. <br><br>  For me personally, another big disadvantage is that there is a very rapid development of trends.  The frameworks are constantly updated, new libraries are released, and everyone wants to start using them right away.  In general, the community can not keep up. <br><br><h3>  Fulstek </h3><br>  Already from the name it should be clear that this type of developers is engaged in the development of both parts.  I do not advise you to try to become such a developer, since it would not be enough to learn all the brains anyway, and most companies have already taken the path of division of labor.  However, fulstek is where to start in order to take a step towards backend or frontend.  Having developed a couple of small applications, you will understand the difference between them (and it really is) and you can decide which side is closer to you. <br><br>  I in due time to be defined read the book ‚ÄúWe Create Dynamic Websites‚Äù, the author of ‚ÄúRobin Nixon‚Äù.  The book is small, only 500 pages, but thanks to it I got a general idea about web development and I boldly made a choice in the direction of the backend about which I still do not regret.  I cited this book as an example, you can take any other one that does not matter. <br><br>  That's basically all I wanted to share, I wish everyone who came to the web good luck and speedy development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357720/</a></p>
