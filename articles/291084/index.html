  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Features of the work of engineers medical-technical profile</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Good day everyone! <br><br>  Today I would like to talk about people who are engaged in the scientific and educational field of medical and technical profile. <br><br>  In many research institutes of our country and abroad, a specialist in the development of medical devices, as a rule, deals with various problems and topics.  To use the device in clinical practice, it is necessary to first embody its software and hardware.  Then conduct laboratory tests.  Then check on the test group, publish the results, formalize intellectual property, make certification, etc. Designing medical devices is a complex, extremely important matter and cannot be approached lightly.  As Hippocrates said: "Do no harm!"

In my opinion, this is <b>help to people who need means of treatment and diagnosis of various diseases.</b>  By itself, work in this area is interesting and affects several areas of knowledge at once: <br><br>  <i>- human and animal physiology</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- biophysics</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- circuit design</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- design of electronic equipment</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- digital processing of medical signals and data</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- The basics of marketing and organization of production.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/49e/cf7/cef/49ecf7cefa7c4f2090a1a3b00f365088.JPG" alt="image"><br>  <i>The MindWave Mobile System is a neuro headset for analyzing brain activity.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>It is used for experimental studies based on RGRTU.</i> <br><br>  Why, then, the development of medical equipment and the related scientific research does not arouse the interest of young people ?!  There are several explanations for this. <br><br>  The work of such an engineer should cover a wide area of ‚Äã‚Äãknowledge, ranging from the study of the principles of construction techniques and ending with the direct study of the sciences of man.  And often, many specialists have a situation, the so-called feeling of "surface specialization".  In other words, we are "everywhere and nowhere."  And indeed, if a surgeon or therapist, receiving an education, knows only 10 years for a person and everything connected with him and becomes a professional in this area, then, as a rule, such a sense of professional satisfaction does not arise for medical engineers.  After graduation, many students go out of its walls and do not realize what areas of knowledge they have studied in full.  Thus, <b>problem No. 1 is a problem of wide specialization and in this connection feelings of insufficiency of the knowledge gained.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f01/e67/8d0/f01e678d0b6c4c08ab1d8b1b474aba7c.JPG"><br>  <i>Visiting the exhibition "Healthcare-2010".</i>  <i>Expo Center.</i>  <i>Moscow</i> <br><br>  Another common problem in this area is the difficulty of choosing "one's" occupation.  It is directly related to the first problem, but besides it has a number of features.  As a rule, medical engineers are trained in universities as manufacturers of medical equipment.  Depending on the scientific interests of the graduating department and their personal interests, the student receives some specialized knowledge.  Someone specializes in the analysis of tomographic images, someone on the development of blood pressure tonometers.  But in general, an occupation can relate to some areas (most often it turns out their combination). <br><br>  <b>1) The hardware developer.</b>  In common "electronics", "zhelezyachnik."  This includes the design of printed circuit boards, circuit design, design development and design of the device. <br>  <b>2) Software developer.</b>  This may be a hardware programmer, a web programmer, an algorithmist, a mathematician, an analyst, etc. <br>  <b>3) The experimental scientist.</b>  This is a rather dependent, but at the same time, extremely necessary area of ‚Äã‚Äãwork for a medical engineer.  His responsibilities include the organization of experimental studies using existing certified medical devices and his own developments.  Publication of research results in leading Russian and foreign publications is also suitable for this occupation. <br>  <b>4) The organizing marketer.</b>  This includes the study of the consumer market, the target audience, which will be offered the developed product.  In addition, the skills of building a business plan, commercial presentations, working in the media and other similar activities are useful here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b18/aad/c87/b18aadc871ab47f1beaf6efaab8bd72b.JPG"><br>  <i>Testing the system of monitoring the motor activity of a person based on accelerometers</i> <i><br></i>  <i>and platforms Arduino Fio.</i>  <i>Gym RGRTU.</i> <br><br>  Immediately after graduation or already in senior courses, the specialist faces the choice of any of these areas, based on acquired knowledge, skills, skills and of course, personal desires and aspirations.  And here a problem arises in the difficulty of choosing the right direction.  The graduate asks himself a logical question: ‚ÄúAnd actually, who am I?  Electronic engineer, programmer, scientist or manager. "  Thus, <b>problem number 2 is the difficulty of choosing the type of occupation</b> .  This problem is often mixed with another factor - it is university-based teaching activities.  After all, it also needs to be given a certain time. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 3 can be called a lack of funding</b> , mainly public.  This is familiar to many not by hearsay, so we will not focus on this. <br><br>  Often, in moments of sad doubt, you ask yourself, well, when, when will we finally be engineers, will we touch medicine, as doctors do?  When will our devices treat people and increase the health indicators of the whole nation ?!  On the basis of this rhetorical question, <b>problem number 4</b> arises <b>- this is the excessive distance of medical engineers from medical practice and clinical trials.</b>  We sometimes make devices, develop programs, even publish articles.  And for whom?  Doctors and their patients should be for us a kind of gas tank in which we must constantly add fuel to new ideas and solutions.  There is no point in a gas canister that is standing in the garage indefinitely, as well as there is no sense in endlessly conducted ‚Äúinternal‚Äù laboratory tests.  And systematic, purposeful cooperation of such specialties with health care institutions is a daily necessity, without which there <b>will</b> never be a positive result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/853/eb4/f18/853eb4f1870f44ef9502285a82eeba00.JPG"><br>  <i>International Conference "Engineering, scientific and educational applications based on technology National Instruments - 2012".</i>  <i>Participation in the exhibition from the LabVIEW-Portal community</i> <br><br>  Thus, this young profession is just beginning to be integrated into the modern infrastructure of the scientific community of medical technologies.  If I may say so, then modern engineers of this kind are pioneers in this field and work by trial and error. <br><br>  After all, if many professions, such as a doctor, a teacher or a fireman, have accumulated vast theoretical and practical experience over several millennia of their existence, then everything is not so clear and understandable with medical instrumentation. <br><br>  In many ways, the positioning of this specialty depends on the educational program of the graduating school, the level of development of information technology, as well as personal interests and lifestyle of a specialist. <br><br>  Modern reality is such that a medical engineer, as well as representatives of the most conservative professions, is required to be fully laid out and dedicated to obtain a tangible result.  This is an incomparable feeling of constant information hunger, lack of knowledge and the desire to achieve the set result in the true sense of the torments many scientific researchers, engineers and doctors including.  But due to this, the development of this area occurs. <br><br>  Sometimes you do not even know what it is better to undertake: write a dissertation research, publish an article to a journal, organize experiments, or apply for funding and intellectual property.  But many in the workload, there are also students who are waiting for classes and getting more and more new knowledge!  But if the steel is not tempered, it will remain soft and inapplicable in production. <br>  "Burning himself - shine to others!" - said Hippocrates. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291084/</a></p>
