Call where you want, say how much you want and the prices for the connection were reasonable.  But there were cell phones and a wired connection, tied to one point, began to look old and terribly inconvenient.  In general, a wired telephone is an archaic and cumbersome thing, limited only to a long wire.  Plus, the tariffs for the telephone line have increased significantly.  It is quite another thing, cellular communication.  Mobility and low rates for communication have made mobile phones accessible to all sectors of society. <br><br>  But cell phones have a significant drawback.  They are sensitive to the quality of communication and signal.  Our country is large and there are places that are very remote from the base stations, where the cell phone signal just disappears.  In addition, for example, it is difficult for older people to master a smartphone, but there are no problems calling from a familiar landline phone.  What to do?  You can try this solution, as a landline cell phone Dadzhet MT3020. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8b/b56/e00/c8bb56e004f94aa2b5c04602bc6b2349.jpg">

      This is a landline cell phone for those who are used to having an ordinary telephone set with a handset on the table.  Oddly enough, but it is this design that has some advantages over a regular mobile phone. <br><br>  I managed to get for testing just such a landline cell phone.  So it turns out that in the summer a lot of time at the cottage.  Cottage naturally outside the city and away from the base station of cellular communication.  To call or send SMS, you need to look for a place higher.  In general, there are problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/c02/a2a/4a3c02a2a9654fd2abaf1d789e1612c9.jpg"><br><br><br>  As you can see, the externally stationary cellular telephone The MT3020 Djet is no different from an ordinary home telephone.  The fact that it gives out only a cellular GSM antenna at the side of the case. <br><br>  <b>Now I‚Äôll tell you my impressions about the phone Dadget MT3020</b> <br>  The packaging is strong and of good quality.  Inside, nothing dangles and does not rumble.  Shipment machine suffered excellent.  The box indicates that this is a landline cell phone and all its main features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97c/4ef/60f/97c4ef60fbdc4539a9e1240c6da7c749.jpg"><br><br>  Technical characteristics of the phone are as follows: <br><ul><li>  Battery: Built-in Li-battery </li><li>  Weight: 590 g </li><li>  Extras: Speakerphone, incoming number identification, clock, alarm clock, FM radio, the ability to use the phone as an Internet GPRS modem in 2G networks, an external antenna for amplifying signal reception with a long wire and a half meter. </li><li>  Voltage 220V, 50Hz and power supply 5V / 2A - EU </li><li>  Dimensions: 200x190x55 mm </li><li>  Communication standard: GSM </li><li>  Black colour </li><li>  GSM frequency: 900Mhz / 1800Mhz / 800Mhz / 1900Mhz </li><li>  Battery: 9 hours talk time and standby time up to 7 days </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b32/917/f32/b32917f322bc4a56972d78f81c323eb9.jpg"><br><br>  Includes two antennas.  One antenna is small, such we often see on modems for the Internet.  A small antenna is installed when the phone is used in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãconfident communication or just at home.  But the second antenna with a long wire of about one and a half meters.  It can be used where reception of a signal is difficult.  For example, in the basement or in a room where the walls do not transmit a signal well.  An antenna with a magnet in the mount can be easily stuck to metal parts.  An external antenna allows for better communication.  The socket for its connection is on the case of the device.  This is a plus. <br><br>  Unlike a regular mobile phone, a landline mobile phone has a more powerful transmitter.  But this transmitter is not in the handset, which during the conversation is applied to the head, but in the case.  Therefore, there is another plus, it is a large distance from the head to the radiating antenna.  And in the handset itself there are no elements that could potentially cause harm. <br><br>  During fairly long calls on a cell phone, the exposure is quite high.  And in our case, this is not.  Another plus in the piggy bank.  And if there is an opportunity to avoid harm, I would prefer to use this opportunity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43b/fba/aad/43bfbaaad2dd42628eaeef7b771d639b.jpg"><br><br>  The phone package consists of the phone itself, a handset with a wire, a power supply unit for operation from the network, a backup power battery, a USB cable for connecting to a computer, two antennas, instructions and a software disc.  All training in working condition will take about two minutes.  We take out of the box, insert the battery, fasten the antenna, depending on the conditions, choose which internal or external, install a standard SIM card, connect the handset and the charger.  Everything!  The device is ready to work. <br><br>  The telephone set can be mounted on the table, but if desired, the telephone can be mounted on the wall.  At the bottom of the case there are technological fasteners for installation in a vertical position, as well as a cover for installing the battery and SIM card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/199/ecc/029/199ecc029b18448cbf30c54331fdf360.jpg"><br><br>  Problems with the installation of the SIM card was not.  A standard SIM card of standard size is used.  Installed and forgotten. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e06/d36/696/e06d366965484e0e91215e047f91f651.jpg"><br><br>  800 mAh battery is charging from the network.  When for some reason the mains voltage drops, the phone automatically switches to battery operation.  The battery charge is enough for 7 days of waiting and up to 9 hours of talk time.  This agree is not enough.  Not every cell phone can provide this, and even more so with smartphones.  When used indoors, the phone is likely to always work from an outlet.  The battery will be a good reserve.  On the case there is a plug for connecting the power supply of the network and for the handset there is also a USB port connecting to a laptop or computer.  By connecting to a computer, we get a GPRS modem and the Internet. <br><br>  The device turns on quickly and plays a switching on melody.  Before readiness for work, no more time passes than a regular cell phone, but since this phone has a powerful antenna, it quickly establishes communication with the base station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/a36/dad/5c1a36dada2c406a974b3cc0eaf78bde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/066/38b/24d/06638b24d9224c00b2b2606c84d4d11d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What's inside?</b> <br><br>  Having examined the case, we can see the device of the telephone set. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d9/3b7/3f7/9d93b73f720e44aa94fe305ab6b7b0c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9dd/522/1ac/9dd5221ac7644ae0b487576bade2f0a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99e/ac5/146/99eac5146e16418e8f7e2aa6184cfbf6.jpg"><br><br>  You can see a board with a microcircuit, a speakerphone, a microphone, a place to install a SIM card. <br>  The chip is probably closed by the screen.  It is understandable.  The phone's transmitter is powerful, and can affect the operation.  Therefore, engineers and applied shielded protection. <br>  <b>What can a landline cell phone?</b> <br>  The capabilities of the phone include all the most necessary functions to always be in touch.  You can make and receive calls, receive and send SMS messages, there is a notebook and a programmable alarm clock.  The device works in the Russian GSM900Mhz / 1800Mhz / 800Mhz / 1900Mhz networks. <br><br>  The phone perfectly simulates a regular wired telephone.  If you pick up the phone, you will hear a familiar long beep, meaning that the line is free.  Let's write one more plus in the phone box.  Engineers took good care of older people and their habits.  If buzzing, then you can call.  My parents retired it immediately appreciated. <br><br>  After a long beep and a full set of numbers, auto dialing is automatically activated and the subscriber is called.  In the phone settings, the automatic dialing time can be configured.  The default is 5 seconds.  If you don‚Äôt want to wait for these 5 seconds, you can make a call with a button on the phone. <br><br>  The screen is big enough and equipped with a nice blue backlight.  In its normal state, it works without illumination, everything is clearly visible and perfectly readable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c1/a36/dad/5c1a36dada2c406a974b3cc0eaf78bde.jpg"><br><br>  The buttons on the case, it is a speakerphone, settings menu, redialing, microphone mute, buttons for navigating through menu items.  The dialing buttons are large with clearly written numbers and letters.  Just for people of advanced age who already have problems with their eyesight. <br><br>  Navigating the menu requires a little habit.  However, everything new requires a small habit.  But, in principle, everything is convenient.  It will be necessary to navigate the screen menu only when you need to use the note book or read an SMS message. <br>  You can work with SMS messages as in a regular cell phone.  You can write a message and you can receive.  I do not think that from such a phone someone will often send SMS messages.  You can make up to 10 drafts for sending SMS and, if necessary, you can still receive SMS in the phone.  It is better to let this opportunity than not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/273/886/d91/273886d9160b41a6b6ab64136038bdfd.jpg"><br><br>  Phonebook, as well as on a regular cell phone, allows any number to assign a name.  When calling, the search for the called subscriber by name is more convenient than by number.  Frequently used numbers can be set to Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/511/ae3/9b9/511ae39b946a4f38b2308875440b3fc9.jpg"><br><br>  The missed call log can store 10 missed calls, and the outgoing call log can store up to 20 numbers.  All phone numbers can be stored as standard in two places, both on the SIM card and in the memory of the phone itself.  It also stores information about the time of the call and its duration, as well as sound alerts in the form of 10 ring tones and 10 alert tones when a message is received. <br><br>  In the city, the signal reception confidence is stable and does not particularly differ from a regular mobile phone.  I tried to connect an external antenna only outside the city. <br>  I conducted an experiment with SIM cards of MTS and Megaphone, which were available, I was pleased with the result.  When the cell phone almost went out, the phone Dadjet with an external antenna caught the signal of the remote tower one hundred percent, and the connection was stable.  I clearly heard the interlocutor, and the interlocutor heard me.  The powerful transmitter did its job and at the same time it was far from my head and did not irradiate me with radio waves. <br><br>  I also want to draw attention to this chip.  This phone has FM radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e60/c1f/a9c/e60c1fa9cb9c4a0a84159e44b9e08d8c.jpg"><br><br>  The phone can scan the broadcast and find Fm radio stations.  After scanning the air, I found several stations, one of which was 65 kilometers away.  The radio only worked for me with a long external antenna.  Probably, if the station is closer, then there will be a signal with a small antenna too.  If, for example, the telephone is used at the guard post, at the caretaker, or somewhere else in such places, then the workers will not be bored and will always be aware of the latest news. <br><br>  <b>Summing up</b> <br><br>  Definitely I was pleased with this cell phone.  This phone is strict, simple and without any frills and bells and whistles.  Perfectly does everything he needs to do according to his status: calls in poor communication conditions are excellent, sending and receiving SMS messages without any problems. <br><br>  Benefits you get: <br>  - complete external antenna, which gives a good signal even in areas of uncertain reception; <br>  - there is no radiation of radio waves, the tube does not need to be held directly at the head; <br>  - automatically recharged, powered from the mains and the battery is turned on during a power outage with waiting up to a week; <br>  - large buttons and design for older people who may not cope with a mobile phone; <br>  - the phone is always in its place and it is not necessary to look for it; <br>  - do not need a telephone line as a landline phone and it can be transferred without problems; <br>  - Additional features such as radio and alarm clock; <br>  - you can connect to a computer and use GPRS Internet. <br><br>  <b>About the shortcomings ...</b> <br>  The phone case is large and spacious inside.  This, from my point of view, allows you to install a more capacious and large battery there.  Then the phone could work without charging for a week, but a whole month or even two. <br><br>  <b>Where will this phone work well?</b> <br>  This is a country house or a country house, a kiosk or a shop, a checkpoint, a security station, a warehouse or a small office, basements with weak cellular reception, apartments or new buildings.  Wherever there is no telephone line.  Here in these cases, the phone will show itself in all its glory.  As I expected, the most useful application of this phone will be outside the city, in the country or in the village.  Agree, to carry a wired phone to the village is often very expensive and almost impossible.  But there may be a problem with the fact that the signal of a regular cell phone is very weak or at times completely absent. <br><br>  This is where the Stationary Cell Phone Dadjet MT3020 is needed. <br><br>  An external antenna solves the signal problem.  Built-in battery solves the problem of possible power outages.  The phone itself is large and the dialing buttons are very large, perfectly visible on the case and solve the convenience problem.  The best place for this phone is to install it, for example, in the house of elderly parents or in the village of the grandparents.  They will always be on a stable and inexpensive connection.  And plus to everything, aged pensioners can not cope with small buttons of a usual cell phone.  I have already watched more than once how elderly people at the age do not cope well with cell phones.  And in this case, get almost the same familiar and convenient landline phone. <br><br>  Issue price when buying a landline cell phone <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/dom-i-dacha/stacionarnyj-sotovyj-telefon/%3Futm_source%3Dbloger%26utm_medium%3Dtaran%26utm_term%3Dstacionarnyj-sotovyj-telefon%26utm_campaign%3Dstacionarnyj-sotovyj-telefon_150">Dadzhet MT3020</a> in retail up to 4 thousand rubles.  You can purchase it directly on the company's website.  Buying yourself pays off quickly if you compare the costs with the cost of a wired phone.  Today, this is one of the most affordable devices, which is autonomous, economical and with all this provides the user with all the features inherent in a regular home phone and even more. <br><br>  <i>Author: Sergey Taran, Yuzha, Ivanovo Region, Russia</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391313/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391313/</a></p>
