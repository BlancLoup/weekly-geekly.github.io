Without simple reports, without adjayles and scraps - only hardcore, in the best traditions of Joker and JPoint - and the name of this conference is <b>JBreak</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c5/649/e20/7c5649e20cb54b87af5cc7af9e045fef.png"><br><br>  In this post you will find:

I take this opportunity to correct the situation: all the reports presented below received a rating of participants 4.5+ (out of five).  All videos are given in the playlist, in which you will find JBreak 2016 reports that are not in the top 10. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Shipilev, Oracle</b> <b><br></b>  <b>The Lord of the Strings: Two Scours</b> <br><br>  The best report is the Joker / JPoint, which broke the hall in Novosibirsk, which helps to understand how much the development of the JDK differs from conventional projects.  This report discusses two features in the still-coming JDK 9 aimed at optimizing strings: <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254">Compact Strings</a> , compressing strings with single-byte characters, which improves the footprint and even overall performance;  and <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/280">Indify String Concat</a> , which uses invokedynamic magic for string concatenation, allowing you to hook up the concatenation implementation without recompiling programs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHiEKXpG_4M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Tagir Valeev</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Stream API: recommendations of the best dog breeders</b> <br><br>  Tagir began his winning streak on Joker 2015, securing the title of one of the best Java speakers in Russia in Novosibirsk. <br><br>  In the report, along with Tagir, you will get acquainted with all the features of the Stream API, you can understand for what operations the standard library lacks tools and how to replace them with your own elegant solutions.  And if by the end of the report you understand, you don‚Äôt want to build bicycles, the report will offer you a couple of libraries that will make life easier. <br><br>  A lot of hardcore, a lot of humor.  Must see, as they say: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vxikpWnnnCU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Alexander Matorin, SberTech</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Unobvious Generics &lt;?&gt; ();</b> <br><br>  A report from the developer Sberbank-Technology, which received high marks not only in Novosibirsk, but in Moscow, is devoted to the pitfalls and the amazing features of the generics in the JDK, what they are compiled for (when they are compiled) and why generics in Java are so strange. <br><br>  The report contains a lot of code, riddles and the coolest examples. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mNyQYTp-Njw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Michal Kordas</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Groovier BDD with Spock</b> <br><br>  The report in English, dedicated to Behavior Driven Development and tools to bring it to perfection.  The combination of Groovy and Spock allows you to write tests and specifications for your code in almost pure English, so even your PM.  <s>which hasn't opened the IDE for five years</s> , will be able to read them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6d/99f/8d9/b6d99f8d96d146829237bddb8061a531.png"><br><br>  Looks fresh and impressive, see for yourself: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HSkU7oI9MGY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Alexey Shipilev, Oracle</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Squeeze me completely</b> <br><br>  In this report, Alexey publicly delves into the guts of the JVM and JDK, in search of how the platform itself is trying to save on memory.  Let's look at the packaging of headers and fields of objects, pointer compression, accounting of links between generations in a heap, tricks in the generated code, autoboxing cache, etc. <br><br>  Want to break your head over tricky questions from Alexey?  Then you here: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHHbIStkaqI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Oleg <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/m0nstermind/" class="user_link">m0nstermind</a> Anastasyev, Odnoklassniki</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Distributed systems in Odnoklassniki</b> <br><br>  A report on how one of the most heavily loaded systems in Russia works, processing up to 500,000 (half a million, yes) requests per second to 8,000 servers in three data centers, included in the list of the best reports at our Java conferences in Moscow, St. Petersburg and See, Novosibirsk. <br><br>  The talk in the report is not about how to ‚Äúassemble classes‚Äù: here you will find an example of building a fault-tolerant distributed system in Java, based on errors and failures, methods of testing and diagnosing them.  It will also deal with accidents in distributed systems and methods for their prevention.  See if you are interested in distributed-architectures: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/065_To1GLqk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Roman Artemyev, Sergey Andreenko</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Features of Java implementation on the Elbrus processor</b> <br><br>  A report on how two students sawed their Java <s>with blackjack and ...</s> under the exotic VLIW architecture of Elbrus.  Together with the speakers, you will go all the way from choosing the JDK and compiler to ‚Äúmanual‚Äù garbage collection and solving problems with exception handling. <br><br>  In the end, you will learn about the approaches and non-trivial solutions that were used when porting the JVM, how the use of seemingly minor architectural features can give much more acceleration than various classical optimizations, and also why everyone says that Elbrus is slow , and as far as this is true: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yOwvNykK__o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Two reports by Vladimir Krasilshchik, Luxoft</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Vert.x: instruction manual</b> <br><br>  Technocratic piece from a pragmatic Java programmer, dedicated to Vert.x - a modern polyglot toolkit for creating reactive web and not only applications. <br><br>  Vert.x is a kind of methodology and tools for building a scalable and high-performance server-side, which, however, do not impose any restrictions on the frameworks and tools that you already have to work with. <br><br>  If you know or are close in terms of terms such as Node.js, Actors Model, Erlang, Akka and microservices, you will definitely be interested in learning more about Vert.x in order to write very fast JVM code in any language, be it Java, Javascript, Scala, Groovy or Ruby. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xPx3UHF9ccQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>What you need to know about logging to a pragmatic Java programmer</b> <br><br>  The report is based on a project consisting of 40 microservices, which (not all, but some) have been maintained by a team of 20 developers for 6 years.  In the work of professional Java ‚Äë programmers, such an aspect as logging does not seem to be something important, meaningful, only when an application begins to live its own life, pass from hands to programmers and testers, break, repair, otherwise fall and be supported, and even more so when it begins to integrate with other subsystems or upgrade to new versions of libraries, here is the logging and shows its true face and cheerfully asks: ‚ÄúWell, @ # $%, didn‚Äôt you wait?‚Äù. <br><br>  From the report you will learn how modern logging libraries are combined, how you can and should use logs, as well as about possible "unexpected", which can happen, for example, in the simplest line: <br><br><pre><code class="java hljs">log.info(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"personalId="</span></span>+id)</code> </pre> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qzqAUUgB3v8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Nikita <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pjbooms/" class="user_link">pjBooms</a> Lipsky, Excelsior</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Java 8 support in Excelsior JET</b> <br><br>  The report of Nikita Lipsky, a JVM developer who doesn‚Äôt write on the pros: the Exotlsior JET is written in Scala, and the runtime is written in Java, which examines the implementation of Excelsior JET of new features added in Java 8. <br><br>  As a result, after the report you will refresh in memory what appeared in Java 8, how it affected the JVM specification, what lambda expressions turn into Java bytecode, how to optimize them statically, and also get some insight into the internal structure one JVM. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ePsev12d9dY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <b>More hardcore</b> </h2><br>  As you can see, the top of the last conference was almost completely occupied by hardcore with reports about JVM guts.  In 2017, the stakes will not fall, we already have 7 speakers, four of whom still work with the guts of the platform - a good start: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b8/0a6/5e9/3b80a65e96844fef8727b69659a2fc9f.png"><br><br>  Of the newcomers to JBreak (each of whom is actually a proven veteran of the Java world), we will have: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Charles Nutter</b> , JVM Developer at Red Hat, <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby Maintainer</a> . </li><li>  <b>Vladimir <a href="https://twitter.com/iwan0www">@ iwan0www</a> Ivanov</b> , engineer of the HotSpot JVM team. </li><li>  <b>Victor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/gamussa/" class="user_link">gAmUssA</a> Gamov</b> , Senior Solution Architect at Hazelcast, an expert in the field of distributed systems, co-founder of the podcast " <a href="http://razbor-poletov.com/">Debriefing</a> ." </li><li>  <b>Egor <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yegor256/" class="user_link">yegor256</a> Bugaenko</b> , CTO in Teamed.io, the founder of the trueOOP movement and the ideological inspirer of the JVM-language EO. </li></ul><br>  However, you will find in 2017 and the best speakers of the last conference: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Alexey Dzhiviemovich Shipilev</b> , JVM-developer in Red Hat, performance engineer with more than 10 years of experience, <s>God is</s> an expert in the field of benchmarking. </li><li>  <b>Tagir <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lany/" class="user_link">lany</a> Valeev</b> , Engineer in the Novosibirsk office of JetBrains, is engaged in a static code analyzer IntelliJ IDE (A), inspections and quick fixes.  OpenJDK contributor, author of the open source StreamEx library and <a href="https://github.com/amaembo/huntbugs">Java Byntcode</a> Analyzer <a href="https://github.com/amaembo/huntbugs">HuntBugs</a> . </li><li>  <b>Nikita <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/pjbooms/" class="user_link">pjBooms</a> Lipsky</b> , One of the initiators and leaders of the Excelsior JET project, a certified Java SE implementation, developed by Excelsior.  Also, by the way, Siberian :) </li></ul><br>  In general, as you can see, already three and a half months before the conference, the list of speakers is such that you can <a href="http://2017.jbreak.ru/registration"><b>run to register</b></a> , but remember - we will have at least three tracks, which means that there will be more than 20 speakers. Stay tuned <a href="http://2017.jbreak.ru/"><b>to the website conference</b></a> . <br><br>  During the closing ceremony of the JBreak 2016, <b>Aleksey <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/23derevo/" class="user_link">23derevo</a> Fedorov</b> noted: what happened on this day at Technopark sold-out means, firstly, that in a year you cannot do without JBreak 2017, and, secondly, that it will have to look for a bigger place for him - and JBreak 2017 will take place at the Novosibirsk Expo Center. <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>By the way, we had people who complained that there was no rumor or spirit about the conference.</i>  <i>Can you advise where to write in order to learn more about the Novosibirsk Java developers about JBreak?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317628/</a></p>
