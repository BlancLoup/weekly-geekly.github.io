Do you spend days on the span in front of PC screens, or maybe you read a lot and by the end of the day your eyes get tired of hard work?  In this article I will talk about the accessory that has been testing for a whole year, which has become an indispensable and habitual attribute for me both in work and in regular life.  I forgot such a tool as "Vizin", a feeling of dryness and redness of the eyes.  And the world around me became much clearer, more contrast and warmer ... <br><br>  To start the video from CES 2011 <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6hwTClAVFLQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_NOZkthOOkrrWJFk6q7mMIvrzqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In the first part, some introductory information about the company and technology. <br>  In the second part of the review I will tell about: <br>  - How to choose such glasses is not the name of the stores at hand, <br>  - Reduce the cost of purchasing and shipping. <br>  - I will carry out a detailed review of the models of glasses purchased by me and my friends, share operating experience and impressions, and also prepare photos and video materials for a more accurate presentation of this accessory and its effectiveness. <br><br><h6>  I already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/94441/">wrote</a> last year about the continuous exposure of quanta of violet and blue radiation from monitors, telephones, and other household and lighting devices.  For the eyes, the violet-blue region (shortwave) of the spectrum is the most harmful.  Daily hours-long stay at the computer does not cause the diseases that parents and doctors tell us, but the development of these same eye diseases, eye fatigue, headaches, and sleep disturbance (due to suppression of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">melatonin</a> levels in the body).  In the article I also mentioned glasses that help to deal with such problems.  About them will be discussed </h6><br><br><h1>  How I discovered GUNNAR </h1><br>  I wear glasses from childhood, and whoever talks about the effects of monitors and visual impairment - I never believed in it, I did not intend to part with my profession and understood that my whole life would be connected with computers.  The vision did not deteriorate, but the older I became and the more I worked, the less time I could spend in front of the monitor without experiencing discomfort, burning eyes and fatigue.  Working for different home / work / customers monitors, by the end of the day, the eyes began to organize a real riot, began to close by themselves, and when they tried to fight them, they began to water from any light source.  And a few years ago there was a serious question about reducing the load on the eyes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/0c7c90cb/6f136799/038ce016/c70c6f36.jpg"><br><br>  The first thoughts were the need to have an operation a la Lasic to return the standard 100% vision, but such an operation costs about 100,000 r.  on both eyes + probability of re-conducting.  To collect such an amount, it takes time, you need to continue working, which means again the day in front of the monitor, again fatigue, again drops and a limited work day.  And then I began to look for a more affordable, cheap and practical solution.  That decision turned out to be Gunnar Optiks glasses. <br><br>  I stumbled upon them by luck, roaming in the expanses of the foreign Internet for eye strain ("eye fatigue") during prolonged work.  The review was overly positive and I went deep into the study, review after review, article by article, for the most part, all authors were positive about their acquisition and strongly recommended.  They were more impressed by their design, and the product‚Äôs focus on their native high-tech audience, as the description of ‚Äú <b>Digital Performance Eyewear</b> ‚Äù shouts.  I have long been looking for stylish but simple frames for ordinary glasses, but in our market there was nothing that would cling like GUNNARS with their wide range. <br><br>  A curious point was the fact that these points, in addition to gamers (the company actively promotes its products in almost all gaming competitions in the US and Korea) and geeks, are actively used by racers, athletes and stars.  Of the latter, 50 cents were observed, the stars of the series Heroes, and Barney Stinson of HIMM. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5f66ddbf/667e5111/de7d5dd9/b0f4709e.jpg"><br><br>  Since the glasses are designed for all people of the digital era (the company focuses specifically on gamers and computer scientists), and not just those who have vision problems.  In its katabatic state, the lenses of the glasses are ordinary (without diopters) made using a special i-AMP technology, which gives the glasses full value.  And to order dioptric glasses, which have recently been produced by the world-famous Carl Zeiss company with this technology is possible only in laboratories and from RX retailers located in America, Italy and Germany.  Then I decided to order Gunnar glasses, and use them with contact lenses. <br><br><h1>  Manufacturer and technology </h1><br>  <b>GUNNAR Optiks</b> is a technology company that seeks to enhance the ability of the human visual system.  GUNNAR glasses are specially designed to provide a person with optical and visual advantages in work, games and everyday life in the shortest possible time. <br><br><h2>  What functions do points </h2><br><ul><li>  Increase visual resolution. </li><li>  Increase contrast. </li><li>  Increase clarity and clarity </li><li>  Neutralize bright and reflected light. </li><li>  Relieve eye fatigue </li><li>  Maintain a moist microclimate around the eyes. </li><li>  Neutralize the feeling of dry eyes </li><li>  Increase efficiency, productivity.  and visual acuity. </li></ul><br><br><h2>  Technology </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/900f8807/c955867e/0e1ab2e6/b74c4222.jpg"><br><br>  i-AMP technology is the result of intensive research into the human optical system and its interaction with digital devices.  According to the company improves the properties of the human eye.  The lenses consist of a patented material, have an advanced geometry and are equipped with a special coating and shade. <br><br>  <b>The I-AMP technology includes:</b> <br>  <b>1. Lens material</b> - <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/technology/technology_lensmaterial.php">diAMIX</a> <br>  <b>2. Geometry of the lens</b> - <a href="http://www.gunnars.com/technology/technology_lensgeometry.php">fRACTYL</a> : Designed using computer algorithms, it creates a microclimate around the eyes while keeping moisture and prevents evaporation by air currents. <br><ul><li>  Neoscopic fit for comfortable viewing at close range. </li><li>  Transcopic fit for comfortable viewing over any distance. </li></ul>  <b>3. Multi-level i-FI lens coating</b> : Filters the transmitted light and protects the lenses: <ul><li>  Anti-glare reduces glare and distracting stray light. </li><li>  Hydrophobic reduces the number of drops from water to the lenses to a minimum. </li><li>  Oleophobic protects against smudging and fingerprints. </li></ul>  Secured with a hard coating that reduces wear and minimizes scratches. <br><br>  <b>4. Shades of lenses - iONIC</b> : <b>GUNNAR</b> laboratory using spectrophotometry studied the visible and invisible parts of the light spectrum in different lighting conditions.  And to balance the load on the eyes, combinations of iONik shades and i-FI coatings were used in the lenses.  Which, depending on the wavelength, light conditions, strengthen or weaken the amount of energy that passes into a person‚Äôs eyes, while increasing their overall performance <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2b932212/45bc2884/3528edb6/b86c5616.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, if you look at the glasses in different conditions from the side, they visually manifest themselves in different ways, and in some cases seem completely invisible (during the day in the sunlight, only faces and nose are visible, glasses are not visible at all), in others on the contrary dark amber.  Glare and reflections are also different, usually purple from the screens, greenish from the sky.  Reflections aesthetically looks very beautiful and diverse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4b98c3bb/b8935018/59b5bec1/93f47053.jpg"><br><br>  The company has a large range of frames, there are strict, athletic, stylish, youth, and female form factors.  In addition to computer, there are sunglasses and 3D glasses, but with them I had neither the experience nor the desire for knowledge, so we will not consider them. <br><br>  Conventionally, the model range is as follows: <br>  * Ruler - Model <br><blockquote>  Sphere - Halogen <br>  Catalyst - <b>Edge</b> , Bit Surfer, Shredder, <b>Wi-Five</b> , Groove <br>  Metallic - Weezer, Rocket, Ombre, Marley, Sheadog <br>  Attache - Phenom, Emissary, Pipeline, Metropole <br>  eSPORT - PPK, Paralex, N Querry </blockquote><br><br>  Read more tomorrow. <br><br>  <b>UPD: The</b> topic is not advertising, the author of the article, like his colleagues, bought points for their own money.  The company is not represented in the territory of the Russian Federation and the CIS.  The reason for the positive feedback is the lack of analog products, and extremely favorable experience of owning this accessory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1c6e47e8/71f1b4e0/20fd464c/e1eb52eb.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, some girls: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/67fe893c/cb13d2e0/5ff397ff/be128942.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6a0e0357/ae695e32/e284b576/652536a2.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/c2a4dd46/79d4fe36/774ce5b2/aa6bc9ae.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121142/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121142/</a></p>
