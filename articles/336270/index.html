There was recently posted <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336092/">material about Xored</a> , as a result of which broke holivar, which rarely happens. <br><br>  In order to balance the positions and understand that the truth is always somewhere in the middle, you cannot miss Platov‚Äôs comments on this topic.  Since  no one deliberately gets to the site to him anyway, then the last punch of this battle will unfairly remain for nonnames.

      Because the response punch is simply obliged to appear here, at least for balance.  So what was it? <br><br>  WHAT IT WAS (authorship of the text - Andrey Platov himself) <br><br>  For a long time we did not believe that the unprecedented harassment of Xored on the net was someone‚Äôs order.  Cui prodest? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Far and close people, having and having no relation to IT, said that this was someone's order.  I could not believe that this is not just a mass madness, that it is beneficial to someone.  That, in general, an insignificant information occasion can make journalists sit online all night, collecting information and calling friends and strangers.  For three days we fought windmills. <br><br>  We tell that it was, and the main hero of the occasion, let's call him Marcus Brutus.  Marcus led two teams at Xored, who worked for some large business unit business unit.  It so happened that the reader already knows about the flamethrower Platov, who since April has been burning out an alien culture within the company, making things transparent, and so on and so forth.  By July, we had successfully cleared most of the company, and our hands reached the Marcus teams. <br><br>  Brutus was the last outpost covering these commands from the flamethrower.  Poorly reasoned resistance to changes in the company, threats to quit and strong (bordering on stupidity) support of Brutus by the customer (he is a very talented communicator) did not allow us to start working with these teams.  In addition, Brutus is the main distributor in the company of negativity about recent changes, a brief squeeze of which can be found in Brutus's post, 1C is also mentioned there (why further). <br><br>  The teams were almost not integrated into the company.  The fact is that most of these people hired Brutus, nobody knew them outside the teams, a typical office in the office.  July 19 Brutus unexpectedly reports that he leaves the company for personal reasons.  Leaves the country, will be engaged in family affairs, etc., etc., etc.  And really some time traveling.  Since August, does not appear in the company, works from home, and actively communicates with the customer and the team. <br><br>  Fondly believing that Brutus is really leaving, we are trying to start working with the Brutus teams, but we meet with resistance from the customer, which requires only one thing - stability until the end of release (October).  Now events begin to develop rapidly: <br><br>  On Friday, August 11, I ask the team whether the team is ready to leave Xored and if we have points for integration.  The team says it's ready to leave, and I isolate it from the Xored processes.  I plan to find out if the customer can change his point of view and give a blank check for the team's review and integration into Xored, otherwise let him take it for himself (opens a branch, whatever).  I'm not going to stupidly sell people, despite the fact that the customer is satisfied - Xored was not made to stupidly drive the loot between the customer and the programmer. <br><br>  On Monday, August 14, Marcus suddenly appears and asks for 10 minutes of my audience - he is interested in what I have in mind.  I honestly said that if the team does not become part of Xored, then let them become part of the customer.  Marcus was slightly shocked, muttered something, saying that they were people, and if the customer fell off, they would need work.  There were no prerequisites for the customer to fall off.  Later, people from the team come up to me who have changed their point of view - they are treating the benefits of integrating with Xored by Marcus. <br><br>  Tuesday, August 15, I declare to the customer, or they work with the company (Xored), or let them take these commands for themselves - I don‚Äôt need them. <br><br>  Wednesday, August 16th.  Marcus unexpectedly leaves the company, although he planned to hang out until the end of August.  The legend is the same: they say to rest, ride. <br><br>  Thursday, August 17th.  The first mistake of Marcus: in the open source project of a small Novosibirsk company, there are 3 commits from the real name of Marcus.  We will find out later.  Marcus did not go anywhere, he remained at his side in the company of his friend. <br><br>  This company is unique in three things: <br><br><ol><li>  It consists mainly of former employees Xored and some may harbor a grudge against me. </li><li>  Some of these guys worked on the customer. </li><li>  Most of these guys have relevant experience, allowing you to instantly pick up customer projects, and pull projects out of a possible crisis. </li></ol><br>  It remains to create a crisis. <br><br>  Friday, August 18th.  Adam's post appears that Xored is the crappy place to work.  Such a playground has never seen before.  All rules of the site are violated and the site closes eyes to it.  Purpose: to discredit the company in the eyes of _otrudnikov_.  Marcus needs employees to run.  An incomprehensible red thread tells me that the employees will run (I don‚Äôt understand why they should run, but the message is sent from all sides).  Once again I remind you that the post appeared a couple of months after the events with Adam. <br><br>  The battle continues until Sunday evening of August 20th.  On Sunday, I drop the atomic bomb, the atmosphere in the office is victorious, the staff are not going to run away (en masse). <br><br>  Monday 21st August  Adam's theme does not subside.  According to all the laws of the genre, it should die down, but the media is connected.  Journalists vc.ru attack everyone all Monday and Tuesday night.  I offer them very interesting topics, but they are interested in Adam's.  The article should make Xored employees run from the company. <br><br>  Monday evening, August 21st.  Marcus (or the person who introduced himself as Marcus) writes a post on Habr.  Post hangs in the top for almost a day, breaking the rules of the site.  Obviously, she is involved in this.  In the post, the words (fairly seasoned with lies) bear the same negative that Marcus carried while working within the company.  The goal is the same, plus strengthening the attack from the other flank (Adam's left to journalists).  Plus mention 1C.  Purpose: to try to force 1C to remove me from the leadership post. <br><br>  Tuesday morning, August 22  I understand that this will not end.  I am ready to accept fate and post a post saying that I am ready to be crucified. <br><br>  Marcus writes me a message that everything will be fine and that you have to hold on.  RedCat is surprised at the reasons for such an attack, recalls the time it takes to split projects.  S.L.  notes that Monday's post is written on behalf of Marcus Brutus - it should be near.  A.S.  reports that Marcus has not gone anywhere and is working as a programmer.  I inform the company that Marcus has deceived them a little.  Marcus almost instantly learns about it and writes me something unintelligible.  On the question of who he is working with now, he answers evasively. <br><br>  The puzzle begins to converge with amazing accuracy.  I write quite messy, and I need a few hours to describe everything calmly. <br><br>  Those who wonder why it is so difficult, I will answer: ‚ÄúXored‚Äù is a very reliable partner.  We have been working with this customer for 10 years.  Marcus‚Äôs no charisma is enough to lead a customer away from us.  He needed a crisis to do this.  Preferably before the release, but the flamethrower hurried events.  I thought why Adam was silent for so long.  Marcus was waiting for the moment to use Adam's to create a crisis.  The ideal option for them was to arrange a crisis shortly before the release, in order to have time to throw the lifeline: a ready-made team, able to pick up and save the project. <br><br>  The second mistake of Marcus: on Sunday afternoon, one of the employees calls me and says the memorized text: I‚Äôm not interested in working with you because of Adam.  If the customer team will be independent ... Here I send it to *% d and hang up.  Now I understand that he had to be a spark, the first to run away. <br><br>  But Xored persevered.  Xored - forever. <br>  Details without welter will be later. <br><br>  Until, <br>  Platov and colleagues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336270/</a></p>
