It's time to share your impressions! <br><br>  About the balance of life and work <br>  Vladimir Gorbunov, General Director of <a href="https://www.workle.ru/t/hab9_rif_main">Workle</a> , presented the presentation “Workle - the first Internet employer” within <a href="http://2012.russianinternetforum.ru/prog/">the “Personnel” section</a> .  The first part of the section was devoted to a review of the labor market, wages and demand for IT specialists, and the second part was held under the slogan work &amp; life balance.  The question of how to maintain a balance between life and work was very relevant for all participants of the event.  Workle put an end to the dispute <b>"Career goals vs personal life"</b> , opening the opportunity to work and earn money in a free schedule, earning an official income. <br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D1%8B-%D0%98%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82.bmp" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Vladimir said that Workle was created in order to meet the needs of business and consumers.  Our users can work where there is Internet by offering products from Workle partner companies.  The latter, in turn, are given the opportunity to create an unlimited staff of remote specialists - Workle independent consultants.

      Olga Manannikova, Director of Marketing and PR HeadHunter Group, was the moderator and participant of the section.  Olga made a presentation on the <b>“Labor Market in the Internet”</b> and outlined figures that proved that the World Wide Web has become not only a means but also a place of employment.  Over the year, the number of vacancies on the Internet has grown by 85%, and every 17th vacancy on the labor market is from the Internet. <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/%D0%A0%D0%98%D0%A4+%D0%9A%D0%98%D0%91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About why all startups in Russia are hungry <br><br>  No conference “RIF + CIB” is complete without presentations of startups.  Vladimir Gorbunov made a presentation <b>“When is your investor Skolkovo”</b> .  Pros and cons of mutual love. "  Workle not only declared itself as a bright and promising startup, but also shared its achievements, because now we can confidently talk about success. <br><br>  At the last conference, our mentor Anton Nosik in the section <b>“How to build a“ dream company ”</b> presented the report <b>“ The dream team - the crowd ”</b> .  It was about the "corporation of users", which allows you to learn and build a career directly on the web.  Today, at RIF + KIB-2012, Vladimir Gorbunov summed up the work of Workle for the year and outlined what role our investor, the Skolkovo innovation center, played in the development of the project.  According to Vladimir, the best definition for a Russian startup is “a hungry startup.” <br><br>  The development of the project "from scratch" is a situation where financial support plays a crucial role.  That is why one of the key issues is raising funds: <b>“It’s not easier to get money from investors for the development of a startup in Russia than to get pity from the Devil</b> ,” Vladimir said.  However, Workle proved by his own example that nothing is impossible, the main thing is to focus on achieving the goal. <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/%D0%A0%D0%98%D0%A4-%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80-%D0%93%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B1%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When asked how the promotion of a startup begins, Vladimir replies with a smile: “Make a list of all investment funds that have their own pages on the Internet, buy coffee and power engineers and start methodically calling one company after another.”  In every joke, as you know, there is a grain of truth, and in our case this proportion is not small.  The fact is that in Russia SEED investments are practically not developed (“seed” investments).  “Seriously,” Vladimir continues, “the main principle of a startup development is the need to tell everyone about the project.  For startups, the rule of three Fs applies: the initial funds are taken from three sources - family, friends and fools.  So, a startup must use all three channels. ”  Money is needed, above all, to create a product, attract a team, scale up a business and conduct a marketing campaign.  Financial and informational support from the state helps us in the popularization of remote work.  Having become a resident of the Skolkovo innovation city, we received the opportunity to cooperate with domestic and foreign IT industry experts. <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/outfoto/habr/st9/1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to the conference, Workle took part in the exhibition held as part of the RIF + CIB.  At our booth, participants in the event could get not only answers to all their questions, but also funny stickers that will remind you that Workle makes Internet work accessible to everyone! <br><br><img src="http://iworkle.ru/outfoto/habr/st9/2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As part of participation in the RIF + CIB exhibition, we received a lot of proposals for creating new professions.  The most frequently proposed option was the “online advertising sales manager”.  In this case, the <b>largest players in the Internet sphere can become Workle partners</b> - a wide scope for choice and action.  By the way, ideas on partnership and the creation of new professions are accepted at market@workle.net.
