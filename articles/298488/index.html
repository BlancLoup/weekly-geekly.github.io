Tell us about your work experience. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> You can say that I have 20 years of professional experience.  I have been cooking since 7 years old.  When my mother went to work, I warmed myself a pizza in the microwave. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> OK, but something from more recent practice.

      <b>Applicant:</b> The last three months I worked in a barbecue at Ashot.  Engaged in sharp meat.  This, of course, is not French cuisine, but I got a very rewarding experience with the barbecue.  And in cutting meat, I am a specialist in general - I cut pork in such a way that none of the visitors could distinguish it from lamb. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Brazier is very interesting, but in our restaurant a stove and oven are used for cooking. Do you know how to work with the oven? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Of course, this is much easier than with a brazier, coal is not needed - set the temperature and that's it. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> We have sophisticated modern equipment. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Do not worry, I saw a cool oven at a neighbor's house - there, of course, there are three regulators, but anyone who knows how to work with barbecues will cope with the oven without difficulty. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Well, you cut the meat for a kebab.  Can you make minced meat? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> As I said before - in cutting meat, I am a top class specialist.  I can make any stuffing with a knife. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But we use meat grinders for making minced meat. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> What are you, meat grinders - this is for lamers.  No self-respecting cook will not use the meat grinder.  After all, so you can lose all the skills with the knife.  Yes, your cook will die of hunger if tomorrow you have to go to the woods for kebabs. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, owning a knife is very important for a cook.  Your resume says that you attended a roll-making workshop, but what about your professional education? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> I studied at the culinary college, but I quit - it's a waste of time.  While the students were sitting in pants, I was gaining professional experience.  Real experience is much more useful than this whole theory.  Well, what can this college teach?  The local teachers are dinosaurs, they have not been engaged in real work for a hundred years. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Also in your resume it is indicated that you are a winner in the competition of culinary skill.  Tell us about it in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Oh, that was really cool.  There were several nominations at the competition - high-speed cooking of scrambled eggs, cutting lettuce, uncorking bottles and others.  I won the nomination for breaking eggs.  In one minute I smashed 118 eggs into a skillet.  It was also the second in the nomination for cutting cheese. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, cheese is very good.  This is an important element of French cuisine.  What french dishes can you cook best? <br><br>  <b>Job seeker:</b> I already talked about pizza <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But ... <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> You are not surprised - you just work in the old fashioned way, now the French cuisine is actively developing and modernizing.  When I was in France - there are pizzerias on every corner.  So French cuisine without pizza is simply unthinkable. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, you are right, but, nevertheless, something more traditional? <br><br>  <b>Job seeker:</b> Once I cooked onion soup.  In general, I made potato, but I decided to take onions instead of potatoes - it‚Äôs also round.  And you know, it turned out to be a great onion soup - it had such a flavor ... So I can well consider myself an expert on this dish. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> How was the soup? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Well, I'm a cook, not a taster.  Let the tasters and taste. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> In our restaurant, the cook always does the first test. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Do you work without a tasting department?  Yes, is it possible to provide a quality product if there are no tasters. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Tasters we have, but they are connected only for the final sample of the entire dinner.  And some dishes try the chefs. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> This will need to change.  Connecting tasters at an early stage will significantly improve the quality of dishes.  After all, tasters are much more experienced in trying than cooks. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Great, and what meat dishes do you cook? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> My grandmother also taught me to cook meat in French.  This is our traditional family recipe.  I am sure that in France no one knows how to make meat in French as much as I do. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Could you write a recipe? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> In my opinion, writing recipes on a piece of paper is a mockery of a candidate.  I used to hold a knife, not a pen.  What is the point of writing recipes?  How can this be useful in the real work of a cook?  You will not feed customers recipes. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> But you have to somehow transfer knowledge, share experience. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> This is let the waiters write.  Their task is to understand the requirements of the client and articulate them clearly.  A cook - must cook. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> What are your cooking skills? <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> You know, I believe that individual chefs should deal with desserts.  Of course, there are full-stack chefs who cook everything from an aperitif to dessert, but you know perfectly well that the quality is disgusting.  So you can not do.  We need a clear division of labor.  Do not your restaurant understand the importance of this?  What kind of cooking techniques do you use? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Do not worry, we have a modern restaurant and we use the best international practices. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> What is your schedule? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer: The</b> restaurant is open from 12 to 24 hours.  Cooks come to work at 11 to get ready for dinner. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> I, of course, got used to free graphics, but do you have the opportunity to work remotely? <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> This is not accepted in our restaurant. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> But in other restaurants this is practiced.  I think you should think about it.  But now it is, of course, not a matter of principle. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Good.  We have a few more candidates;  we will contact you when we make a decision. <br><br>  <b>Applicant:</b> Just do not pull for too long.  I have an offer from a restaurant in Paris and I have to give them an answer.  The work there is, of course, interesting, but I would not want to move to Paris from Mytishchi. <br><br>  <b>Interviewer:</b> Yes, we will call you tomorrow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298488/</a></p>
