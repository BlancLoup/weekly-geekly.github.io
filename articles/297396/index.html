For 5 years we have been developing and supporting the online service of Parental Control <a href="http://kidlogger.net/%3Flang%3Dru">KidLogger.net</a> .  To date, he helps 300 thousand parents to monitor how their children use computers and smartphones.  Based on this well-established technology, we decided to create a corporate service for small business StaffCounter.

      This is a fully automated time tracking system that measures employee performance based on a detailed analysis of his computer activities. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.staffcounter.net/ru/">StaffCounter</a> is unique in that it provides the most necessary things to control employees for free.  And for managers who really need to receive complete statistics and make decisions based on reports, there is a full-fledged service for evaluating productivity and working time accounting.  This helps in cases where these reports are used to optimize business processes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Free employee control</b> <br><br>  As practice shows, the majority of our clients use StaffCounter only to control employees.  And this means that comprehensive analytics, counting of time, reports on numerous metrics are simply not needed by them.  The service is used as a psychological factor for employees, so that they understand that their work will not be ignored, even when the manager is absent. <br><br>  Taking into account this experience, we decided to offer a free service for monitoring employees at the computer.  Its functions are sufficient for the awareness of the activities of employees to those who, more than additional control, do not expect such a service.  The decision not to take money for this came after we calculated how much each free client costs us, and we realized that we can afford it.  In addition, it is just more honest with customers who simply do not use additional features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/df3/1ff/ff0df31ff2414337b0e72d492bf763cb.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Time tracking and productivity measurement</b> <br>  This service is for those who need detailed time tracking, statistics and automatic analysis of staff performance.  The productivity measurement tool works completely autonomously, without requiring any participation from the manager.  It is enough to spend 10 minutes to set up and specify which categories of programs and sites are productive and which are unproductive. <br><br>  <b>Automatic violation notifications</b> <br>  StaffCounter can independently verify productivity reports, saving manager time.  The service is provided with notifications about the following violations: the share of unproductive or unknown sites and applications was more than 50% per working day;  the employee did not come to work.  You do not even need to log into your account at StaffCounter.  Just pay attention to the notice. <br><br>  <b>Security and Data Protection</b> <br>  We pay special attention to corporate information security, so we publish the open source code of our products.  Everything in the program is absolutely transparent, we use open standards for the safe transfer and storage of data.  Only the name of the window or process is transmitted to the server, and never a full link to a specific document or page on the site. <br><br>  The service also ensures the confidentiality of personal data (passwords, accounts), personal correspondence and any other typed text, does not record audio and video.  Technique issued by the employer, of course, is designed to work, but we do not approve of interference with privacy. <br><br>  In the following publications we plan to tell about this: <br>  - as we thought, how many free clients can we have on our Dell PowerEdge R730 server; <br>  - experiments with monitoring Android smarfonov <br>  - how did the promotion of the KidLogger.net for Android service affect its removal from the PlayStore, etc. <br><br>  We will be glad to hear your opinion.  And if you are a leader, share your experience or case study. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297396/</a></p>
