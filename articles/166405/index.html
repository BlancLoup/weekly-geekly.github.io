There are plenty of previous versions of information on the internet, including on the official website of laptop manufacturers.  For the eight at the time of purchase and, in fact, the manipulation of the return of any information was not found. <br><br>  Anticipating comments like "why buy a car without wheels, etc ..." I will immediately explain myself: I am constantly asked questions on this topic, we will consider this topic to be something like testing the return system in my own skin. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Introduction </h1><br>  All of the following actions were carried out with the laptop Acer V5-171-533 <a href="">(J.Market)</a> , the procedure and the amount of payments may vary from different manufacturers.

      To get started, let's take a look at the article <a href="http://www.acer.ru/ac/ru/RU/content/reimbursement">‚ÄúReturning the cost of the MS Windows OS family‚Äù</a> on the manufacturer‚Äôs official website.  As you can see (at the time of writing), there is no data on Windows 8.  I was not responded to the letter specified in the e-mail article, although more than 2 weeks have passed. <br><br>  In the reviews on the market (link above) we come across the comment of the buyer <i>shulepovc</i> from January 17, 2013 <blockquote>  when trying to make a refund for the pre-installed win8 - the service center refused reciprocity, there is still no return program for win8 ( </blockquote>  Sales are already there, but the program is not invented?  There is a violation of Article 11, Part 1, Clause 5 of the Law on Protection of Competition (for details in the <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2006/07/27/zaschita-konkurencii.html">WG</a> ).  We decide to check everything on our own skin and, in the event of a negative result, have official documents on refusal on our hands for further actions. <br><br><h1>  Buying a laptop </h1><br>  So, we take the laptop from the store.  Be sure to open the box and remove the warranty card from the inside.  It is packed in polyethylene along with instructions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/02d/8a0/1a1/02d8a01a1caa0bb3466002d7eb41ca6e.jpg"><br>  Looks like a little brochure in several languages.  Ask the seller to fill out the card and put all the necessary seals and stamps.  <u>Without filling out this card, the SC has the right to refuse to return the OS.</u> <br><br>  It is advisable not to turn on the laptop, because when you first start, there is an initial preparation of the OS for use, which takes considerable time and is absolutely not necessary for us.  Moreover, when you first start Windows asks to accept the terms of the license agreement. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f04/24d/285/f0424d285cae88c7ea3a2e55fdc55819.jpg"><br>  In no case should this be done.  <u>The SC will again fail if you have already agreed and activated your copy.</u> <br><br>  Also be sure to have a sticker on the bottom cover of the laptop.  Instead of the usual pink label certificate of authenticity now uses a sticker of genuine software, a description of which can be found on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ru-ru/howtotell/Hardware.aspx">Microsoft</a> website. <br><img src="http://www.microsoft.com/global/en-us/howtotell/PublishingImages/GenuineMSLabels.gif" alt="image"><br>  The key itself is flashed into the BIOS, which I was able to find out after putting the laptop in <a href="http://acer-ru.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27436/~/%25D0%259E%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25D2%25D1%2583%25D0%25D5%25D1%2582-%25D0%25DD%25D0%25D0%25D0%25DA%25D0%25DB%25D0%25D5%25D0%25D9%25D0%25DA%25D0%25D0-%25D1%2581%25D0%25D5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25D8%25D1%2584%25D0%25D8%25D0%25DA%25D0%25D0%25D1%2582%25D0%25D0-%25D0%25DF%25D0%25DE%25D0%25D4%25D0%25DB%25D0%25D8%25D0%25DD%25D0%25DD%25D0%25DE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25D8-windows">here</a> . <br><br><h1>  Visit service center </h1><br>  You can return the OS within a month from the date of purchase by contacting the service center of Acer's retail partner, if you bought a laptop from him, or to an authorized service center, which in my case is the R-Style Service ( <a href="http://www.acer.ru/ac/ru/RU/content/service-centers">list of SOs in Russia</a> ). <br><br>  We take with us in the SC a guarantee card, a laptop itself and checks (or other payment documents confirming the fact of purchase).  In my opinion, it is better to bring the entire box directly from the store to avoid unnecessary questions. <br><br>  After the paperwork is issued, a receiving coupon is issued, according to which number you can track the execution of the application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ae/ceb/935/4aeceb93545a5ba088d9e9ab4206eff4.jpg"><br>  The approximate formatting time is hard, which is the return procedure, as I was told in the SC, - one or two days. <br><br><h1>  Second visit to the service center </h1><br>  In fact, the procedure was delayed for almost a month, therefore, taking this opportunity, I say hello to the ‚Äúengineers‚Äù of the SC mentioned above.  The laptop was returned without a sticker, with a pristine hard and money.  True, in the UEFI mode, the laptop refused to start due to the lack of a ‚Äúbootable device‚Äù.  If you tell in the comments how to set the boot record of the currently installed Windows 7 x64 in the boot manager, I would be grateful.  Now I use the Legacy BIOS mode. <br><br><h1>  Results </h1><br>  If you do not mind spending time on trips to the service center and there is no burning desire to start using the toy you just purchased, you can try the return procedure.  Acer'a technical support wrote that the amount of compensation is 1080 rubles.  That was the amount I was given back.  There is not a word about this on the site, although as follows from the letter, the procedure is similar to the previous editions: <br><blockquote>  In case of refusal to use the pre-installed Windows OS, you can receive, in the manner and on the terms established by this (http://www.acer.ru/ac/ru/RU/RU/content/reimbursement) Program, monetary compensation in the amount of: <br><br>  For Vista Home Premium, Win 7 Home Premium, Win 8 <br>  1 080 rub </blockquote><br><br><h1>  Links </h1><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.acer.ru/ac/ru/RU/content/reimbursement">Acer</a> official website </li><li>  Federal Law of the Russian Federation of July 26, 2006 N 135- ‚ÄúOn Protection of Competition‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2006/07/27/zaschita-konkurencii.html">publication</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/125285/">Post</a> from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/narical/" class="user_link">Narical</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/125674/">continued</a> </li><li>  Sandbox <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/sandbox/41683/">article</a> </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166405/</a></p>
