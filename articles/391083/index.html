  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell at Mobile World Congress: preparing for the IoT era, modular data centers, OEM solutions and a secure tablet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Watching the visitors of the Dell booth at the Mobile World Congress, it was easy to determine - who knows the real situation in modern IT, and who live with old ideas about it.  The latter twisted their heads in bewilderment: where are the gadgets?  Connoisseurs, in turn, studied solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT), data centers of the new generation, tools for virtualizing network functions (NFV) and servers for telecom operators already thinking about switching to 5G.  Although the gadgets, of course, were also. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b10/87b/64d/b1087b64da7440c089208cc76158cfde.jpg"><br><br>  Already a few years ago, the description of Dell's comprehensive integrated solutions, from hardware and software systems for telecom operators to special effects creation tools for Hollywood film studios, made a strong impression.  Today, despite a very wide range of business and entertainment equipment, Dell is a real service company.  Perhaps even more service than some business colleagues who officially call themselves such. <a name="habracut"></a>

Smartphones, smart watches, fitness trackers - all this, of course, is there, although the tablets this year have drastically decreased.  They say they are no longer in demand, because from the bottom they are supported by smartphones with a large screen, and from above - 2-in-1 devices and lightweight laptops.  But much more participants and guests were worried about something completely different.  For example, the Internet of things, the standards associated with it, and the necessary infrastructure.  The networks of the fifth generation (5G), which will surprise us not so much with speed as with the ability to provide with communication an order of magnitude more diverse devices.  The trendy virtual reality theme will increase the volume of content transmitted over networks, and although at this stage VR is making only tentative steps to the masses, now it is necessary to think about how to quickly increase the amount of data with minimal costs.  There is no escape from the topic of information security, because as digital services are digitized, the number of attacks grows, and every new device in a home or office network is a potential breach.  After all, even a very secure door by default is less resistant to burglary than a monolithic wall. <br><br>  Dell at MWC 2016 helped find answers to the challenges of the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/52e/537/75652e53778b4a96a1579b1bcb82fa6b.jpg"><br><br>  So, Dell showed the Dell Edge Gateway 5000 Series Gateway, specially tailored to work with IoT.  There are a lot of gateways at various levels in the Dell portfolio, and they help collect, secure, and process sensor data at the edge of the network.  The company says its solution is an alternative to current expensive proprietary solutions.  Edge Gateway 5000 Series is based on the Intel platform and can run on any operating system to choose a customer: Ubuntu Snappy, Wind River Linux or Windows 10 IoT Enterprise.  Remote management can be done using Dell Command | Monitor for Linux and / or Dell Cloud Client Manager.  Third-party tools such as SAP, OSIsoft, Eigen Innovations and Lucid can be used to analyze the collected data.  Taking into account the use of energy-efficient Intel Atom E3800 processor, this is a truly practical and flexible solution.  The ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù does not generate much traffic.  But the sheer number of devices easily "puts" an unprepared infrastructure. <br><br>  Of course, the Internet gateway is only one of the elements of the network upgrade.  At different stages: data acquisition, transportation, aggregation, analysis, and use - Dell offers its technologies and solutions.  Among them, a special role is played by the cloud service Dell Boomi, which allows to transfer various business applications to the cloud, and the scale of the business itself does not play a special role, everyone will find their own use.  Also worth mentioning are the smart Dell Sonicwall firewalls, the Dell Force 10 network platforms, the Dell Storage network storage and many (indeed many!) Other products and services hailing from Texas. <br><br>  The epoch of IoT has not yet begun, but there is almost no doubt about its occurrence.  When the surveillance cameras start to ‚Äútalk‚Äù with the gate directly, and the refrigerator starts talking to the electric furnace and the online store, it does not seem to everyone: the offices, the households, and the operators.  Better not to wait for this moment. <br><br>  Another important topic raised by Dell at Mobile World Congress is modular solutions for data centers.  The centers used to build, as they say, not for centuries.  Data volumes were growing too fast, which required constant modernization.  But today not only volumes, but also, shall we say, quality requirements for data are growing.  It is not enough to simply accept and transfer / save them, more and more often real-time analysis is required, and no one, frankly, knows what requirements will appear in a couple of years.  Therefore, the equipment for data centers should be not only powerful, reliable and energy efficient (these are quite obvious things), but also easily replaceable, based on current tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/ba7/044/1daba7044e6540169e2fdc3b0b5b7238.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e87/5df/97b/e875df97b2c3465aa823783226f09963.jpg"><br><br>  At MWC, Dell showed the DSS 9000 - a platform for telecom operators, where modules with storage media can easily be replaced by compute.  And vice versa.  Actually, the number of modules and their proportion can be determined by the user.  The compute modules use Intel dual-socket motherboards with 16 RAM slots each. <br><br>  In some cases, Dell is ready to refuse to place products on its own brand, losing this honor to its partner.  <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-us/work/learn/oem-industry-solutions">OEMs at the corporation</a> offer a nearly complete range of Dell products without a logo, but with proprietary support.  Dell has extensive experience working with OEMs in different countries, and now she is ready to act as such.  Offering not only experience, but also responsibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/224/c73/a1d/224c73a1d692410fb4656e7887b91a2f.jpg"><br><br>  And, of course, not without consumer products.  Fans of extreme travel, as well as parents with young children with interest studied Latitude 12 Rugged Tablet - a tablet on the Intel Core M in a secure case.  It can be dropped, used in cold and heat, and, judging by the strength of the structure, the tablet can easily be repulsed from small predators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/639/3c2/08e/6393c208e49a42afa3bb8e1370efdb65.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eca/d7a/df8/ecad7adf888d4ac6bb1209da5bac9717.jpg"><br><br>  The Latitude 14 7000 family switched to 6th generation Intel Core processors, which added battery life and performance.  It used to be one of the most successful business ultrabooks on the market, but there is no limit to perfection.  Interestingly, the new Latitude 14 7000 can be supplied with a license of Windows 7 Professional, and the user will decide for himself whether to use the classics or still switch to Windows 10. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77a/93b/d86/77a93bd86a2549f7835a0713039fb05d.jpg"><br><br>  Ponorhel with the transition to the 6th generation of Intel Core and the world's smallest 13-inch ultrabook, Dell XPS 13. Now the battery life (sparingly, but running mode) has grown to 18 hours.  By the way, a number of modern Dell laptops acquired USB-C ports, without losing even more familiar versions along the way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/982/d33/494982d33a884b99a8d381c9851f64b4.jpg"><br><br>  Mobile World Congress this year was almost entirely about the future.  Everyone tried to grope exactly how it would be.  On what it will be possible to earn money, where to lay straws. <br><br>  Dell is ready to help in all areas. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391083/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391083/</a></p>
