  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Task management system Track Task</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear audience Habrahabra.  I would like to present you a fresh product in the form of an online service in the field of project and task management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cd/976/66c/0cd97666c9774fc5a284eeb7d6d994c8.png"><br><br>  About functionality: projects, tasks, comments, statuses for projects and tasks, priorities for tasks, attaching files to tasks, differentiating access rights within a project, user profile, email notifications, Skype notification, user types, administration, statistics and the most the main thing is the ability to measure the time of the task execution with automatic calculation of cost by adjustable parameters.  You can also connect the LiqPay API from Privat Bank to receive payment for completed unpaid tasks on your bank card.  LiqPay works directly with your card, Track Task does not take any commissions, it just works as a tool.

      To call him another bike somehow will not be entirely correct, although some people have such thoughts.  This service was originally written for its needs, since all existing services were without the required functionality and (or) were very difficult to work with, without the necessary functions and features.  Let's look at everything in order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To work in the system, you must first register.  But what about now without it?) You need to invent and choose a free login.  It will be used as a subdomain of your copy of the system (for example, * .track-task.com).  You also need to specify your work email address and password.  A link will come to your mail with the activation of your account and it will also install the copy of your system. <br><br>  Unfortunately, at the moment there is no demo version of Track Task.  It is planned and will soon be available to everyone with a fully working functionality. <br><br>  There are two types of users in the system, the main and the regular user.  The only difference is that the main user is a super administrator.  Other users can also be administrators, but they do not have the privileges to remove the super admin.  Each user can have their own role.  For example: a user, developer, tester, translator, customer or system administrator.  The user role determines the access rights to some functionality of your copy of the system. <br><br>  In the copy of the system it is impossible to just register and register.  New users enter the system by inviting them by e-mail.  This is done using any system administrator.  Or you can simply create a new user, tell him the link to your copy of the system, email address and password. <br><br>  Immediately after logging in, you get to the console page (Dashboard).  Which serves for operational orientation on all projects and tasks.  This is a kind of filter by task status. <br><br>  The main menu for the administrator consists of the following items: console, comments, projects, my profile, administration, exit.  For all other users, the same thing without the administration element.  In general, the project itself is built on Twitter Bootstrap, only it was cut out absolutely everything that was unnecessary, that was not used.  At the same time, I wanted to save a fully working version on mobile devices, which was done.  Track Task is adapted for mobile devices and you can do everything that you do in a regular browser without any restrictions on functionality. <br><br>  Briefly, the Track Task contains the following structure: users, user access rights to projects, projects, projects - tasks, tasks - comments and files, projects - statuses, tasks - statuses and priorities. <br><br>  On the administration page, in the statistics section, a detailed log is kept for each user with the page name, user name, IP and time of the page visit.  And in the history section, a log of actions in the system is displayed, for example, creating a new project, a task, adding a new comment, attaching a file or downloading a file, etc. The administrator can see who was there and what he did at any time. <br><br>  As for the appearance, it is now possible to set a name with a description for the main page as well as change the background from white to any other picture you have uploaded.  In the future, it is planned to make more flexible customization of the appearance.  You ask, why is it necessary?  Well, please your colleagues, customers, developers with corporate identity or a pleasant New Year background for the new year :) <br><br>  The service has the ability to attach files to tasks, but everything is not so simple here.  All files are processed by the script and if the system user does not have access rights to the project, the file will not be available for download.  Needless files can not be downloaded from outside the system.  Pleasant moments in the files is that the links are permanent, the possibility of resuming.  The maximum size of the downloaded file, at the moment, should be no more than 200 MB. <br><br>  At the moment, the service is delivered completely free of charge and without any restrictions.  We promptly listen to the users of the service through the postal address (the contact form on the main site, the postal address is not published in order to avoid spam) or through the service Reformal.ru <br><br>  When introducing a new functionality, the rule is always applied - put everything into the settings and make it optional.  What if someone does not like it or not at all.  So sometimes in the settings section there are new options that allow you to enable / disable new or existing functionality.  By default, the new functionality is not included after updates. <br><br>  Service link: <a href="http://track-task.com/">track-task.com</a> <br><br>  Please write your opinions and suggestions in the comments.  Have a nice work! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198484/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198484/</a></p>
