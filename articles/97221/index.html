Chan Kim and Rene Moborna.  Certain moments remind of <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2342717/">TRIZ</a> (Theory of Inventive Problem <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2342717/">Solving</a> ), which of course was quite gratifying.  After reading a series of theses was formed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ba5/958/354/ba59583546a1a194cd4f6403c326ce88.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>0. We must move away from the competition.</b>  Competition is the main indicator of the scarlet ocean (the ocean is painted with blood from fierce competition), the higher it is, the lower the potential profit and the greater the costs.  Blue Ocean just takes away from the competition, it is possible to create your own rules and not spend energy on the fight, concentrating on the case.

      <b>1. Balance.</b>  To minimize risks, the company‚Äôs portfolio should include both representatives of the blue and red oceans, and the red ocean, despite all its minuses, can still provide a small, but steady profit, which should be used for searching and creating blue oceans. <br><br>  <b>2. At the junction of the spheres.</b>  It is necessary to carefully examine the space between the spheres, as a rule, there it is just possible to make a blue ocean.  A good example from the book is Cirque de Soleil, who took all the best from the circus and theater and created for themselves a new space without competition.  They by the way are one of the richest companies in Canada, and indeed the whole world. <br><br>  <b>3. Do not be afraid, but think.</b>  We must not be afraid to mix like immiscible.  It often happens that an approach that is poorly or ineffectively applied in one area can revolutionize another.  For example, the Ford model T nobody even thought of assembling on a conveyor with unqualified workers, because the car was a luxury of manual work at that time, and in the end, due to the conveyor, we managed to reduce the assembly time from a month to 4 days + Ford eliminated all unnecessary Essence (one model, one color) for the price of the carriage and made everyone. <br><br>  <b>4. The invention for the sake of the invention.</b>  It is also important to understand that the invention can be applied, make a business out of it, so that it does not remain an eternal prototype. <br><br>  <b>5. Search strategy.</b>  To search for a blue ocean, it is necessary to make an analytics of current industry players (or several industries at once, on one chart), finding their main points of application of resources.  For example, in the wine industry, they may be: price, use of special terminology, indirect marketing, quality of aging, history, richness of taste, assortment (X axis).  Further, it is necessary to understand who makes how much effort to these points, so you can get the curves of the strategies of competitors (Y-axis).  This graph will help you to understand where to avoid moving and, due to visualization, it is easier to understand how to work with these points further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6ef/8ad/07d/6ef8ad07daaa2bfbdede41f266be6528.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>6. Strategic outline.</b>  For a blue ocean, it is necessary to make such a curve, and with such a set of points of application of resources that it minimally or not at all intersect with competitors (above, just an example of the strategic outline of Casella Wines with the brand <a href="http://www.yellowtailwine.com/">[yellow tail]</a> ).  Or, if we are talking about the junction of spheres, we must take the best from each sphere and eliminate the superfluous. <br><br>  <b>7. Focusing.</b>  Each strategy should have a focus on something concrete, which is put in the center and to which maximum efforts are made, which are already pulling the rest.  For example, in model T it was accessibility for the widest possible masses.  The focus essentially reflects the motto of the company or one of the businesses, and the motto should be as clear as possible and without different interpretations. <br><br>  <b>8. This is very interesting.</b>  Especially steep blue ocean can be obtained when the resources are very small and we need to think about their dual use, about combining.  For starters, you can try a simple brute force, this alone can give good ideas, because before that nobody has tried it, did not try to look at this resource from this side.  Business in the direction of the blue ocean is like a good old school quest. <br><br>  <b>9. Implementation and visualization.</b>  Successful implementation of the strategy is possible only when it is understood by the whole team, when everything is as transparent as possible and everyone knows where the company is going and what its goals are.  It is also important that the team understand what steps need to be done to implement and what it will receive if the strategy is successfully implemented.  In this case, it is also very important to visualize the strategy, so that at any time it is possible to compare / clarify whether resources are being spent correctly.  To do this, you can make a modified strategic plan ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/91929/">I already wrote about it in one of the posts</a> ) by adding the strategic canvas curve to it. <br><br>  Well, probably the most important thing: to do the blue oceans is wildly interesting and cool. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97221/</a></p>
