  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google Cloud Platform Live: a mix of IaaS and PaaS. Moore's Law for the Clouds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we present several news related to the <a href="http://cloud.google.com/">Cloud Platform</a> services.  You are waiting for reduced and simplified rates, DevOps cloud tools, managed virtual machines (VM) for App Engine, Big Data analytics in real time using Google BigQuery, and much more. <br><br><h4>  Unmatched prices </h4><br>  Cloud platforms offer a very simple formula: you use a virtual infrastructure and pay only for the current load.  It is more profitable compared with the purchase of its own equipment.  In addition, you do not need to pay large upfront fees.  However, the price of cloud platforms is contrary <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%259C%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">to Moore's law</a> : over the past 5 years, it has fallen by only 8% per year, although over the same time, the cost of equipment has decreased by 20‚Äì30%. <br><br>  We decided to restore the balance by simplifying tariffs and reducing the cost of various ‚Äúon demand‚Äù services by 30‚Äì85%:

    <ol><li>  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine">Compute Engine VMs</a> have become at least 32% cheaper regardless of size, region, and class. </li><li>  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/app-engine">App Engine fees</a> have become more transparent;  significantly decreased prices for front-end virtual machines and database operations. </li><li>  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage/">Cloud Storage</a> now costs 2.6 cents ($ 0.026) per 1 GB (an average of 68% lower for most customers). </li><li>  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/bigquery">BigQuery</a> ‚Äúon demand‚Äù tariff fell by 85%. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Discounts for active users </h4><br>  There is one more news.  We introduce <a href="http://developers.google.com/compute/pricing">discounts</a> for everyone who provides a constant load on our cloud platform.  It‚Äôs very simple to save money with us: the discount starts to operate automatically after using the virtual machine for a quarter of a month.  And if you use it for a whole month, then save 30% in addition to the new ‚Äúon demand‚Äù tariffs (that is, 53% compared to the old tariffs). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/794/43a/a59/79443aa59ccd0f330778435b3200f9d5.png"><br>  <i>After a quarter of a month, everyone who regularly used a virtual machine gets an additional discount.</i> <br><br>  Now, thanks to new tariffs and discounts, the lowest prices in the industry are available to you - and no upfront fees, fixed payments, or future demand forecasts. <br><br><h4>  Productivity increase </h4><br>  We also want to introduce new features of the service, which will increase the productivity of developers: <br><br><ol><li>  Develop, test and launch your services directly in the cloud.  Minimal effort and changes in your workflow are guaranteed.  Just save the changes to Git, and we will build the binary code and test the modules. </li><li>  View the logs of all virtual machines, use filtering and searching tools. </li><li>  View detailed stack traces when analyzing bugs.  With one click, find the version of the code that caused the problem.  Make small changes to the code right through the browser. </li></ol><br>  Later we will add other convenient features.  Follow the news! <br><br><h4>  Managed Virtual Machines </h4><br>  Today, developers are forced to choose between conventional virtual machines (which provide flexibility) and managed platforms (which offer scaling and automated management).  But we do not want to challenge you.  Meet the <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/managed-vms">managed virtual machines</a> !  You can execute any code on the virtual machine and quickly incorporate it into your application.  At the same time, App Engine will automatically manage your virtual machines. <br><br><h4>  Support for new platforms in Compute Engine </h4><br>  Compute Engine now supports <a href="http://cloud.google.com/r/windows">Windows Server 2008 R2</a> (in restricted access mode), as well as <a href="http://www.redhat.com/products/enterprise-linux/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/server/">SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</a> (without restrictions). <br><br><h4>  Big Data in real time </h4><br>  Using BigQuery, you can send interactive SQL queries for arrays of any size.  The launch takes place in seconds, and the service does not need to be configured and debugged.  Starting today, thanks to <a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery">BigQuery data streaming,</a> you can download 100,000 records per second per table (and updates will be performed almost instantly).  This means that you can analyze large data streams in real time.  At the same time, BigQuery boasts adequate prices - $ 5 for 5 TB (‚Äúon demand‚Äù requests) and $ 20,000 per month for 5 GB / s (for allocated capacity).  This is 75% lower than other providers! <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  Being a developer and creating applications for users from all over the world is an incredibly interesting job.  We made sure that it was also convenient: now it will be easier for you to write and test code in the cloud using familiar tools.  And managed virtual machines will provide you with both flexibility and automatic control based on App Engine.  All this adds the ability to analyze large amounts of data. <br><br>  And do not forget about the tariff reduction!  They have become even more accessible in accordance with the law of Moore: the cost of virtual equipment has fallen along with the price of real.  In addition, simply by regularly using the platform, you will receive an additional discount - without long-term contracts, fixed payments and advance payments.  At your service the most affordable rates and the best infrastructure! <br><br>  We have come a long way in the first quarter, but we are not going to stop there.  You will learn about our future plans at the Google I / O conference in June. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217209/</a></p>
