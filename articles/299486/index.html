As part of this <a href="http://recode.net/2016/03/18/google-is-shopping-for-cloud-companies-on-the-list-namely-and-shopify/">,</a> new projects <a href="http://recode.net/2016/03/18/google-is-shopping-for-cloud-companies-on-the-list-namely-and-shopify/">appeared</a> on the takeover list: Metavine, a startup that develops applications for corporate clients with an investment of 5.5 million, Shopify is a Canadian e-Commerce company with a market capitalization of $ 2.25, CallidusCloud, Xactly , and Namely, specializing in the development of health solutions and raising investment in the amount of $ 108 million in three rounds with the last investor in the person of Sequoia Capital. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The takeover of these companies could potentially enter the development strategy for the medium business, which now employs hundreds of thousands of employees.  Currently, this area is a priority for Google CEO Sundar Pichai - for his development, he even <a href="http://recode.net/2015/11/19/google-taps-vmware-founder-greene-to-play-catch-up-in-the-cloud/">hired</a> VMware co-founder Diana Green as senior vice president for cloud business, who joined the company in December last year.  Almost immediately after this, Google merged the divisions for the development of corporate applications and cloud solutions under the leadership of Diana Green, and recently the entire portfolio of Google Apps was taken over by its responsibility.

      In this segment, Google faced intense competition from Amazon and Microsoft.  One of the problems was the direction of Google Apps - it is great for small and large businesses.  But almost does not attract the attention of medium-sized businesses. <br><br>  Taking over companies targeting medium-sized customers is an excellent example - Namely now sells employee-related applications, Shopify solutions are popular among entrepreneurs in the e-Commerce segment, and Xactly allows you to track the company's sales performance based on your own web service. <br><br>  Together with the absorption of these companies, Google will be able not only to use them to attract new customers, but also to transfer all data to Google Cloud‚Äôs own cloud platform.  Here again, there is competition between Microsoft's Amazon Web Services and Azure.  The first system is often in demand by large corporations, but they eventually refuse to use it, so the company is similarly focused on attracting medium-sized businesses.  Therefore, Google is only trying to develop this segment and has already managed to get such customers as Sony, Macy's, Spotify and Apple.  To date, Google has not confirmed the possibility of a potential deal, and start-up officials have similarly refused to comment on this information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299486/</a></p>
