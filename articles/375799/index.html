  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãtip: Red boots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  He lived in the world "miller" and he had three sons.  The ‚Äúthresher‚Äù is old at all, only 10 terahertz, but it is still good for raids.  The police shot him in one of them. <br>  Before his death, the father bequeathed to his sons - his elder "thresher", to the middle - the base of commercial secrets of average value, and the youngest - a computer of a special technology, small, prototype, abbreviated - K.O.T.  For a long time the younger could not console himself, having received such an inheritance ... <br>  ‚ÄúBrothers,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwill be able to continue to pursue computer espionage, but what can I do with such small capacities?  Yes, with him and the "Telegraph" is not breaking!  I‚Äôm going to sell it to Katsu, his junkman, I'll make a feast for the last money! ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But here the low-powered speakers squeaked, and K.O.T.  calm and reasonable: <br>  - Do not worry, master!  Find the Red Downloader, or better two.  Maybe not so offended you, as you now think. <br>  Long, short, and the younger brother found a pair of Red Downloaders, and he barely received K.O.T.  all that he needed was, he immediately went on a journey on the Net.  Having settled down in places of large clusters of hackers, he threw open snares - ‚Äúwallet.dat Satoshi, not password protected‚Äù, and after a second in a forceful seizure, one of the novice triad hackers was fluttering. <br>  Proud of his prey, K.O.T.  straight to the Palace of the Resident.  Not the president. <br>  He bowed to him and said: <br>  - Here you have a young plump hacker from the possession of my ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù, and the name of that marquise is Kara-bass, which means ‚ÄúDeath to poorly playing bass players‚Äù. <br>  Such, of course, any Resident will always approve.  It happened this time. <br><br>  The hacker was sent to the torture room, and soon they learned from him many secrets of the triads, which gave the Resident great pleasure, and the clever K.O.T. was presented with a QR-Code assistant of the first step.  In the meantime, the time has come for the Resident to take a walk along the muddy banks of the Hudson River together with her beautiful daughter. <br><br>  They drove an armored car, flew support quadcopters into the air - and set off.  KOT also rushed to the owner on the forced mode. <br>  - Do you accept my advice?  He asked him.  Then at the hour I specified - dive into the water at such and such a place. <br>  When the Resident's armored car, roaring with all eight motors in the womb, drove ashore, K.O.T.  rushed to him and in all the power of low-power speakers shouted: <br>  - Help, save!  "Marquis" Kara-bass drowning!

      Having recognized the recognition system by the very computer that delivered the Chinese hacker to him, the Resident ordered to stop the transport, and soon his guards pulled the Marquis out of the water. <br>  The cat has so far managed to tell the Resident that during the next attack, the Marquis suffered a gunfight with the feds, barely having time to dive into the river at the last moment.  He was wounded in the arm of a machine gun, but his trusty "jumpsuit" took the brunt, and was completely destroyed. <br><br>  Immediately the Resident ordered to bring for the Marquis the best "jumpsuit" from the devices of his wardrobe. <br>  The outfit turned out to fit both, and to the face, besides, the Marquis so deftly carried out its initial configuration and skillfully approached the debugger that the Resident's beautiful daughter, looking at him, thought for the first time that he was very much in her taste. <br><br>  CAT.  I was delighted with how everything went and swinging the neural interfaces merrily rushed in front of the armored car. <br>  Soon he saw the underground shop.  Going down to the Network to the first access level, he reprogrammed the android guards and told them to answer that the shop was owned by the "Marquis" Kara-bass. <br><br>  Then an armored car drove up, and the Resident asked, while the guards carefully covered him with bullet-glasses: <br>  - Yes, no way here produce "Green Laughter"!  Whose is the shop, well done? <br>  - ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù of Kara-bass!  - answered androids according to the program. <br><br>  Meanwhile, K.O.T.  kept moving forward.  He reprogrammed the other androids of the next workshop, even better than before, only had to go down to the Net to the depth of the second access level.  Then an armored car drove up, and the Resident asked, while the guards carefully covered him with bullet-glasses: <br>  - Yes, no way here produce "Steel Ice"!  Whose is the shop, well done? <br>  - ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù of Kara-bass!  - answered androids according to the program. <br>  The Resident was surprised, but also delighted, and his daughter‚Äôs eyes looked at the Marquis with great interest. <br><br>  CAT.  all rushed forward.  He reprogrammed the other androids of the next workshop, the most luxurious of them all, but he had to go down to the Web to the depth of the third access level, and it was pretty to sweat over the burglary of protection. <br>  Then an armored car drove up and the Resident asked, while the guards carefully covered him with bullet-glasses: <br>  - Can not be!  It produces the very "Silent Joy"?  Whose is the shop, whose ?! <br>  - ‚ÄúMarquis‚Äù of Kara-bass!  - answered androids according to the program. <br><br>  As the Resident's lovely daughter heard that the "Marquis" owns the workshop for the production of the very "Silent Joy" - she fell in love with him without memory, and the Resident himself could not marvel at the wealth of the "Marquis". <br>  And finally he found himself K.O.T.  near the power gate of the extraordinary palace in which the Anarchist bomber lived.  I haven‚Äôt seen living computers for a long time, because everyone fled from him in fear, so he covered the most abundant table for KOTA and kept trying to pour in ‚Äúroyal vodka‚Äù. <br><br>  However, K.O.T.  with all possible politeness, and instead asked: <br>  - Is it true, my dear host, that you can turn into anyone, even the most potent robot? <br>  - Right!  - the Anarchist rudely laughed and after a moment he rewrote his consciousness into a huge human-like fighting robot, once guarding the borders of Russia. <br>  ‚ÄúDo you have a backup,‚Äù inquired K.O.T.  with Lenin's squint and kind smile. <br>  - Not!  - Anarchist bomber roughly cut him off, - backups for lamers! <br><br>  And here K.O.T.'s optointerfaces flamed scarlet.  It must have been reflected in them by the glow of a fire burning in the fireplace ... <br>  ‚ÄúBut can you, dear master,‚Äù K.O.T softly purred, place his consciousness in something small? <br>  - Of course!  - the bomber replied without hesitation; he launched the 7z 666 version of the archiver and soon his consciousness sank to the smallest file.  Even with the whole story, this archiver is so beautiful! <br>  At the same time, KOT, even without immersion in the Network, was able to erase it without the possibility of recovery.  Children!  Make backups! <br><br>  The resident, meanwhile, wishing to rest, had already ordered his armored car to be driven into the garage, and the copters hovered over the lock. <br>  Ran out to meet K.O.T.  and said to him <br>  - Welcome to the convent of "Marquis" Kara-bass. <br>  - How, "Marquis"?  Is this ownership yours too ?! <br><br>  Three of them, the Marquis, the Resident and his charming daughter, they entered the main hall, where a wonderful dinner offered by the Anarchist bomber to the cunning K.O.T.  Seeing all this luxury, I could not say Resident alone: <br>  ‚ÄúI see how you and my daughter look at each other, Marquis!‚Äù  As for me, I agree - be my son-in-law! <br><br>  "Marquis" at the same moment connected its neural interface with the neural interface of a beautiful girl, which she gave him with a captivating smile ... <br><br>  And at the wedding they called Hertz, the old Hertz, and he married them at its best in the latest fashion, very popular.  CAT.  he took over all the operations of the management of shops and possessions. <br><br>  They lived happily ever after and died one day when a rival gang of another marquis blew up their palace with an obsidian bomb. <br><br>  Author: Artem Karetnikov AKA Leider </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375799/</a></p>
