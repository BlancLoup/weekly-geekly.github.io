    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why do you need a promotional website when there are app stores, themed media, social, banner networks, etc.</b>  <b>etc.?</b> <br><br>  Of course, there are a lot of other ways to attract attention to your mobile application and increase the number of installations, the site is one of these ways, though not the most effective, but it should not be at the end of your list of priorities. <br><br>  The site of a mobile application is an integral element of its promotion. <br>  Search traffic can bring a fairly tangible percentage of the total installations in the long run to ignore.  If you skillfully use the various ‚Äúcalls to action‚Äù and maintain the updating of the content, you can make a ‚Äúmini-market‚Äù of your application from your website. <br>  Technical support for users of the application is also more convenient to link to the site. <br>  If you plan to conduct a marketing research of users of your mobile application, the site can help with this. <br>  Contests in social networks can also be advertised through the site and so on. <br><br>  <b>More important than the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù question, can only be ‚Äúwhen‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The site of the mobile application should appear during its development, and not after. <br><br>  Beta-version of your product is a unique opportunity to begin to form a loyal audience of your users before the release, not to mention the advantages of open testing to refine the mobile application itself. <br><br>  <i>Test your legendary</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13a/605/064/13a605064c499bd6a59bace0b6925932.png" alt="MurtaughList"><br><br>  <b>Immersion in the atmosphere with design</b> <br><br>  Many people think that visitors do not like to read texts, this is not entirely true.  It's just that the online community has become so selective that it gives you from 1 to 3 seconds (maximum) to get yourself interested in the contents of your site. <br><br>  Each person receives a dose of up to 6,000 advertising messages per day (heard at one of the conferences), of course, the brain has adapted to reject not exactly the necessary information at the stage of its preview. <br><br>  A design that catches the user's mood, or evokes the right emotion and talks about the main purpose of your mobile application without words, greatly increases the chances of your site being viewed. <br><br>  <i>Those who have once been in such a situation or have similar fears will not pass by this site.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3e/85f/75a/a3e85f75a227e1338df1161b01ce1d6e.png" alt="Panic"><br><br>  <i>Anyone who liked to draw with chalk on asphalt or blackboard will not remain indifferent</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40d/633/13f/40d63313fc73e3151b1912b4746ddbb6.png" alt="Bord"><br><br>  Read about the <a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/emotional-design-with-a-c-t-part-2/">emotional design</a> in the presentation of Trevor van Gorp (Trevor van Gorp) and the unusual <a href="http://www.poetpainter.com/thoughts/article/introducing-the-mental-notes-behavior-cube">interface design tool by</a> Stephen Anderson (Stephen Anderson). <br>  All designers should become familiar with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/interaction-color-by-josef/id664296461%3Fls%3D1%26mt%3D8">theory of light by</a> Joseph Albers (Josef Albers). <br><br>  <b>Think of the texts on the site as a conversation with the user.</b> <br><br>  SEO should be clever, concise thoughts, texts are simple but emotional. <br><br>  You can read about the information style, learn from the leading media on your subject or ... <br>  just write what the user will receive from your application without loud or abstruse words, participial or complex speech turns. <br><br>  I'm sure you know everything about bulleted lists, paragraphs, intriguing headlines, but remember one thing: <br>  The more your site‚Äôs text looks like a conversation with a user, the more interesting it will be to communicate with you.  No moralizing, assurances, warnings, long and convoluted arguments.  Be interesting interlocutors. <br><br>  <b>Twitter format for the message on the main page</b> <br><br>  Bring the story of your application in one tweet (140 characters with spaces), select the main advantage of your application and associate with the main need of its target audience with the help of feelings and emotions. <br><br>  <i>Your Personal Best!</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e32/62a/0e8/e3262a0e8a1a66905f044b4b8834f7e5.png" alt="Rubisapp"><br><br>  <b>Limited web version for the lazy, right on the site, without installation</b> <br><br>  Most of the promotional sites for mobile applications have the form of a one-page site looking down, almost always flat in design, sometimes with parallax where you need to press just one button, or one to choose from, depending on the mobile religion: ‚ÄúAndroid app on Google Play‚Äù / "Download on the App Store". <br><br>  How do you want to surprise the average user who has ‚Äúfilled up‚Äù with free applications and is too lazy to press one button?  Installing a free application on a smartphone is perceived by some individuals as something from the category: ‚Äúwell, okay, they were persuaded, I‚Äôll look and be.‚Äù <br><br>  Suggest an alternative.  A limited Web version of a mobile application right on the site that you don‚Äôt even need to install and, yes, write something extraordinary on the button. <br><br>  <i>Browse challenges online</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12b/5dd/f38/12b5ddf38f565abcd786164a25e115cd.png" alt="Everest"><br><br>  <b>80% of people are visuals, show them a video about your application</b> <br><br>  Vision is the main sense organ and with the development of 3D animation, augmented reality and other visualization technologies, the dominant of the visual apparatus in the process of life will only be strengthened. <br><br>  You did not notice for yourself that it was easier for you to watch a video on YouTube about how to handle this or that thing than to read the instructions that came with it. <br><br>  Interesting in the plot (this is the first), short in duration (this is the second), a beautifully filmed (this is the third) video about your application tells more about it than the text that is read diagonally, in headlines or individual phrases. <br><br>  <i>Nontrivial mobile application development</i> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oGg-kFLm97U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwzV5t85XqGPp_XrzsPJQY8RxMhQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  If the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is so simple and clear that you can talk about it without words, show it. <br><br>  <i>No comments</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a75/369/e57/a75369e5726840cd65d184ca0e1cfeae.png" alt="PictionApp"><br><br>  <b>Give visitors the opportunity to talk about the application in the social.</b>  <b>networks</b> <br><br>  Despite the obviousness of this point, some developers of promotional sites either forget about the social activity of their visitors or place social networking buttons where they need to be found. <br><br>  Do not limit yourself to buttons, give a site visitor the opportunity to log in to it through an account in one of the popular social networks in exchange for tangible benefits from this action. <br><br>  <b>Feedback is fast and unobtrusive.</b> <br><br>  Promotional sites are focused on one action, in the case of promotional sites for mobile applications, this is the button ‚ÄúAndroid app on Google Play‚Äù and / or ‚ÄúDownload on the App Store‚Äù. <br><br>  Keep in mind that when you ask a visitor, for example, to leave contacts to participate in testing the developed mobile application, this should be one text field for e-mail. <br><br>  <b>It doesn't matter what you think about your application, they will not believe you anyway.</b> <br><br>  The so-called ‚ÄúSocial proof‚Äù is very important for a promotional site, but it must be correct.  Levels of confidence in reviews, like circles on the water, the further - the weaker.  Most of all you trust yourself, then family members, close friends, good acquaintances, and so on.  You, as a developer, are at the last place of the user, and customers of applications from your portfolio are at the last but one. <br><br>  Another thing - the recognized industry experts, whose names are on everyone‚Äôs lips.  They violate the above logic and invade the credibility of users.  Contact them, interest your project, pay money for testing because they will not take money from your review. <br><br>  No self-respecting Internet resource, especially with the name, will not write a review for an application that is not worthy, their business reputation and professional ratings are definitely not worth the money, do not even hope. <br><br>  This needs to be done also because it will be a good test of the ambitions of your mobile application for success. <br><br>  <i>APProved</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7fb/cdf/f26/7fbcdff26d6b1ec15af25af663443630.png" alt="Risapp"><br><br>  <b>A or B?</b> <br><br>  Do not neglect A / B testing. <br><br>  As a rule, developers of a promotional site provide 2 options for the concept of your landing page.  If both are standing, do not make a choice now, implement both options and test on visitors.  Web analytics will tell you which option is the most successful and what you can borrow from the least successful. <br><br>  Even the length of the landing page matters, Brian Honigman talks about this in the article <a href="http://positionly.com/blog/inbound-marketing/long-vs-short-landing-page">Long vs.</a>  <a href="http://positionly.com/blog/inbound-marketing/long-vs-short-landing-page">Short Landing Page - Which One Works Better?</a> <br><br>  <b>Finally</b> <br><br>  The site for the mobile application will judge the application itself. <br><br>  In the fierce competition in app stores, a promotional website can become a kind of bridge between search results and a page in a store with the only difference that you already clicked on the ‚ÄúAndroid app on Google Play‚Äù / ‚ÄùDownload on the App Store‚Äù button liked something. <br><br>  Moving from theory to practice in the following post: " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213299/">Promo site for a mobile application. Part 2</a> " <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213039/</a></p>
