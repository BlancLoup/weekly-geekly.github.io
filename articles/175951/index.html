For example, why huge and very rich companies operating in high-tech, for a minute - not in the sale of sausage!  - the industry is not able to do such a trivial, in principle, a thing as a normal site. <br><br>  Today, Megafon has come under my sight, whose services I have been using for 9-10 years. <br><br>  I just needed to disable a couple of additional tariff options that I connected recently when traveling around the country.  The options themselves are wonderful - for only 10 rubles per day each, you can rate calls and mobile Internet at the tariffs of your home region (Moscow).  That's just need to turn them off on return, and then the money will continue to be written off.  So you can only after a month, thinking about where you have money flowing from your account, remember about it.  20 rubles per day - 600 extra rubles per month.

      Good move, Megafon!  But this is not just another topic of complaints about the thievery of opsoxes.  Fully accepting responsibility for my forgetfulness, I go, albeit belatedly, to disable these functions.  How to do it?  You can call the number 0500, after a couple of minutes of waiting (the good side of MegaFon - the call center is working quickly) a nice and quick girl at the other end disconnects everything and the money stops disappearing from the account.  But a call to the call center is so out of date.  And what if I am a sociopath, to whom the very need to talk on the phone is stress?  It was decided: go to your personal account on the MegaFon website - the so-called ‚ÄúService Guide‚Äù.  That's what I'll tell in more detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Step 1. Go to the site </h5><br>  We go to the main page - the site immediately determines the region of my location and throws on the Moscow sub-site.  The link to the personal account is traditionally up right, everything is as it should be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d75/ec3/274/d75ec32743dc5ccb220edef7631584fd.png"><br><br><h5>  Step 2. Login in your account </h5><br>  Why is it important that I was exactly on the Moscow site?  Geo-targeting is logical and convenient, but a personal account, in theory, should be common to the user, regardless of his location.  And here is no: as seen in the address bar, we are still on the Moscow subdomain: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f53/52d/1bf/f5352d1bfeac2ff14c2a65bf103d2843.png"><br><br>  What is it fraught with?  It's very simple: if you try to enter the ‚ÄúService Guide‚Äù from a non-home region, for example, from Chelyabinsk, the site simply does not recognize your login and password, since  You will be on the Siberian site.  Rave?  Rave.  You will not be in your personal account until you guess through the main pens to change the region.  What is the point of this move, when the region is already ‚Äúsewn up‚Äù in the telephone number itself ‚Äî I am absolutely incomprehensible. <br><br>  <i>Time.</i> <br><br>  Ok, we understand, we introduce captcha: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e43/a63/440/e43a634400f91c7d33eec2e20aa191ed.png"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm not always lucky with their captcha.  <s>A rare bird reaches the middle of the Dnieper</s> rarely when it is possible to enter it the first time.  It got to the point that I had to complain to the support of "Megaphone".  Judging by their answer, the problem (and its solution) is familiar to them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ff/5f9/ebb/7ff5f9ebbcfc1b6efb969ed9890287c2.png"><br><br>  Ok, remember.  Just why not fix it by putting something more human-like? <br><br>  <i>Two.</i> <br><br><h5>  Step 3. My Account </h5><br>  The good news is: all the services ordered are visible on the main page, albeit not immediately, but somewhere below: <br><br><img src="http://s2.uploads.ru/TpYfG.png"><br><br>  It would be logical to indicate immediately and the cost of the tariff - good, there is a place.  But to find out what this service is and how much it costs, you can only after two clicks (one extra transition to <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/roaming/national/special_offers_voice_sms/">this</a> page, and only then - the <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/roaming/national/special_offers_voice_sms/in_roam_russia.html">one</a> that was needed initially).  <i>Three</i> . <br><br>  Ok, sorted out.  But how to turn them off now?  A click on the service leads to its description, there is no possibility to select or perform any action with it.  <i>Four</i> .  We'll have to look through the menu "Service Guide" - and this is another problem! <br><br><h5>  Step 4. Wilds "Service Guide" </h5><br>  It is more or less logical to look for a trip in the ‚ÄúServices and Tariff‚Äù menu.  However, clicking on it does not take me anywhere: it simply opens an extended submenu.  Another superfluous, optional click.  <i>Five</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc9/3f6/128/cc93f61287b49d2c99dc916ec1e183c2.png"><br><br>  What would you choose in my place?  I chose "Changing the set of services" - it seems logical.  To see what services I have connected, I had to alternately walk through four sections: <br><br><img src="http://s3.uploads.ru/SBzXr.gif"><br><br>  Why it was impossible to display all these services in one list?  Four more optional clicks. <br>  <i>Six</i> <br><br>  And most importantly - I never found the required roaming services.  Maybe they are in the "Change of tariff options" section?  Looking ahead, I will say right away: yes, it is there.  But before you throw a stone at me, answer the simple question: what is the tariff, her mother, service, different from the tariff option?  What was going on in the head of the unfortunate marketer who came up with this classification - and what key should I deconstruct his logic in order to pass this quest from the first time in the shortest way?  It seems to me that such a key does not exist - it is impossible to understand.  You can only learn.  <i>Seven</i> . <br><br>  But do not think that it was easy.  In the ‚ÄúChange of tariff options‚Äù submenu, we again come across a nested menu, and much more confused: now there are not only groups, but also sections: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00e/085/ed2/00e085ed2c89ed6ce68e7fe0e066750e.png"><br><br>  4 sections, 14 nested groups.  To view all the options for each section, you need to make 18 (!) Clicks - first select a section, then a group. <br><br>  I will not load you through the pages, I‚Äôll say right away: the information I was looking for was in the section ‚ÄúRoaming discounts‚Äù, the group ‚ÄúRoaming discounts across Russia‚Äù - only in the fifteenth option search session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b99/b4f/0f9/b99b4f0f9474fadf25f4b625b5a344c0.png"><br><br><h5>  Let's sum up </h5><br>  To find and disable two simple but voracious tariff options, I needed: <br><br><ol><li>  Go to the site, go to your account </li><li>  Update a couple of times the captcha, finally go to your personal account </li><li>  Proshershit in turn 2 on the menu, 4 groups in the first, 11 groups in the second. </li></ol><br><br>  If I were doing all this from a region other than the home one, then another item would be added: ‚ÄúHaving tormented the region to return to the main one, change the region‚Äù. <br><br>  Along the way, I counted <i>seven</i> jambs: <br><br><ol><li>  Linking personal account to the region on the site </li><li>  Glitch captcha </li><li>  No direct links to the description of the service with its title </li><li>  The absence of the possibility of operations with a specific service, the need to look for them through the menu </li><li>  Two-level menu </li><li>  Two / three-level menu of services within specific submenus </li><li>  Lack of logic - at least clear logic - in the separation of services and options </li></ol><br>  And all this came to light in the way of solving a primitive, in general, problem - to disable two tariff options, which is done within three minutes of calling the call center.  And this is your problem, dear "Megaphone"!  After all, the call center must be recruited, trained, fed - and the site is working for itself and is not asking.  But as long as your site will resemble a quest from the beginning of the 90s - do not hope to cut the cost of the call center.  Even the most notorious sociopaths will still make phone calls, because your website was simply made by misanthropists. <br><br><h5>  What to do? </h5><br>  Solutions to the problems, in principle, are obvious.  As is well known, in a properly formulated problem - half the solution.  But I still chew to the end.  So, you need: <br><br><ol><li>  Make a single login to your personal account </li><li>  Add the ability to operate services and tariffs right from the initial screen of your personal account </li><li>  Deliver descriptions to tooltips where it is not possible - give direct links to descriptions. </li><li>  Rebuild the menu, destroying the fruits of a split marketing personality like "options / services" </li><li>  To get rid of the menu nesting: everything received as a result of the reassembly should be displayed in the menu entirely - good, nobody restricts us vertically </li><li>  Inside specific menu items, display all sections, groups, subsections, and other labudenes on one screen, destroying the nesting inside the submenu with special care and particular cruelty </li><li> <i>(bonus)</i> Remind the client that his home region is connected and daily charge money for roaming.  You, dear "Megaphone", you know, when I returned, and you send me a welcome SMS.  So why don't you at the same time remind me that my money is being written off for services that I no longer need?  Once a day, until I disconnect them, it would be enough. </li></ol><br>  What is there in the remaining sections of the ‚ÄúService Guide‚Äù is hiding - I‚Äôm even afraid to imagine and, frankly, I don‚Äôt want to understand at all.  And why?  If the link to the operation with the connected options were right on the first screen, then I would not even have to go into the jungle of the menu: I would have disabled them directly from the main page in my account. <br><br>  Don't thank MegaFon.  Better just make a normal site.  Your subscriber. <br><br>  PS Today is the day of "Service Guide" on Habr√©: another post about him - this time <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175939/">about the security holes of the SG</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175951/</a></p>
