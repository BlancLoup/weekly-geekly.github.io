  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Developing games with Intel: GPA and the first July webinar</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc6/158/680/dc6158680efe51604541e1053ab63ef5.jpg" align="left"><br>  What can be common to such gaming masterpieces as Civilization, STALKER or, say, Rise of Flight?  If you say that this is amazing realistic graphics and a unique and exciting gameplay, then you will certainly be right.  But we should not also forget that despite the high demands on computing resources, all these games work wonderfully on the budget "hardware".  And it‚Äôs not at all necessary to have a gaming system with a powerful discrete video card in order to enjoy many hours of gameplay.  Yes, the developers took into account the features of various gaming platforms.  And, perhaps, not all of you know that Intel Graphics Performance Analyzers (Intel GPA) provided invaluable assistance in the difficult task of optimization. <br><br>  Armed with this tool, you can easily overcome the causes of the limited performance of the game.  If you are still not familiar with Intel GPA, then it's time to try it in action!  Especially for you on Friday, July 1, we will hold a <a href="http://intelcorp.regsvc.com/E5928">master class on Intel graphics tools</a> , where we will tell and show you how to use them in order to maximize the performance of your application. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  July 1 at 11:00 - meet on the platform of Adobe Connect </h4><br>  So, on July 1 at 11 am Moscow time, we begin to broadcast the webinar.  To participate, you must first register on <a href="http://intelcorp.regsvc.com/E5928">IntelCorp.regsvc.com/E5928</a> .  After completing and submitting the registration form, you will receive an email with a link to enter the ‚Äúvirtual audience‚Äù.  To participate, you will not need any additional software, only a web browser and Adobe Flash Player, which with a probability of 99.9% is already installed on your PC.

    <h4>  Who is the speaker? </h4><br>  The webinar is conducted by Philipp Gerasimov ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/philippgerasimov/" class="user_link">philippgerasimov</a> ), with whom you may be familiar with the project ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/71512/">5 weeks with Intel</a> ‚Äù.  You could also meet him at KRI, where he represented the Intel GPA and told how with his help eminent companies achieved impressive optimization results for their games.  If you still have not had the opportunity to visit the CWI, I advise you to register in advance in order not to miss Philip's report this time. <br><br><h4>  What will be discussed? </h4><br>  The event is devoted to the problem of optimizing computer games.  You will learn about Intel's tools for analyzing performance and debugging graphics programs that should be in the arsenal of each game developer.  Of course, the highlight of the program is <a href="http://www.intel.com/software/gpa/">Intel Graphics Performance Analyzers (Intel GPA)</a> .  The product was first introduced in 2009 at KRI, and since then it has always been popular with developers, thanks to a unique approach to optimizing graphics.  Not so long ago, a new version of <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/announcing-gpa-4dot0/">Intel GPA 4.0</a> was released, which includes 3 main modules: <br><ul><li>  <strong>System Analyzer HUD (Heads-Up Display)</strong> is a dashboard for performance monitoring and analysis.  CPU / GPU / Direct3D metrics are displayed in real time over the game frame.  This tool is the first step towards optimization.  It allows you to determine the limited application performance - CPU or GPU; </li><li>  <strong>Frame Analyzer is</strong> designed for detailed analysis and debugging of the captured frame, allows you to find the most difficult D3D API calls and eliminate bottlenecks; </li><li>  <strong>Platform Analyzer</strong> is a tool for visualizing thread performance across all CPU cores. </li></ul><br>  At the webinar, we also talk about <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/app/software-assessment%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">Intel Graphics Checker</a> .  This tool is provided as part of the Intel affiliate program and allows you to quickly assess the performance of the application, as well as get a detailed report with recommendations for optimizing the code.  The new version 3.0 includes integration with Intel GPA.  Thus, in addition to the FPS application, the tool allows you to get information about the efficiency of the use of the central and graphics processor. <br><br>  Intel GPA tools and Intel Graphics Checker will provide you with real assistance in creating and optimizing graphics applications.  Come in on the morning of July 1st to the webinar, and with live examples you will see how these tools can quickly identify bottlenecks and perform code optimization.  In addition, you will learn about new benefits for members of <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/home%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">the Intel affiliate program</a> and how to get the tools for free. <br><br>  See you on Friday! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Active webinar participants who will ask interesting questions will receive pleasant souvenirs from Intel Software. <br><br>  <b>UPD: You can</b> view and download the webinar in the recording at the link: <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/videos/webinar-intel-tools-for-game-developers/">software.intel.com/ru-ru/videos/webinar-intel-tools-for-game-developers/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122933/</a></p>
