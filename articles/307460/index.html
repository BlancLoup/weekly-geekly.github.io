    <h3>  Experiment on living people </h3><br>  For a month <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr5razgovor%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">we</a> collected, analyzed data of 2800 resources of our clients.  For the full result in the selection process, the following criteria were used: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ High attendance (considered only sites from 7 thousand visitors); <br>  ‚Ä¢ The difference in the themes of sites and appearance; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Using advertising channels: Direct and / or AdWords, email newsletters. <br><br>  It is worth noting that during the billing period there were no changes on the site, in addition to changing the settings in the widget.  During data collection, we analyzed the frequency of use of individual options and conducted a comprehensive comparison of performance, evaluating the conversion to calls through the widget. <br><br><h3>  What got </h3><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/256/ef2/27f256ef2be244739ad046391cc8002e.jpg"></div><br><h3>  Details about the details </h3><br><br>  <b>Tips</b> <br>  So that the user can quickly navigate the site and immediately pay attention to the possibility of feedback, you should use visual details on the WCF and company contacts, for example, arrows on the page indicating the feedback form, or focus on the color of the communication button (It should not merge with the site but, on the contrary, stand out against its background).  We suggest customers use motivational tips for the call button. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67b/d12/c77/67bd12c771a946c7832759814fc41de9.jpg"></div><br>  In your personal account, you can specify up to three short interactive messages, successively replacing each other.  For example: ‚ÄúThe call is absolutely free‚Äù, ‚ÄúLearn about special promotions‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet 10% discount after the call‚Äù, etc. According to the results, 62% of our customers use the ‚ÄúTips‚Äù setting for the widget.  For the first month, the difference between the sites before using the prompts and after was plus 16.3% to the conversion. <br><br>  <b>Individual offer</b> <br>  Sites that use personal calls to the user, show the best results.  In our personal account, this option is used by 39% of clients.  These sites have the highest sales through a widget among the sites studied (the average difference in the conversion of traffic into calls reaches up to 11.6%). <br><br>  With the help of the ‚ÄúHashtags‚Äù setting, clients can create several text variants, selecting each one for a specific group of target audiences.  By tying a message in the widget's pop-up window to the traffic source, you can personalize the appeal to the audience as much as possible. <br><br>  For example, if a visitor searched for ‚ÄúNissan Almera‚Äù in Yandex, read about the car on the forum or in the company's blog, then when he gets to the site, the widget will turn to him with the proposal that is most interesting for him at the moment: ‚ÄúLooking for Nissan Almera?  We know everything about her!  Let us call you back and answer all the questions? ". <br><br>  <b>Company `s logo</b> <br>  The option "Add logo" is quite popular among all types of clients.  89% of customers use this feature and place a logo or banner ad in the system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a7/2c1/bb4/8a72c1bb4f55432ebe6098da2163d316.jpg"></div><br>  Widget with the logo fits in well with the design, increasing the credibility of the system and warming the interest of customers if there are discounts or special conditions in the banner.  However, it is worth noting that there was no strong difference in conversion (Less than 2% in favor of the option). <br><br>  <b>Data Protection and Security</b> <br>  If a site visitor is not sure that the service you offer is safe, he will refuse risks.  The guarantee of the safety of the entered data on the contrary contributes to an increase in the user‚Äôs trust threshold. <br><br>  A / B testing revealed that the appearance of the inscription ‚ÄúFree and confidential‚Äù in the form of feedback brings an increase in conversion of up to 26.7%.  And this is a direct confirmation of the hypothesis of the security needs of the site visitors. <br>  96% of our clients have this option enabled in widgets. <br><br>  <b>Interaction bonuses</b> <br>  Pointing to the client on the specific advantages of the company (USP), you can attract attention and keep the visitor on the site.  And with the help of information about free lessons, delivery, book, discount, you can achieve the target action (subscribe to the newsletter, leave the CP, call the company).  The visitor will receive an interesting offer, and you - an interested leader from the site. <br><br>  29% of customers using discounts, promotions and gifts in a widget received up to 83% of calls through the feedback form.  A survey of focus groups of 100 large customers confirmed that promotion is the most effective method of collecting leads, because 7 out of 10 customers who called have asked for the proposed benefit and were ready to buy the product. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  The results of the study showed that each of the options considered in its own way influences the further behavior of the user, helps you to establish contact with the site visitors, and a competent combination of several options is the key to successful conversion of traffic into leads. <br><blockquote>  <i>We recommend to read "As our customers increased the conversion rate."</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cashmyvisit/blog/300388/">Go to</a></i> </blockquote><br>  <b>Promotional PS</b> <br>  Feedback systems are designed for companies that are constantly developing their business and caring for customers (Read more <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/cashmyvisit/blog/296762/">here</a> ).  With us, you will receive a guarantee of the quality of communication, the ability to easily manage settings and analyze all available data about site visitors.
