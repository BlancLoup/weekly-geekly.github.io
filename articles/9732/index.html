  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to earn $ 10 by investing $ 5</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is a small note that doesn‚Äôt have a special relationship to making money on the Internet, but judging by the title of the article, you could understand that it‚Äôs about money. <br>  So, ways to make money or, correctly said, make 5 bucks 10. <br><br>  Way numeric one. <br><br>  Bookmakers.  Bookmakers - these are firms that are engaged in receiving cash bets on sports competitions.  To calculate the win is used so called "coefficients".  Suppose you bet on the victory of "Manchester" and the game "Manchester - Chelsea".  Coefficient on Mancheste 2.5.  You bet $ 5.  When you win "Manchester" get $ 5 * 2.5 = $ 12.5.  More than twice.  There are two game strategies for such offices.  The first is the betting of large amounts on a specific serious game, in which you are sure.  Usually, such games have coefficients to win one of the teams not less than 1.8.  The second strategy is to place small amounts on competitions for example ‚ÄúMozambique on Underwater Polo‚Äù, that is, matches that are not of first importance.  The second strategy is best implemented on the Internet in live mode, it is like a quick game on the currency exchange to raise and lower the price of a particular currency.  Which of these two strategies brings the best result is not for me to judge.  Addresses in the network of such offices do not publish, they will not pay me for it.

      Namber two. <br><br>  Online casino.  Oddly enough, but it really is.  Now I feel a flurry of complaints that this is all a divorce, kidalovo, etc.  Nothing like this!  You just need to be able to choose the right casino.  From my personal experience I will say that once I did at one online casino on roulette for 8 minutes with $ 10 - 25. At this, my games ended, immediately took the winnings and ran far, far across the expanses of the Internet.  ;-) In principle, this method of course is more likely than bookmakers, but not deprived of the right to life.  Try it and luck will smile at you. <br><br>  Method number is last for today. <br><br>  HYIP.  Mutual funds on the Internet.  I will tell you right away that I never earned anything on such funds, I just didn‚Äôt want to.  Somewhere 80% of all existing ones are fraudsters who collect deposits, the first hundred depositors are really paid something, while the rest are simply thrown away and then appear at a different address with a different name but a similar design.  So act at your own risk.  Finding such funds is not difficult - the query "HYIP" or "Internet investment fund" in any search engine will give tens or even hundreds of thousands of results.  My advice to you - if the feedback from the foundation is maintained only by e-mail, neither the address nor the telephone number of the foundation is indicated - do not have a deal with it.  Accordingly, if you are offered 30% per day, it is clear that these are fraudsters. <br><br>  So now you have as many as 3 ways to make $ 5 out of 10. And who said that you can't make money on the Internet?  ;-) <br><br>  Full article at <a href="http://nextzoid.blogspot.com/">nextzoid.blogspot.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9732/</a></p>
