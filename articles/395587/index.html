Indeed, in the soul of almost every man lives tanker.  For us, the tank is the personification of unstoppable force.  Then we already became programmers, designers and testers.  But many of us still freeze in the chest from the <s>smell of napalm in the morning, the</s> roar of diesel engines, the clank of caterpillars and the sight of the enemy in the sight.  True, this joy usually gives us not a tank training ground, but WASD with a mouse.  And today we propose to recall the most interesting modern combat vehicles, on which you can smash tank wedges of an adversary in the online action game <a href="https://aw.mail.ru/">Armored Warfare: The Armat</a> Project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  T-90MS </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a1/b2d/c7a/7a1b2dc7a1b64aa0be68aebb4b45e4e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/e8b/c15/705e8bc155d8440d888ae6b382764a18.jpg">

This is partly due to the presence of the landing hatch in the stern of the tank, so the designers have to book a much larger internal volume.

The tank is equipped with radar radar with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">AFAR</a> and infrared HD-cameras, creating a circular field of view.  Some experts believe that the T-14 radar is capable of calculating the position of the enemy along the trajectory of the shells flying past.  A combat information and control system is capable of transmitting data about the enemy to other combat units belonging to the information network. <br><br>  The tank used technologies to reduce visibility in the infrared, radio and magnetic ranges, making it difficult to target and capture anti-tank weapons.

In addition, it is planned to experiment with the installation of not 125, but 152-mm guns (howitzer caliber).  This is due to the fact that modern tanks are overgrown with good protection. <br><br>  The list of innovations can be listed for a long time.
