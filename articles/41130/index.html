Depending on the project, a tester and a SEO promoter can be added to this list.  Ideally, each person in the team has a niche in which he works.  This may be a design or layout or programming, but certainly not the first plus the second plus the third, and also the search for customers in their free time.  In the latter case, the person simply begins to "spray" on different professions and as a result becomes a layman in all of them.  In addition, too much depends on the person and this is a real risk for the project to be overwhelmed in the event of illness / strike / dismissal of that person. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  What do we see in freelancing if a single freelancer works?  At a minimum, every professional, besides his main job, performs the duties of a client search manager and a project manager (customer reports, policy screening, sometimes even the role of a link between team members).  I described above why this is an unfortunate organizational decision.

      I have only one solution - to join freelancers into groups.  It is the group, not the studio because  working in a studio freelancer becomes an ordinary hired worker with remote employment.  These associations can be built like construction brigades that sababil in Soviet times.  The basic principles may be as follows: <br><br><ol><li>  Prior to the start of work, which of the team members will work on which area will be fully signed.  Suppose if you need to administer something, then it should be clear what kind of OS it will be, what version of the kernel (at least approximately), what will be the hardware on which the project should rise and what processes in the system should work and interact.  Similarly, the applicant for the position of designer will be provided with the scheme of the site or a complete list of functionality that must be supported by the result of his work.  Only in this case, the applicant for a role in the team will be able to objectively assess their abilities and provide evidence of their competence. </li><li>  Before the start of the project, the profit sharing scheme is fully agreed.  Each team member must know who and how much will receive.  Any darkness in this matter will envy.  If someone is not enough, then let it happen before the start of work, and not after.  Finding a replacement for an employee before the project starts will be much easier (more time to search for an employee and to get used to the rest of the team) and cheaper (cost ~ urgency). <br>  An important detail in this paragraph is the openness of the agreement with the customer for all team members.  In this case, all team members will be aware of all amounts and terms associated with the project. </li><li>  The person initiating the creation of a team is its first member.  A person has the right to create a team only if he can assume the role of one of the team members.  All other team members are added only at the invitation of one of the existing team members.  At the entrance of each participant in the team, he is obliged to provide evidence of his competence in the role for which he claims.  A candidate may be rejected by at least 40 percent of the votes in open voting. </li><li>  Each member of the team signs in with the entry into it under the consent to make a profit after the completion of all the work on the project, and not at the end of its section of work.  This condition solves the problem of the loss of unscrupulous designers and layout designers in the event of problems with the design or layout at the later stages of work.  The same applies to programmers who have a tendency to refuse to correct errors or resolve issues with deploying applications on hosting. </li><li>  All communication between team members and between the team and the customer is made in a separate Skype conference.  For the convenience of tracking decisions, all communication is conducted in chat mode.  A running conference does not stop until the project is completed.  Any decisions related to important issues for the project (adding / excluding participants, architecture, etc.) are discussed only in the conference dedicated to the project.  Any decisions and votes taken outside the main conference are considered invalid and should not be implemented.  An alternative to Skype conference can be any other tool that provides support for a dozen simultaneous users, cross-platform, and preservation of message history. </li><li>  The penalty sanction applied to each participant is only one: the exclusion from the team and the deprivation of all profits from the project.  A penalty is applied in case of non-fulfillment of a customer‚Äôs requirement from the list of requirements specified in clause 1. If the customer has declared such non-fulfillment, a vote (open) is announced on the issue of excluding a member from the team.  To exclude you need at least 60% of the votes of team members.  20% of the profit of the person who invited the trade-injured participant is transferred to the customer in the form of compensation for moral damage and for the inevitable delay in the delivery of the project. </li></ol><br><br>  This can be considered a sketch of the statute of such shabashek.  Of course, each shabashka has the right to create its own charters and make changes to this option, but not one shabashka can exist without such a list of rules and no project can be started without notifying the customer about these rules. <br><br>  What advantages will such or a similar organization have over studios or offices?  Openness of profit distribution principles.  The participants of such an organization have no reason to think about a colleague who unfairly receives three times more money.  All these moments are clarified at the time of the invitation to the team.  Agreed - work and do not arise.  Did not agree - goodbye. <br><br>  What are the benefits for freelance singles?  Opportunity to work in their narrow specialty without spraying on others.  This guarantees higher productivity and therefore higher returns. <br><br>  What are the benefits for the customer?  The openness of the development process and the possibility of instant communication with each participant in this process in the conference.  The guarantee that a decision made by one team member will not conflict with the interests of another member. <br><br>  In a separate paragraph, I repeat that the decision does not claim to be ideal.  Descriptions of alternative solutions in the comments are welcome. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41130/</a></p>
