  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to change MSI boards on Cougar Point chipsets in Ukraine</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Surely everyone has already heard <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/112926/">about the problem with Intel chipsets for the new LGA 1155 platform</a> .  As promised, the defective board began to be exchanged for new ones. <br><br>  On May 10, 2011, on the website of the Ukrainian representative office of MSI, <a href="http://ua.msi.com/news/index.php%3Fcommand%3DshowNews%26newsID%3D139">there was a press release</a> about the start of the program for exchanging problem motherboards for new ones.  It seems that everything is great fees change, but there are some, not the most pleasant, features. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, following the instructions in the press release, I turned to the store where I took the fee by email.  I was quickly answered by telling the mechanics of the exchange: <ol><li>  Partner accepts stepping (B2) motherboards from end-users (motherboard, passport photocopy) </li><li>  Partner sends request to MSI </li><li>  Representation identifies the motherboard, confirms the willingness to replace. </li><li>  The partner sends the declared motherboards to the office of the Ukrainian representative office. </li><li>  After the responsible staff of the representative office of the motherboard, MSI gives the official written permission to the partner for the free issuance of a new fee to the consumer and orders the distributor to ship the specified number of motherboards (B3) to the partners for replacement. </li></ol>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Here it is necessary to make a digression telling how the replacement of boards took place in civilized European countries, which began almost a month earlier: <ol><li>  The consumer informs about the replacement of the card on the website, indicating the serial number, his contact details and the place of purchase. </li><li>  MSI identifies the fees and sends (instructs the distributor) the fees to the store where the user bought the fee. </li><li>  Upon receipt of the payment, the shop informs the consumer about the availability of the payment in the shop </li><li>  The consumer comes to the store and exchanges the old fee for a new one and remains satisfied </li></ol><br><br>  The difference is noticeable to the naked eye.  Firstly, for some time you will have to live without a computer, secondly, you will have to visit the store twice, that is, you have to take time off from work 2 times. <br><br>  Well, I thought, I need to do something, so I sent a letter to the store with a passport scan and a photo of the board sticker, to which I quickly received an answer: <br><blockquote>  MSI confirmed the replacement, you need a mother from you to transfer it to MSI. <br>  <b>Replacement will be in 2 weeks.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is absurd‚Äù - I thought.  Not only will I lose time on the exchange of fees, I also have to part with the computer for two weeks, which means material losses for me, because  at home I earn a little money.  Impressed by the answer, I quickly unsubscribed me with a request to somehow shorten the procedure and hinted that I would be completely satisfied with the way they do in civilized countries.  The answer was not long in coming (good, but traditionally): <br><blockquote>  Replacing goes according to the ISI program. Some boards are replaced with new stepping. </blockquote><br><br>  Well, actually nothing new, so I decided to go directly to the MSI office, in the hope that they would be in my position.  Surprisingly, I did not have to wait long for a response from them either, since  I wrote the answer at the end of the working day, then I was answered the next morning: <br><blockquote>  Terms of exchange for all the same. <br>  1. During the week, the dealer collects motherboards. <br>  2. At the end of the week sends a request with the number of motherboards, models and serial numbers. <br>  3. At the beginning of the new week gets a replacement at the office.  distributor regarding the filed list. </blockquote>  and a small additive: <br><blockquote>  If you do not want to give a fee and wait a week, then arrange with the dealer that you give it to him before he will transfer it to the distributor. </blockquote><br><br>  It seems that everything is fine, but literally in the process of writing this post I got a call from the store, telling me that the minimum exchange time would even be a week (as I understood it, the news came from MSI). <br><br>  In a week of idle time, I will lose more than the cost, so the proposed option is not acceptable to me.  Having bought the board in total, I received hemorrhoids in its exchange, it seems the only acceptable way out is to buy a new board on the B3 stepping (most likely Asus P8Z68-V PRO, MSI is dead for me), to pass the exchange fee without any consequences, and after receiving the return fee to sell it at the flea market. <br><br>  Conclusions that I made: <ul><li>  The Ukrainian representative office of MSI is pretending to care for the client, and in fact, they put it.  They decided not to complicate their lives, so they took the simplest path. </li><li>  Looks like I'll be back to competitor products again. </li><li>  I‚Äôm too naive because I thought that <a href="http://ua.msi.com/news/index.php%3Fcommand%3DshowNews%26newsID%3D116">‚ÄúMSI cares about the quality of its products and the well-being of its customers.‚Äù</a> </li></ul><br><br>  PS How is the exchange of "potentially defective" in other CIS countries, as well as other manufacturers in Ukraine? <br>  PPS Appreciate the employees of both the store and the MSI office for a quick response <br>  PPPS <b>Taki received a replacement, waited a little more than 3 weeks, so that the chosen one, even with the purchase of the Z68, was correct.</b>  <b>The resulting nurse on the new stepping successfully sold.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120019/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120019/</a></p>
