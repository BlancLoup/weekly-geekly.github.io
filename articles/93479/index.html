  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 most attractive categories of software for beginners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We at <a href="http://ingria-startup.ru/">Ingria Business Incubator have</a> quite a lot of contact with various projects, mostly IT workers, who want to take part in one of our programs or simply come to talk at various events.  Many of them are unique and truly innovative, some of them are somewhat similar to Western startups in the original idea or even sometimes in implementation.  And while processing applications for the <a href="http://www.web-ready.ru/">Web Ready</a> contest, we noticed some patterns in Internet projects.  And recently I stumbled upon an article in which <a href="http://twitter.com/dharmesh">Dharmesh Shah</a> highlighted the unchanging types of applications that <a href="http://twitter.com/dharmesh">startups</a> are developing.  Each time they resort to one of these types.  ‚ÄúIt's not that this is bad, I just found it curious,‚Äù he says.  Well, yes, then the translation ( <a href="http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/11978/The-10-Most-Tempting-Software-Startup-Categories.aspx">original</a> ) of this small note. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ca9/e46/1ec/ca9e461ec8b960905f9a3f45d35610db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  1. Project Management / Time Distribution / Search for program errors (Project Management / Time Tracking / Bug Tracking) </h5><br>  Probably the developer is not satisfied with the program that he has to use, and he has thoughts like ‚ÄúHey, I can do something better in a week, and it will do exactly what I want and that satisfies my needs.  It will support custom fields, query-by-example, persistent view and other elegant things. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  2. Communities / Forums (Community / Discussion Forums) </h5><br>  The developer has created a new online community on an interesting topic.  I stumbled here and there, but did not find anything normal and suitable.  ‚ÄúHey, it's simple, the data model is trivial and I can use this project to study this new structure that I have long wanted to play with.‚Äù <br><br><h5>  3. Personalized News Aggregation / Filtering Aggregators </h5><br>  I'm not exactly sure why it still continues to appear.  I think the reason is that a normal person can not perceive such a large amount of information that is now in the network.  And this is an obvious problem.  The start-uper understands how to better filter information: there may be voting / learning mechanisms, social features (your friends like it, so you too). <br><br><h5>  4. Content Management (website, blog) </h5><br>  Another seemingly simple type of applications (‚Äúhow difficult can it be?‚Äù) Is more difficult to study some existing system and make it do what you want, rather than hastily building your ‚Äúminimalist‚Äù application (which over time, it will become less and less minimal). <br><br><h5>  5. Voting and Reviews (Social Voting and Reviews) </h5><br>  This is a new type.  These applications allow users to vote / rate / post reviews about something (movies, books, wines and anything else). <br><br><h5>  6. Applications for various events (Music / Events Location Application) </h5><br>  What the world really needs is to know when their favorite band is going to come to the city.  Connect with friends!  Find out where they will go!  Meet up <br><br><h5>  7. Dating and contacting (Dating and Match-Making) </h5><br>  This does not require an explanation.  As with most applications, start-ups often like to ‚Äúscratch something that is already itching.‚Äù <br><br><h5>  8. Personal Information Management </h5><br>  I think this is one of the most frequently encountered applications, as it is created when you learn something new in programming.  ‚ÄúHey, I can use this new ORM system to create my own DVD collection.  And it only takes 50 lines of code. ‚Äù <br><br><h5>  9. Social Network for ... (Social Network) </h5><br>  They appeared long before MySpace and Facebook.  In this case, the application is not so trivial, but this is what makes them a little more attractive.  Data models can be inexhaustible and if the application has a good interface, it will be an application that will be a pleasure to work with. <br><br><h5>  10. Photo / Video / Bookmarks / Anything for sharing (Photo / video / bookmark / whatever sharing) </h5><br>  We like sharing information.  The appeal of this application is precisely its wide appeal ‚Äúhi, my friend needs to somehow share photos from her recent trip to Brazil‚Äù. <br><br>  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that if you create an application in any of these categories, it will be doomed to failure.  I just find it curious that these types tend to repeat again and again. <br><br>  Did I miss something?  Are you currently working on a project that falls into one of the above categories? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93479/</a></p>
