Since then, the designers have taken root in the design community that all fish texts should always look natural and attractive. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We also try to make such a fish so that we can laugh heartily over it along with the customer.  If there are texts prepared for the site, then we use them.  Or write yourself a few paragraphs on the topic, often they are then used. <br><br>  But sometimes this fish can annoy itself.  In the case of increased inadequacy of individual representatives of the customer, a coherent text, as it turned out, is harmful.

      Once we made a corporate identity and a site for a subsidiary of one well-known Russian holding.  As a result of intracorporate intrigues (oh, this is a topic that deserves a separate note), I had to speak in front of people whose meeting was not supposed to take place. <br><br>  The foreign executive director with whom we worked on the project flew off on a business trip to another continent, leaving us alone with the management board. <br><br>  Despite the all-Russian (yes, perhaps, world-wide) fame of the holding and progressive foreign CEO, the office itself remained completely soviet.  The management board has also chosen the appropriate one.  To take part in the discussion of the layout was even aunt-manager of the farm (proudly referred to as deputy for AHC). <br><br>  Opportunities to abandon this meeting was not.  On the agenda - a discussion of layouts. <br><br>  The number and quality of participants was a surprise to me.  Yes, and previous work on the corporate style did not cause any difficulties, and therefore the layout was prepared together with a PR manager and practically agreed upon texts. <br><br>  The discussion of the layout was reduced to the discussion of texts. <br><br>  - And we will soon open two more objects, we need to change the number. <br>  - And let's rephrase here. <br>  - Can I change the title here? <br><br>  Attempts to return the management board to a constructive dialogue did not lead to anything.  Every minute, we still fell into a discussion of the texts.  I tried in vain to explain that this is a mock-up, that we are not discussing the texts, but the design, that the content of the site is still being written by the PR service, that the content can be edited directly on the site. <br><br>  Some readers, probably, already had insight.  Like, it was necessary to put a completely left text.  Nothing like this!  Read on. <br><br>  Was on the layout of the block with the <a href="" rel="external">left text</a> .  When the management board, overwhelmed by the creative impulse, got to him, he heard exclamations: <br><br>  - What is it? <br>  - What is this nonsense? <br>  - What does this have to do with our company? <br>  - Why is the boat in the picture? <br>  - <em>Are you not prepared the texts?</em> <br><br>  The last remark, by the way, was thrown by a man who knew that we should not prepare texts.  He had his own motives. <br><br>  My explanations about the nature and purpose of the fish text, apparently, will remain a secret for several representatives of the management board until the end of the days.  One of the instigators of internal corporate intrigue tried to take advantage of this (oh, what kind of groups there were), proposing to ‚Äúterminate the contract‚Äù.  Fortunately, this citizen was able to calm down. <br><br>  Everything ended well, and I learned some lessons from this story: <br><br><ul><li>  First of all, even if you work with a well-known company and a progressive foreign director, you can expect a terrible situation in a dark corner. <del>  scoop </del>  management board.  Your plans can upset office intrigues in the customer‚Äôs camp.  By the will of a ridiculous case, mock-ups will probably have to be discussed with people who are incompetent in this case. </li><li>  Secondly, we have included in the contract a clause on the composition and number of persons authorized to discuss anything with us.  And if the customer tries to change this item, <a href="http://blog.studiomade.ru/articles/business/anti-discount/"><b>we put the price and terms in direct dependence on it</b></a> . </li><li>  Thirdly, if there is reason to suspect some of the participants in the discussion are inadequate, use such a fish text that they will not read.  Lorem ipsum, for example. </li></ul><br><br>  Fortunately, since then, we have not had to face a similar situation.  Perhaps due to the changes made to the contract and the preliminary conversation, which we will necessarily conduct with the customer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54584/</a></p>
