There is something better. </p><br><p>  The fact is that before <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">Mobius 2017 Moscow there are</a> only a couple of days left, and the time has come to announce the opening of the <strong>free broadcast of the main track</strong> !  Under the cut - a small <em>changelog</em> , a link to YouTube, the official Telegram channel and a brief overview of the program of the first track. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/dl/jk/aadljkr75ejipqs_16knp8d4cxq.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The mobile market is developing so rapidly that in order to appeal to users, it is not enough to develop just a good application or organize a good conference.  It is necessary to focus on the audience, to respond flexibly and quickly to its needs.  One of the main needs of the Hubs community is the opportunity to see the conference remotely and in good quality. <br><br>  About the quality.  Since <a href="http://2017.mobiusconf.com/">April Mobius</a> half a year has passed, and we thoroughly worked on the bugs.  In <em>general, all the</em> reviews of all conference participants who watched the broadcast were analyzed.  Corrected, of course, not all, but much.  To begin with, half of the respondents (42%) did <strong>not</strong> even <strong>notice any problems</strong> - but we know!  Microphones will work better, the sound will be cleaner, stability is higher (thanks to the efforts of our friends from <a href="http://sbtg.ru/">SBTG.ru</a> , who have even moved to a more fault-tolerant data center for this). <br><br>  In the intervals between presentations, when speakers and participants on the site are removed to the discussion areas, we show the audience of the online broadcast news reports about the off-session events of the conference and take fascinating interviews with speakers and interesting guests.  <strong>Interviews will be more lively</strong> : in the intervals between the reports there will be two presenters ( <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/phillennium/">@phillennium</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/olegchir/">@olegchir</a> , you can regularly see our posts on Habr√©).  Minor technical inconsistencies are put on tighter controls.

      Participants' questions ( <em>those who watch for free, too</em> ) are now taken into account, you can ask them in the <a href="https://t.me/mobiusconf">official Telegram-group of the</a> conference.  It is recommended to understand Telegram in advance.  Right now <a href="https://telegram.org/">go and install</a> it! <br><br>  Actually, very soon you will be able to see what happened with us - <strong>on November 11 at 9:40 in the morning we will start the free broadcast of the main track Mobius 2017 Moscow</strong> .  And it will be in the resolution of <strong>1440r</strong> , so that for once you need your cool monitors.  It is important that the resolution was raised not just for the sake of the video quality race, but with a very specific purpose: the extra space is used to display the speaker itself next to the screen (which is displayed in 1080p) - the camera will no longer jump between the slides and the presenter. <br><br><h1>  How to connect </h1><br>  Just open YouTube in a browser, mobile device or whatever you like.

That is, they, of course, will, but only for conference participants who have left feedback.  And for all the others, we traditionally post them in 3-4 months. </li><li>  You cannot watch what happens in other halls.  And there will be many interesting things.  Next time register and watch everything without restrictions. </li></ul><br><h1>  Program </h1><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1k/rb/ep/1krbepmoc3nvnurhmb9jtlaa_le.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/7ewhxk5ohg28asgu6scqw8/"><b>Vladimir @dzigoro Ivanov - The Void of Heritage: A Strategy for Drastic Improvements in the Project</b></a> <br>  Vladimir is one of the fairly frequent guests of our conferences, and his position as lead developer in EPAM is not the reason.  It‚Äôs all about using the range of interests ( <b>Android, React, iOS, Web</b> ) and the speaker‚Äôs no less interesting background (started as a <b>Java EE</b> engineer, but got carried away with mobile technologies ‚Äúand rolled‚Äù). <br>  To begin with we dissolve the mat.  apparatus (from the word "mat", not "mathematics").  Let's sort out " <b>Legacy</b> ".  Every developer has to deal with it constantly.  Moreover, each new project becomes legacy over time, if not enough attention is paid to technical debt.  The report will talk about how to live with a particularly neglected case, aka a project of more than 5 years of age. <br><br>  We will find out: <br><br><ul><li>  how to realize the size of the debt; </li><li>  how to come up with a refactoring plan; </li><li>  hold it as painlessly as possible. </li></ul><br>  The code will be in <b>Java</b> , but there is almost no specificity for <b>Android</b> , so it will be interesting for engineers of both platforms. <br>  It is a little theory, a lot of practice, a pinch of statistics, not boring pictures - everything, as you like. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3z/2q/v5/3z2qv58e8cbfwsc-ksbrhgmmojg.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2zbpb5p9awemu42sucew2o/"><b>Maxim @max_sokolov Sokolov - Messenger inside out, or How to make an instant messenger today in a mobile iOS application</b></a> <br>  Imagine that instead of tearing off a piece of paper with a phone from an ad at the entrance, you can take a smartphone and immediately write to the owner directly, specifying the status, without worrying about the problem ‚Äúdoes not take the pipe, got it, sold it,‚Äù etc. <br>  To get such a messenger, Maxim Sokolov, like Team Lead in <i>Avito</i> , had to go through all the serious things, from a simple <b>HTTP-API</b> to using web sockets, learning about the pros, cons, and pitfalls of various approaches.  Maxim will share how his team designed the client-server <b>API</b> and how <b>Swift</b> helped with this.  You will learn how to guarantee the delivery of messages to customers, online user statuses, message statuses and other functions of modern instant messengers and their implementation. <br><br>  Messengers are developing rapidly and new functionality needs to be added quickly.  The report will explain how to build a scalable architecture that makes it easy to add new chips. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sn/ng/m5/snngm5znbs6al4nbsh26ogrkgbs.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/1viu3dhu7esqsagsugeaco/"><b>Yevgeny @ptiz Kamyshanov - Life without connection: from chaos to consensus</b></a> <br>  Too many historical references are obtained during the review.  But what to do, the story moves in a spiral: ‚Äúapplications on the desktop tend to work in the cloud regardless of the local memory‚Äù, ‚Äúapplications on the phone gradually acquire more and more offline functionality.‚Äù <br><br>  Good or not, it will be possible to discuss with Evgeny Kamyshanov from <i>EPAM</i> after its practical demonstration of this phenomenon during the report. <br>  With all this, being a <b>Lead iOS developer</b> at <i>EPAM</i> in St. Petersburg, the speaker does not believe in silver bullets and struggles with perfectionism as much as he can. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/st/ao/nv/staonvjyxl0pqtnr0vcwpj_fpto.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/q7ujap5oscugoks4uwemm/"><b>Alexander @zlx Zimin - Let's Design the UI Correctly</b></a> <br>  Several months have already passed since we interviewed Alexander, who can be read <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/334244/">here</a> .  The information in the article will make it possible to present the speaker many times better than the thousand extra marks in the review, so let's proceed directly to the report. <br><br>  In the report, Alexander will talk about approaches to the development of <b>UI</b> , which allow new developers to make changes without rewriting the code and reusing the written components. <br><br>  Also part of the report will be devoted to <b>Atomic Design</b> .  Many popular applications use non-standard visual components, and the <i>Badoo</i> team is no exception.  To prevent this from creating a lot of headaches for designers and developers, they had to work out a solution, which will be presented in the report. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2y/yw/gl/2yywgl9zqgvn_qga5ggsybmqids.png">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2bu0yhbp3kqui0eyu08u84/"><b>Gleb @Novixon Novik - Service Layer Architecture Using Composite Operations</b></a> <br>  Surely many people know the podcast about Podlodka mobile development.  It is led by Gleb Novik, the author of the <abbr title="https://github.com/strongself/COOperation">COOperation</abbr> framework. <br>  Gleb's report will be built around a common way to build the service layer of an application ‚Äî this is using <b>GCD</b> mechanisms to create asynchronous interaction of components.  Many people think, but very few people use in practice the full power of the <b>NSOperation</b> and <b>NSOperationQueue classes</b> for this task. <br><br>  Through careful decomposition and minor refinement of these classes, you can get an extremely flexible and portable component that will become a true friend when you create new services.  Gleb will talk about how you can use composite operations when building a service layer and how the <b>COOperation</b> framework developed by him can help. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/dd/e6/qsdde6axqjwl6d18_deuis3ycqs.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/2mdvnkwcssioquwmgykq08/"><b>Dmitry @handamade Kurkin - Optimizing Application Size</b></a> <br>  So, what do you associate the sound <b>"oh-oh"</b> ?  Of course, it‚Äôs not worth talking about everyone, but for those who started before the iPhone came, this is the sound of a single messenger, which, by celebrity, was comparable to the current Telegram. <br><br>  What is this all about?  Dmitry has 12 years of experience in developing instant messengers for various platforms.  The last 5 years doing iOS-client for <b>ICQ</b> (the sound "oh-oh") in the post team lead. <br>  Consider what the size of the application on iOS is made of and how this size can be reduced.  Here are some experiments to clarify what the size of the application in the AppStore ultimately takes, and tell you about the tools that will help you find extra data and determine the most voluminous parts of the program code. <br><hr><br><img align="left" width="180" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/li/cm/hulicmdpkhyn9vjwtkbp09h3jio.jpeg">  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2017/msk/talks/1o9avlthcy6mu0gecymec6/"><b>Jonathan Levin - How to whip a new feature yourself and not be killed by your manager</b></a> <br>  Have you ever had a situation when you work in a company on an application, and suddenly you get the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa new cool feature?  You understand, here it is - a turning point, but when you seek support and approval for the development, you are faced with an obstacle: "We do not have the resources," or "At the moment we have other priorities." <br><br>  Employees who are familiar with the company's product are best suited to inventing and designing the best features for an application, but sometimes the company's policies and procedures are in the way.  But where there is a desire, there are opportunities!  Rebels and insurgents conquer the world - The Empire must fall!  If you know that this feature is important, but you do not have permission to continue, you will have to carefully balance between creative freedom and respect for the priorities of your company. <br><br>  In this report, Jonathan will share how he developed the feature without permission and how he was not fired / crippled / killed. <br><br>  Jonathan is one of the leading Israeli mobile developers, part of the elite Google Developer Experts team.  He played a key role in the success of Gett, who collected more than $ 500 million, and also received funding from his startup KolGene, which is gaining popularity with the genetic market connector.  Being a loyal supporter of mobile and product management, Jonathan is also very enthusiastic about the backend.  As an accomplished developer and entrepreneur, he knows exactly how to turn smart ideas into a profitable product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341908/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341908/</a></p>
