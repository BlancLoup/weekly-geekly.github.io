The reason for this is the fact that all enterprises are trying to introduce computational and storage capacities closer to the place where data is generated.  In addition, the density of data and computing power is constantly increasing - there is no need for large sizes.  Now the majority of data centers of <b><a href="https://vps.house/">VPS</a></b> service providers (virtual servers) do not represent rooms larger than 1 room. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The so-called micromodular data processing centers (MMDC) are not something supernova, nor are they the only solution to the problem of geodistribution of data processing.  However, according to the research company 451 Research, over the past three years, the popularity of micromodular data centers has increased, and the cumulative annual growth rate was 42%.  It is quite possible that sales of MMDC in 2018 reached almost the sum of 30 million US dollars (compared to 2017, this figure varied in the limit of 18 million dollars).  Despite the not so extensive market, MMDC sales in 2018 will include about 2,000 new installations, in addition they will become an integral part of expensive projects.

      Daniel Bizo, senior analyst for data center technologies at 451 Research, said that so far micromodules are not in the public domain.  However, according to him, such a product has a huge growth potential, and not only because absolutely new technologies are used there, but because in the future with the help of micromodules many problems can be solved and the demand for highly distributed capacity can be met. <br><br>  The pursuit of localized computing resources grows as companies move their digital initiatives.  Businesses are struggling with bandwidth limitations and trying to reduce response times for delayed applications per millisecond.  In industrial environments, companies need local data storage and processing capabilities to make the most of intelligent data processing systems.  Telecom companies and content distributors seek to more effectively deploy and manage peripheral computing solutions in response to the demand for digital services. <br><br>  According to Bizo, digitization of the physical world will require huge amounts of storage, so micromodules should be the first step to ensure this process. <br><br><h4>  What are micromodular data centers? </h4><br>  A micromodular data center, in essence, is a device encapsulated in its own protective shell.  Climate control, power distribution and network connection are built into the subassembly, as well as other functions, such as physical protection, fire extinguishing system, damping and protection against electromagnetic interference. <br><br>  The case of a micromodular data center is located inside its own shell (encapsulated and with a closed loop), but in terms of its functionality it is not inferior to the data centers that are standard in the understanding of the inhabitants.  Therefore, it is not surprising that this technology can help solve the problem of deploying portable IT facilities. <br><br>  Currently, compact, solid-state technical devices are widely used, and server racks or rooms can be found in almost any branch of any company.  VPS providers also keep up with them, maximally optimizing the expenditure part and more and more dumping prices for their services.  This is especially true of virtual servers running Windows Server - this is <a href="https://vps.house/">VPS Windows</a> Micro-modular data centers differ from traditional ways.  At the product level, they are more carefully designed and integrated, as opposed to typical IT racks or server. <br><br>  When considering what infrastructure requirements need to be used in a decentralized approach to IT technologies, many companies are faced with the fact that in most cases their existing distributed capacities are subject to decommissioning or upgrade.  Most of the existing sites are not suitable for digital services, because they do not have the necessary reliability, stability and protection. <br><br>  Another advantage of micromodular data centers is their ease of deployment.  According to Bizo, testing and integration of micromodular data center components is carried out by the supplier and its channel partners, which significantly speeds up their deployment.  Since all parts are prefabricated and self-contained, therefore, less labor is required.  This is especially attractive for financial services companies.  For example, for banks, the main advantage of micromodular data centers is their predictability and the ability to exercise continuous monitoring.  After all, the fact that there is an opportunity to test and assemble everything in one place and then send it under protection to another place and install it looks much more attractive than launching the whole project: hiring contractors in the right place, long-term work, building and staffing the premises, and more. .d <br><br>  Another distinctive feature of a micromodular data center from typical IT racks or server stands is that the decision to deploy micromodular data centers is always carefully weighed and planned.  The use of micromodules will make the deployment more strategic, and as a result become part of a larger architecture. <br><br><h4>  Who manufactures micromodular data centers? </h4><br>  Micromodular data centers have different sizes.  For each case, the company can deploy different variants of the data center: put one rack for local file caching or configure several racks to create a high-performance computing cluster.  In the end, the company can combine a group of racks to create a larger micromodular unit with a capacity of tens to hundreds of kilowatts. <br><br>  Since the second half of 2016, the number of manufacturers of micromodular data centers has increased markedly.  For example, the company STULZ, an expert in the field of systems for the control of environmental parameters, offers the STULZ Micro DC line, which includes three racks that can be scaled to fit (in the photo at the beginning of the article). <br><br>  The company Instant Data Centers, located in Tempe, Arizona, offers its line of microdata centers, including built-in cooling, fire safety, shock and vibration isolation, as well as a standard waterproof jacket. <br>  Schneider Electric, in turn, offers its modular microdata center, which includes power, cooling, security, and appropriate infrastructure management, in addition, it has the ability to scale up to 100 kilowatts.  HP introduced the micro-modular data center HPE Micro Datacenter, which includes the advantages of several developments.  The project is a storage, network computing solutions from HPE, coupled with a secure case, UPS, power distribution, cooling and monitoring systems from Schneider Electric. <br><br>  According to Bizo, technologies such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning, cloud-based VPS / VDS ‚Äî north, etc., can provoke a demand for micromodular data centers.  And telecommunications service providers, in order to optimize their networks and the digital services running on them, need more computational units and storages that could be deployed in networks of telecom operators.  Of course, let's not get ahead of ourselves and talk about speed, but it will be a shame if micromodular data centers do not go beyond the current speed of work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345050/</a></p>
