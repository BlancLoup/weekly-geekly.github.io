On behalf of all the participants I want to say a huge thank you to the organizers of the event.  In my opinion, everything went pretty well.  The room was excellent, coffee and cakes were also excellent, and the speakers, in the end, pleased us with their performances. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Now I would like to dwell on the performances themselves. <br><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/27/11/2711b4942edbca8e18b159c9daad819b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The first to speak was Sergey Khomenkov with his report <b>‚ÄúSimple Content Delivery Network with his own hands‚Äù</b> <br>  Sergey told us that, actually, it is CDN, told about load distribution between servers and geo-balancing. <br>  The main motto of the report may be: ‚ÄúCDN is easy.‚Äù <br>  The next in line was Kirill Zorin with his <b>‚ÄúDesigning and refactoring web applications in PHP‚Äù</b> <br>  Overall, the report is good.  Kirill tried to combine several topics at once in his speech, as a result of which the report seemed a bit drawn out. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4a/ab/4aab3f08c04ff56ae85cd833b418023d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Next on the list is the report <b>‚ÄúFree Traffic from the Yandex Home Page.</b>  <b>How to get more? ‚Äù</b> This topic was highlighted to us by Yandex employee Alexander Nikolaenko. <br>  Alexander told what a widget is and why it is needed.  He told about the regional program of widgets, and about how, in fact, to create a widget.

    <br>  Dmitry Kirilkin made a presentation on <b>"Features of doing business on the Internet"</b> <br>  Dmitry told us about how to attract traffic to the site, about factors affecting the position of the site in search engines, about advertising campaigns. <br>  An original question was asked from the audience: ‚ÄúDoes your work make the Internet better?‚Äù 50 over 50 - answered Dmitry. <br><br>  After Dmitri's speech, we listened to the report by Andrey Kholmanyuk <b>‚ÄúVector graphics in interactive web applications‚Äù.</b> <br>  Andrew told us about SVG, VML and showed some examples. <br><br>  Then came the report on <b>project management by</b> Dmitry Chistov <b>.</b> <br>  The report was very good, many questions were considered.  For example, one of them is scheduling (Gantt chart).  Dmitry also spoke about the tools that are used to perform the tasks mentioned in the report. <br><br>  Yury Pavlov demonstrated the <b>‚ÄúBeHistory‚Äù</b> historical informational informational project <b>.</b>  The goal of the project is to create some kind of information base in the field of historical sciences, and provide a tool for working with it.  The project is quite interesting and I really hope that the guys will succeed.  You can now take a look, so to speak, at a rudimentary version.  The project is available at <a href="http://behistory.ru/">behistory.ru</a> <br><br>  Dmitry Pavlenko told how to make money on flash games.  His report is called: <b>"Earn on flash games"</b> <br>  The report examined the ways of earning a developer of flash games, the main types of sponsorship and much more. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e3/79/e379e85af33536c91a57df796ed8c158.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The next speaker was Andrei Zaitsev with his report <b>‚ÄúDesigning User Interfaces‚Äù.</b> <br>  For the uninitiated listeners at the beginning were given the basic concepts: HCI, Usability, GUI, UI, UX.  Andrew spoke about the process of developing the interface, showed examples of bad and good decisions about the software that is used in the design.  At the end of the report he advised several conferences and gave a list of references which, if desired, can be read.  Here are a few books whose names I remembered: Jeff Raskin's Interface and Alan Cooper's Interface. <br><br>  The last at the conference was Andrei Petrenko.  With the report <b>"Methods of website optimization and their application."</b> <br><br>  Thank you for reading my little review. <br>  Presentations of reports are available on the <a href="http://webday.info/">official conference website</a> . <br>  As for the video, it was noticed by me that in the hall several people filmed the entire conference on camera.  I really hope that this video will soon be available online. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95874/</a></p>
