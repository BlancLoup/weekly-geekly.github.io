  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Butterfly Effect</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I once wrote, <i>who wants - he is looking for opportunities, who does not want - is looking for reasons</i> .  I used to think that this statement is valid in 99.9% of cases, but recently my opinion has changed a bit. <br><br>  Have you ever thought about the reasons why some people blog, write podcasts, webcasts, speak at events, while others limit themselves to viewing them and sometimes stingy commenting?  Such reasons may be minimal knowledge of sabzh, lack of experience, etc.  Lack of interest, understanding the usefulness of the process and laziness can also be such reasons, but now it‚Äôs not about them. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As I began to notice, the main reason is the <i>fear of being ridiculed, the fear of making a mistake and looking ridiculous in the eyes of the public</i> , and often just a <i>panic fear of the audience</i> .

      After several conversations with different people, I realized that they would be glad to write or do something, but ... they are afraid of the negative reaction of the ‚Äúgreat and terrible gurus‚Äù who simply overwhelmed our Internet.  At Habr√© it manifests itself in the form of fear to pick up minuses in karma, on the forums - fear of making a mistake and giving the wrong answer, on speaking - fear of being ridiculed by those present; ". <br><br>  As a result, we have the following logic: <i>less sparkle - fewer problems</i> .  This is a completely wrong approach.  After all, any experience, even a negative one, is an experience.  <i>I can say by myself that I have a lot more positive experience, and at the same time I am well aware that without him everything would have been different.</i> <br><br>  Let's look at some typical scenarios: <br><br>  <b>I will not translate this article because I don‚Äôt know English perfectly and can be mistaken</b> <br>  The only mistake is that you did not translate this article.  Firstly, many people do not know a foreign language at all (many do not even know their own), and secondly, having written 5 ridiculous translations, you are guaranteed to see the result in the sixth or seventh translation. <br><br>  <b>I will write, and suddenly it will not be interesting to anyone?</b> <br>  I wonder how you will find out without writing anything? <br><br>  <b>Everyone knows that !!!</b> <br>  According to the observations, the main attendance falls on articles like ‚Äúsomething for dummies‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to set up mail‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to go to the toilet‚Äù, while there are very few complex technical articles.  Therefore, if you write something small and useful, then surely they will say thank you. <br><br>  The term ‚Äúbutterfly effect‚Äù refers to a property of some chaotic systems, where a slight effect on a system can have large and unpredictable effects somewhere else and at another time.  Thus, a random blog post can lead to an employer, help you find a colleague or partner, a performance can positively affect your future activities, and a casual acquaintance can completely change your life. <br><br>  The main thing to overcome your fear and very soon you will see that you yourself are a terrible and unique guru :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85875/</a></p>
