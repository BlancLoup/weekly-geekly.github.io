      <b>Price drop</b> <br><br>  One of the main conditions contributing to the global transition of enterprises to virtual desktops is the elimination of the price barrier.  At a conference in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãCitrix spoke about expanding the ‚Äújob transformation‚Äù model with innovative tools and features that should help IT implement virtual desktops, while significantly reducing infrastructure development costs. <br><br>  As the main tools designed to reduce the cost of implementing virtualization systems in large, medium and small businesses, Citrix plans to use: <br><br>  <b>SoC technology implementation</b> <br><br>  An important announcement at Citrix Synergy was the introduction of an initiative called ‚ÄúCitrix HDX Ready System-on-Chip (SoC)‚Äù, aimed at creating a new generation of client devices that will differ not only in low-value, but also in the ability to provide users with access to virtual workers tables, with support for multimedia content. <br><br>  This initiative will allow you to move away from stereotypes and work with virtual desktops not only on traditional devices - personal computers, tablet PCs and smartphones, but also on mobile phones, smart keyboards, set-top boxes and express payment terminals.  In this case, all these devices will be able to display virtual desktops, in the form in which users are accustomed to seeing them on their desktops and provide the most extensive possibilities for working with multimedia data. <br><br>  To implement this project, Citrix is ‚Äã‚Äãplanning to implement HDX technology directly into the chip.  The new computing system will be delivered to manufacturers of end equipment in the form of a separate chip designed for client devices, and the first samples with integrated technology on the HDX chip will appear on the market in early 2012. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/436KIUBr_pw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgthrYe9mPHjGKG0X85EQr4H08dKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Concept of open clouds</b> <br><br>  As part of a workplace virtualization development strategy, Citrix has opened access to the Share File information cloud.  This initiative allows you to create a stackable platform for sharing data across applications, devices, and services.  The ‚ÄúFollow me data‚Äù model (information is always with me) enables third-party developers and vendors to include in their solutions, through a set of open API, various popular information services such as search, sharing, synchronization and deletion.  Citrix now provides customers with not only constant access to virtual workplaces (‚Äúfollow me desktop‚Äù service) and applications (‚ÄúFollow me apps‚Äù service), but also data, allowing them not only to work, but also to have fun using any devices. <br><br>  <b>Implementation of virtualization systems in the SMB sector</b> <br><br>  At the last conference, Citrix paid much attention to issues related to the implementation of virtualization systems in the small and medium business sector.  Especially for this segment, the company introduced a new version of Citrix VDI-in-a-Box - a simple and affordable solution for virtualization of workplaces, designed specifically for the SMB sector.  Unlike virtualization systems that are initially focused on large businesses, deploying the VDI-in-a-Box solution in a small enterprise is less costly and easier to maintain, which makes it possible to achieve the main goals of introducing virtualization ‚Äî saving money, increasing security and business flexibility. <br><br>  For the active implementation of virtual desktops in small companies, Citrix launches various partner programs.  One of them is focused on the development of desktop virtualization in the SMB sector.  To further encourage the introduction of virtualization of workplaces in small and medium-sized companies, from January 2012, Citrix introduces a new specialization for channel partners under the Citrix Solution Advisor program - SMB specialist (SMB specialist).  Partners certified in this area have access to an expanded set of sales tools, the possibility of passing free online training, as well as access to presales support that will help them successfully attract and maintain SMB clients.  Training in this program is free, takes place online and does not take much time.  In addition, as part of its SMB initiative, Citrix provides support for a huge number of products optimized for Citrix (Citrix Ready) from leading technology partners of the company, such as Dell and Wyse. <br><br>  At the conference, the company also announced a new solution that combines Citrix VDI-in-a-Box with the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù support of Citrix GoToManage, allowing managed service providers and IT staff to monitor and support virtual workplace environments at multiple sites of their own or customer data centers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHXmc9KVfos%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi7SnTRcFP4PVvZvK59tt8F71cDmQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Previous announcements</b> <br><br>  Also at the Citrix Synergy conference, the company spoke in detail about the high-profile announcements made earlier - entering into a strategic partnership with Cisco and the release of a new version of the XenDesktop 5.5 software product. <br><br>  The main goal of integration with Cisco is to more actively innovate solutions that will help customers simplify and accelerate the deployment of virtual desktops and applications with high image quality.  The integration of Cisco networking technologies and the Citrix HDX protocol will increase user comfort. <br><br>  The Cisco and Citrix Alliance enables you to create new, advanced solutions for running virtual desktops on a huge number of different devices, including Mac, PC, tablet PCs and thin clients.  Another objective of this collaboration is to create solutions for data centers, which simplify the deployment of the companies' infrastructures necessary for the provision of IT services in a variety of networks. <br><br>  The second significant announcement made by Citrix earlier is the release of a new version of the virtualization solution for large enterprises XenDesktop 5.5.  In version 5.5, more than 150 innovations were implemented, making it the most serious upgrade of Citrix HDX technology.  The main feature of XenDesktop 5.5 is the ability to deliver virtual desktops to mobile and remote users via WAN-channels at a speed of 3 times greater than before, at a much lower cost. <br><br>  The most important improvements also include a six-fold reduction in printing and scanning time, doubling the launch speed of applications and flexible QoS control to ensure comfortable operation regardless of the quality of the communication channel.  The new version has made significant improvements in the field of work with multimedia.  Among them is the integration of the technology of redirection of Flash-content, thanks to which the work with video and audio through WAN-channels is provided, while the costs are reduced by 50%. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133025/</a></p>
