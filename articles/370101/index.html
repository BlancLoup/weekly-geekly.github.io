And what about audio?  You can record audio messages in instant messengers (here we also assign private messages in social networks, for example, Vkontakte and Facebook messenger). <br><br>  And although some people fundamentally ignore this function, it is no longer necessary to doubt its popularity: a large number of people around it use it every day.  And if earlier they caught on themselves sidelong glances, then today everyone is accustomed to this. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/285096/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c4/c57/f70/5c4c57f70514476984f8de9351908fc5.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mstable/16897658914/">C_osett</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">PD</a></i>

    <h2>  "Audiotvity" </h2><br>  Audio messages in messengers and audio posts <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D13367486">are convenient in</a> their own way: you can record them and, most importantly, listen to them anywhere: on the subway, at the wheel, at work, while jogging or playing sports in the hall.  Despite all the negative forecasts, the radio still lives, and perhaps such services are a natural way of development, which allows you to keep abreast of events and at the same time feel closer to your friends, hearing their voice more often. <br><br>  But how to distribute audio content in social networks?  One option is to use third-party applications.  For example, in 2014, Twitter made it possible to post <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2014/introducing-a-new-audio-experience-on-twitter">audio</a> from SoundCloud.  And the download will turn out as podcasts, and music, and any other recordings.  And you can start listening in one click without having to go to another application.  This immediately took advantage of musicians who even posted their new singles on Twitter.  Today, the number of applications through which you can share audio messages on social networks is constantly growing. <br><br>  For example, <a href="https://www.clickz.com/is-audio-platform-anchor-the-next-big-thing-for-social-media/100931/">Anchor</a> allows users to create minute audio recordings and share them with friends, not only within the application.  In this case, for each audio post you can give the same minute audio response.  The developers of each application try to make it special by inventing original names for audio posts: in Anchor, a custom message is called a wave.  And <a href="https://www.chirbit.com/">Chirbit is</a> designed not only for recording audio, but also for downloading files of up to 120 megabytes. <br><br>  But all such applications have a certain minus - the need to create a separate account and maintain it.  That is, to record audio and share it with friends, you have to make a lot of extra gestures compared to a short tweet that you can quickly type.  Therefore, the development of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"audiotvitov" entered a different stage.  And today, attempts to create separate audio networks do not stop. <br><br>  Among them, the Indian application <a href="http://theceo.in/2016/03/febler-connects-your-favourite-channels-on-the-go/">Febler</a> , designed to listen to news, podcasts, custom messages, and even broadcasts from television channels.  Although the project is aimed specifically at the domestic market, the founders are confident that the need for news audio channels on social networks as an alternative to radio will grow worldwide.  In addition, the application has a function of offline access. <br><br>  Unfortunately, not all of these projects survive in a highly competitive environment.  For example, in May 2016, Quora users provided examples of <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-twitter-like-service-with-audio-instead-of-text">applications</a> in which voice recordings can be shared, a kind of ‚Äúaudio switchers‚Äù.  Thus, the <a href="https://twitter.com/tvider">Tvider</a> application, which was created back in 2009 for downloading including audio files to Twitter, is no longer functioning today. <br><br><h2>  Podcasts </h2><br>  Another way to solve the problem of <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/03/hoping-to-make-audio-more-shareable-wnyc-introduces-audiograms-for-social-media/">audio content</a> distribution was WNYC (New York online radio station).  They analyzed the popularity of reposts from third-party applications on Facebook and concluded that people listen to audio much less often (even though they can stay on the page) than watch videos that are automatically played when watching a tape. <br><br>  In addition, in the system of building a news <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/why-it-still-so-hard-share-audio-files-social-media-173127">feed,</a> more preference is given to video files, which is why many ‚Äúpodcasters‚Äù decided to combine audio content with a video series or just a static photo on the background.  But there is another problem - these videos are automatically played without sound, and the users themselves switch on the sound not so often, since their goal initially is to see what's new with friends. <br><br>  And WNYC found a way out - they combined video and audio in an unusual form.  For their podcasts, they created special audiograms that tell users to turn on the sound.  However, while podcasts are still not popular on Facebook.  Users are not ready to listen to even the most popular programs longer than 4-5 minutes, and the ideal duration of audio files, according to the radio station, is only 1 minute. <br><br>  The number of applications in which users record not only their short messages, but entire podcasts, is also growing.  For example, in addition to <a href="http://hubbub.fm/">Hubub</a> and <a href="http://www.boast-talk.com/">Boast talk</a> applications, in addition to custom short audio messages, you can find news and podcasts.  <a href="https://www.spreaker.com/start-your-podcast%3Fref%3Dhomepage">Speaker</a> content consists only of podcasts, which are not only created there, but then downloaded to iTunes or YouTube. <br><br>  Another audio network, <a href="http://applecation.ru/apps/musika/listn-audio-socialnaya-cet-na-iphone-i-ipad.htm">Listn</a> , invites users to create their own audio <a href="http://applecation.ru/apps/musika/listn-audio-socialnaya-cet-na-iphone-i-ipad.htm">playlists</a> from various online services and streams.  Listening through the built-in audio player.  Here you can search and add friends, subscribe to users with matching tastes and watch which podcasts they listen to.  By the way, we also make an audio broadcast (about sound): you can listen to our podcasts in <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/sou-zvuk-vigorous-space/id731089874">iTunes</a> ( <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook%3Fformat%3Drss">RSS</a> / <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/zvoook">Web version</a> ), and you can read transcripts in our <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/284694/">blog</a> . <br><br><h2>  Musical / Audio Applications </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/musically-lip-sync-app">Musically</a> can rightly be considered the most successful example of combining audio and video.  As of November 2016, it has already been used by 100 million people.  The number of users has grown very quickly, thanks in large part to teenagers and young people, who make up more than half of the audience.  Musically one of the main differences from other similar services - it is a separate social network (similar to Instagram) with the functions of subscribing to liked users, likes, commenting and personal messages. <br><br>  Another project is aimed at children and adolescents - <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/12/pundit-launches-an-audio-social-media-app-for-millennials/">Pundit</a> .  Its feature is also not in the process of creating audio posts: here you can not only share your thoughts and record short audio, but also apply various filters to your voice.  The developers even managed to attract Disney so that users could ‚Äúspeak‚Äù with the voices of all the famous cartoon characters. <br><br>  And the <a href="https://getvoicecapsule.com/">VoiceCapsule</a> project positions itself as an album of memories created from voice files.  The developers note that their application will help to save recorded audio even in case of a phone change.  However, the potential of the application is not yet clear, because today almost every smartphone has the ability to save files in the cloud, which can then be accessed from its other devices. <br><br>  The number of audio applications is growing, and their focus is expanding.  Although the Gallup <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/">study</a> shows that today's young people prefer to communicate via text messages, it is possible that ‚Äúaudio communication‚Äù without the need for direct communication will change the preferences of users.  In addition, modern services not only allow you to communicate, but also create entertainment audio content, and its popularity is also gaining momentum.  And if he can become a full part of the world of social networks - time will tell. <br><br>  What else can you read in our "World Hi-Fi": <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/">Latest reviews and articles and audio reviews</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/podcasts/">Sound in simple words: Our audio podcast</a> </li><li>  Hi-Fi Manufacturers: <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/company/">Stories and Interviews</a> plus <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/production/">Factory Reports</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/diy_audio/">Practical materials in the format of "do it yourself"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/about_sound/">Interesting sound</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370101/</a></p>
