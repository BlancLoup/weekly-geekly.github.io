Our names are Anton and Svetlana, and we are working together on the project ‚Äú <a href="http://www.iloveip.ru/">I love IP</a> ‚Äù.  Almost a year ago we went to Southeast Asia for the first time to winter and lived for 6 months in Thailand and 4.5 months in Vietnam.  We are often asked which of these countries is better?  In the post we will try to objectively tell about your experience, and you will draw your own conclusions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/486/254/87b/48625487bf794996bcf52b5e7a845883.jpg" width="600"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Visa </h4><br>  To come to Thailand or Vietnam for a long time, you need to apply for a visa.  For short trips (up to 30 days in Thailand, up to 15 days in Vietnam), a visa is not required. <br><br>  <strong>Thailand</strong>

      We did a one-time tourist visa in Moscow for $ 40.  The visa allows you to enter Thailand for three months and stay there for 60 days. <br><br>  To obtain a visa you need a standard package of documents: <br><br><ol><li>  original and copy of passport (valid for at least 6 months), </li><li>  completed form, </li><li>  2 photos 4x6 cm </li><li>  paid tickets there and back, </li><li>  an extract from the bank on the availability of 20,000 baht (approximately $ 600) per person, </li><li>  certificate of employment. </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>Vietnam</strong> <br><br>  With a visa to Vietnam everything is much easier.  It can be done in advance in Moscow, and upon arrival at one of the international airports (in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Da Nang or Nyachang), and in the country itself before the expiration of 15 days of visa-free entry.  We issued a visa at the airport in Ho Chi Minh City.  In addition to a passport, application form and photographs, you need an invitation (approval letter).  It can be ordered via the Internet, cost from $ 10.  At the airport, a visa is issued for free and gives you the opportunity to stay in the country for 90 days. <br><br>  <strong>Extension</strong> <br><br>  To extend your stay on a single-entry tourist visa in Thailand is possible only once for 30 days.  To do this, you need to contact the immigration office with a passport and photo, fill out a form and pay 1900 baht (‚âà $ 60). <br><br>  Extend a stay on a single-entry tourist visa in Vietnam can be 2 times for 90 days.  Thus, in Vietnam without leaving the country can be almost 9 months.  For renewal, it is enough to contact any travel agency with a passport.  Cost from 40 to 60 $. <br><br><h4>  Housing </h4><br>  <strong>Thailand</strong> <br><br>  In Thailand, we lived in Phuket and rented apartments in the central part of the island for 15,000 baht (‚âà $ 470) per month.  Electricity and water were paid separately.  Internet - 550 baht per month.  It takes 20-25 minutes by car to the Kata and Karon beaches.  The complex had a small pool and gym.  The apartments themselves are 27 square meters.  m with a kitchen, work space, a small balcony, a flat-screen TV and a washing machine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/603/26e/768/60326e76874d4c1a9e4d9c382c4f6fb0.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>The house in which we rented apartments in Thailand</i> <br><br>  <strong>Vietnam</strong> <br><br>  In Vietnam we lived in Nha Trang and rented <a href="http://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/camila-house.ru.html">apartments</a> for $ 470 a month, 5 minutes walk from the sea.  The price included water, Wi-Fi and cleaning 2 times a week.  Electricity was paid separately.  Apartment 39 square meters.  m, with everything you need, including dishes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b13/343/213/b133432134b549d4a56ddeeab6139e5b.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>The view from the window of our apartments in Vietnam</i> <br><br><h4>  Food </h4><br>  <strong>Thailand</strong> <br><br>  There are many supermarkets on the island, where you can buy anything.  And in each area there are small shops 7-eleven.  We spent about 4,000‚Äì5,000 baht a week on food.  Sometimes they ordered food from MDonald's or Pizza Company for the house. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/660/563/926/66056392692d473cb6215673213d509b.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>Tesco Lotus Supermarket in Phuket</i> <br><br>  <strong>Vietnam</strong> <br><br>  There are 3 supermarkets in Nha Trang.  They are much smaller than in Thailand, and the choice is small, but you can buy everything you need.  We often ate in cafes and restaurants.  The average bill for two in Vietnam is 400‚Äì650 rubles, in Thailand 1,200‚Äì1500 rubles.  Vietnamese cuisine is less spicy and we liked it more than Thai. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/97d/b99/ebf97db9984f45a2beb83b79917ef002.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>Maximark store in Nha Trang</i> <br><br><h4>  Transport </h4><br>  Both in Thailand and in Vietnam you can rent a bike, but we took a taxi.  Taxi on Phuket is expensive, one trip to the store cost 300 baht (‚âà 390 rubles), to the beach - 500 baht (‚âà 650 rubles).  And the same in the opposite direction. <br><br>  In Vietnam, a taxi on the counter.  The minimum cost of the trip is 10,000 dong (‚âà 18 rubles).  Our apartments were not far from the tourist center, with many cafes and restaurants.  Therefore, we could reach almost any place for 20,000 dongs, and to the store for 40,000 dongs (‚âà 72 rubles). <br><br><h4>  Medicine and insurance </h4><br>  There are several international private hospitals in Phuket.  The treatment and care there is top notch.  The cost of one doctor's appointment is from 800 baht (‚âà 1000 rubles).  There are state clinics, where treatment is cheaper. <br><br>  In Nha Trang, the best hospital is a bit like our usual paid clinic, but the staff is friendly and speaks Russian.  The cost of one doctor's appointment is from 140,000 dong (‚âà 250 rubles), dental treatment from $ 15. <br><br>  Before the trip, it is desirable to issue insurance.  And if you plan to ride a bike, then it must be done.  In case of a fall and a fracture, an operation in Vietnam will cost from $ 1,000, in Thailand from $ 5,000. <br><br>  Insurance can be issued online at <a href="https://cherehapa.ru/">cherehapa.ru</a> .  They work with such insurance companies as Ingosstrakh, Alfastrakhovanie, etc. To ride a bike, you need to additionally select the option Active Leisure / Controlling a moped.  On the site, everything is done simply and quickly, and any insurance can be bought while already abroad. <br><br><h4>  Climate </h4><br>  We lived in Phuket from December to May, and the best weather was in December ‚Äî February.  This is probably the only time when you could do without air conditioning.  On the other days it was very hot. <br><br>  In Vietnam, we never turned on the air conditioning, despite the fact that we arrived there in the hottest season, in June.  A cool wind always blew from the sea, which made it comfortable both in the weather and at home. <br><br><h4>  Beaches </h4><br>  Phuket is a very warm and beautiful sea.  There are several beaches.  The most tourist is Patong, we were not there.  Kata and Karon are also popular.  We liked Nai Harn most of all, the quietest and most peaceful of all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2f/c17/afe/a2fc17afe84b4a19a932db338b4230b0.jpg" width="600"><br><br>  In Nha Trang, one city beach is almost 7 km long.  The infrastructure there is better than on the beaches of Phuket.  There are some good bars and restaurants, but you can find secluded places.  The sea is colder than Phuket, and the best time for swimming is from July to September.  In October, the water becomes turbid and the waves rise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc2/6d0/c07/cc26d0c076584e3b8260198dadfd348e.jpg" width="600"><br><br><h4>  Adaptation </h4><br>  In Thailand, it was easy to adapt to everything, and if there were any disadvantages, then we almost did not notice them. <br><br>  With Vietnam, it was the opposite; we got used to it for a very long time.  The first thing that caught my eye was a poor socialist country.  And it leaves a mark on everything.  The second is crazy traffic from a huge number of bikes.  Third - here you need to constantly be on the check and always check the change, especially when you pay in a taxi.  But if you get used to it, then Vietnam will open from a completely different side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8f/59e/48a/c8f59e48ac8b431d81d3afa1e7f9b022.jpg" width="600"><br>  <i>Plain Vietnamese street</i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  And in Thailand, and in Vietnam there are pluses.  But we remember Vietnam more.  If you are thinking about living abroad, then whatever country you choose, you will surely discover many new and interesting things. <br><br><h4>  Where are we now </h4><br>  Now we live in Bali, and be sure to tell about it next time.  In the meantime, you can follow our travels on <a href="http://instagram.com/iloveip">Instagram</a> . <br><br>  If you have questions about living in Thailand or in Vietnam, write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/242883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/242883/</a></p>
