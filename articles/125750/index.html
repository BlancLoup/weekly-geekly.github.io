In short, the scheme is simple: we provide comprehensive support to participants in the development and optimization stages of software products;  you create reliable and productive applications;  If the optimization results meet our requirements, you get additional benefits and opportunities for business development.  The advantages themselves were mentioned in passing: yes, they are, and there are many of them, and therefore it is better to figure it out.  I hope you did;) <br><br>  Over the year, much has changed in the affiliate program: the website has been updated, interesting initiatives have appeared and the range of benefits that are useful in the difficult business of software development has expanded. <br>  Under the cut, you will find Top 5 new ‚Äútasty‚Äù opportunities for affiliate program participants that are definitely worth a try. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Discounts for hardware and software </h4><br>  For the first time in the framework of the Intel Partner Program, we have opened the <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/devdiscount%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">summer season for sales of hardware and development tools</a> .  You can get a discount coupon worth 9,000 rubles and sell it at the <a href="http://ogo1.ru/market/intelpartner.php">CSO</a> store <a href="http://ogo1.ru/market/intelpartner.php">!</a>  with the purchase of a system based on the Intel Core 2nd generation.  In addition to the newly acquired equipment, you also get an exclusive 50% discount on the tools of the Intel Parallel Studio XE package.  As you know, the goods are not from last season, so the number of coupons is limited.

    <h4>  Intel lab hardware at your service </h4><br>  Testing is both the most important and the most costly stage of the life cycle of a software product.  And it's not just about time costs.  If you are engaged in the development of multi-threaded applications, then to assess the performance gains you need to run tests on multiprocessor machines, which cost a lot of money.  Agree, not everyone can afford a server with 4 8-core Zions.  Save money will help our initiative " <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/library/fastaccess-program%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">Quick Test</a> ".  You can check the performance of your application on various systems that are available in the Moscow laboratory of Intel.  You are required to fill out the application form, specifying the system requirements.  And very soon we will invite you to the Moscow office of Intel.  If you go far to Moscow or tests require a lot of time, you can use the service of remote access to our equipment. <br><br><h4>  We rent Intel systems </h4><br>  Surely you have repeatedly had the need to demonstrate their development at various exhibitions or events.  To do this, you need the latest systems so that customers can fully appreciate the performance of your product.  Also, equipment of a specific configuration may be required for some time for development or testing.  In all these cases, the rental of equipment can be much more profitable than its purchase, especially if the cost of the rental itself and the delivery to the place will be zero.  Participants in our program can get modern PCs, servers and laptops and use them for a month for the needs of their business for free.  At the moment, <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/systemloaner%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">this service is</a> provided only in the countries of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  But if there is a demand on your part, then we will definitely open a similar program in Russia. <br><br><h4>  Your company is always in sight of customers. </h4><br>  How often did you have the opportunity to visit the CES, Intel Solutions Summit, SIGGRAPH or, say, the Intel Developer Forum?  And the opportunity to present your company and product at these events?  We have made sure that your applications are always visible to users.  Recently, the software products of our partners are shown on <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/library/interactive-software-showcase%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">an interactive showcase</a> - a touch stand, which is exhibited at events with the participation of Intel around the world.  In this way, you can tell about yourself to a wider public. <br><br><h4>  Advertising with CBS Interactive </h4><br>  If your product is oriented on an English-speaking audience, it will not be superfluous to attract attention from American users, IT-professionals or investors.  With the help of the CBS Interactive self-service advertising portal you can advertise on the best technical, business and gaming resources, such as TechRepublic.com, CNET.com, Download.com or GameSpot.com.  Of course, advertising is not free, but the <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/library/online-advertising%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">discount offered</a> will allow you to increase the volume of your online advertising by 40% without additional costs. <br><br><h4>  We are waiting for your proposals to expand the range! </h4><br>  These are the top 5 new affiliate program resources.  If you want to see the full list, take a look at <a href="http://software.intel.com/partner/library/resource-library%3Flocale%3Dru-RU">our menu</a> ;) We try to regularly replenish the range of benefits.  And since you are our main clients and customers, it will be interesting to hear what benefits you would like to see first.  Therefore, please answer the 3 questionnaire questions: <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TKTZ7MQ">http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/TKTZ7MQ</a> <br><br>  Your feedback will definitely have a big impact on what products appear in the near future on the counters of the Intel partner program. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125750/</a></p>
