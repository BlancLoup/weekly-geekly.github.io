What happens to a children's rubber toy after three years of use (typical shelf life of rubber toys)?  Why is a century-old wine sold at auction for thousands of dollars?  These questions are rarely thought of by people who are used to looking at the shelf life of each product in the refrigerator and each product, as if these numbers mean something important. <br><br>  The fact is that the date and time on the packaging makes almost no sense.

    <h1>  What is the "shelf life" </h1><br>  According to the definition from the Civil Code, the shelf life of a product is the period after which the product is considered unsuitable for its intended use.  After the expiration date, food products are considered unsuitable for food, medicines are prohibited to use, and consumer goods are regarded as being sold "without claims."  For certain products, the term "shelf life" is equivalent to the warranty period. <br><br>  According to current legislation, retailers are obliged to remove from the sale of goods with expired - and buy from the manufacturer a new batch of goods.  If it is a large trading network, it concludes an agreement with the manufacturer that it takes back the goods that are not sold.  If this is a regular store or individual entrepreneur, then the cost of goods is taken into account in the item of expenses - and is evenly transferred to all other goods that go on sale, that is, is transferred to the buyer.  In any case, ‚Äúexpired‚Äù goods are destroyed or thrown away, whether they be food (even which never spoils, see below) or other goods. <br><br>  By the way, the seller is also obliged to transfer the goods to the buyer in such a way that he can be used as intended <i>before the expiration of this period</i> .  So the seller withdraws from the sale not only the goods that have expired, but also goods with a shelf life that is coming to an end. <br><br>  According to the law "On Protection of Consumer Rights", the seller is prohibited to change the expiration date, which is indicated on the label, packaging or in the accompanying documents for the goods, as well as to put into circulation goods that have expired. <br><br><h1>  Why "shelf life" makes little sense </h1><br>  As already mentioned, products begin to deteriorate from the first second after their manufacture or collection.  It is important to understand that the degree of damage to the product depends more on <b>the storage conditions</b> , and not on the storage time.  Especially important factors are humidity and temperature. <br><br>  Specialists in product quality explain that in fact the shelf life of a product is more related to the <i>quality of the</i> product, and not to its nutritional properties or safety.  It is about optimal freshness, optimal taste and other requirements that are set by state standards and other regulations.  At the same time, the established standards are extremely conservative. <br><br>  To provide for all possible situations, manufacturers set an expiration date based on the worst-case scenario.  That is, as the most lazy and stupid buyer will store the goods in the worst conditions that are possible (within the boundaries of the conditions indicated on the label).  Provided that to go from home to the store a few hours in the heat and maximum humidity. <br><br>  Ted Labuza (Ted Labuza) from the University of Minnesota <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2010/02/ignore_expiration_dates.html">says</a> that with a responsible approach ‚Äî if you put food in the refrigerator right after you arrive home ‚Äî the specified shelf life of milk and meat can be safely extended by three to seven days.  As for the greenery, research shows: the loss of nutritional properties is reflected in the loss of color.  So if the green has turned yellow - it means that there are not enough vitamins in it.  But if greens look normal, then what's the point of looking at the printed expiration date? <br><br>  Pasta or rice can be safely stored for a year without loss of taste, and you will hardly notice the difference in the following years.  On the <a href="http://www.stilltasty.com/">StillTasty</a> website, <a href="http://www.stilltasty.com/">you</a> can learn how long various products can be stored and tasty.  The difference with the official expiration dates is amazing. <br><br>  For months, kept closed packs of cookies, flour and other things.  Canned food is practically the safest food you can buy in the store.  To spoil a canned product is extremely difficult, it is quietly stored for five years in a cool place.  In principle, if the tin can is protected from rust, then the product can normally be stored for much longer than five years.  And after this period, you will have to carefully listen to the sensations in order to catch some difference between this product and the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù one. <br><br>  Given the absurdity of the very term "shelf life", it is not surprising that manufacturers can not decide on their own standards and constantly change the standards and terms.  Different countries have different rules, and even within the same country there may be differences in the regions.  So, if the same milk is sent for sale in Connecticut, then you need to put a sticker on it with a shelf life of 12 days from the day of pasteurization.  And if the same milk went to Pennsylvania, then 14 days. <br><br>  Shelf life on the package, of course, stimulate sales.  They thought in order to encourage buyers to purchase fresh produce, to increase the profit of the manufacturer.  But at the same time, they pose a threat to the consumer, creating a false sense of security.  Instead of assessing the actual quality of the product by its smell and appearance, people blindly trust the date printed on the package. <br><br>  In general, with proper storage there are products that are <a href="http://www.stilltasty.com/articles/view/35">stored forever</a> and never deteriorate.  Among them are honey, rice, sugar, strong alcohol, salt, corn starch, white vinegar, vanilla extract and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/894/91f/ff7/89491fff7454fbf2798ed20b78cdc7a8.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/400187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/400187/</a></p>
