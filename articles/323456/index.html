  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Women who have changed business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The history of women in American business begins long ago, in the 18th century, when Elizabeth Lukas Pinkney started growing and processing indigo dye for the production of indigo dye.  At the age of 16, Pinkney had already managed three plantations, and by the beginning of the War of Independence, her products accounted for a third of all exports from South Carolina.  The coffin of Pinkney in 1793 was carried by US President George Washington.  And even despite this, conservatism for many years did not allow to look at women entrepreneurs seriously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64b/3d7/d1a/64b3d7d1a5d60c9fca2f6cb56b10787a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Russia, in the XVIII century, Maria Vasilyevna Maltsova was noted.  She was the wife of the founder of the Gusev Crystal Factory, after whose death she bought two factories to expand production.  She built in 1790 <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4">Dyatkovo glass and crystal factory</a> .

      Let's go back to the USA.  The first American dream embodied black Sarah Bridlove.  Millionaire in the United States has become a woman who has not yet been white.  At the age of seven she became an orphan, at the age of twenty she was widowed, remaining with a child, and after that she began to study hair care and experiment with products that treat hair loss.  She developed a therapy, her husband helped her to make an advertisement and convinced her to use another name, more interesting - Madame C.J. Walker.  She traveled around the country and helped women become more beautiful, inspired them and earned $ 1 million by 1919, which, taking into account inflation for 2017, is $ 14.9 million. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/64e/282/10d/64e28210d731a534516ac7a8ab3772c2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/203/871/619/203871619de91cede3d9c41e69738846.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, the story about the means for hair growth does not apply to IT.  However, here we are talking about business as a whole, about courage, which helped a woman in the beginning of the 20th century to do what most men could not do.  And besides the floor she had another obstacle: skin color.  As you remember, for African Americans until the 1970s, there were separate seats in buses, separate cafes and toilets.  And Muhammad Ali threw his Olympic medal into the river after he was refused to be served in an ordinary restaurant for whites. <br><br>  Sarah Bridlove died in 1919.  After this, the most prominent example of a successful woman in business is Catherine Graham.  Fifty years after the death of the black millionaire, Graham became the head of the company, which is included in the Fortune 500 rating - the Washington Post.  It was thanks to her that an article was published denouncing Richard Nixon, which resulted in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">Watergate scandal</a> .  The head of the Washington Post was threatened, but it did not help - the article came out, and the memoirs of Catherine Graham brought her the Pulitzer Prize. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d70/4cf/44a/d704cf44ae0ad990e41a8e3d1abe22bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89f/3f3/a5b/89f3f3a5bc11971460415998d784b698.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Anti-aging cosmetics from Estee Lauder, face cream from Helena Rubinstein, dresses from Coco Chanel, corporate culture of direct sales from Mary Kay - it all looks harmonious.  But not for every industry the high position of women was the norm, not every profession seems to many to be accessible to the fair sex.  Even at the training stage, teachers can condescendingly treat students, this is written <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/290282/">in this article on Habr√©</a> .  Although the same teachers perfectly remember Ada Lovelace, Hedy Lamarr and Grace Hopper. <br><br>  Gender prejudice can be complicated by other factors, such as race and cultural characteristics.  Can a woman in India be a programmer?  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/286246/">Sudha Murthy could</a> .  In 1974 she became an engineer in one of the largest Indian companies - TELCO.  ‚ÄúDo you know why we wrote that we do not need girls?  Because we never had women in the workplace.  This is not a college for co-education, it is a factory.  At the institute, you were the best all the time, we admire it.  But as you are more suited to scientific work ... ", - told her after she answered all the questions at the interview.  Sudha replied: "Then you need to start somewhere, otherwise women will never work for you." <br><br>  Together with her husband, Sudha Murthy founded <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infosys">Infosys</a> , which is why the verb <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">to bangalore</a> appeared in English, which means ‚Äúto dismiss IT specialists and transfer their functions to an outsourcing company from India in order to save on wages‚Äù.  Of the $ 200, this couple created a company with a capitalization of $ 32 billion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25d/7ba/10d/25d7ba10d717448eaa163d638e483030.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Many companies in the IT industry are now trying to attract more women specialists and managers.  Warren Buffett notes that Catherine Graham and Carol Loomis, another finance journalist, were role models for him.  Because of this, he advocated expanding business opportunities for women.  There are even studies <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/293242/">showing</a> that privately owned IT companies run by women demonstrate greater capital efficiency. <br><br>  Let's congratulate the beautiful ladies on March 8 and wish you success both at home and at work.  In any industry and in any business.  I wish you happiness! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323456/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323456/</a></p>
