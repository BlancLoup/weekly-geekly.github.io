And everyone has already known for a long time that nobody needs to send covers in envelopes to win a T-shirt with a logo (this is not entirely true, but the acceleration is in this direction). <br><br>  It is clear as the day of God that web youth needs to create brand experience on the web.  Positive experience with the brand.  Interactive and all other clever words, not devoid of meaning.  ‚ÄúPeople on the net want to have a fan,‚Äù speaking their language.  So you need to make him a real, and not a phony fan, and he will not get anywhere from you. <br><br>  It should be noted that this applies not only to the youth audience, but young animals are the best example.

      Let's say, the company decided to forget about candy wrappers, covers and thirty-second waste of money and create an experience of communication with the brand.  In our case, on the Internet.  What does this company do first?  She makes an entertainment portal.  So what?  And nothing.  Why?  But why. <br><br>  The most detailed version of the site of a drink consists hypothetically of: <br><br>  - Flash games; <br>  - Blog; <br>  - Dating site; <br>  - network games; <br>  - Features download content (music, pictures, movies, ringtones, etc.); <br>  - Opportunities to send a postcard or funny to a friend (hehe); <br>  - Bindings to some SMS-mechanics, such as participate in the SMS-battle, see the results online. <br><br>  And, of course, ratings and votes on all these points. <br><br>  Suppose we have created a wonderful site, just wonderful, worked out at the executive level very worthy.  Why it turns out crap and people do not go to him in the quantity in which we need? <br><br>  Because, firstly, and this is important - for each of the above items, our new, uncouth portal has competitors.  Charismatic and the best in their field.  Well, who needs a blog from beer D, for example, if there is a LJ and Darty.  I am silent about dating sites - there is a whole mafia there.  Network games are the same.  Download ringtones and MP3s - yes, this is a whole business and tough competition!  There are excellent sites of postcards for every taste, and SMS-mechanics have destroyed some TV channels, because there is nothing more to be seen besides them. <br><br>  Secondly, the entire advertising network pseudo-razvlekuha will look intrusive and peremptory, not offering a choice. <br><br>  And where are you, I ask, you go with your portal?  Isn't it better to brand and adjust each of the above services by organizing profitable alliances for money with specialists - each in their own field? <br><br>  This is a question, there are no answers.  We'll see how brands will enter into the network life of Runet in the coming years, but still I would like to make one, only one conclusion: those who find the mind and the courage to do it unobtrusively, unfriendly and organically, will look down on idiots spending millions on promotions. <br><br>  <i>PS Companies that behaved incorrectly and made stupid portals, of course, are not mentioned for political correction purposes.</i>  <i>Beer T, for example, with its community.</i>  <i>Therefore, in the column no links.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4203/</a></p>
