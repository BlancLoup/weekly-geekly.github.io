And investors already have an interest in the projects presented, which means that we are on the right track. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to the results of this year‚Äôs GenerationS, about fifty projects have already entered into negotiations with Russian venture capital investors.  In addition, several corporations expressed their desire to join the competition next year as organizers and partners.  ‚ÄúAlready today, a number of Russian corporations see in the GenerationS competition a channel for finding interesting developments that can be used in solving their business problems.  Today we are discussing a partnership with several companies that next year plan to create separate industry tracks to search for technologies, ‚Äùcommented Gulnara Bikkulova, director of the RVC innovative markets department. <br>  The final GenerationS federal accelerator competition was held within the framework of the Moscow Open Innovations Forum.  25 strongest GenerationS projects were presented by a jury of 100 Russian and foreign investors.  The jury evaluated the projects presented at the investment session according to seven main criteria: the team, problem value and solutions, understanding of the market, technical implementation, competitive advantages, scalability of the business model and possible capitalization of the project on the horizon of 3-5 years.  The final score was the sum of the indicators according to the criteria and the investor's assessment in terms of investing in the project's own funds. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInteresting projects, good ideas, a strong team always raise money, a little faster or a little slower.  But the competition is useful for startups not only to attract investors, but also to compare themselves with other projects, to practice.  This is a sieve through which the weak pass, and the strong receive a good stimulus for development.  I think that all startups that have reached the final of GenerationS have high chances of success in realizing their products, ‚Äùsaid Konstantin Fokin, general director of the Moscow Innovation Development Center. <br><br>  All finalists of the competition received the Moscow Innovation Passports, which gives the holder priority rights to participate in various programs of the Moscow Government and to receive services provided on preferential terms by Moscow development institutions and their partners.  The total value of prizes for the finalists from the competition partners amounted to about 38 million rubles.  Each contest finalist was awarded a grant of one million rubles from the Assistance Fund.  Three target grants for business development in the nomination ‚ÄúSmart City‚Äù from the construction company ‚ÄúMorton‚Äù were received by the teams ‚ÄúComputer Robotics‚Äù, GeoCV and Promobot.  Special prize from SAP went to the project Veeroute.  The team ‚ÄúComputer Robotics‚Äù got an opportunity to present their project to the investors of the Club of Directors for Science and Innovations.  Participation in the Seed forum Singapore acceleration program was provided by LOGA Group to three finalists of the BiotechMed track - Liomed, HepyScreen and Brain Target, while Tsinoferr and AquaAgroSorb teams will be able to present their projects at the investment session in New York.  Three IT startups 3Plet Publishing, AddReality and Piligrim XXI were given the opportunity to participate in the acceleration program Fabernovel based on the leading NUMA innovation center in Paris, and Promobot, Nerpa Interceptors and Bitblaze will be accelerated in Berlin.  A ticket to the international congress in the field of digital innovation Leweb was awarded to the project GeoCV.  All twenty-five participants in the final received certificates from the consulting company Deloitte, and also became owners of a subscription to Kaspersky Lab's anti-virus program.  Finals leaders received a subscription from Elsevier. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241269/</a></p>
