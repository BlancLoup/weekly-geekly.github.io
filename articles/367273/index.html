I will not be dispersed for a long time about the benefits of weekly business planning, because this is the key topic of all fashionable books on time management and self-improvement.  One thing is for sure - it works.  Therefore, for quite a long time, I don‚Äôt let go of the desire to create the perfect balanced menu for each day of the week in advance.  Over the course of my life, I have accumulated various habits, tastes and preferences for filling the refrigerator.  But you cannot escape from reality.  Besides the fact that food can be tasty, it can be useful and useless.  And here, of course, it is difficult to say that modern dietetics has gone far ahead.  Not.  There are still doubts about the mandatory presence of certain mineral salts in the daily diet and participation in the body of certain substances.  I will not go into details, because I do not know much, and I do not want to give advice.  But I want to share one of my observations.  To whom it will seem interesting, I ask under the cut! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      To simplify the task of planning a meal, I decided to create a table of products with the content of certain substances necessary for a healthy person and without pathologies throughout the day.  What, in fact, I want to share with anyone who wants to expand my experience.  According to the contents of this table, it is easy to choose the optimal set of products and understand which products should be constantly present in the diet, and which places are not at all there. <br><br>  I did not set myself the goal of conducting scientific research, and I don‚Äôt have the corresponding competence.  It's just such a life-simplifying plate that can be printed and hung on the door of the refrigerator.  Therefore, I am pleased to invite to this post to discuss my table of people with great knowledge.  The collective mind works wonders! <br><br>  I will allow myself one more small note: making up the table, I started from my own views on food culture, so it does not contain meat products, but contains milk and chicken eggs, which I personally consider the basis of a healthy diet.  Also, I did not divide it by age and sex and put the average value in the graph of consumption rates, but it focuses more on an adult - significant adjustments are needed for children and retirement age.  And also do not forget that the heat treatment of products great changes their contents, but this is perhaps worth a separate study. <br><br>  <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByRxZkUXRnI4VmlOSHV4MWE2ejQ/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing"><u>The table is</u></a> free for editing and everyone is invited to it. <br><br>  PS When compiling the table, I used to a large extent the data of Wikipedia, sometimes expanding with other articles, including in English.  This work is not even close to the scientific status and was done in order to simplify their own lives.  In addition, Wikipedia links to sources were as far as possible verified.  But there is nothing perfect, so I will be happy with possible criticism and suggestions.  Be healthy! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367273/</a></p>
