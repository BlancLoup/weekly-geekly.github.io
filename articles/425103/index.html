  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Stop Google predators chasing your kids</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Without consent, without publicity, without the ability to avoid. <br><br>  For legions of involuntary students and teachers across the country, this is, in fact, a dangerous policy that Google has imposed on its school districts. <br><br>  It is estimated that about 80 million students and teachers are already registered to <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2856827%3Fhl%3Dru">the G Suite for Education</a> (formerly known as Google Apps for Education);  Over 25 million students and faculty are currently using Google Chromebook.  Signing in to your Google Account is the key to accessing homework, quizzes, tests, group discussions, presentations, spreadsheets, and other seamless communications.  Without a Google Account, students and teachers are driven from their own virtual classrooms.

Teachers and parents who exposed and opposed this disturbing, intrusive regime were ridiculed and ignored. <br><br>  And Washington's lobbyist politicians who held a hearing in the Senate this week about breaches of consumer confidentiality remain, in the matter of wholesale trade in personal information of school-age children ignorant or complicit in endless data mining and making profits in the future. <br><br>  Over the past few years, I have reported in my column and the CRTV.com investigation program about educational technologies, marauding personal data and the history of web surfing of millions of American schoolchildren. <br><br>  Remember: state and federal educational databases provide countless opportunities for private companies using public school students who are subject to annual assessments.  These opportunities flourished after the adoption of high-tech standards, tests and coordinated texts and curricula, lobbied by high-tech companies.  Every Student Succeeds Act helps to further consolidate the collection of personal information by the state, including data about relationships, values, beliefs and personal plans, and allows you to transfer this data to a third party, thanks to Obama-era loopholes cut through the Federal Family and Human Rights and Privacy Act. <br><br>  This racket includes Facebook's Digital Promise partnership with the US Department of Education and TS Gold (Teaching Strategies Gold) social / emotional behavior tracking system, focused on preschoolers.  Yes, preschoolers.  The Unicorn project, promoted by big business, promotes ‚Äúdata compatibility‚Äù between a large number of educational technology products competing for clicks and your child‚Äôs data.  And, despite the fact that for data mining, they got access to students' emails without their consent, Google continues to penetrate the classrooms and family living rooms. <br><br>  Parents, did you receive a notification before your child signed up for a Google account?  In many districts, school information officers usurp your family power and massively register your sons and daughters on Google without your consent or knowledge.  You may not familiarize yourself with the terms of service, privacy policy, or the G Suite for Education agreement between Google and your school.  Even if parents do receive a notification before their children are forcibly dragged into Google World, they do not have the opportunity to refuse or at least sort out. <br><br>  Springfield, Missouri, public school employee and mother Brooke Henderson, along with her sister Brett Hay (who is also a mother and teacher) were horrified to find that even if they left their G Suite accounts, their personal passwords, account details At the bank, the personal data of the parents, the confidential data of the spouses and the history of the children's web browser were stored on Google Drive accounts.  Unbeknownst to the sisters, Google‚Äôs auto-logon and auto-sync features allow you to collect and archive non-educational information on relatives' devices. <br><br>  Henderson showed me screenshots and videos of these breaches of confidentiality, including keeping a personal voice search history and notes of a young niece and a history of watching her nephew's Youtube videos.  Worse, this information is available to an unknown number of district employees.  Security issues are multiplied and exacerbated by other third-party data management systems used in the district where Henderson lives, who have ‚Äúworked together‚Äù with Google, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructure">Canvas</a> and the unified registration system Clever. <br><br>  According to the rights advocate for parents and researcher Cheri Kiseker: ‚ÄúParents do not want to learn about business actions only after they receive the data from our children.  We want to have the right to request consent to receive data, and students should not be penalized if their parents choose not to share the data.  Also, if the data is used incorrectly, mandatory penalties should be applied. ‚Äù <br><br>  Appeal to Congress: Allow Google to specify "boundaries" for educational information, just like allowing the fox to guard the chicken coop.  Parents have the right to know - and have the right to "NO" - when it comes to protecting the privacy of their children.  Anything less is capitulation to the devourers of childish data. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425103/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425103/</a></p>
