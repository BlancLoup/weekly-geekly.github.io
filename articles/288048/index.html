Like previous anniversaries (‚Ññ‚Ññ <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/158777.html">4</a> and <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/165781.html">11</a> ), this one will be celebrated by the whole country.  In this connection, the next Saturday and Sunday are declared holidays!  And recently, I have more and more began to receive letters, telegrams and wrappers about the reviews.  Some letters contain links to blogs and requests that I in the next review necessarily mention these blogs.  In others, they gently teach how to write these reviews correctly.  I am glad immensely to those and other letters.  And since today we have an anniversary, I decided to take a close look at the material that I studied.  So, this review will be about the best blogs over the past six months. <br><br>  Let's start with our Palestinians.  Just a few days ago, the contest of content projects, which was held in the framework of the ‚ÄúDays of the Internet‚Äù, ended.  Among the nominations were blogs.  The winner was the blog " <a href="http://br23.net/">br23.net - two baki adnago blogger</a> ", the second place was taken by " <a href="http://inf.by/library">Librarians of Belarus: Library Blog</a> ", and the third was shared by " <a href="http://s13.ru/">Grodno entertainment blog s13</a> " and " <a href="http://inf.by/apple">Blog about Apple</a> ".  Decent sites, but in my opinion, victories are not worthy.  Yes, this proves once again that I do not understand blogs.  I would give a victory to <a href="http://jamshid.ru/">Jamshid's blog</a> .  This site is the flagship of the Belarusian blogosphere after the untimely death of inforedesign.  Constant updates, interesting topics, several TV shows, for example, "Pearls of subscribers", the original author's headings.  That is all that I like about blogs can be found in the Jamshid's blog.  The blog specializes in mobile communications (especially since the author works in one Belarusian mobile operator) and IT.  Competitions are, of course, good, but the jury does not always select the best.  And only I, the great and terrible Leshka Chaletsky, can advise really interesting things!  I look forward to admiration on the forum.  And on this about Belarus, unfortunately, everything.

      Not once appeared in our reviews blog " <a href="http://sundaybytes.com/">Sunday bytes</a> ."  Anton Antich, the author of the blog, works at the Microsoft office of the Microsoft Small Desk.  Hence the thematic focus of the blog: first, you can learn a lot of interesting things about the internal structure of the mega-corporation;  secondly, first-hand reports on the development and release of new MS software;  thirdly, useful articles about business and management from a knowledgeable and understanding person in this matter.  In addition, Anton became an ideologue and one of the creators of the <a href="http://blogus.ru/">Blogus</a> project.  This is not a blog, but a peculiar blog hit parade.  Moreover, statistics is considered not by the number of visitors, but by links to the site, which is a wonderful definition of credibility.  Check out Blogus to see one of the most reputable blogs at the moment. <br><br>  What could be more natural than a journalist's blog?  Vladislav Surnin - Kiev journalist, and yes even the author of the blog ‚Äú <a href="http://ouch.kiev.ua/">Details</a> ‚Äù.  Also a frequent guest in our reviews.  Of course, the presentation of the material is interesting, because a professional journalist will not write nonsense.  The most frequently raised topics are literature, philosophy and, of course, the Internet.  In addition, Vladislav is a good photographer, whose works were published in the media, so that photo lovers will also be interested to look at the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù blog.  I have always liked people with their personal opinions, especially if they are not afraid to express this opinion. <br><br>  Dmitry Davydov is the author of the blog " <a href="http://davydov.blogspot.com/">Marketing in a small town</a> ".  "Noise" was that everyone argues with the author hoarsely, trying to prove to him that he is a layman and writes nonsense.  But Dima is not distracted by controversy and continues to produce wonderful articles almost every day.  I think the title of the blog is understandable.  But I advise everyone to read texts, because they are literary interesting.  For example, I am absolutely not interested in marketing absolutely, but I look forward to every new publication in this blog.  Perhaps this effect is achieved by the fact that Dima shares his life experience?  It turns out really a diary that has information value.  Well, if you are a marketer or copywriter, then constantly reading this blog is your direct responsibility! <br><br>  I would never forgive myself if I did not mention <a href="http://lifehack.ru/">lifehack.ru</a> blog.  As written in the title, this blog is a "daily review of ways to hack the universe."  Do not be intimidated by such a long and confusing definition - there is nothing tricky about the texts.  I will try to explain the topic of the blog as simply as possible - various ways to change your own life.  No, this is not about radical hairstyles or tips "how to quit a husband."  Here texts are, rather, about a comfortable life, how to systematize work or household chores.  For example, the blog has an article "How not to die at the machine or secrets of productivity in the workplace."  Honestly, I have not changed my life under the influence of this blog, but this is rather a minus for me, not for the author.  So if you feel that life is too complicated, take a look at lifehack.ru (damn, almost advertising a helpline). <br><br>  And we don‚Äôt forget about webmasters - hello, Andrei!  Also, Nikita Vakorin, the author of the wonderful blog <a href="http://umade.ru/">Umade.ru,</a> does not forget about them.  The title says that this blog is for web enthusiasts.  And who are we all if not web enthusiasts?  In Moscow, in honor of us, even the highway is named.  So, Nikita constantly publishes notes on web development in his blog.  Most often come across articles about CSS, but the rest of the coding does not suffer from a lack of attention.  Please note that the blog peacefully coexists and author articles, and translations from foreign sources.  So a comprehensive look is guaranteed.  Unfortunately, I do not understand web development so well as to assess Nikita's competence; my readers will do this for me. <br><br>  Maxim Makarenkov is the chief editor of Enter magazine, writes and publishes short stories in Boris Natanovich Strugatsky's Noon XXI Century magazine, collaborates with various online and offline publications.  Are you interested in reading his " <a href="http://makarenkov.org/">Informbureau</a> " blog?  It is a pity that Maxim has recently become less likely to write to his blog, but every time I read his notes with great pleasure.  Strongly recommend to all novice authors to look into the section "For Authors", perhaps it is from there that you will begin your journey into great literature. <br><br>  So, I took care of webmasters, but forgot about programmers?  I am <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog">correcting</a> what Ivan Sagalaev helps me with my <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog">Manic Weblog</a> .  I always considered programmers to be people of this world.  However, if they also blog, it means that the human remains in them.  If I know little about web layout, then programming is something otherworldly for me, so I‚Äôm not going to evaluate the quality of the blog.  I judge by the number of comments, which each Ivan‚Äôs post is always a lot of.  So, it is read and his articles cause a response. <br><br>  It is always nice to read thematic blogs, especially when they are written by people "in the subject."  Timofey Tselykh is such a person and we are lucky that he decided to create a blog " <a href="http://interbiz.ru/">Internet business today</a> ."  Timofey has been doing business on the Web for more than five years, so the topic is oriented like a fish in water.  That is why his notes more than once appeared in our reviews.  According to the author, the blog is mainly aimed at publishing foreign news from the field of business to the Internet (Timofey believes that this word is not inclined) and various studies of Western marketers.  In his publications, he tries to select interesting, useful and important material from different areas of electronic business, which may be of interest to the majority of domestic entrepreneurs. <br><br>  And in the penultimate paragraph of my review, I will note the blog of our frequenter <a href="http://merkurov.ru/">Anton Merkurov</a> .  I would give this magazine a definition of ‚Äúcultural‚Äù, in the sense that the notes are mainly devoted to various cultural events and, in general, to art, although Anton himself calls his blog ‚Äúinteresting about different things‚Äù.  The topic is clear, because Anton is a descendant of the famous photo artist Sergey Merkurov.  By the way, about the great-grandfather Anton created a separate site. <br><br>  Just as imperceptibly as our anniversary issue began and ended.  I expect critical letters and comments from you on the forum - did you like this form of review or should you return to links to specific articles?  Congratulations to all on the beginning of spring and beriberi, your <br><br>  <b>journalist and hamster Alyaksheyk KHALETSKY</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006140602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ14, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288048/</a></p>
