Without much admiration for the device, but without competing with mud. <br><br><h4>  Why iPhone? </h4><br>  It's all pretty simple.  There was a need to combine a phone, a book reader, a pdf monitor, a digital voice recorder, and no mail client in one device.  Before that, there was a hp hx4700 PDA, but everything was spoiled by its operating system.  As a result, it was decided to get a lot of happiness in the case with an apple.

      Did it work out?  Let's try to figure it out. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Everything written below refers to the official iPhone 3G. <br><br><h6>  Phone </h6><br>  It must be said that the phone - it was the phone - at Apple it turned out all the same so-so.  Nokia 6300, which I had before Jobs, was much more convenient in the telephone part.  For example, in Nokia there is an auto answer (which is important for motorists with a headset in the ear). <br><br>  In addition to the history with the headset, you need to say about the choice of the sound source.  The idea is not bad, the implementation - too.  Sometimes you need to turn on the speakerphone without disconnecting the headset from the device. <br><br>  Vaunted Spotlight works in contacts according to laws known to him only.  For example, the search by organization works fine, but Spotlight simply ignores the text placed in the notes to the contact. <br><br>  Placing SMS and MMS in the form of chat - 5 plus.  But when sending SMS to several people, iPhone automatically offers to send MMS.  Moreover, it is unclear what moves him to such a step.  Apparently, the very idea that MMS at several recipients may not be configured, the iPhone is deeply disgusted. <br><br>  I was pleased with the opportunity to assign my tags to the phones.  No need to guess which of the three cell phones of a person is Moscow.  Change the label to "Moscow" and live happily. <br><br><h6>  Book reader </h6><br>  The answer is simple.  Shortbook.  The program can do almost anything.  For readability, it is no worse than AlReader or HaaliReader for Windows Mobile.  The only problem is uploading files.  They can either be downloaded directly from these our Internet sites, or an ftp-server should be raised on the computer.  Or - as I began to do quite recently - I use the local network file storage. <br><br><h6>  PDF Viewer </h6><br>  That work with pdf, tested on the iPod Touch 2G, was the reason for buying an iPhone.  With horror I remember RepliGO for PDAs, which required conversion for each file, and at the same time did not guarantee normal viewing. <br><br>  On the iPhone, the main program for reading pdf is GoodReader.  Although comparable convenience on small documents (up to 30 megabytes) provides, for example, and Files Lite.  Screen, however, is not enough.  But a small physical resolution is compensated by the ease of navigation through the document. <br><br>  Would I change the iPhone to a specialized eInk reader?  Not.  But not because the reader is worse, but simply because the ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù option suits me personally more. <br><br><h6>  Dictaphone </h6><br>  At first, Apple did everything well.  Voice notes were of unlimited length, streamlined, and everything would have remained good, but then firmware 3.1 appeared. <br><br>  Apple ruined everything.  With firmware 3.1, voice notes are limited to 77 megabytes (approximately 35 minutes).  Why - this is a great mystery.  The forums have relevant topics where the problem is discussed, but there is no progress In firmware 3.1.2, everything remained bad.  Apple is silent. <br><br>  But a voice recorder is needed.  So I did everything well on my own for $ 1.99.  Bought a griffin iTalk.  The program is simple like a bagel, can write a voice recorder audio notes of any length.  The ordering is done, perhaps, even simpler than in the standard application.  Writes to aiff, which is then converted with foobar2000 into any convenient format (and even some inconvenient ones). <br><br><h4>  What's not to like </h4><br>  iTunes.  Perhaps it works differently on Macs, but on the PC - the apotheosis of insanity. <br>  My personal complaints about tuna can be divided into two groups: <br>  1. Glitches of the program. <br>  2. Perverted synchronization logic. <br><br><h6>  Glitches "Tuna" </h6><br>  The hit parade of glitches is headed by a couple of errors: ‚ÄúCould not sync iPhone: you do not have enough rights for this operation‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnable to save iPhone library file: you do not have enough rights for this operation‚Äù.  In the first case, the phone interrupts synchronization.  In the second program you have to download again. <br><br>  ITunes gives these errors when working with administrator rights under the administrator account. <br><br>  Another iTunes glitch - duplication of programs.  Now, according to Apple‚Äôs brainchild, I have three copies of AppBox lite, 4 copies of Doodle Jump, and so on.  Naturally, in the phone all these programs are in the singular.  What is even more ridiculous - removing a tick from any copy in the ‚Äúprogram synchronization‚Äù leads to the removal of the program from the phone. <br><br>  And here we smoothly proceed to the next item. <br><br><h6>  Perversions with sync </h6><br>  It would seem, what is easier?  There are two data sets, on the phone and on the computer, there is the date of the last synchronization.  Everything that is changed in the phone is transferred to the computer;  Everything that is changed on the computer is in the phone.  What has been changed both there and there causes a synchronization conflict - it is then necessary to ask the user what he thinks about this.  Well, checkboxes from the series ‚Äúsynchronize contacts - synchronize video - synchronize all other types of content‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo this is exactly what is on the aytyuns!‚Äù The user will say.  And it will be wrong.  Above is an example about program synchronization.  The fact that I do not want to synchronize programs does not mean that I want to remove them.  But no alternative suggested.  Either synchronize or delete. <br><br>  Same with other types of content.  Either they are synchronized or deleted.  Itunes is an unpleasant thought that something might just lie in the iPhone.  And the synchronization of this content may not be necessary for me at all.  The breakthrough was a tick "handle music and video manually." <br><br>  "But what about the fight against piracy!".  No way.  Well, absolutely nothing.  Because next to the iPhone for sale flash drive for $ 10.  Which for the convenience of transferring files is much better than any iPhone. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  And is there an e-mail castemer? <br><br>  On the one hand, there are many devices in similar mass-dimensional characteristics.  But after careful feeling of the HTC Touch HD, Nokia 5800, Nokia N97 and the like, I took an iPhone.  For the glitches and brakes WinMobayla got even for Hewlett with Packard, and I did not notice the changes.  And Nokia has the ability to produce semi-finished products and then finish them. <br><br>  What is missing?  Multitasking!  And ActiveSync for synchronization =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76314/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76314/</a></p>
