  <section class="page js-page"><h1>YouTube star turned out to be an actress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube is</a> becoming so popular that with its help real stars are born.  They have a huge popularity and many thousands of army of fans who are looking forward to each new series of video podcasts.  One of the celebrities on YouTube was the mysterious ‚Äúlonely girl‚Äù Bree (Bree) with her nickname <a href="http://youtube.com/user/lonelygirl15">Lonelygirl15</a> , which very religious parents allegedly kept home schooling and were not allowed to go to school.  The video blog on YouTube was her only way to make friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the past four months, a real Internet drama has unfolded around Lonelygirl15, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/technology/13lonely.html%3Fex%3D1315800000%26amp%3Ben%3D7eae0d6786f68939%26amp%3Bei%3D5088">writes the NY Times</a> .  As a result, it turned out that a 20-year-old student of the acting institute plays a fictional character under the nickname Lonelygirl15 ( <a href="">photo</a> ).  Moreover, videos are shot by professional experts ( <a href="">photo</a> ), and the project even has a producer.  Multimillion audience of viewers professionally circled around the finger. <br><br>  In fact, the girl's name is Jessica Rose (Jessica Rose).  A native of New Zealand is 20 years old and she lives in Los Angeles, where she studies as an actress.  The fact that tens of thousands of viewers considered her a vlog is in fact the basis for the future movie.  The life story of Lonelygirl15 turned out to be fiction from start to finish. <br><br>  The first suspicions appeared when one of the spectators (the son of a Hollywood newspaper reporter) stated that one of the heroines of the film reminds him of an actress he had seen somewhere.  An investigation has begun.  Soon the audience was able to establish the name of this actress, and gradually other details of the hoax became known.  All doubts were dispelled when it was discovered that the Lonelygirl15 fan site was registered before the first series of its video podcast was published on the Web.

      The ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of this grand scam is the scriptwriter and director Ramesh Flinders (Ramesh Flinders) and his assistant programmer.  From the very beginning, the high quality of video materials aroused suspicion among viewers.  Therefore, scenes in bed were filmed at Flinders home with a cheap webcam. <br><br>  To deceive the many thousands of audiences, various tricks were used.  For example, emails were sent on behalf of a fictional character from different IP addresses. <br><br>  The director set his goal to make a movie that would look super-realistic and cause the maximum resonance among the Internet audience.  He did it perfectly well.  The organizer of the project believes that he invented a ‚Äúnew genre in art‚Äù.  Cinema, where reality is so closely intertwined with fiction that it is almost impossible to distinguish one from the other.  The director does not plan to stop the release of new series now, when the hoax is revealed.  On the contrary, after such a scandal the popularity of Bree can reach new heights. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4406/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4406/</a></p>
