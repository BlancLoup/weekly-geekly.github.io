And today we <b>are glad to present a new service for evaluating companies</b> , with the help of which everyone can find out what their employees think about the company as an employer. <br><br>  We believe that the new service will help employers discover their strengths and weaknesses and work more consciously to improve the HR brand, and also make the IT labor market even more structured and transparent and help employers and job seekers find each other better. <br><br>  Ratings can leave any registered user who has experience in the relevant company.  ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù guarantees complete anonymity of ratings: they can only be shown in an impersonal or aggregated form with other assessments.  <i>In the first part of our announcement, we will describe how the new service is arranged and how the estimates are considered.</i>

      Before launching the ratings service, we tested it on a narrow circle of more than 50 companies that received ratings from their employees.  We thank everyone who responded to our call to test a new service and gave valuable advice on how to improve it!  <i><a href="https://habr.com/company/moikrug/blog/418047/">In the second part of</a> our announcement, we will show the companies that participated in the test and received the highest marks.</i> <br><br>  So on My Circle looks like the <a href="https://moikrug.ru/companies/yandex/scores">evaluation page of the company Yandex</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oa/cx/md/oacxmdszevu8gn85djzmmmqopve.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  How to view a company valuation and give your assessment </h3><br>  On the main page of each company appeared the block ‚ÄúCompany Assessment by Employees‚Äù.  In this block, the average rating of the company, the average recommendation, and the number of assessments collected and comments left are displayed in a short form.  To see the assessment in all details, you need to click on the <b>"Assessment in detail</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  To give an assessment to the company in which you work or have worked, you need to go to its main page and, in the <b>assessment section,</b> click on the <b>‚ÄúPost Your Rating‚Äù</b> button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/886/b73/f08/886b73f08116c84417bba0f028f442ce.png"><br><br><h3>  How is the assessment </h3><br>  The company can be assessed according to 12 criteria: for each set a rating from 1 - I completely disagree, up to 5 - I fully agree.  Based on the individual estimates obtained for each criterion, its average rating is calculated (as a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%258F%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_NPS">weighted average</a> ).  And further, according to all criteria, the <b>average rating of the company</b> as a whole is calculated (as the arithmetic average of the average estimates for all criteria). <br><br>  Also, you can indicate how likely you will recommend the company as an employer to your friends: I will not recommend the rating from 0, I will definitely recommend it to 10.

When selecting criteria, our past research helped us, here is one of them: ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/moikrug/blog/317448/">Can IT professionals change jobs without increasing pay</a> ?‚Äù <br><br>  On the evaluation form, the employee receives questions in the following form and, choosing 1 to 5, shows how much he agrees with each of the statements: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Interesting tasks</b> .  The company solve interesting problems. <br></li><li>  <b>Modern technology</b> .  The company uses modern technology. <br></li><li>  <b>Adequate salary</b> .
