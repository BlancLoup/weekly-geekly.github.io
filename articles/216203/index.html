      However, very often the customer himself does not know or misunderstands what tasks he will have to solve later.  And that they need to be solved together with marketers in order to achieve the promotion of their product or service. <br><br>  Accordingly, the initial task of the seller (Sales Manager) in this situation will be to talk about the methods and tools of promotion.  But it is worth pointing out that in order to make an informed choice of one or another method or a whole complex of measures, it is necessary to conduct a series of audits.  These will be audits of the technical part of the project, the market of existing proposals and competition.  After that, you can more consciously choose technology for the future product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Quite often there are situations when the selected stack of technologies is suitable for the implementation of a business idea, but it is absolutely not suitable for its further promotion.  A good example would be an online store written in Flash.  Or the client comes for support and ‚Äúdopilivaniem‚Äù a very old project.  This is often easier to rewrite than to edit.  Yes, and in terms of marketing is extremely difficult to implement support.  At the same time, such projects are often very inert and any change in them affects the lowest levels of the architecture and can respond in the most unexpected place. <br><br>  In this case, the success of any marketing task depends on the flexibility of technology.  And the complexity / impossibility of marketing support for a ‚Äúdinosaur‚Äù project can be one of the bricks that will help build the foundation for product development from scratch, which in turn is good for developers (it takes away the need to dig hundreds of thousands of lines of someone else‚Äôs outdated code with funny comments) . <br><br>  At this stage it is better to ‚Äúoutbid than undercount‚Äù.  If you initially outline the range of marketing tools that will form requirements for the project, it is much easier to take into account the requirements during the development process than to ‚Äúfinish‚Äù the finished product (deliver crutches and listen to hundreds of complaints about the dramatic increase in time and human resources costs). <br><br><h2>  WHAT A SELLER CAN OFFER TO A CUSTOMER: </h2><br>  All Internet marketing services by and large can be divided and classified according to the stages at which the project is located. <br><br><h3>  STAGE 1: Pre-release preparations and the launch stage of the Web product </h3><br><ul><li>  Market analysis: research on search engines, an approximate assessment of the target audience (CA), competition, traffic volumes in the subject area and trends; </li></ul><br>  On the side of the marketing department, you can implement the selection of the semantic core and conduct an indicative analysis of competitor traffic, on the basis of which it will be possible to judge the estimated cost and difficulty of promotion in this product. <br><br><ul><li>  design of interfaces for landing pages, taking into account usability; </li></ul><br>  In order to get positive results in any commercial project, it is not enough just to bring traffic to a resource.  In this case, conversion indicators (transactions, subscriptions, downloads) can serve as qualitative indicators.  And in order for the user not only to read the information, but to make an action on the site (subscribed, ordered, bought), it is necessary to implement quality landing pages for traffic. <br><br><ul><li>  making recommendations for SEO for implementation on the site during the development process; </li></ul><br>  The best option.  The work on the internal optimization of the site according to the requirements of search engines is carried out in parallel with the development, therefore, after the release of the project, it is not necessary to make major changes to the architecture and logic of the product. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An important point!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is necessary to explain to the client that the answer to the question ‚ÄúWho is your Central Asia?‚Äù The answer ‚Äúour Central Asia is all Internet users‚Äù is inadmissible, it means that there is no understanding to whom the site is aimed, and therefore it is not clear how it should be. <br>  Also, the customer must answer the standard question ‚ÄúWhat is the peculiarity of my product or service?‚Äù. <br></div></div><br><br><h3>  2 STAGE: Work with already launched product / service </h3><br><ul><li>  <strong>Audit of an existing site and making recommendations for internal optimization;</strong> </li></ul><br>  It will identify problem areas in the site architecture, non-compliance with the requirements of search engines and make recommendations for their elimination. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Preparing the site for promotion in search engines (SEO);</strong> </li></ul><br>  A set of measures taken on the internal optimization of the site in accordance with the recommendations based on the requirements of search engines.  Necessary in order to increase the visibility of the site in search engines, and, consequently, traffic to the site. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An important point!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is necessary to explain to the client that <br><ul><li>  positions in search engines (in particular, in Google) on the screen of their monitor are not identical to positions on the screens of other users who enter this query not only within one country / region / state / city, but even for each user separately; </li><li>  positions on requests that ‚Äúlike‚Äù the client without information on frequency, seasonality of traffic, etc.  even under the condition of being in one place, they may not bring visits or conversions; </li><li>  no company can guarantee positions in search engines, and those companies that provide such guarantees simply provide a budget for risks at the expense of the client; </li><li>  Positions in search engines are not always reflected in the traffic coming to the site. </li></ul><br></div></div><br><ul><li>  <strong>contextual advertising (PPC)</strong> </li></ul><br>  Promoting a finished web product is easiest with contextual advertising.  Even without a serious information base, it will work.  In context advertising everything is transparent - the client pays a specific amount for a specific user.  The user comes and does what they want from him or not. <br><br>  If the project is a monster of the Mesozoic era, contextual advertising can be used without making changes on the site itself.  It is enough to make some good adaptive static Landing Pages (landing pages) and from there build traffic to those corners of the site or service you need. <br><br>  Also, this tool is just perfect for ‚Äúprobing‚Äù key requests and other types of testing user behavior. <br><br><h3>  STAGE 3: Work on Conversions </h3><br><ul><li>  <strong>Web analytics</strong> </li></ul><br>  The audit will identify problem areas on the site, identify key indicators by which you can monitor the effectiveness of certain activities, identify patterns of behavior and common features of the site‚Äôs audience. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Site usability audit</strong> </li></ul><br>  It will help to find out at what stage users of the site may have problems with navigation, making a decision to complete a transaction and give recommendations for improving the interface in order to increase conversions. <br><br><h3>  4 STAGE: Work on brand loyalty </h3><br><ul><li>  <strong>social media marketing (SMM)</strong> </li></ul><br>  Creating, maintaining and maintaining company profiles in social networks.  It will help the service / product / company to become closer and more ‚Äútransparent‚Äù to users. <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>direct marketing (e-mail marketing)</strong> </li></ul><br>  Creation of layouts, layout and content filling of various letters that will be sent to users (mailings with goods, newsletters, event mailings). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An important point!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It should be remembered: none of the marketing channels, if you use it and only it, will not give quick and stunning results.  But working at once through several channels after some time often leads to a synergistic effect (when 1 + 1 is not 2, but 3).  :) <br></div></div><br><h2>  HOW AND WHEN TO OFFER: </h2><br><h3>  1. The client came up with the idea, and our company will implement the website. </h3><br>  At the stage of discussing the draft of a future website / web service, you need to ask whether the client knows his future target audience (hereinafter referred to as CA) which competitors are in the project (there are some competitors). <br><br>  If a client weakly imagines his target user, he needs to offer him a quick study of Central Asia.  This will help determine the main sources of traffic, subscriptions, purchases that the website will have.  In accordance with this data, the architecture and structure of the project may change. <br>  Depending on the target audience and you can offer the client to initially optimize the site for macretzing needs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cc/c81/386/4ccc81386a087db9658448a00e367dae.png"><br><br>  You should also pay attention to the initial usability of all interface elements. <br><br><h3>  2. The client already has a ready site.  He is interested in upgrading, expanding functionality, marketing support. </h3><br>  Along with the changes on the site to expand the functionality, you can offer the client an audit of the existing channels of visitors / buyers. <br><br>  To do this, you need to have access to all analytics and marketing tools that are already used on the site (Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Bing Webmaster Tools, Google AdWords, etc), access to the admin panel of the site itself, as well as get the initial data by conversions, etc. <br><br><h4>  Further, on the basis of the data obtained, we can compile: </h4><br><ul><li>  or a short list of recommendations with a description of problem areas in the marketing of the client company, technical problems in the work of the site; </li><li>  or a complete list of recommendations describing problems in marketing and technical aspects of the site. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An important point!</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This report with recommendations will also include data on possible problems in usability, as well as the ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù found during web analytics on the site. <br></div></div><br><h4>  At the exit, the client receives information about where problems are found by: </h4><br><ul><li>  the technical part of the site in general (Technical Issues); </li><li>  website promotion in search engines (SEO); </li><li>  optimization of paid traffic campaigns (PPC); </li><li>  promotion of the company in social networks (SMM). </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">SHORT CHECKLIST MARKETING WORKS</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  When choosing a marketing strategy, you can use one or several tools at once.  And further for their introduction the following actions are necessary: <br><br><h3>  SEO </h3><br><ol><li>  Collection of semantic core (Semantic Core). </li><li>  Writing or editing existing metadata and content on the client‚Äôs site (Meta &amp; Content Tuning): </li></ol><br><ul><li>  titles; </li><li>  meta descriptions; </li><li>  indication of canonical pages; </li><li>  image captions; </li><li>  writing text content; </li><li>  technical issues (for example, performance). </li></ul><br><h3>  PPC </h3><br><ol><li>  Connect, configure Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools. </li><li>  Audit and analysis of the current situation. </li><li>  Preparation and implementation of technical improvements of the project. </li><li>  Collection and approval of semantics. </li><li>  Preparation and maintenance of PPC Ads. </li></ol><br><h3>  SMM </h3><br><ul><li>  Connect, configure Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools. </li><li>  Audit, analysis of the current situation. </li><li>  Preparation and implementation of technical improvements of the project. </li><li>  Collection and approval of semantics. </li><li>  Creation, maintenance of social accounts. </li></ul><br><h3>  DIRECT MARKETING </h3><br><ol><li>  Accumulation of user base, its further segmentation, depending on the needs and capabilities of the customer. </li><li>  Choosing the direction of work on mailings: the definition of key triggers (transactional, threshold, recurrent, informational). </li><li>  Design, layout and filling layouts. </li><li>  Creating campaigns for mailings. </li><li>  Support and analytics. </li></ol><br></div></div><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  Of course, everything described above is far from a complete list of information that vendors of the services of development companies should familiarize themselves with, however, it may become a good basis for accumulating their internal knowledge base for small companies that are just starting to gain momentum. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216203/</a></p>
