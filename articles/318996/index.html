  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Pink Eurollers dream of censorship on the topic "1984"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The news source is an article by a German <a href="https://juliareda.eu/2016/12/10-illegal-things/">MP</a> from the Pirate Party <a href="https://juliareda.eu/2016/12/10-illegal-things/">juliareda.eu/2016/12/10-illegal-things</a> on its own website, where it brings up some glaring lobbying cases and monitors lobbying events.  Its latest information deserves the special attention of the IT community, so far at the level of proposals to the European Parliament (hereinafter everywhere?).  Not the most recent European Commissioner (for the digital economy and society), G√ºnther Oettinger, will recently leave his post, which determines the EU‚Äôs Internet policy and moves up - it will control the EU budget.  But the crown of his path in the current position has left an amazing bill that, if fully implemented, will deeply affect familiar relations on the Internet and sow new hopes in the hearts of thousands of simple copywriters around the world.  Speech, in fact - about the reform of copyright. <br><br>  In short - what he offers.  (Ranked by degree of influence on IT.) <br><br>  * Github will be obliged to check all downloads of the source code for copyright infringement; <br>  * Wikipedia will be censored for photo uploads; <br>  * You will not be able to develop your own realization of artificial intelligence based on texts and other data protected by copyright (except for scientific research institutes for the purposes of scientific research); <br>  * Prevent search engines from indexing pages even for the purpose of storing data (i.e., "for yourself" is also impossible); <br>  * Pictures can not be attached anywhere, as in social networks now, even ‚Äúfor the soul‚Äù, for copyright; <br>  * In Twitter, you can not copy the author's phrases, slogans, headlines; <br>  * In social networks, of course, you can not copy posts from blogs; <br>  * You can not even share links (yes, links with arbitrarily short quotes), this is a copyright, the property of the authors (you can, if with permission, for money or in some other way agreed); <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  * In the portfolio you can not put something copyrighted, and sites where portfolio are formed, will be required to prevent violations (now only removed on demand); <br>  * But what is good (or someone like that): the draft law does not impose restrictions on the activity of file sharing services like Megaupload.

    <h3>  Github </h3><br>  This large site with red-eyed has long been unnerving respected rights holders.  Let's think in new ways.  So that they do not, sticking their tongues out, run across thousands of accounts, looking for where to cut the money.  It would be more fair if they agree with them and start to bring money on a silver platter beforehand.  And piety before the haves will rise here, and faith in the power of the law.  In any case - 9 will not pay, the 10th will at least believe that he must pay.  Isn't this the brilliant goal of any laws - so that they begin to be believed? <br><br><h3>  Wikipedia </h3><br>  So what if they do not extract profits?  Here the seals in the ocean, too, do not extract anything, but we also find ways to tear off their skin and make a profit?  How is this plankton worse than nerpa?  Moreover, it is reasonable and will begin to realize that on someone else's loaf should open their mouths, only paying. <br><br><h3>  Own realization of artificial intelligence </h3><br>  It is impossible, it is impossible.  Here you are from where the data for analysis perceptron AI take?  The noise of mosquitoes from wildlife?  Type something?  Not.  All researchers completely strive to take someone else's (author!) Data.  Even if this is the sound of whales, then someone fished him out of nature?  Are you ready to pay for the work of extractors?  Here, scientific research institutes can, all their activities are regulated and they will not get away from the boards.  But researchers, hackers (horror) - they are rogue, they try to grab everything themselves and can‚Äôt share it with the publishers of the newspapers, and just a lot of authors whose texts will be taken for analysis.  Not a business, gentlemen, not a business. <br><br><h3>  The ban on search engines indexing </h3><br>  Guys, nothing personal, they gave you to eat, fur and other goodies.  Now we need to become civilized, you understand this well with your advertising nonsense.  So we have our own interest in how to make profit for our digital content.  Our history lasts from the Middle Ages, we just let you frolic.  And your plankton will be pressed to the nail, it's 1984! <br><br><h3>  Pictures can not be attached anywhere </h3><br>  Well, why not immediately?  Can!  But for the money.  Be sure that there are plenty of free resources, over the years of this farce, and that, and the other has accumulated in bulk.  All will be satisfied, and some - more satisfied. <br><br><h3>  In Twitter, you can not copy the author's phrases </h3><br>  It seemed to you the strangest?  Like any brilliant idea, at first it seems wild to many.  But judge, if there is a copyright on the complete work, then why not be in it for phrases?  Moreover, the fish bite at them, nobody will deny anything here.  And if they bite, there is a cutting. <br><br><h3>  In social networks, of course, you can not copy posts </h3><br>  Of course of course.  Forgive us for our oversight, but you understand, civilization does not immediately enter into every home, European values ‚Äã‚Äãdo not immediately find their way in the jungle of digital communications.  But over time, this is inevitable.  Have you heard the link idea yet? <br><br><h3>  You can't even share links. </h3><br>  This is a brain explosion!  All that these red-eyed botanists invented, then did, then involved a lot of ordinary people, you with us - all this is illegal.  Cannot be referenced (without paying).  Pointing at the other, you take away a piece of his glory.  Some of the screamers managed to hang, someone climbed on the heads of others ... But let's not talk about it.  Now everything will be legal.  Whoever first said ‚ÄúA‚Äù and paid - he will continue to receive dividends, while others will be able to listen and pay, or pay and listen.  Ideally, the money will be collected from true sources of news and from the chain of the few working people whose work it is to bring the news to all of you. <br><br><h3>  In the portfolio you can not put something copyright </h3><br>  Of course.  And if earlier the traffickers from the last forces watched where their piece of labor was snatching, then now everything will be better - everyone will know that he has to pay.  And sites with a portfolio will help with this.  Ideally, without being tested for uniqueness, neither your photos, nor collages, nor even texts and codes will go to sites.  For something you can, of course, pay. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúMegaupload is too tough for us‚Äù </h3><br>  Well, what are we going to do with it, say European bureaucrats, even if the US government could not rein in it?  We, they say, will get levies from social networks, to which we have our hands, which will pay us, you just give us the laws. <br><br><h3>  What do people on this planet do now? </h3><br>  The author - a deputy of the European Parliament, offers this.  This bill has just begun to be discussed.  She invites readers to help reject the introduction of additional copyrights for publishers by contacting their MEPs directly and support the associations of EBLIDA and LIBER libraries, which are struggling (seemingly) to expand the list of favorites in these new marvelous exceptions for scientific research institutes that are generously allowed to do data analysis scientific work in general.  He draws attention to the fact that Mozilla and the advocates of ‚Äúdigital rights‚Äù from the EDRi organization have already criticized this bill. <br><br>  What to say about such deputies who critically dislike European copyright traditions?  This is England, the 18th century.  A wonderful discovery, analogue of usury money.  Suppose you invented a pixel and registered your patent.  And now you would get dividends to death, thinking only about what else to invent.  And even the heirs received them for another 25 years, and in the case of Disney - all 90 or more.  You are given a law tool, and you?  Europeans do not see their happiness. <br><br>  <i><b>UPD</b> (after about 24 hours): responded to a great, informative comment on <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/lair/" class="user_link">lair</a> here - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/318996/">habrahabr.ru/post/318996/#comment_9998114</a> .</i>  <i>In 2 words - I do not agree on all the points of the ‚Äúarrival‚Äù:).</i>  <i>(Sorry for not being able to respond promptly, so I missed the ensuing discussion.)</i> <br><br><ol><li>  <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2016/09/26/help-fix-copyright-send-a-rebellious-selfie-to-european-parliament-really/">Mozilla: Help me fix the copyright, send a protest in the form of a selfie to the European Parliament (Seriously!)</a> - a critical response on Mozilla‚Äôs blog about this bill. </li><li>  <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-3010_en.htm">European Union 2016: The European Commission proposes to update the copyright for the life and prosperity of European culture (press release)</a> - September 2016 </li><li>  <a href="https://edri.org/eu-copyright-directive-privatised-censorship-and-filtering-of-free-speech/">EDRi <i>(European Digital Rights Internship Opportunity in Brussels)</i> : The European Commission directive on copyright is the privatization of censorship and the filtering of freedom of speech</a> - October 2016, about the same thing. <br></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/318996/">https://habr.com/ru/post/318996/</a></p>
