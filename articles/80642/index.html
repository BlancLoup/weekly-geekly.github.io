On the eve of the celebration of the New Year on behalf of my <a href="http://microolap.com/">office</a> , I distributed personal licenses for ER designers: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mysql/79706/">PgMDD</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mysql/79706/">MyMDD</a> (for PostgreSQL and MySQL, respectively).  In my opus, I want to reveal some statistical aspects, and to share conclusions drawn from your requests, friends. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Popularity </h3><br>  I will not disclose exact figures on the number of licenses given, but I will only say that the planned 8 billion was barely enough for the needs of those who ask.  And this is taking into account the <a href="http://www.perepis-2010.ru/counter.php">official</a> (official?) ~ 7 billion of the world's population.  In my opinion, the Chinese do not agree on something. <br><br>  Your attention is a statistical "bubble", it is a torus.  By the way, it was made with the help of a smart <a href="http://www.onlinecharttool.com/">online tool</a> , which I found quite by accident. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e19/498/eb3/e19498eb3eed6f4a61a4aab841143542.png">

      I don‚Äôt know how to evaluate the result of 63% for MySQL versus 36% for PostgreSQL.  I suggest you to make far-reaching conclusions to you, habrazhitel, in the comments.  I personally believe that the ‚ÄúWishing Postgres‚Äù caste got drunk before their brothers in mind couldn‚Äôt ask for a gift.  Let me remind you that the case was December 30 at the height of the fierce corporate parties, of which the author of these lines also became a victim. <br><br><h3>  Castes </h3><br>  It is worth paying attention to one interesting fact.  Hardly anyone is surprised that we were intently reading letters from people with mailboxes different from gmail.com and mail.ru, and more specifically from people with corporate mailboxes. <br><br>  So if students and web freelancers prevail in requests for a designer for MySQL, then corporate people are asked for postgres, and there are a lot of them.  We saw nothing surprising in the fact that PostgreSQL is seriously considered an alternative to Oracle, at least for new projects.  In this regard, I confess, I was surprised by the fact that no one asked for support from <a href="http://www.enterprisedb.com/">EnterpriseDB</a> , the designer of the DBMS, which aggressively positions itself as ‚ÄúPostgreSQL compatible with Oracle‚Äù (Built upon PostgreSQL ... offers deeper Oracle¬Æ compatibility). <br><br><h3>  Population </h3><br>  Let's talk about people.  Our people have always been famous for simplicity, open heart.  And this time he did not let him doubt his qualities.  Every fourth of the gifted asked both designers at once.  Some, though in natural modesty, sent two letters at different times, which added to us anal pain, but not critical. <br><br>  We can also share approximate data on the ‚Äúlayers‚Äù of the population: <br><ul><li>  80% - students and teachers (to study), </li><li>  5% - freelancers (earn), </li><li>  3% - state institutions </li><li>  2% - girls (judging by the names). </li></ul><br><br>  This is a very rough estimate, but still. <br><br>  From amusing (read ‚Äúto no one needed‚Äù) facts, I want to give statistics on popular names: <br><br><ul><li>  7.3% - Alexander </li><li>  7.2% - Dmitry </li><li>  6.5% - Sergey </li><li>  5.7% - Alexey </li><li>  5.2% - Andrey </li><li>  3.8% - Eugene </li><li>  2.9% - Michael </li><li>  2.9% - Maxim </li><li>  2.8% - Anton </li><li>  2.7% - Pavel </li><li>  2.7% - Vladimir. </li></ul><br><br>  Based on the results, one thing can be said with certainty - the Chinese skillfully mimic. <br><br><h3>  post office </h3><br><br>  We were not surprised by the fact that the hegemon in the field of postal services today is none other than Google.  The share of people with boxes from the ‚Äúcorporation of good‚Äù was 58.7% percent.  The closest competitors of Yandex and Mail.ru have a share of 7.2% each.  There were many people who chose to provide us with their corporate mailboxes for registration.  But in general, the Google Mail is walking around the planet. <br><br>  By the way, the burden of registration and processing fell on the shoulders of two fragile girls.  They made a great manual work.  They even wrote to all the owners of all the servers that sent us nonsense like this: <br><br> <code>host mxs.majordomo.ru [78.108.81.249]: 550-host 80.73.171.170 is listed in rbl.majordomo.ru, use: <br> 550 htt://majordomo.ru/rbl for remove IP</code> <br> <br><br>  or such: <br><br> <code>host imx2.rambler.ru [81.19.88.6]: 554 5.7.1 Spam message rejected; If this is not spam contact abuse at rambler-co.ru</code> <br> <br><br>  There were no answers, draw conclusions about the services.  We understand GMail, which can shove a message into spam, but stupidly not to accept it - in our opinion it‚Äôs just overkill. <br><br><h3>  Feedback </h3><br>  Feedback from you began to flow right there.  What pleased - as developers, and grieved - as people born in the USSR.  I had to literally pull myself out of the festive table like the notorious Baron Munchausen.  And urgently check, prepare and respond.  By the undoubted victory of Habr in the affairs of the bugfix, it is worth noting the <a href="http://microolap.com/products/database/postgresql-designer/download/">beta</a> released hot on the heels of the PostgreSQL designer.  And the most amazing thing is that this beta was aimed at fixing problems with Wine. <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  Wins and accomplishments to you in the new year, friends! <br><br><h3>  PS </h3><br>  I did not include a <a href="http://microolap.com/products/database/mssql-designer/">designer for MsSQL</a> in this statistic, since it is in a state of being.  ‚ÄúPrebeta‚Äù is such a euphemism among us, you can safely use it - the monitor will not explode.  There is simply no documentation yet and still there are small shoals for which reports licenses are readily given after the release of the combat release.  Well, you know how it is. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80642/</a></p>
