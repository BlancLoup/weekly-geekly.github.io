  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why learning is a new procrastination</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The world is rich in online courses, blogs, social media, free e-books, podcasts and webinars, which gives a truly great opportunity to expand your knowledge in any field that you can imagine. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/ece/d64/adfeced643ea40dd9fa4249deec00ee4.jpeg"></div><br>  Thanks to technological progress and instant access to the Internet, anyone can now learn even from home.  It would be foolish not to use this opportunity to improve your knowledge and skills. <br><br>  In addition, in part you are even forced to do this, since the modern world has raised the bar higher than ever before.  It literally makes you constantly accelerate the pace. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not surprisingly, in the end, you try to be everywhere at once and do everything at once.  Without a doubt, you are doing everything possible to constantly collect tiny bits of information from any existing channels, because you are afraid that you might fall behind if you stop.

      In the end, you enter non-stop learning mode.  You cannot afford to miss something important and try to read every book that falls into your hands.  You listen to every podcast that can download your smartphone and go through all the online courses that you can buy from your paycheck. <br><br>  In short, you are learning.  As much as possible.  As intense as you can stand it. <br><br>  You are learning how to write and publish a new book.  You learn how to run a successful blog.  You learn how to achieve the goal on Kickstarter.  You will learn how to create the next "unicorn".  You will learn how to get your dream job.  You will learn how to successfully sell thousands of items on Amazon.  You will learn how to make millions of passive income. <br>  However, the problem is that you do everything except for concrete actions. <br><br>  All this activity does not bring you closer to the goals you want to achieve.  Even the best knowledge will not make you more powerful, powerful and successful if you do not put them into practice. <br><br>  The key secret of success lies not in the accumulation of excessive experience, but in the ability to use it. <br><br>  Knowledge is worthless as long as it is not applied.  It goes without saying that learning is crucial.  However, the fact is that now it must take a completely different form.  You must stop learning from others' experiences, other people's knowledge, failures, victories and start learning from your own mistakes, adventures, achievements and audacious actions. <br><br>  Training has become the main trend of the twenty-first century.  Unfortunately, this has also become a <i>new form of procrastination</i> . <br><br>  You deliberately postpone the first step, justifying it with your zeal for expanding your knowledge and learning new things.  You postpone the starting date, motivating it with your desire to gain new skills that would help you succeed faster.  You are postponing the pursuit of your own aspirations, because to act on your own and create your own success story is much more difficult than reading about other people's experiences. <br><br>  In the meantime, no one really would even blame you for wasting your time.  In addition, you feel comfortable, always staying within this zone of ease and convenience. <br>  However, the fact is that you already have and know everything you need to get started.  In fact, there is already nothing that you still need to learn in order to take the first step. <br><br>  Accept this truth.  No matter how good your theoretical knowledge is, you will still encounter many obstacles while you enter this knowledge into practice.  You have to deal with such problems, which you have never read in any book.  You will have to find and make spontaneous decisions, to which, perhaps, no one has yet thought of you.  You have to design your own path to success. <br><br><ul><li>  Stop learning by mindlessly consuming.  Start learning by creating. </li><li>  Stop learning by exploring.  Start learning by working. </li><li>  Stop learning by listening.  Start learning by talking. </li><li>  Stop learning by reading.  Start learning by writing. </li><li>  Stop learning by watching the game.  Start learning by playing it. </li><li>  Stop procrastinating.  Start doing. </li></ul><br>  Transform your learning process from continuous procrastination to an endless process of absorbing invaluable experience based on your own path. <br><br>  It would seem that all this is contrary to common sense, but the old-fashioned way of learning is exactly what pulls you back.  This is what levels all your achievements. <br><br>  Continuously learning, evaluating ideas, pondering and visualizing your way to the main aspirations, you will not move further than the place where you are now.  But specific actions will help you move on. <br><br>  You can sit and explore, explore and explore, while someone is already reaping the fruits of their fruitful and hard work. <br><br>  Stop just learning.  Get brave enough to take the first step and start learning from your experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322980/</a></p>
