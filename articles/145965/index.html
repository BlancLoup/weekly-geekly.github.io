Under the cut you will find information about the course of the competition, the correct answers to the tasks and, of course, the name of the winner.  Thanks to everyone who participated, discussed the competition in the comments and our congratulations to the winner. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  About the competition </h4><br>  Total responses to the contest were sent to us by 41 people.  Many people wrote / discussed the answers in the comments to the topic, but under the terms of the competition, these answers were not considered.  The first answer came 34 minutes after the start of the competition.  Unfortunately, no one scored 7 points in this competition, having solved all the tasks and earned a bonus point.  Several people scored 6 points at once, and in both possible ways - for 6 solved tasks and for 5 tasks + bonus point.  The first 6 points scored <a href="https://twitter.com/">@MarkAblov</a> (he is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mark_ablov/" class="user_link">mark_ablov</a> ).  His <a href="http://pastebin.com/neY0nAbE">decision is</a> proposed to consider the reference.  Of course, this is only one of the possible options for the correct answer.  We tried to read all the options very carefully: if the proposed solution was different from the one we were supposed to, we definitely checked its correctness, if the proposed programming language was different from ours - we definitely checked whether the program could be executed in this language and whether its execution would give the required output . <br><br><h4>  Typical mistakes </h4><br>  Unfortunately, some people did not carefully read the conditions of the competition and made mistakes in the design of the answer.  For example, splitting the answer into several separate tweets is an error; sending answers to the resume email specified in the topic is an error.  Such answers were not considered, we are very sorry, but be more careful next time.  Another interesting move is posting responses on Twitter with limited access for reading.  Unfortunately, our regular telepath is now on vacation and we did not have the opportunity to read what was published in the ‚Äúsubzamochnymi‚Äù tweets.

    <h5>  Typical task errors </h5><br>  <b>1,2,3.</b>  - there were almost no errors, these tasks were thought of as warming-up and did not cause any problems.  A couple of people, however, managed to make a mistake in the numbering of lines (although the numbering order was specified in the task). <br><br>  <b>4.</b> This is not bash or perl.  This is PowerShell.  I admit the options that with the help of some aliases \ hacks \ additional code, the proposed construction with a regular expression could be performed in other languages, but in the problem statement it was clearly stated that all fixes should be reduced to editing one line of code and not touch nothing more.  This is only possible for PowerShell.  And yet - to replace this line completely (the example consists of just one line) with print in your favorite language with the language indicated in the answer - this is, of course, a very creative solution.  But the invalid, as stated in the conditions of the competition. <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Transfer the increment to the second printf argument ‚Äî the wrong solution.  It can really work on some compiler or platform, but in general the standard says that the order of calculating the function's arguments is not defined, the comma operator in this place is not a sequence point. <br><br>  <b>6. The</b> answer "Assembler" was not accepted as correct.  This is DCPU-16.  The options ‚ÄúAssembler for the DCPU-16 processor‚Äù or ‚ÄúBytecode for the DCPU-16 virtual machine‚Äù would also be accepted, but the answer without specifying the platform is no. <br><br><h4>  Winner </h4><br>  Dear <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/mark_ablov/" class="user_link">mark_ablov</a> , please contact me through personal mail on Habr√© or by mail (in my profile).  If you personally can not get a prize, perhaps you have friends or acquaintances who can get a ticket in Kiev on June 18th or 19th. <br><br>  Thanks again to all participants and readers.  Stay tuned, this is not the last contest. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145965/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145965/</a></p>
