And the day after tomorrow, I and my colleagues from <a href="https://python.ru/">Moscow Python</a> will gather developers at <a href="https://conf.python.ru/">the conference of the same name</a> : to drink coffee, chat, chat and chat again!  And in order to have something to talk about, we divided 14 speakers into two streams, who will tell you the most curious things from the world of Python development and set topics for discussion.  Ilya Beda, the Bro.Engineering techlead, is the ‚Äúfull stack developer‚Äù that is on the Python backend, and on the JavaScript frontend and on the Qt desktop.  At the conference, Ilya will talk about constructing your own DSL using Python data structures.  And on Habr√©, he has already answered many tricky questions and told how he looks at the development.  By the way, you can familiarize yourself with the previous three interviews <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/Voximplant/blog/308726/">here</a> , <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/Voximplant/blog/309168/">here</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/Voximplant/blog/311536/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What did you do as a developer?</b>  <b>What companies, tasks, programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies?</b>  <b>Where are you using Python now?</b> <br><br>  Once upon a time I was doing desktop software on Qt.  The most memorable project is to automate the recording of athlete starts.  Then I realized the real value of bugs.  When in the winter at -30 you need to go by bus to the other end of the city with a flash drive in order to update the buggy system. <br><br>  At that time, I generally laughed at WEB technologies.

      Then for some time he worked as an admin and there he started writing tools in Python to optimize routine tasks.  Then it turned from a console utility into a web application so that my colleagues could use them too.  And then I realized that it was more interesting for me to program, and completely went to the web. <br><br>  Now at Bro.Engineering we are developing various web applications, and we have the whole backend on Python Django. <br><br>  <b>In your experience, what are the strengths and weaknesses of Python in relation to other popular programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãin your area?</b> <br><br>  Python is really multi-paradigm.  This allows you to do truly unique things.  I will talk about such things in my report. <br><br>  <b>If you could go back in time when Guido created Python and give him one, but any advice - what would you say?</b> <br><br>  No need to remove reduce from Python 3. <br><br>  <b>What do you use to write and edit Python code?</b> <br><br>  I used to use PyCharm because of its nice autocompletion.  But after becoming acquainted with functional programming, my code became such that PyCharm could no longer auto-complete it.  Since then, I have been using vim.  There have been attempts to switch to emacs, but so far unsuccessful. <br><br>  <b>Let's play Nostradamus.</b>  <b>What do you think will happen to Python in a few years?</b> <br><br>  I hope that there will be no major changes.  For stability, I love Python.  I also hope the fashion for gradual typing will take place. <br><br>  <b>What do you think about switching from Python 2 to Python 3?</b>  <b>Anything interesting that you personally encountered in practice?</b> <br><br>  Does anyone else use Python 2? <br><br>  <b>What one advice would you give to all new Python developers?</b> <br><br>  Learn to write code with tests right away. <br><br>  <b>What programming language do you write at work other than Python?</b>  <b>And outside of work?</b> <br><br>  A lot of JavaScript, but I'm very unhappy with it and am looking for a replacement.  There is still a bit of clojure for the company's internal projects.  There is a hobby project on Elm. <br><br>  <b>Recommend any book that you have read over the past year, technical or not.</b> <br><br>  Books I read only art.  From the last reading I liked ‚ÄúMolly Blackwater.  Beyond the edge of the world "Nika Perumova.  The book is very different from all its previous, but it went to her advantage.  And technical ones become obsolete before they go out of print.  It is better to get yourself a good collection of Twitter items. <br><br>  <b>Many people think that it is best to start learning programming in Python.</b>  <b>Your opinion?</b> <br><br>  Everything is just like that.  There is nothing better for learning Python. <br><br><h1>  <b><font color="#f0b000">Conference Tickets</font></b> </h1><br>  You can buy on the <a href="https://conf.python.ru/">official website</a> .  I also remind you that on Saturday and Sunday, October 15th and 16th, I <a href="https://intercomconf.com/">invite</a> developers to the cozy hackspace " <a href="http://steelup.ru/">STEEL</a> " at the Exhibition of Economic Achievements, where we have the Russian part of the huge international hackathon <b>TADHack for</b> 24 hours!  Participation is free, prizes are good, registration is <a href="https://tadhack.voximplant.ru/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311538/</a></p>
