In 2009, we redesigned the site with the help of designers, you can still look at it at <a href="http://e-legion.ru/">e-legion.ru</a> .  And in 2011 we also attracted an interface designer :) Inside, I want to talk about the design process of the main page. <br><br><img src="http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/6830/generaluf.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      A software business is primarily the realization of customer goals through the work of programmers.  Guided by this, we set the goals solved by the site, in order of priority: <ol><li>  Attracting customers </li><li>  Attracting employees </li><li>  External PR </li><li>  Employee Website </li></ol>  Our target audience: <ol><li>  Customers </li><li>  Job seekers </li><li>  Journalists </li><li>  Employees of the company </li></ol>  For each target audience, the main tasks solved by the site were written out, and high-quality usability testing of the old site was carried out.  Armed with their results and priorities in the tasks of users, we created wireframes. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b86/c4b/3d3/b86c4b3d3aba650b63ab8f73ce092cd4.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  What have we changed from the previous version of the site?  <b>Everything</b> <br><br>  A little background.  If in the transition from the first version to the second in shock were the designers, then from the second to the third they were joined by interface designers.  It is difficult to disagree with them, even an ordinary user.  Imagine that you are a customer and you want to see the applications we have made for Android.  Submitted?  And now try to find them in the portfolio - difficult.  Or try to find in the corporate blog the news about the first ADCSpb meeting - it is very difficult!  Well, until the end of the world has come, we nevertheless decided to replace the frankly obsolete website, written ‚Äúon the knee‚Äù, with a modern and convenient one. <br><br>  Let's start with information about the company presented on the main page.  The logo and name of the company have a significant size and place on the page.  There is a slogan that clearly explains what the company is doing.  The presence of a contact phone and e-mail address is also required, no need to force the user to go to the "Contacts". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/330/ed7/08a/330ed708a1aa493498f25de98a59cf09.gif" alt="counter for tumblr"><br><br>  If we talk about navigation, the main elements are assigned a very visible area.  Similar in meaning, in turn, are grouped in one place. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25CA%25EE%25F8%25E5%25EB%25E5%25EA_%25CC%25E8%25EB%25EB%25E5%25F0%25E0">Rule 7 + 2</a> .  ‚ÄúShort-term memory can simultaneously contain 7-9 entities.  Often this fact is used to prove the need to reduce the number of items in the navigation menu to 7 ". <br><br>  High-priority tasks such as company information, customer list, latest news, etc., are provided with direct access.  Examples of content are used instead of descriptions: a banner with a description of the last project, located under the header, attracts attention and makes it clear which projects the company is engaged in. <br><br>  The headers and menus use a language that the user understands.  The approach to naming from the point of view of the user, not the company.  No abstruse phrases and marketing slogans in the menu.  For example, "Jobs", and not "We are looking for employees." <br><br>  The search is in the form of a form, not a link to a form.  More recently, it was believed that if the site uses search, then the navigation must be urgently redone.  But this myth was refuted by Stephen Krug in his book ‚Äú <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/49546821/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2-%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D0%25B3-%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-2-%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4">Don't make me think 2.</a> ‚Äù  He proved that the ratio of people using navigation and searching is about 50/50. <br><br>  If we are not talking about the necessity of the search, but about its display, then the guys from Usabilitylab were clearly in favor of the form: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is <i>much better to design a search in the form of a particular form, rather than a link‚Äú Search for goods ‚Äù.</i>  <i>This link sees a lot less people.</i>  <i>And the point is not an extra click - the words are lost among other texts, they may be misinterpreted, they simply cannot be noticed</i> . ‚Äù <br><br>  As a result, we get a site made for the visitor, intuitive and easy to use. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/505/19d/bd6/50519dbd6ddd45f70ea98222712914e9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  I would like to ask the community to evaluate the result.  Still, the site we do primarily for users, so your opinion is very important to us.  For my part, I can promise that all comments will be considered at the general meeting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120209/</a></p>
