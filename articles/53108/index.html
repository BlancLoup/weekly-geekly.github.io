      Once I quit playing WoW :) <br><br>  I had 4-6 hours of free time per day, which, at first, I began to spend on watching movies.  To watch only the best and interesting, I began to use the services of <a href="http://imhonet.ru/">imhonet.ru</a> and <a href="http://kinopoisk.ru/">kinopoisk.ru</a> . <br><br>  After I rated about 200 films on Imhonet, he stopped giving me adequate recommendations, and I really didn‚Äôt want to watch what he was offering.  I stopped going there. <br><br>  I used Kinopoisk a little longer, revised everything with awards over the past few years, revised everything imdb above 8, then uninteresting films went on, in the end, I stopped going and going there. <br><br>  I liked the oral recommendations of friends most of all, because these were not custom-made reviews and not dry assessments, but the opinions of people I know.  So the idea arose, to create a small saytik on which my friends and I will write, who watched what the latest movie, based on the forum threads ‚ÄúWhat was the last movie you watched?‚Äù, Only with convenient search and selection mechanisms for films, while simple interface. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4 months have passed since the launch of the service, during which time a lot of things have changed, many features were implemented that users wanted, the design changed several times, much was rethought. <br><br>  As a result, the following key features are implemented, without any special various bells and whistles: <br><ul><li>  selection of films from the whole heap, on my personal handful according to the principle ‚ÄúI will watch‚Äù, ‚ÄúI will not‚Äù, ‚ÄúI will decide later‚Äù. </li><li>  evaluation of the film viewed and the opportunity to discuss the assessment </li><li>  additional features such as clouds of genres, movie search, the ability to track who has watched what films, will look, etc. </li></ul><br>  In the near future I want to realize: <br><ul><li>  add additional attributes to the film (country, director, actors), and the corresponding navigation and search in these fields </li><li>  add the ability to recommend a specific movie to a specific person (special notification) </li><li>  additional sorting (according to the assessment of a particular user, according to the date of feedback of a particular user) </li></ul><br>  Now the service is moving from alpha to beta, and I invite you to look at what happened. <br>  Do not judge too strictly, worked alone, knowing that as a result, users need more, but did not want to fill the service with "unnecessary" functionality, overload it. <br>  I would be very happy to hear constructive criticism, recommendations, considerations on the topic ‚Äúwhat else is needed / what is extra‚Äù about: <br><ul><li>  current functionality </li><li>  current interface organization, website design </li><li>  regarding development plans </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://kinoestet.ru/">Welcome</a> :) <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> <br>  I <b>do not position</b> my service as a substitute for ikonet or kinopoisku. <br>  I <b>position</b> it as a replacement for the forum branches ‚ÄúAnd what was the last movie you watched?‚Äù, Which are in almost all forums. <br>  Since there are such branches in the forums, it means that people need it, despite the existence of imdb, film searching, etc. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2</b> <br>  I decided not to lose time, that's what I did today :) <br>  - Added RSS to recent comments, link under tag cloud <br>  - Renamed "new" to "unmarked" <br>  - When registering added small rules <br>  - Slightly changed the form of adding a movie, all fields are shown at once <br>  - Fixed a bug about saving a movie with a title that already exists, now instead of an incomprehensible mistake it says what is wrong <br>  - Russian and foreign name is now one link <br>  - Added an author to the movie panel, plus a small redesigner. <br>  - Changed the logo to less aggressive </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53108/</a></p>
