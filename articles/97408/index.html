      The server contains 11 hard drives, of which one is bootable and 10 is a file dump. <br>  How not difficult to count, 10 disks of 2 terabytes - will give the desired 20 terabytes! <br>  How to achieve this? <br>  I'll tell you now! <br><br>  PySy This is a transfer of my article from the Sandbox.  From the moment of its writing, I found out a couple of ‚Äúfun‚Äù things, which were added here. <br><br>  PyPySy This is exactly an amateur solution for cramming such a horde of disks into one computer. <br>  Reliability is realized on the basis of the fact that with such a number of disks - you can put a part in a RAID, and if necessary - easily and naturally replace the one that took off! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Housing </h5><br><br>  Perhaps one of the main problems with cramming such a number of disks into one computer. <br>  I tried several options, including a self-made rack for 10 discs from the corners of the Merlenovsky, but it was all uncomfortable ... <br><br>  As a result, I stopped at the ‚Äúunpretentious‚Äù case for 9 pieces of five-inch slots. <br>  You can take at 10, but there‚Äôs really no point ... <br>  In my case, the choice fell on Silver Stone with a door, but options in bulk! <br>  Something similar - will cost a thousand 2-3 rubles. <br><br><h5>  HDD Basket </h5><br><br>  I took two pieces of MOBILE RACK SATA METALL ST-3051. <br>  This is a device that clogs up with three five-inch slots, instead giving you the opportunity to install 5 SATA drives in each. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d3/150/7d7/1d31507d7cd6dc63a93012fd0f823d4b.jpg" alt="Appearance"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c0/8f6/783/8c08f6783e283b4bdff1769ccda9d037.jpg" alt="Containers extended"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afa/81b/a5c/afa81ba5cde6511dd5e10b232d37388c.jpg" alt="Back view"><br>  Buy this can be about 4357 rubles a piece. <br>  I took before the crisis, so decently saved ... <br><br>  The small detail - what it looks like in the picture is not quite right: in practice, to get into these three five-inch frames you have to put it on its side ... <br><br>  On the rear panel there are five SATA connectors, 2 SATA power supplies and three Molexes (for the most part, it is NOT much necessary for them, but ...).  Plus fan 80 mm. <br>  On the front - work indicators. <br><br>  Each disk is placed in the ‚Äúbasket‚Äù, moves into the ‚Äúbasket‚Äù until it reaches its connectors on the basket board with its own SATA contacts, after which the basket handle is pressed and latched. <br>  Plus, as I recently found out (after three years!), The device ‚ÄúHot Swap‚Äù works fine !!! <br><br>  We put two of these baskets to the bottom of the case, scoring six of the nine slots (just so as not to outweigh the top!). <br>  Now we are ready to put as many as 10 discs! <br><br>  <i><b>UPD</b> In front of the baskets there is a power switch in the form of buttons.</i>  <i>Buttons should be pressed!</i>  <i>And yesterday I cursed everything - some of the disks do not see and that's it!</i>  <i>So far I have not remembered about these buttons - I was tormented byaaaa .....</i> <br><br><h5>  Power Supply </h5><br><br>  Recently upgraded to 600 watts thousand for two rubles. <br>  Previously, it worked with the 350 and is fine, but recently the power supply unit began to ‚Äúpurr‚Äù <br><br><h5>  CD-DVD drive </h5><br><br>  Absolutely useless thing on file storage! <br>  You can put it, but in practice it is easier to take a USB drive and connect it only when installing the system! <br>  As correctly noted in the comments - in principle, you can install a system from a flash drive! <br><br>  In principle, if you put an automatic image copying script on a server somewhere here, it can be useful and bring it to your choice! <br><br>  Of the connection options: if you do it by analogy, you will have a choice of either 2 SATA or 1 IDE.  So - there is where to connect! <br><br><h5>  Mothering percent </h5><br><br>  Any! <br><br>  In practice, a few tips: <br><ul><li>  Do not take frankly weak!  The first time I had a mini-motherboard from VIA, as a result, the network worked through the stump deck! </li><li>  The network is better than gigabit! </li><li>  Pieces 6 SATA on the motherboard, but you can 4 </li><li>  Built-in video adapter: we will manage it over the network, but sometimes you need to configure something on the machine itself and stick a video card for this ‚Äî somehow, not a hunt! </li><li>  PCI-E - desirable, and better more "short" </li></ul><br><br>  The rest is up to you. <br><br>  Warned me of buying ASUS P5Q Premium - I almost lied the other day when I was thinking about upgrading. <br>  It would seem, 10 SATA - what more could you want ?! <br>  In practice, it turned out that there were not 10 of them, but 6 + 4 ... <br>  Those.  6 - normal, and 4 - ‚Äútwo doubles‚Äù, when the disks stuck in them are combined in pairs into ‚Äúreyds‚Äù ... <br><br>  So it is better to take the motherboard to 6 (4) conventional SATA, "finishing off" the remaining expansion cards! <br><br>  <i><i>UPD</i> I had to upgrade to 775 Socket when upgrading.</i>  <i>As a result, namachalaaaaa ... Or 6 SATA, or built-in vidyuha.</i>  <i>In more modern chipsets, the problem is not so acute ...</i> <i><br></i>  <i>As a result, when upgrading I took 4 SATA: I already had PCI controller cards, 2 mothers had PCI on my mother, so I decided that it would still be cheaper than buying a vidyahu ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>(The reason for the upgrade is idiotic ... 11th disc ... While it was 10 - everything was normal. I stuck 11 - so the old mother stubbornly didn‚Äôt see the second CATA! I had to upgrade my mother.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>IMHO - you just had to click on the power micro-buttons on the rivers, but ... We all think with hindsight!</i>  <i>In the plus - now not 2, but 4 disks can work in 3GBS mode!)</i> <br><br><h5>  SATA controller </h5><br><br>  Adaptec AAR-1430SA, for example. <br>  It is placed in the ‚Äúshort‚Äù PSI-E and gives 4 SATA ports. <br>  It will cost about a thousand to 4 ... <br><br>  At one time, I bought some on a simple PCI on Budyonovskiy (the legacy of the memorable mother from VIA - there were no PCI-Es), but they only pull the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù SATA speed ... <br><br><h5>  "Backup" Ethernet </h5><br><br>  Sometimes the network built into the motherboard "dies", so it is better to immediately provide a place on the mother and shawl to replace the network! <br><br><h5>  Fan controller aka Reobas </h5><br><br>  At your choice.  You can put it, you can - no. <br>  The place for placement in the housing for it is available ... <br><br>  I put - originally was a resistor, now - with a display and touch controls.  Plus the fact that you can significantly muffle the fan noise! <br><br>  PySy Esteta put "dropsy", but it's not so cheap ... <br><br><h5>  SATA Laces </h5><br><br>  Someone will say, ‚ÄúWhy do we need tips on laces?‚Äù And it will be not quite right ... <br><br>  The fact is that the ‚Äúangular‚Äù SATA connectors cannot be inserted into the basket - the convexity from the fan sticks there foolishly! <br>  In the motherboard - most often the "corner" will also interfere: most often they are placed in pairs, eventually interfere with each other, if the "bent" connector on the cord. <br>  So "Our choice" - "straight" laces! <br><br><h5>  Assembly </h5><br><br>  A couple of tips: <br><br><ul><li>  Case makers on pyatidyuymovki make or small corners on the edges, or "pallet" for the "convenience" of the installation.  When choosing a case, do not mess with "pallets" - they will interfere!  Corners - need to bend. </li><li>  SATA shoelaces should be tied together with 4 pieces - otherwise they will occupy a half case!  If they get into the basket fan - the baskets will strongly scream the speaker on such mockery!  At my place I split 2 wires each from 2 to the mother and a second basket + two three each - to the other connectors.  It turned out quite compact. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  And finally, the SYSTEM! </h5><br><br>  I stopped at Ubuntu - how to put in the server configuration on Habr√© written many articles! <br><br>  In particular, I can advise <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/linux/95898/">Home linux server with my own hands</a> <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  These are the pies. <br>  Rather not difficult and not expensive, you can assemble a STRONGLY multi-disk system ... <br>  If you put additional SATA controllers and another basket, then the number of disks can be brought up to 15 pieces quietly, which will give all 30 ter with two terabyte drives! <br><br>  * dreamy * But after all, three-terabyte will someday appear ... <br><br>  And may the Force be with you!  Fortunately, it will be possible to cram VERY much into such volumes of this Force! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97408/</a></p>
