  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My first ubuntu. Enthusiastic emotions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello dear habravchane.  This is my first topic on Habr√© and it is dedicated to a grand event that I fear will change my life forever.  Yesterday I looked at Linux for the first time in my life! <br><br>  <b>Brief background.</b> <br>  The main direction of my activity is design.  The design is very different, from routine graphics with its layout of books to the design of catalogs and, of course, the web.  I have been doing all this for 8 years now and, it seems, I don‚Äôt know grief.  All this time I was sitting on Windows. <br>  ‚ÄúWhy not Mac?‚Äù You ask. <br>  - So historically :) Or rather, of course, there are reasons, but my topic today is not about that. <br>  So, on my working machine, there are windows and until the adobe graphic packages start to function normally under Linux there is simply no chance of changing the OS on the main computer.  It's a pity! <br><br>  I decided to install Linux on my old dell inspiron 600m laptop, which I had only heard about before, but had never seen before.  The choice, in my opinion, is logical.  Anyway, serious graphics on such a computer cannot be done, and I can give presentations to clients, surf the Internet and watch movies from under any OS.

      So, I used the search on Habr√© (blessed is this stronghold of information) and chose ubuntu 8 for myself, being guided only by the friendly interface.  I downloaded myself a live-cd, inserted a laptop into the cd-rom and ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  ... I could not even imagine how simple, fast and smooth installation can be.  Everything fell into place, the sound worked, the screen resolution appeared to me in its maximum possible version, wireless connected without problems and I was asked to download a bunch of updates, which I did.  In short, ubuntu got up in an instant, unlike Windows, which tore my brain, demanding to download drivers, forcing languages ‚Äã‚Äãto load, and so on. <br><br>  A few moments that impressed me in Ubuntu and in an instant made me a strong Linux user. <br><br>  1. Interface.  The interface I saw for the first time in my life and I had two cigarettes and a cup of coffee to understand it.  By the way, I understood my first Windows for almost a week.  The interface is simple, convenient, logical.  Even the Samiznaetekto should envy.  It is so simple that so far I have not had any questions about what, where, how, lies and how to use it. <br><br>  2. After the installation was completed, I immediately wanted to turn on the music.  The OS told me that it could not lose mp3 and offered to download codecs itself. You know, the same WMplayer always told me that it now downloads the missing codecs, but every time it gave an error.  And ubuntu said, did, all downloaded itself. <br><br>  3. I am very poorly versed in Linux programs, so I am very afraid to make a wrong choice.  And besides, I do not know where to look.  Ubuntu has given me a huge list of various applications that it downloads and installs without problems.  There is a choice, and it is by no means small.  Conveniently, you don‚Äôt need to search through half of the Internet to find something, download it, then understand that the software doesn‚Äôt fit and start searching again.  I clicked, everything was loaded, I looked, if I liked it, if not, I deleted it with one click and you can choose the next software. <br>  Immediately I would like to ask for help in choosing programs to habravchanam. <br>  Looking for programs for easy viewing files jpeg, tiff, gif, png.  This is necessary for presentations, and if the set of formats is larger, this is only a plus. <br>  I figured out with psd and pdf like, so you do not need to offer gimp and kpdf. <br>  What do you recommend with work in flash? <br>  What program html / CSS editor is better to use? <br><br>  This is the second day I‚Äôm sitting in ubuntu and very pleased with everything.  I am really glad that I discovered the world of open source software and that this world turned out to be so simple, bright and understandable.  Once again, I‚Äôll repeat, if I say that I‚Äôll switch over to Linux finally when the main graphic editors can function normally under this OS.  Have a nice weekend </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37203/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37203/</a></p>
