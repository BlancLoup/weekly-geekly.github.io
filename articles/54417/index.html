      Another ‚Äúcapitalist grimace‚Äù happened to the developers of the <a href="http://openises.sourceforge.net/emd02.html">next FLOSS-development</a> .  But some piquant details lend particular cynicism to the whole story.  Cases when developers of commercial software do not want to lose their expensive feeders and judge the developers of FLOSS alternatives is no longer news.  Just recently, Microsoft <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/microsoft/53676/">did it</a> .  But in this case, the situation is ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù because human lives are at first, and also because it was not even the program that was banned, but a piece of paper! <br><br>  How did that happen?  Several people led by Bob Austin (Bob Austin) decided what to do for ambulance services - it would be a good idea (he worked for several years in fire departments and in ambulance services - and, I suppose, knew that chronic lack of money in these organizations - cruel reality).  In addition to cash wins, there is another side to the coin: making even small changes from commercial suppliers of such systems is incredibly difficult. <br><br>  And there was a small subproject inside this subproject: Cards 911. In essence, it contained a ‚Äúprogram for a person‚Äù: what questions should be asked to the victim and in what sequence (where did the passage happen? What exactly happened? How many people suffered? Etc .).  Answers could lead to other parts of the same document (or, perhaps, outside) where additional explanations were given.  The entire document could have been downloaded as an ODS file or PDF file. <br><br>  Of course, it turned out that the idea doesn‚Äôt have God knows what's new and, given where and when this idea was born, it could not be not patented.  So it turned out.  Priority Dispatch Corporation sent the developer a list of 10 patents (for pedants: <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DfmUXAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D5857966">5857966</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3D1gd7AAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D7106835">7106835</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DlV0NAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6607481">6607481</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DLGQDAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6106459">6106459</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DjF4EAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6078894">6078894</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DYxoEAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6076065">6076065</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3D_ZUDAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6053864">6053864</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DGeQAAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6010451">6010451</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DRAcXAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D6004266">6004266</a> , <a href="http://www.google.com/patents%3Fid%3DoaEYAAAAEBAJ%26dq%3D5989187">5989187</a> ) that this document (again: just a document!) Violated and demanded to be destroyed all physical and electronic copies of this document.  Since Bob and other developers did not have the money to defend their rights in court, this was done. <br><br>  But the story did not end there: after studying the patents described above, it turned out that it is simply impossible to create a useful document of this kind (in any case, it is impossible to make a document complying with NHTSA and ASTM standards) - at least if these patents are interpreted as interpreted by Priority Dispatch Lawyers (and if you interpret them differently, this can result in millions of dollars of legal battles).  So you want, you do not want, but the ambulance services will have to buy documents from the Priority Dispatch Corporation company (and other companies that bought the license, of course). <br><br>  The developers themselves have already come to terms with the loss and closed the project and just wanted the general public to know about this case - for they cannot fight the corporation, even if it is not the largest, they cannot do - and this is also a very characteristic feature of recent years.  However, the story has received quite a wide resonance and, perhaps, in this particular case of life, it will not be laid on the altar of ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù, but this is unlikely to change the whole system. <br><br>  These are the cases: we have already reached a situation where ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù is used to <b>prevent people from helping to save the lives of other people</b> .  But have we already reached the point of absurdity, or do we still have to go so far that the inhale and exhalation will be patented and every gesture will require license fees? <br><br>  <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20090308/0932074028.shtml">Link to the original</a> (the text above mentioned is a retelling, as there is no translator from me). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54417/</a></p>
