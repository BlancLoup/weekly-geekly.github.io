The developers recognized the problem, and began to correct it, gradually removing the changes made by AI.  It all started after the development company (Frontier) launched the update for The Engineers (2.1).  The update was supposed to improve the game AI, increasing the rationality of the NPC.  And indeed, the "mobs" have become formidable opponents.  Moreover, the update opened the way for AI to develop weapons and equipment.

      The creation of new types of weapons and equipment from the AI ‚Äã‚Äãtook quite a bit of time.  The computer opponent created, in particular, equipment for intercepting the ships of gamers flying through space and time at the speed of light.  This equipment deactivated the hyperdrive, and the player left the special mode to normal space.  And here the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwas already starting to attack with all the power it was capable of.  And its power has increased significantly, since the computer gained access to another function - crafting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fa/10d/22f/2fa10d22fc801efdc640702f67aa023f.jpg"><br><br>  All this turned out to be more than enough to put pressure on human players.  NPC fought better than many gamers, they could pull the player into ordinary space, and finish him there with updated weapons. <br><br>  And here is another interesting point: the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcreated a super-weapon, which the creators did not even suspect. <br><br>  Players-people began to meet in space NPC space ships, hung with, at first glance, ridiculous weapons.  But this weapon tore gamers' ships literally to pieces.  The situation became critical, and developers <a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php%3Ft%3D258662">had to intervene</a> : <br><br>  " <i>Hi guys,</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>We want to share with you the news about how far our investigation regarding gaming AI has progressed after the removal of new weapons of ‚Äúmobs‚Äù, as well as the planned actions.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The development team worked carefully, studying these bugs.</i>  <i>As it turned out, the unusual attacks of the new weapon resulted from a bug in the gaming environment, thanks to which the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwas able to combine different types of weapons with the simultaneous summation of the characteristics of these weapons.</i>  <i>This means that a new, never-before-seen (sometimes destructive) weapon was created, for example, a railgun with a firing rate of a pulsed laser.</i>  <i>The properties of this weapon are enhanced by the additional characteristics and capabilities of the weapons of "engineers" (We do not think that the AI ‚Äã‚Äãbecomes reasonable, like Skynet).</i>  <i>But the gallant Mark Allen of the development team decided to destroy these NPCs.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The bug fix is ‚Äã‚Äãexpected to take effect with the next release, scheduled for the end of this / beginning of next week ... I would like to clarify a few points.</i>  <i>The AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill not be cut, it will remain as strong as it was after the update.</i>  <i>The only thing we did was remove the weapons of the ‚Äúengineers‚Äù, which allowed us to study the problem and identify a bug.</i>  <i>As soon as the problem is resolved, we will be able to see how the AI ‚Äã‚Äãbehaves, and after a while, perhaps the most powerful weapon of the ‚Äúengineers‚Äù will be given to the NPC with the highest rating, we will explore this possibility.</i>  <i>But this will not be done now, because we want to make sure that the balance is optimal.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Please note that the PC update will be released first, and then an update for the Xbox One will be released.</i>  <i>We‚Äôll let you know as soon as we have more data</i> . " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c4/763/47e/8c476347e4814385ddd9342d72a0fad8.jpg"><br><br>  Now the version 2.1 weapon has already been removed from the game, which allows developers to carefully examine the bug. <br><br>  Anyway, the situation with AI in Elite Dangerous is extremely interesting.  Self-learning game AI, which is superior to human players many times, is an unusual situation.  The problem will be solved, no doubt, and we will wait for new bugs. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  With regard to the invention of weapons of AI, this may not be entirely correct statement.  So, in the comments talk about the possibility for NPS to pump their equipment to the maximum parameters.  A person needs years to do this, while the computer manages in a much shorter time.  In addition, bots have an almost unlimited resource, while people need to collect a lot of rare artifacts to enhance weapons / equipment or create new ones. <br><br>  This applies to both weapons and equipment of various types, including the one that turns off the super cruise mode for the enemy.  In computers, this equipment was pumped to the maximum parameters.  In addition, bots have unlimited ammunition, and frequent shots do not affect the heating of the ship.  Therefore, a plasma cannon in an AI can shoot as many times as desired without the threat of destroying a ship. <br><br>  Plus, the last patch somewhat upset the balance of the game, and weak players began to get strong opponents.  Naturally, the last in tatters carried gamers, people just starting to play.  Whatever it was, the developers are not going to reduce the characteristics of the NPC, only the game balance will be corrected.  Also, as mentioned above, the bots took all this super-weapon, so people will also play a little easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394895/</a></p>
