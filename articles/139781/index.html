Myths and Reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00f/9f2/c3a/00f9f2c3a809665065cd370fcbf89101.jpg" alt="SleepTracker Pro Elite Mens, Womens, Standard" title="SleepTracker Pro Elite Mens, Womens, Standard"><br><br>  Raise raised, and forgot to wake up!  This condition is familiar, perhaps, to every IT person, like many other creative people, whose working rhythm does not fit into the framework of the standard 8 hour working day. <br>  For several years, the Internet has been replete with reviews and stories about the wonderful ‚Äúsmart alarm clocks‚Äù (SleepTracker and aXbo) that can solve the problem of lack of sleep during irregular working hours.  After rereading a number of similar articles, I opted for SleepTracker Pro Elite Mens. <br>  The purpose of this topic is to share practical experience of using this model, and the educational program on the phases of sleep is described in more detail in the articles, the links to which I will cite below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Reasons for choosing SleepTracker Pro Elite Mens (1st left) </h4><br><ul><li>  Awakening from vibration, which is much more humane compared to the typical loud, sharp sounds of alarm clocks.  Alas, there is no wakeup mode in the Standard and aXbo models. </li><li>  The alarm clock adjusts exactly to your sleep phases, unlike aXbo (for two, it is cheaper to buy one aXbo than two separate SleepTracker) is actually able to track only the sleep phases of one of the spouses, while someone will not get enough sleep. </li><li>  The hand does not sweat as much as from the aXbo cuff, even in hot weather. </li><li>  It is possible to save the time history of your sleep phases (via USB) on a computer. </li><li>  SleepTracker Pro Elite Womens (center) - a completely similar model, but stylized for women. </li></ul><br>  The main differences between the Pro model and the Standard (1st right) are the presence of a wake-up vibro mode and a USB interface for exporting data.  If the phase analysis of sleep is needed by no means everyone, then the mode is vibro and really worth it.  However, at prices in the Russian Federation, the Pro version cost 6300 rubles, and the Standard 4500 rubles.  You decide whether to overpay almost 2000r.  so that the morning does not start with a headache from harsh sounds, and at the same time wake up the spouse too early. <br>  If you need a smart alarm clock for two, then aXbo for the price will be cheaper ~ 11t.r.  for two, but as I mentioned earlier, it will wake you up simultaneously, based on the sleep phases of one of you and with a signal.

      So, the main question: <b>HOW does the alarm clock determine the phases of sleep?</b> <br>  Answer: An accelerometer is built into the watch, which monitors the mobility of the hand in a dream and relates it to the sleep phase.  Those.  the movement of the hand in a dream defines an alarm clock as a phase of fast sleep.  Nothing abstruse. <br><br><h4>  Where and how not to buy SleepTracker </h4><br>  For the sake of efficiency, I was led to promises of quick delivery from Moscow of the Budilnikov.net online store and cash on delivery by the Post of Russia.  It was in vain.  Not only that the price in the Russian Federation is 6300r., To this cost you should add the commission of the Russian Post + 10% (630r) + the cost of delivery to the region ~ 300r.  As a result, the alarm clock cost me more than 7200r. <br><br>  It is much more advantageous to buy directly on <a href="http://sleeptracker.com/">the manufacturer‚Äôs website</a> for ~ $ 150 + delivery in the Russian Federation.  Pay by PayPal.  All you need is a basic knowledge of English ... well, or the ability to use an online translator.  Also, SleepTracker is sold on Amazon, eBay and other Internet shops, and can be delivered to the Russian Federation through an intermediary, such as EbayToday. <br><br><h4>  Completion (pictures that rarely come across to the Internet) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/72a/cea/d0f/72acead0f4f73daa16ffead890616af0.jpg" alt=" " title="Box Content"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b6/e40/d3c/0b6e40d3ca02532186fc3c298102c0c6.jpg" alt=" USB" title="USB cord"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/769/ed1/d4c/769ed1d4cf2e225a3b8e682c1fffbdb0.jpg" alt="   USB " title="Rear wall with USB contacts"><br>  As you probably already noticed, SleepTracker is a regular Chinese watch (Made in China), differing from all others only by the presence of an accelerometer (+ vibro and USB in the Pro version).  The inscription "water resistant to 10m" on the back wall even a little surprised.  But the brand. <br><br><h4>  ON SleepTracker (not included, downloaded from <a href="http://my.sleeptracker.com/download.cfm">offsite</a> ) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e3/712/7aa/9e37127aa988011ebb1cf77cbc4dd929.png" alt=" SleepTracker" title="SleepTracker software"><br>  I‚Äôll say right away that the software has disappointed me because it is an extremely primitive add-on over the MS Access database, okay, at least there is an unloading of the database into the CSV text format.  I wanted to see something more than a few serifs and the average length of the sleep phase.  Graphics would or say the ability to download and view the sleep data of other owners of this product for example, different professions, etc. <br>  However, the biggest disadvantage is the need to <b>daily</b> merge data from the alarm clock on the PC because the cache is on it for 1 day (1 dream), after which the sleep data in the alarm clock is overwritten with new ones. <br><br><h4>  Final conclusions </h4><br><ul><li>  A pretty good and simple way to work out your own sleep / wakefulness schedule, especially when you remember the cost of an alarm clock. </li><li>  The need every time you go to sleep wearing a watch (for the day with such a clock is unlikely to be like) and press the "magic" button on the alarm clock is a bit tiring. </li><li>  If you were overexcited the day before (work, movies, games, pleasant company, alcohol), then the alarm clock will not correctly detect the phases of your sleep and will simply work as late as possible what you have installed on it. </li><li>  The need for analysis to daily merge data on the computer - an unpleasant moment, could make the cache and more. </li><li>  Do not wait for instant results, read carefully the instructions that at least a <b>month of</b> permanent use can work out an optimal schedule for you. </li></ul><br>  So again: the <b>alarm clock works</b> , but not at all as many expect.  For it only helps to make a more or less optimal sleep schedule for you, which you will eventually get used to yourself. <br>  If your schedule changes constantly or you drink a lot of alcohol, walk, etc., then this product is not for you at least because you simply don‚Äôt remember to press the ‚ÄúI went to sleep‚Äù button on it. <br><br><h4>  Afterword </h4><br><ul><li>  For smart electronics engineers there is a huge help image product ti.com, which for a smaller amount includes a huge number of sensors in the form factor of a wristwatch. </li><li>  For software developers, the opportunity to write an easier, more convenient, cross-platform alternative client for downloading, processing and displaying data about the phases of your sleep, as well as a social component can be introduced for comparison with the results of people from the same profession, country, etc. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Useful articles for familiarization </h4><br>  <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/article/misc/sleeptracker_vs_axbo.html">SleepTracker and aXbo smart alarm trials: the best way to wake up</a> <br>  <a href="http://mydebianblog.blogspot.com/2008/08/sleeptracker.html">Sleeptracker - a wristwatch with a humane alarm clock</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.hwp.ru/Periferia/Sleeptracker/index.html">Sleeptracker - alarm clock on guard of healthy sleep</a> <br>  <a href="http://axborussia.ru/">Smart alarm Axbo (phase alarm)</a> <br><br>  <i>PS As questions and comments arrive, I will supplement the article with facts that interest you.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139781/</a></p>
