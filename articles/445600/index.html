I am a sysadmin on call, or rather, an outsourcer who advises and serves both individuals and organizations of different profiles in terms of IT infrastructure.  This is a hard, nervous, almost mad job, inside of which I saw everything: from vodka spilled on laptop to the fall of serious servers in companies that had enough money for the server, and for some reason there were no brains capable of serving it.  I think, on Habr√©, there is no need to explain for a long time what my job consists of: I once left the position of senior sysadmin in order not to look much into the hands of the employer.  So I am quite experienced gloomy admin.  Almost like memes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dbd/97d/3d7/dbd97d3d7752c0b180efc676c50602e6.png"><br><br>  <i>I give a tooth, some hosting providers look at best so.</i>  <i>In the best!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have funny and sad stories in stock, funny incidents and even stories, but today I want to start with a very painful topic - with hosting sites!  C, mother of their leg, hosting!  I admit honestly, it seems to me that I am not myself, and my criteria for choosing a service provider were grown in a scientific laboratory, sterilized and mothballed in my brain.  And all the others choose correctly: anyhow cheaper, anyhow larger, anyhow on Windows, anyhow ... I will tell you what brought me to the point that I decided to do a survey in order to understand what I am right and what is wrong.  Well, agree where to discuss it, if not on Habr√©.

      So, if you see this text, it means that they gave me an invite :) And I, with your permission, will immediately start swearing. <br><br><h2>  What are the problems? </h2><br><hr><br><h3>  Nobody cares about speed </h3><br>  Everyone, from a blogger and a dog breeder with a site to a development company, doesn‚Äôt care about the speed at which the site loads.  There were dozens of calls with the words " <i>Yes, this is my internet is slow, so it‚Äôs loaded like that, that's okay, the rest is fine, I guess</i> ."  And the reason is that this hosting provides such speed.  Meanwhile, the site loading and navigation through it evoke the memory of Dial-up modem sounds, the rating of such a site in search certainly goes down, failures grow, and all these respected freelancers, IP and LLC lose a significant number of visitors able to visit their site.  About CDN, I generally keep quiet - none of me have heard of him. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Lovers of freebies and those who hurl money </h3><br>  Next come the lovers of the two extremes: " <i>I have free hosting, I have outsmarted everyone</i> " and " <i>I have the most expensive hosting, I am cool</i> ."  Both categories are wrong with the difference that the latter at least receive normal services.  Free hosting is an evil thing, because they will certainly earn money on you: place ads on your resource, sell additional products, and this will provide the worst resource with a bunch of restrictions.  Overpaid, however, is also not necessary - why do you need VDS for a small blog about grooming or a one-page site?  Or why does the company have a lot of disk space when the virtual server will be used for a single service with a small load and with a small amount of data?  I think it is best to pay exactly for what you want to receive.  Well, I repeat: free hosting cannot be good.  Get me out. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  TP - stands for how you want </h3><br>  Technical support for hosting ... it's me.  Yes, yes, with more or less small providers, the availability and professionalism of support leaves much to be desired: they answer for a long time, often do not understand what they want from them - and this despite the fact that they are not called by a trick with a confused explanation, but by me, who formulates questions and describes problems with professional language and technical details. <br><br>  I like providers with round-the-clock telephone support, but if the site has a form for sending questions, then write-it was gone.  True, in both cases there are exceptions.  But in general - a bunch of students. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Nobody reads about the details. </h3><br>  I could now blame the hosting providers, but I will blame my clients - adult gentlemen who have their own business, but they don‚Äôt read the terms of contracts and the rules of service provision.  And all the limitations of hosting for them - surprise by surprise, including SLA.  By the way, not a single one of my corporate clients was able to articulate what type of server was leased ‚Äî hosting and hosting.  I said to them: ‚Äú <i>What if your beautiful product, which you deliver to customers according to the SaaS model, is adjacent to some Azino-from-Fryazino, and it will be blocked along with you?</i>  <i>Or will there be an attack on him from a slow, gambling young hacker?</i>  "(No, well, I, of course, speak more rudely).  And they round their eyes: ‚Äú <i>And what, it happens?</i>  <i>Here is a bl.</i>  "Well, that is, these people have syrok in Auchan for the expiration date and the composition will be checked three times, but the type of hosting is not lordly. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Insecure safety </h3><br>  Security is our never.  I look at my clients, and I wonder - as soon as they have not seven children, but 0-1-2?  After all, they absolutely do not know anything about security and the means to achieve it.  Or, again, the same: we fasten the belt, we will buy insurance, we‚Äôll run to the pharmacy, and I don‚Äôt care about business, tea, it will not become pregnant.  Well, I do not know, you can definitely fly - for big problems and money.  The fact is that not every hosting company provides decent security opportunities, and sometimes it can be honestly found out from the user agreement.  And that's not counting those who promise a lot, but do nothing and let the client down.  In general, it is strictly necessary to learn about the frequency and rules of backup, about uptime, about antiviruses, about the structure of the server, even if you are going to host your DIY website. <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Not for growth </h3><br>  Another problem is that there is no scalability and necessary functions.  I do not know what my clients think when starting a blog, website or online store.  Judging by the vague requests to ‚Äúhelp move‚Äù, they initially counted on a quick bankruptcy, but the project failed and began to develop.  Because many of them chose hosting without the necessary functions, the possibility of expanding and increasing speed, etc. <br><br>  Well, like a cherry on a cake, constantly lost passwords and accesses, the lack of responsibility in companies and complete carelessness among private traders, unwillingness to at least study something, punch, check, read reviews.  And who should I blame, then, hosting providers?  Data centers?  No, I will insist that the user is to blame (of course, if there are no cases of fraud and outright hostages from hosters - but they are there!). <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Good guys </h3><br>  Once such a booze has gone, I will not give up bad hosters - I think, according to reviews, they will tell you everything, google it please.  But for those who barely broke my nerves, I‚Äôll say: this is the <a href="https://infobox.ru/">Infobox</a> (there was a blog on Habr√©), <a href="https://vscale.io/">Vscale</a> (the <a href="https://vscale.io/">Selectc</a> blog <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/selectel/">is</a> on Habr√©), <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub">RUVDS</a> (they also <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/ruvds/">have</a> on Habr√©), oddly enough, <a href="https://www.reg.ru/">REG.RU</a> (solid Four), well, and my imported pet, which is not suitable for everyone - <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> . <br><br><hr><br><h3>  Poll </h3><br>  Reflecting on the hosting, I was born insidious idea, which can potentially make life easier for both hosting and its users.  But for its implementation, I really need statistics, and it is from a technically savvy collective mind. <br><br>  Therefore, please help me and tell me how you and your customers / supervisors choose hosting.  I did a separate survey for individuals purchasing hosting, and a separate one - for companies and their representatives.  The questions in general are the same, but the form is bigger for companies.  If you get into both cases, I will be grateful if you pass both. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/DCwRDDuBN1jHvAbI3">Survey for users</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/4WmN1JT6lrj9Zv693">Survey for companies</a> <br><br>  In short, I exhale, thank you in advance for the survey and most importantly - tell me, stupid, in the comments, how are you doing with hosting, what are you guided by, when you choose and what is it, hosting your dream? <br><br>  Peace for everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/445600/">https://habr.com/ru/post/445600/</a></p>
