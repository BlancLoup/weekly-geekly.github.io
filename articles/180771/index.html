As a result, if you do not ignore all these attempts by telecom operators to earn less on you, rest or a business trip will be much less costly.  Consider the same opportunity to save on communication during travel.  Since I am from Krasnodar, the first point is roaming in the Southern Federal District, if you have a sim card from the Krasnodar Territory. <br>  If you live in another region - scroll to roaming in Russia and the world. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Southern Federal District - Russia, Sochi, Northern Caucasus </h4><br>  The Southern Federal District is, we recall, the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Adygea, the Rostov Region, the Stavropol Territory, the Volgograd Region, the Astrakhan Region, the Republic of Kalmykia, the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania, the Republic of Ingushetia, the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic and the Republic of Dagestan .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78c/db1/31f/78cdb131fc18ddb7aaa885c74e604f46.png"><br><br>  Only <b>Megaphone</b> came out with a radical new offers, adding the <b>‚ÄúVisiting at home‚Äù service</b> , which makes all incoming calls free and outgoing, SMS and Internet - at a home rate.  True, it costs 10 rubles per day (connection is 30 rubles by the number * 105 * 4 * 1 * 1 * 10 * 3 #, disconnection * 105 * 4 * 1 * 1 * 10 * 4 #).  And also slightly expanding the <b>‚ÄúAll Caucasus‚Äù service</b> , in which all outgoing services throughout Russia become equal to 2 rubles, and incoming services become free.  It costs 1 ruble per day, and the connection is 30 rubles (send an SMS command kav + to number 000106, disconnect - an SMS with the word kav-). <br><br>  <b>MTS</b> still has the service <b>‚ÄúAlways at home</b> ‚Äù: outgoing in the South Federal District for 1.5 rubles, all incoming calls are free with a subscription fee of 3 rubles per day (connection is 30 rubles by * 111 * 3333 #) <br><br>  <b>Beeline‚Äôs ‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù service has</b> slightly deteriorated, but it is still obligatory for connection.  When you connect the service for 30 rubles and a subscription fee of 1 ruble per day, outgoing calls will cost 1 ruble (it was - at a home rate), incoming calls are free, SMS and Internet - at a home rate.  You can connect it to the number * 110 * 341 #, disconnect - * 110 * 240 #. <br><br>  <b>Tele2</b> traditionally offers favorable prices in "its" region - the Rostov region and standard prices - in all others, there are no any actions or services. <br><br><h4>  Russia is a generous soul </h4><br>  Prices for intranet roaming are shown in Table 2, minimum changes for the year and only in basic tariffs (for example, the Internet at MTS and Megaphone has become slightly more expensive): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63d/17b/559/63d17b559bb2f4e79b288d314588bb80.png"><br><br>  On the <b>MTS,</b> everything is also sure to activate the service <b>‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù</b> .  The connection costs 30 rubles and the monthly fee is 3.95 per day, but you will not pay for incoming calls, and calls to any numbers will cost 3 rubles.  True number has changed.  Connect / Disconnect - * 111 * 3333 # <br><br>  On <b>Beeline,</b> also make sure to connect <b>‚ÄúRoaming Light‚Äù</b> with the command * 110 * 9991 #.  With its help, all incoming calls in roaming will be free, outgoing calls to Beeline all over Russia are 1.95, to other phones 4.95 per minute.  Connecting it for free, and the monthly fee - 5 rubles per day.  You can absolutely not limit yourself to receive calls from colleagues, partners and relatives, and for home calls, you can use the USSD-command ‚ÄúCall me‚Äù - * 144 * phone number #, for example * 144 * 9031234567 #.  Then this subscriber will receive an SMS message with a request to call and call you back at your cheap regular rate. <br><br>  For <b>Megafon</b> for 3 rubles a day, you can use the service <b>"Mega Country"</b> , which makes all calls at once, costing 2.90.  You can connect it for 30 rubles by the number * 235 * 4 * 2 #, disconnect - * 235 * 4 * 3 #.  For 4.90 per day, you can receive all incoming calls for free with the service <b>‚ÄúEasy reception‚Äù</b> , but its connection costs already 49 rubles (* 235 * 3 * 2 #, disconnection * 235 * 3 * 3 #).  Again, you can use the service ‚Äúcall me back‚Äù by getting a free connection with relatives (* 144 * subscriber number #). <br><br>  <b>Tele2</b> rates are highly dependent on the region to which you intend to arrive, so we recommend that you look at the network coverage map before the trip.  If an operator works in the region you need, then incoming and outgoing on Tele2 will cost 1.5 rubles, the other outgoing / incoming - 5 rubles.  Internet at home rate, and SMS - 0.95.  If you are, for example, in Moscow, you will receive 9.45 rubles for outgoing and incoming and 4.5 rubles SMS.  Internet - 25 rubles per megabyte. <br><br><h4>  World Globe - rates in international roaming </h4><br>  Changes in international tariffs are more and they are much more interesting.  Everything has become more confusing, and unequivocally to say which offer is most advantageous, everything is more complicated. <br><br>  Like last year, tariffication is divided into zones.  Usually Zone 1 - CIS and Europe, Zone 2 - Africa, Asia, Australia, Zone 3 - North and South America.  However, the distribution varies greatly from operator to operator, so check which zone your country falls into on the operator‚Äôs site before you travel.  So, rates: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/741/1d2/337/7411d23379d28097109b59f042675917.png"><br><br><h5>  Tele 2 </h5><br>  Here everything is also simple and profitable. <br>  Europe - incoming and outgoing 9.45 rubles per minute, SMS - 4.50 rubles. <br>  Africa, Asia, Australia - 35 and 12 respectively. <br>  North and South America - 65 and 12 respectively. <br><br>  Moreover, Tele2 networks in Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia, as well as preferential tariffs in Kazakhstan, subject to the connection of the free service <b>‚ÄúPreferential roaming in Tele2 networks abroad‚Äù</b> (* 143 * 1 #).  Incoming and outgoing becomes equal to 5 rubles, SMS - 3.50, and the Internet - only 5 rubles per megabyte. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Tele2 Features</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Just remember that in some countries Tele2 does not have automatic roaming.  To register on the network, in the PIN code entry field, you need to dial the number ‚Äú1‚Äù and then the PIN.  That is, if PIN 9876, then you need to dial 19876 in the input field. Otherwise, you will not register on another network!  Accordingly, before you travel, be sure to check that the PIN code request feature is enabled on your phone.  If your phone does not request a PIN when you turn it on, you need to enable this feature.  Remember also that although it is possible to receive incoming calls in the event of such registration just as usual, it will not be possible to call directly!  You need to use the command * 147 * 8xxxxxxxxx # or * 147 * + 7xxxxxxxxxx #.  That is, to dial the number 8-952-123-45-67, you need to enter * 147 * 89521234567 # and press the send call button.  International roaming is activated automatically, billing in real time. </div></div><br><br><h5>  Mts </h5><br>  Slightly changed the good service <b>‚ÄúWorld without Borders‚Äù</b> , which now costs 25 rubles a day instead of 19. When you connect it when you are in Armenia, Belarus, Ukraine or Turkmenistan, your calls will be charged as follows: 10 minutes of incoming calls are free, from 11 minutes - 5 rubles (it was 5.90) ‚Äã‚Äãper minute, 1 minute outgoing to Russia - 25 rubles, from 2 minutes to 5th - 15 rubles (it was 5.90), then according to the tariff. <br><br>  If you travel in other countries, the tariffs will be the following: the first 10 minutes of incoming calls are free, from the 11th minute - 5 rubles (it was 8.90) per minute.  1 minute of outgoing calls to Russia - according to the tariff, from 2 minutes to five - 15 rubles (it was 8.90).  You can connect to the number * 111 * 4444 #, disable - * 111 * 33 * 7 #.  The service is valid only for 200 minutes of grace per month, then - 5 rubles a minute. <br><br>  You can also connect the free service <b>‚ÄúGo-go roaming‚Äù</b> to the number * 111 * 882 #, with it incoming calls will cost you only 11.90, and outgoing calls 19.90 (in ‚Äúdistant‚Äù countries - 79 rubles), though you need to call with the prefix of the type * 137 * 79181234567 #. <br>  The Internet will cost 750 rubles per megabyte in either case.  Reducing services like <b>‚ÄúBIT abroad‚Äù</b> will allow you to pamper yourself with the Internet, because with it 10 megabytes per day you will be available for 150-300 rubles per day in Europe and 2000 rubles per day in other countries (before the cost was 700 rubles) .  But of course it is better to find free wi-fi access points. <br><br>  In order for you to be available while roaming, you need to make sure that the International Access and International and National Roaming services are activated. <br><br><h5>  Beeline </h5><br>  Beeline is still happy with the service <b>"Multipass"</b> .  In Europe, the CIS and Asian countries, the outgoing call is 15, and the incoming one is 5 rubles, sms is 3.95, and the Internet is only 30 rubles per megabyte. <br><br>  A new offer - a competitor of the service ‚ÄúWorld without Borders from MTS‚Äù - <b>‚ÄúPlanet Zero‚Äù</b> .  Free and no monthly fee.  SMS in any country of the world becomes equal to 10 rubles, the first minute of an incoming call in any country is 19 rubles, from the second to the tenth are free, then again 19 rubles.  You can connect to the number * 110 * 331 #. <br><br>  Traveling in the CIS countries and Georgia, you can activate the new service <b>‚ÄúSuperVisa‚Äù</b> (free of charge, no monthly fee).  The first minute per day is 60 rubles, but from 2 to 20 minutes both outgoing and incoming are free.  Further calls for 3 rubles per minute.  You can connect to the number * 110 * 81 #. <br>  In other countries, you can use less comfortable services, for example, ‚ÄúCountry to order‚Äù - a discount on all calls and SMS at 50% of the basic price of the tariff.  Subscription fee - 15 rubles per day.  * 139 * 551 * country_code # <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúVoiced roaming‚Äù</b> - 50% discount on all incoming calls.  Subscription fee - 10 rubles per day.  * 110 * 0051 # <br>  <b>Comfortable Roaming</b> - 100 incoming minutes in any country of the world for 895 rubles.  * 110 * 995 #. <br>  But the most profitable for other countries is <b>‚ÄúSeductive roaming‚Äù</b> (connect by the number * 110 * 0171 #).  For 10 rubles a day incoming and SMS in any country of the world will cost you only 3.95 rubles! <br><br>  You can get 7 megabytes of the Internet in any country of the world for 250 rubles with the service <b>‚ÄúSea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Internet‚Äù</b> (* 110 * 0021 #), which turns out to be up to 20 times more profitable than the standard tariff. <br>  Some services can be combined with each other.  International roaming is activated automatically.  Tariffing - in real time. <br><br><h5>  Megaphone </h5><br>  In order to use roaming, it is necessary to activate the service ‚ÄúRoaming in all networks‚Äù, otherwise the phone abroad will not work. <br><br>  Continues to delight the <b>"Euro tariff"</b> .  Calls, SMS, Internet in Europe are much cheaper and without any additional services.  Outgoing calls will cost 16 rubles, and incoming and SMS - 6, the Internet - 50 rubles per megabyte. <br><br>  In other countries, you can activate the service <b>‚ÄúMy World‚Äù</b> - incoming 2 times cheaper for 10 rubles per day - * 235 * 6 * 2 #, off * 235 * 6 * 3 #, as well as ‚ÄúSMS without borders‚Äù - SMS in 2 times cheaper for 10 rubles a day - * 235 * 7 * 2 #, disable - * 235 * 7 * 3 #. <br><br>  If you are going to South Ossetia, activate the service <b>‚ÄúNeighboring countries‚Äù,</b> then the incoming ones will be free of charge, and the outgoing ones will cost 3 rubles for 1.75 in essence (send an SMS command 68 to the number 000105).  If you fly to Azerbaijan, Georgia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, connect <b>‚ÄúPreferential roaming‚Äù</b> to the number * 105 * 4 * 5 * 2 # for 100 rubles for 7 days, then your incoming calls will be 15, outgoing - 25 , SMS - at 7, and the Internet - at 70 rubles per megabyte. <br><br>  Well, for lovers of the Internet in roaming, there is still a great offer - the Internet in Europe for only 7 rubles per megabyte with <b>the Vacation Online</b> service, which can be connected to * 104 # and then choosing this option.  The option is valid for 30 days and costs only 10 rubles. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  If you are traveling in the <b>Southern Federal District</b> , the best choice is <b>‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù on Beeline</b> , followed by <b>‚ÄúEverywhere at Home‚Äù by MTS</b> and <b>‚ÄúVisiting Like Home‚Äù by Megaphone</b> .  Connect required. <br><br>  If you are traveling <b>in Russia</b> outside the Southern Federal District, be sure to connect <b>‚ÄúRoaming light‚Äù from Beeline</b> , in the second place <b>‚ÄúEverywhere is at Home‚Äù from MTS</b> .  Or, take the <b>Tele2</b> SIM card with you if you are going to the region where it is presented.  If you have a <b>Megaphone</b> connect <b>"Mega Country"</b> for outgoing calls or <b>"Easy reception"</b> , if most of it will be incoming. <br><br>  If you are going abroad, the most advantageous offer will be roaming from <b>Tele2</b> for you.  For Europe, the <b>Megafonovsky Euro-rate is</b> very beneficial, which even does not need to be connected additionally.  Further, depending on where you are going and how you use the connection, <b>Beeline's Multi-Pass</b> (Europe), <b>Planet Zero</b> (long incoming calls) or <b>Seductive roaming</b> (many SMS and incoming calls all over the world) or <b>MTS</b> will be beneficial. <b>"World without Borders"</b> (many incoming and outgoing).  If you fly far away, connect <b>"go-go roaming" from MTS</b> and also can not be afraid for the budget. <br><br>  There are all sorts of tourist <a href="http://www.sim-travel.ru/tariff/">sim cards</a> like <a href="http://www.sim-travel.ru/tariff/">Simtravel</a> and <a href="http://www.goodline.ru/ru/abonents/tarifs/">Goodline</a> , taking into account the rather profitable services of operators, they only pay off when traveling to distant countries (Zone 3 and sometimes Zone 2).  Calls start at 9 rubles per minute.  You can receive calls to your Russian number by placing a call forwarding from it to the toll-free number 8-800 (it will cost 4.5 rubles per minute). <br><br>  Although the operators' offers have become more confusing and it has become more difficult to identify any definite winner, in general, tariffs, if used correctly, have become more profitable and operators have leveled off, offering similar services to subscribers with different call profiles.  In general, there is plenty to choose from and to be able to boast afterwards that he spent on communication somewhere ‚ÄúFor Faraway Lands‚Äù ‚Äúmere pennies‚Äù (see the sidebar). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How much can you save with correctly selected roaming services?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>SFD.</b>  Trip for 3 days.  20 minutes of outgoing, 30 minutes of incoming, 10 sms, 5 megabytes of the Internet.  Total, for example, on the biline. <br>  Without additional services: 20 minutes * 9.95 + 30 minutes * 9.95 + 10 sms * 3.95 + 5 megabytes * 8 rubles = 577 rubles. <br>  With the service ‚ÄúHome Region‚Äù: 30 rubles connection + 3 rubles for 3 days + 20 minutes * 1 ruble + 30 minutes * 0 + 10 sms * 0.5 + 5 megabytes * 8 rubles = 104 rubles. <br>  <u>Saving 473 rubles, we began to spend 5.5 times less!</u> <br><br>  <b>Russia.</b>  We participate in the exhibition in Moscow during the week.  During this time, we have 100 minutes of outgoing, 200 minutes of incoming, 30 sms, 30 megabytes of the Internet.  Take the MTS. <br>  Without additional services: 100 * 8.90 + 200 * 8.90 + 30 * 3.95 + 30 * 9.90 = 3085.50 rubles <br>  With the service ‚ÄúEverywhere at home‚Äù: 30 for connection + 3 rubles * 7 days + 100 * 3 + 200 * 0 + 30 * 3.95 + 30 * 9.95 = 768 rubles. <br>  <u>Savings already 2317.5 rubles.</u>  <u>Reduced costs by 4 times!</u> <br><br>  <b>Abroad.</b>  Let's go to Cyprus for a week.  During this time we had 10 minutes of outgoing calls to Russia, 30 minutes of incoming calls, 20 sms and 1 megabyte of internet (checked the flight).  Take Beeline, they are easier to consider. <br>  Without additional services: 10 * 69 + 30 * 69 + 20 * 19 + 1 * 750 = 3890 rubles <br>  With the ‚ÄúMultipass‚Äù service: 10 * 15 + 30 * 5 + 20 * 3.95 + 1 * 29.5 = 408.5 rubles. <br>  <u>Savings 3481.5 rubles.</u>  <u>We have reduced costs by almost 10 times!</u> <br></div></div><br><br>  In general, favorable communication to you!
