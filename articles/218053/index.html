Introduction <br>  In our world, everything is interconnected, it seems to each other, it has the same or similar parameters.  Often these properties are called symmetry.  In the "Concise Oxford Dictionary", symmetry is defined as "Beauty due to the proportionality of body parts or any whole, balance, similarity, harmony, consistency."  [1] Very often, symmetry manifests itself in mathematics and physics.  In physics, the properties of symmetry are clearly manifested in quantum mechanics and its mathematical apparatus, for example, the Schrödinger equation [2].  In mathematics there is a special mathematical apparatus, operating with the concepts of similarity and symmetry.  This mathematical apparatus is called group theory [3].  One of the practical applications of symmetry in mathematics is RSA public key encryption [4]. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. Matrix of residuals of a prime number <br><br>  Consider the definition of deduction and comparison by module.  Here is the definition given in the modern explanatory dictionary.  The number “a“ is called the residue of the number “b“ modulo “m“ if the difference “a - b“ is divided by “m“ (a, b, m&gt; 0 are integers).  That is, “a“ is comparable to “b“ modulo “m“. <br><br>  a ≡ b (mod m)

      <br>
      This means that if “a“ is not completely divided by “m”, then “b“ is the remainder of dividing “a“ by “m“.  Two integers “a“ and “b“ are comparable modulo a natural number “m“ if they give identical residues when divided by “m“. <br>  Take a simple integer and denote it by “b”.  The set of integers in the interval (1,2,3, ... b-1) is denoted by “B“.  If this set is written in the form of a column, in ascending order from bottom to top, then we get the matrix column.  All numbers in this column are arranged one after another, their number is equal to “b - 1“.  Denote this column by the number “1“.  Each number from the set “B“ is squared and divided by “b“ with the remainder.  The resulting remnants of the remainder will write in the column.  Denote this column by the number “2“ and place it to the right of column number “1“.  It is necessary to arrange the remains so that they correspond to the numbers squared, and are with them in one straight line.  After that, we will raise each number from the set “B“ to the third degree and divide it by “b“ with the remainder.  From the obtained residues, we form a column with the number “3“, by analogy with column number “2“.  Further, by analogy, we raise to the next degree and find the remains of division by “b“.  We perform actions as long as the exponent in which we build numbers from the set “B“ is less than “b“.  As a result, we obtain a square matrix of size (b-1) x (b-1). <br><br>  An example of such a square matrix for a prime integer “b = 23” is shown in Fig.1. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce1/e47/7d1/ce1e477d113927612bece94a1874d71d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fig.  1 Matrix of residuals of a simple integer b = 23. <br><br>  The resulting matrix has amazing properties: <br><br>  - It is clearly seen that the last column of the matrix consists of one units.  This is fully consistent with the Farm simplicity test.  A n-1 ≡ 1 (mod N) [5]. <br>  - It should be noted that the column with the number (b-1) / 2 (“b“ minus 1 divided by 2) consists of only two values ​​of the set “B“.  These are the values ​​1 and (b-1). <br>  - The values ​​of the numbers, the sets “B“, in the columns are symmetrical about the middle of the interval, i.e.  value pairs (b-1) / 2 and (b + 1) / 2. <br>  - The types of symmetry for different columns are different. <br>  - For columns with even numbers, the values ​​are equidistant from the middle of the interval, i.e.  the pairs of values ​​(b-1) / 2 and (b + 1) / 2 are the same.  For the matrix shown in Fig.  1, the remainder of 11 squared divided by 23 and the remainder of 12 squared divided by 23 are equal and equal to 6. <br>  - For columns with odd numbers, the values ​​equidistant from the middle of the interval, i.e.  The value pairs (b-1) / 2 and (b + 1) / 2 are always equal to “b“.  For the matrix shown in Fig.  1, the remainder of 11 in the third degree, divided by 23, is 20, the remainder of 12 in the third degree, divided by 23, is 3. In total, these two residues are 23, i.e.  are equal to “b“. <br><br>  All properties described above and considered for the matrix shown in fig.  1, are inherent in matrices constructed according to the same rules for other simple integers. <br><br>  3. Matrix residual composite number <br><br>  The matrix considered in Section 2 characterizes the symmetry of primes.  For composite numbers, the matrix constructed by the same rules is significantly different.  It inherits the properties of the matrix of a prime number, but acquires new properties.  Consider a composite number that is a product of two primes “x“ and “y“.  Similarly, the value of a number is denoted by “b“, and the set of all numbers in the interval (1, b-1) is denoted by “B“.  Consider the composite number “b = 35“, which is the result of multiplying the primes “x = 5“ and “y = 7“.  We construct a matrix of residues of various degrees for the numerical interval (35-1).  The residual matrix is ​​shown in Fig.  2 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d02/ca8/021/d02ca802179064a1ef09d94f167bd0c6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fig.  2 Residual matrix of composite number b = 35. <br>  Some properties are inherited from the matrix of residues of a prime number.  For example, the values ​​of the numbers present in the columns are symmetric about the middle of the values ​​of the numerical interval, i.e.  values ​​(b-1) / 2 and (b + 1) / 2. <br><br>  The matrix shown in Fig.  2, bears in itself new properties: <br><br>  - The values ​​of the rows of the matrix, in which the first column contains multiples of divisors of a composite number, take numerical values ​​of multiples of the divisors of a composite number and are never equal to 1. For example, in the matrix of Fig.  2, row 5, in the second column, has the value 25, in the third 20, in the fourth 30 and so on.  All these values ​​are multiples of 5. <br>  - If we exclude rows whose values ​​are multiples of the divisors of the number “b“, then there will necessarily be two columns in which the remaining values ​​are 1. For example, in fig.  2 are columns with numbers 12, 24. <br>  - Of these two selected columns, the largest column number is the product (x-1) by (y-1).  Those.  if from each of the factors, subtract 1 and multiply them, then we get the number of the largest selected column.  For the matrix in fig.  2 factors of the number “b“ are 5 and 7. If we subtract 1 from each of them and multiply, we get (5-1) x (7-1) = 24. This is exactly the number of the largest selected column.  It should be noted that in this case, the column number is equal to the Euler function, whose value is (x-1) x (y-1) = (n).  [6]. <br>  - The second column must contain four values ​​equal to 1. For the matrix of residues of a prime number and the values ​​of the set “B” equal to (1, b-1), the values ​​in the second column take the value 1. For the matrix of residues of a composite number, there are two more numbers the sets “B“, in the case of which they are squared and divided by “b“, the remainder is 1. In Fig.  2 are numbers 6 and 29. <br>  - There are always pairs of numbers, sets “B“, following each other, the values ​​of which are multiples of the divisors “x” and “y” of the number “b”.  For the matrix in fig.  2 are pairs (14, 15) and (20, 21). <br><br>  All properties described above and considered for the matrix shown in fig.  2, are inherent in matrices constructed according to the same rules for other composite integers. <br><br>  4. Factoring numbers <br><br>  If we consider the RSA public key encryption method [4], then its use is based on the existence of mutually opposite mappings in the matrix of residuals of a composite number.  If we take the composite number “b“, there are always two columns “c“ and “d“ in its residue matrix, for which the following conditions are true: <br><br>  (b1 ** c) ≡ c1 (mod b);  (c1 ** d) ≡ d1 (mod b);  b1 = d1 <br><br>  where b1, c1, d1 are numeric values ​​in columns 1, c, d. <br><br>  That is, for the composite number “b“ there always exist two numbers “c“, “d“ from the range (1, b-1) for which the sequence of actions is valid: <br>  - We define the remainder of any number “b1“ from the range (1, b-1) raised to the power of “c“ and divided by “b“.  We denote this remainder by “c1“. <br>  - The resulting residue “c1“ will be raised to the power of “d“ and divided into “b“ with the remainder.  We denote this remainder by “d1“. <br>  - The resulting residue “d1“ is always equal to “b1“. <br>  For the RSA encryption algorithm, (c, b) is the public key, (d, b) is the secret key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8d/dd3/821/a8ddd38217b3aac59d5390f0b72dc835.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Fig.  3 Residual matrix of the composite number b = 33. <br><br>  Consider the matrix of residuals of the number b = 33, fig.  3. For this number c = 3, d = 7.  Take any number from the first column, for example, 8 and raise it to the 3rd power, the remainder is 17. We raise 17 to the power 7, the remainder is 8, i.e.  this remainder is equal to the original number from the first column. <br>  RSA is one of the common public key encryption algorithms.  Together with the improvement of encryption methods, methods for decrypting secret messages are being improved. <br>  Often, the decryption task for RSA is attempted in the forehead, i.e.  find the divisors of the base composite number.  These methods are called factorization of numbers.  In addition to a simple enumeration of values ​​and verification of numbers, use the quadratic sieve method. <br><br>  The basis of this method is that part of the residuals from squaring and dividing by the number “b“ are full squares of numbers.  In fig.  2 full squares are the quadratic residues of the numbers (11, 12, 17), from the first column.  To find the divisors of the number “b“, it is necessary to extract the square root from the quadratic remainder.  The result, i.e.  square root, subtract from the number “b“ or add to the number “b“.  Multiple divisors of the number “b” will be obtained.  Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can find the divisors of the number “b“. <br>  In fig.  2, for the number 11, the quadratic remainder is 16. We extract the square root of 16, it is 4. We add 4 to 11, we get 15, a multiple of the divisor 5. We take 4 from 11, we get 7, the number is equal to 7. <br><br>  One of the most modern methods of factoring numbers is the sieve method of a number field [7].  This method allows reducing the number of values ​​to be checked and reducing the time for performing calculations.  The use of the sieve method of the numerical field and the properties of the matrix of residuals of the composite number makes it possible to achieve even more powerful results. <br><br>  For experimental verification of the methods of factorization of numbers, you can use the so-called Mersenne numbers [8].  These numbers are the number 2 to the power of “n“, minus 1, where the “n“ is a natural number.  Only a limited number of Mersenne numbers are simple; the rest are decomposed into a finite number of divisors. <br>  As an illustrative example, one of the divisors, the number 2 to the power of 4099, minus 1, is equal to - <br>  431654595928296534254101974033397155588925169723783332084380283993261 <br>  209600632883153055473166663136594966053411838575253500155337120152873 <br>  781979635198920643526624304319945635699208877607737201529464080041890 <br>  547345467573782661041054825447947267620282789541695832747170633177331 <br>  920343746996221855049648583763367504662477325712779883313257418325242 <br>  923223374882540094860518718525171060169694349915604794431233943848839 <br>  032331927197514745282594881581533286782002526616104836932259305133211 <br>  436643050243706215479754994805351437606942854754835739144357537526269 <br>  041212016993538655106720507482318994547865735219931202814880677303379 <br>  021540170667630675512896640229254326407201860556265718380698467494757 <br>  374722667518146123812589844575734597771351069823560862537030159862538 <br>  798769879690913001816439118925869829536250846639469310212937581855933 <br>  518710668619729641309263324784218037304674615635505157625365285797298 <br>  443305108038716358762651248086440048468372406494047491988831492829285 <br>  161751678332086837187972136968851829414833128243888620308340321378185 <br>  123642015152620056914762030047166652837911735649104226834442937368573 <br>  819974224203735488718107356908123314371578553175076071717775764345142 <br>  549580867720367836084289513946899287311856029114297 <br><br>  4.
