  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Legend of the Black Point</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© often point to grammatical errors.  Right at all, in the comments.  And even if the error is corrected, the comment is still an eternal monument to the author‚Äôs mistake.  In a conversation with an illiterate interlocutor, the best tactic is to ignore mistakes, not focus attention on them.  But at the same time, to pronounce correctly.  You are told the document, you are in response to the document.  If this is not a clinical case, it will be corrected.  When correspondence is harder to notice your already ingrained joint.  Therefore, I urge you not to ignore errors in the articles, but to communicate your comments to the author on habraposhta, and not in the comments. <br><br>  Grammar is a problem not only Habrahabr, but the entire Internet.  Yes, what is there!  Even in the days of FIDO, the problem was relevant.  Thus was born the legend about the Black Point.  This is an old story.  I hope someone else remembers her besides me. <br><br>  Ahead of the night - it's time to dive into the times of joyfully blinking lights of dial-up modems, all-powerful sysops (system operator), steering their nodal stations, simple point guys and beautiful point girls, smart echo conferences and funny meetings on sysops and pointe.

Here I am also not vizhy.  But he is.  (k / f "DMB").  This story happened long ago, many years ago.  The modems were then big, the CPSs were small, the words ‚Äúcaschenism‚Äù were not even yet appreciated, and the expression ‚ÄúIP-point‚Äù was perceived by many as a kind of sophisticated pygatelstvo.  Once upon a time, there was someone named Gamotny Point, who was very famous in the network of the node.  The grammar is not in the sense that he did not get paid in ehah (with whom he doesn‚Äôt happen), or there he always took his post during the time.  No, not a poet.  Although, in order to, for example, set up his station in a crowded manner, he could do the job quite well without his boss.  But that's not the point.  He was grammatical in the sense that he always wrote without grammatical and punctuation errors, and even stylistically all his letters were ideal ‚Äî not one corrector would be preferred.  And there was one weakness of him, however - he didn‚Äôt like it when someone made his orthographic errors in the texts of his letters.  And every time, if the interlocutor was certainly clever and readable, the Gramot Point tried to fix it - sort of like the average literacy of the fidoshnikov raised, he dealt with godly business.  Yes, and this is important, all his comments did not have the character of raids and other bullying at all.  All of this had the character of ordinary friends.  Now Hy will meet the Gramot Point and the word ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù, and he says - only those who come from Vienna arrived in the same type in more detail.  Or would you see the word "Intiligentsia" - with a say - say, that intellectuals didn‚Äôt create the Intel corporation?  So write through the "e" then it is necessary.  Hy remembered the easy-to-follow people associations, started writing words correctly, and didn‚Äôt even get angry at the Point Manager at all.  Hy, and did not want to correct grammatical errors from those who tried to correct grammatical errors, Gramot Point simply didn‚Äôt talk.  And it was still in the same LAN, from there was a family Gramot Point, a girl named Perfect Point.  I saw it somehow Gramotny Point on the next point, and fell in love with first glance.  And then she began to send letters to the network.  And the girl was a philologist by education, and those guys who write literally dare, I respected it very much.  Therefore, reciprocated.  It is true only in the network yet.  And Gramotny Point vskore y knew that she is not zamyzhem.  Yes, and he was never married.  And he already began to build his rosy plans for the imminent rapprochement with Great Point.  But here in Lokalka appeared Advanced Hacker.  Before that, he accidentally wandered into Viet Nam on the rifle of that very node, he saw the Beautiful Pointessy, and his heart, too, was kindled by a great passion.  And he even asked her girls for her fidosh address.  And he began later in LAN with her rewriting.  But the girl treated the hackers very coolly, pust even to the promoted, so he did not achieve anything in the end, and the soul of the repudiated darkened.  Not only that - no, he was not the Promoted Hacker, an excellent pupil in Russian.  And Tym still Gramotny Point vdpyg on the basis of his grammatical errors shovel any otpyskat.  And when yznal Ppodvinyty Hakep that this same ppekpasno Pointessa even with these tricks kpytit Gpamotnym points, and that the same Point more and avtopitetom all ehah because of its gpamotnosti polzyetsya, pochepnela anger dysha Ppodvinytogo Hakepa.  And then he became Black Hacker.  For a long time Black Hacker thought how to avenge the cunning seducer of her passion.  And he drank beer, and found an insight on him.  And he turned on the computer, and, having written down the e-mail of that same Gramotny Point, he then climbed into Tyrbo Debagger, and began with a speed of the woodpecker to hammer on the keyboard, realizing his trespassing evil plans ... ... Somehow you put a month , on the next day after the black Friday of the 13th, downloaded the Gamotny Point post y of his boss.  And ydivilsya.  I received this most Gramoton Point, crawling over the letters that had fallen in the banknote, causing several advantages in various echoes, and all the advantages - solely for the crying beamlessness and for covering the Pypsky language.  And he was surprised - after all, he hadn‚Äôt made a single grammatical mistake before ‚Äî not even a typo.  All the same, before sending it two times I looked at it.  Darkened by the insult Dysha Gamotnogo Point.  Pogpytil he wrote a few letters in your favorite ekhi - and even went to bed.  And on the second day, they were even shorter - even those subscribers, whose mistakes the Gramot Point had once joked about, had already begun to steal over it themselves.  Yes, all with the letters of the letters are sent, so as they say, he did not deny the author of his messages.  And his boss, the next portion of advantages for his point, is already hinting in LAN - they say, or restore your spellchecker, or clean out of the configs.  But there was no SpellChecker point, it was never like that.  ‚ÄúAnd how could I write such impassable letters,‚Äù the Human Point Point asked himself ... And, without waiting for an answer, he got drunk that day from the fire.  And he turned black in the Point Point, and he became that day Black Point.  Many, many letters he wrote while drunk at various ekhi, and no, not good, as before - his letters were very, very evil.  Of course, it was all about that, by optidly harassing the file, allegedly sent by the Beautiful Point, he actually got to the computer of the Terrible Trojan, made in a rush of malice and envy by Black Hacker.  And on Great Black Friday, this same Trojan, resident in a computer, began to do his own thing, turning the ideal and unmistakable texts of outgoing letters into full frameless.  And no, Black Hacker did not sleep at that time.  He sent the samples of the Black Sysop's work to various conferences, accompanying them with evil commentaries - they say as soon as he stopped working with the Spellchecker of the Point Manager, he showed his true senselessness.  And they say now it is not for the person to be there any mistakes of others to comment, increasing their own authority.  And they believed the sysops of Black Hackery, and the malicious letters to the address of the Black Sysop were sent scoffing at grammatical errors.  And he received many such letters on the third day, a lot.  And the most terrible reason was the response of the very Beautiful Point that the philologist on education was however.  She wrote in a letter - they say look for yourself podgygy best of the flyers.  And still bezgamotnym cattle was called at last.  And she said that it would be better for Black Hacker to get away from such a disagreement in people than for him.  I didn‚Äôt keep Black Point like that, drank a glass for the sake of, and took the same day as a small fiddler - hanged himself on a modem cord.  ... However, further, as the legend says, since the very modem cable on which the Black Point hanged itself and remained connected to the Network of Friends, its soul was in an invisible electronic state.  For a long time he wandered around among various echoconferences - backbone ones and not so much - and every time he saw that someone told someone a grammar error, he was angry about the darkness of the Black Point, and he did sopses then dirty things.  And then the sysops understood that the type of dypnaya is - to indicate the interlocutor to grammatical errors, then the normal connection will not be bydetated.  And it became a dubbing tone from those times in FIDO to show errors, and many moderators even brought this point to their rules.  And by that time the wedding between International Pointess and Black Hacker was approaching.  And a lot of chores saw the black points of Black Point on this occasion in LAN.  And there was a wedding, and there were many guests, and there was a lot of booze.  And at the very beginning of the holiday, the guests of the group found out that the bridegroom had disappeared.  Have you been looking for the groom for a long time - they soon found out.  They found him sitting on a chair in front of his computer, with his face turned over from death.  The black hacker was twitching in the terrain vehicles.  On the monitor were displayed pictorial pictures, which Black Hacker decided to last, before the wedding, just download from the site he hacked.  I downloaded it, but I did not enjoy it.  To the guests, with a misunderstanding, reviewing the contents of the monitor, it began to become dypno.  And not at all from naked girls of course.  No, it was of course quite a friend.  ... With a hidden 25th frame on the monitor, I painted my ominous converging circles of a deadly dangerous virus, which the journalists later labeled as "Virus 666".  ... Black Hacker's father, suspecting something was wrong, took the first thing that came under pyky - and this was a cheap Chinese scanner - and broke the windshield of the wicked monitor.  But it was already late.  Black Hacker took a mental trick.  Black Point was avenged.  ... A lot, a lot of water from that time.  But as the legend says, up to these days, at night, among the equilibrium drivers and modems, cable phones, twisted pairs and coaxial local area networks, the hovering Black Point walks.  And if he, God forbid, sees that some kind of scum shows someone else to grammatical errors ‚Äî or even to innocent typing errors ‚Äî but this is a link to fucking matter.
