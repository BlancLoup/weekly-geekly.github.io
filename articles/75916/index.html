Whether everything is drunk, or spent on the case, or zanykano - go, count. <br>  Once he faced a similar problem.  With a salary of 30 thousand rubles.  (and for our city it is not at all bad money) the difference from 7 thousand rubles.  was not noticed at all.  It seems like I wanted a car, I wanted HTC to be trendy, but here everything is the same food and food, beer, beer, and beer. <br><br>  Well, moving away from the lyrical part.  Once, with a <s>beer, the</s> fool decided to try to control all of his finances using bookkeeping.  At that time, the only software I knew (rather by hearsay) was 1C 8 Accounting.  Found, set, opened, scared, closed.  Man, I am not at all referring to accounting, so it was decided not to bother with 1C, but to look towards other people-oriented products, accounting that is not educated, if any (products) exist.  And what would you think?  Exist! <br><br>  Below I will try to arrange a brief overview of products that are focused on accounting in the home. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Moneytracker </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.dominsoft.ru/">MoneyTracker</a> is a simple and convenient program for managing home bookkeeping.  The first thing that caught the eye was a <a href="http://www.dominsoft.ru/pictures.php">nice interface</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35b/e15/bf1/35be15bf12ba58933eb33e780dcfebda.gif" alt="image"><br>  All main modules are rendered with large buttons in the top menu.  The main modules include: Articles (a list of the nomenclature of something), Accounts, Consolidated list of incomes / expenses, Revenues, Expenses, Transfers, Calendar (something like a planner), Budgets, and Reports (in tabular or graphical representation).  In general, we can say that the large buttons of the top menu contain all the basic.  The remaining parts of the program are various directories of currencies, places of possible spending of money, products, family members, various dynamics, etc. <br>  What you liked: <br><ol><li>  The interface is nice, usable. </li><li>  The nomenclature reference book is already filled with frequently encountered goods and services. </li><li>  I figured out the maximum in an hour in software, all the buttons are at hand, help is not something that is ah, but informative.  Reports are also completely suitable for my purposes. </li><li>  In the calendar there is the possibility of both one-time and daily / monthly planning. </li></ol><br>  What did not like: perhaps only the calendar.  I would like to see more flexible planning.  For example, I want to buy something immediately, as soon as there is money on it + after the purchase, 2,000 rubles will remain in my pocket. <br>  <b>License cost:</b> 400 rub. <br><br><h4>  Keepsoft </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.keepsoft.ru/">KeepSoft</a> interface was not as beautiful as MoneyTracker, but the features ... <br><img src="http://www.keepsoft.ru/hb4screens/m_incomes.gif" alt="image"><br>  There is everything listed above (but here's the reference book of the nomenclature is empty and the planning is not in the form of a calendar, but in the table).  But go for it - sync with the PDA!  I did not see the version for the PDA due to the lack of it, but the problem with lost checks abruptly disappears.  I myself use MoneyTracker, and there is a constant problem of ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù to record at home what I spent in the store.  It's all easier - spent, recorded in the PDA, came home, synchronized. <br>  Other benefits: built-in backup, data import / export / synchronization, a single general search. <br>  <b>Private license:</b> 400 rub. <br>  <b>Family license:</b> 650 rub. <br><br><h4>  Family 2009 </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.sanuel.com/">Family 2009</a> is just something. <br><img src="http://www.sanuel.com/ru/newpics/main/family.jpg" alt="image"><br>  First of all, the interface catches the eye.  Nice gradients, beautiful controls, everything meets the rules of style.  Just worth a look. <br>  By opportunities other than the above: <br><ol><li>  Excellent calendar planning budgets, loans, investments, deposits </li><li>  accounting of mutual funds, metals, stocks, quotes, etc. </li><li>  comfortable, beautiful and clear reports (with the ability to create your own) </li></ol><br><br>  The program is more than just home accounting, but the main focus is on that. <br>  <b>Family 2009 Pro license:</b> $ 19.95, approximately 570 rubles. <br>  <b>Family 2009 license (reduced version):</b> $ 14.95, approximately 430 rubles. <br><br><h4>  DAFFTIN Simple Family Budget </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.dafftin.com/descr_sfbudget.php">DAFFTIN Simple Family Budget is</a> very similar to MoneyTracker, so I won‚Äôt go deep into it. <br><img src="http://www.dafftin.com/images/sfbudget_mw_small333.jpg" alt="image"><br>  I didn‚Äôt like navigation (menu buttons, for example, without labels), didn‚Äôt like the interface. <br>  <b>License cost:</b> 200 rub. <br><br><h4>  Drebedengi </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.drebedengi.ru/">Drebedengi</a> is a development by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/alexan/" class="user_link">alexan</a> , which is an online + offline home accounting service. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/315/342/a92/315342a92df8edc7f7cb7cf52075f178.gif" alt="image"><br>  I never used it myself, but decided to include it in the review after the comment left.  More detailed description <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/52393/">here</a> .  I really liked the idea.  As I understand it, you can keep accounts both online on the web portal, and locally, periodically or when you need to synchronize the whole thing.  In the course of searching for software, I saw exactly online portals, which are accounting (that is, without the possibility of local work with subsequent synchronization), and therefore did not include them in the review.  A surface review showed the following: all standard functionality + online version + PDA version + the ability to make expenses via SMS.  The project seems very, very interesting. <br>  I will definitely register in Drebedengi and see everything with my own eyes. <br><br>  Somehow like this.  This is not all the software on the market, but IMHO is the one that you should pay attention to from the price / quality ratio. <br><br>  After: <a href="http://www.wosoft.ru/load/112-1-10">here</a> you can see a more complete list of software. <br><br>  PS Please do not judge strictly, this is my first feature article, and the first pancake, as you know ... <br>  PPS Since all the software is practically impossible to know, please unsubscribe in the comments on interesting thematic software, not listed in the review. <br>  PPPS I, as mentioned above, use MoneyTracker.  As for general reasons, she gave me more than anything else.  Practicing like this is complete detailing of incomes and expenses, and a subsequent analysis of bottlenecks (‚Äúdon't drink so much beer, otherwise you won't have a fancy HTC‚Äù).  Plus it is convenient to look for stores with cheaper prices (sometimes it is caught up to 50% cheap). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75916/</a></p>
