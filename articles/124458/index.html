  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Analysis of the SBR (freelance) in the framework of the CEDC</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Enough general management theory there is a remarkable law, which is called the ‚Äú <b>Law of Normal Distribution</b> ‚Äù, its essence is as follows: if you test many identical objects for any one property, the result will be as follows: <br><ul><li>  from 1% to 3% of objects will show excellent results; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% good results; </li><li>  80% to 90% average, normal results; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% poor results; </li><li>  from 1% to 3% are very bad, the worst results. </li></ul><br>  It should be noted that this law acts in all natural phenomena, and also applies to society as a whole, social groups within it, and to each individual individually. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since we consider the activities of distant work exchanges, we will immediately give an example of the justice of this law in the following way, choose the general statistics of remote workers (freelancers) by rating (taken from free-lance.ru) and get the following results: <br><ul><li>  from 1% to 3% very high rating (TOP) above 7000 points; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% high rating of 5000 - 7000 points; </li><li>  from 80% to 90% average rating of 500 - 5000 points; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% low rating is less than 500 points; </li><li>  from 1% to 3% very low rating to 100 points. </li></ul><br>  It is necessary to make a note here, accounts of remote workers of performers participate in the diagram below, employers' accounts are not considered at this stage. <br><br><img src="http://img13.imageshost.ru/img/2011/07/19/image_4e2592cecaaf6.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The qualities include the professional activities of the remote worker.  According to the <b>law of normal distribution</b> , as well as the results obtained in the analysis of freelancers, we obtain: <br><ul><li>  10% - 20% highly specialized freelancers; </li><li>  80% - 90% of masters of high and medium level; </li><li>  10% - 20% of newbies. </li></ul><br>  So, we have come to the most important thing for which everything was written - SBR ( <i>‚ÄúA transaction without risk‚Äù will reduce the risk of unsuccessful cooperation for both the employer and the freelancer to a minimum. The service interface is convenient, intuitive and has a wide range of options for making and approval of changes, file transfer and correspondence between the employer and the free-lancer.</i> ), the description is taken from the site free-lance.ru.  As you can see the wording is very vague, in fact, the RRF means that the freelance administration completely takes control of the financial flows and business correspondence between the employer and the contractor, and in the event of a conflict, decides <b>at its discretion the</b> issue to one side or the other, the RRF paid service.

      What is wrong here !?  "Behold the root" - Kozma bars. <br><br>  Based on the above model and the law of normal distribution, we will create a model of 40,000 SBR approximately the total number of transactions per month on the site free-lance.ru: <br><ul><li>  from 1% to 3% of transactions will be flawless; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% of transactions will take place almost as flawlessly (it may be necessary to additionally discuss some details); </li><li>  from 80 to 90% of transactions will take place in a normal operating mode: negotiations, perhaps personal meetings, approval of the TK, adjustment of the TK, minor revision of the project after launch for some specializations, etc.  In general, will pass <b>on the full function of self-government</b> ; </li><li>  from 3% to 7% of transactions will be with conflict between the parties, but can also be self-regulated and completed; </li><li>  from 1% to 3% of transactions will fail. </li></ul><br>  Yes, indeed, the SBR service is in its essence a good thing, if you are a <b>new player</b> on the remote work exchange, 1‚Äì3% is very unlikely that your project will burn out, out of 40,000 projects per month (400‚Äì1200) will be unsuccessful, but if you don‚Äôt want You can risk it <b>at your discretion</b> , but unfortunately the tendency on freelancing resources is now such that <b>such a service</b> is mandatory, this compulsory measure is manifested indirectly, in additional benefits for those who have concluded it, such as increasing the rating  a, raising positions in the directory of freelancers and employers, the priority of considering appeals to the administration of the resource, etc.  What this will lead to is already clear; those who refuse to conclude the FRA will be outsiders, always with a low rating, in the very tail of the freelancers catalog. <br><br>  What conclusion can be made from all this?  The advantages of SBS are obvious; <b>they simply do not exist</b> .  From scratch as well as on various rumors (fueled by stakeholders), the owners of such resources create an imaginary need for such a service and often directly and roughly imposing it, not to mention the fact that this is a paid service, and money is spent from the pockets of freelancers and employers not justified at all. <br><br>  This analytical note is addressed to all freelancers, but to a large extent, and employers, turn, partly on your fears and not confidence, and create an unnecessary service like this from scratch, and as shown above by the law of normal distribution, <b>from 80% to 90% of transactions will be successful no matter what.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124458/</a></p>
