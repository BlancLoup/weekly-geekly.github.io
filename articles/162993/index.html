  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Instagram changes the content of the user agreement. What does this mean for you?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Instagram this Monday released an updated version of the <a href="http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/">user agreement</a> , in which they included long clauses on how user-uploaded photos can be used by Instagram and its parent company Facebook. <br><br>  The changes will take effect on January 16, 2013, and will not affect images uploaded before this date. <br><br>  Both Facebook and Instagram hinted at plans to include ads on Instagram, although they refused to provide details of how and when this will happen.  Under the new agreement can be judged on what they have in mind.  Let's go over it and estimate what key changes can mean for users. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3b/c09/4f3/b3bc094f3a7d72d7592119a745d47baf.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Instagram can provide information about its users to its parent company, Facebook, as well as related companies and its advertisers.</b> <br>  Instagram reports that the changes were made to the agreement in order to help it "easier to function as one of the parts of Facebook, by providing an opportunity to exchange information between both companies."  This potentially profitable step will allow advertisers to use data and information that the user leaves on Instagram, such as favorite places, bands, restaurants or hobbies, in order to more accurately target advertising for a particular person. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
      <b>2. You can become part of the advertisement without your knowledge.</b> <br>  The new agreement section, entitled ‚ÄúRights,‚Äù states that Instagram will also be able to use your photos and your identity inside advertising.  ‚ÄúYou agree that another company may pay us to show your username, affinity, photographs (including any metadata associated with them), and / or actions that you perform, along with paid or sponsored content, without any compensation for you, ‚Äùsays the new rules.  This means that all photos uploaded to Instagram may appear in advertisements within the service itself, or within Facebook.  In addition, any person who does not use Instagram can also appear in advertising if his friend has posted a photo of him.  Facebook is already running ads based on the activity of people on their website. <br><br>  Mark Rottenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, an attorney group from Washington, said that using the image of a particular person in advertising may be contrary to some laws that protect privacy. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost states have laws that restrict the use of a person‚Äôs name or likeness for commercial purposes without consent,‚Äù says Rottenberg.  ‚ÄúIt would be legal to allow a person to commercially benefit from their images and preferences, which is a big problem for both stars and others, as well as cause for concern for Facebook users, whose images are already used by them to incite their friends to buy goods services. " <br><br>  <b>3. Minor users are no exception.</b> <br>  Although it is necessary to be over 13 years old for registering on Instagram, it‚Äôs said that if a teenager is registered, he confirms that his parent or guardian has agreed to use his image, username and photos in advertising. <br><br>  <b>4. Advertising may not be called such.</b> <br>  In another part of the agreement, you are told that advertising will not necessarily be marked with advertising.  "You realize that we are not obligated to identify paid services and sponsored content as such." <br><br>  <b>5. Want to dodge?</b>  <b>Delete account.</b> <br>  The only way to avoid new conditions is to stop using the service.  If you log in to Instagram in any way, including the website, mobile application or any other service offered by the company, you will automatically give your agreement so that your data and your content will be used in advertising.  The agreement says: "Using the site, service or any application (including mobile) created by Instagram (collectively referred to as the Service), in any way, you sign up to this agreement." <br><br>  Instagram reported these changes on its blog, noting that ‚Äúnothing has changed about the ownership rights of your photos and who can see them.‚Äù  In this post, the company says that the changes are mostly intended to help in the fight against spam, which filled the social network with the growth of its popularity. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe new agreement helps protect you and prevent spam as we grow,‚Äù the company writes. <br><br>  <i>Here <a href="http://raganwald.posterous.com/translation-from-legalese-and-pr-speak-to-eng">are a</a> couple of <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/280827247764582401">views</a> on the situation.</i>  <i>I, like a malicious hipster, already reeling fishing rods.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The head of the company <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/163121/">tried to apologize</a> in the official blog, citing the complexity of the unequivocal interpretation of legal documents for ordinary people.</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/162993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/162993/</a></p>
