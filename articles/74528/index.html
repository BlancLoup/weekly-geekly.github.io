      On <b>August 27,</b> 2009, the parcel arrived at the KRASNODAR MSC TSOSP and I, in the hope that I will wait another two or three days while there 100% have already sent all notifications and other hemorrhoids have settled down, will please the recipient. <br><br>  <b>08/30/2009</b> Delighted the recipient and said that it‚Äôs time to get a notification already :) <br><br>  <b>09/02/2009 The</b> recipient replies that he did not receive any notice, that he went to the post office and was sent from there ‚Äúdelicately‚Äù hinting (oh, how they like to make jokes) to wait for the notice. <br><br>  and so 2 more times ... (I repeat that the recipient was at the post office without notice, in the hope of receiving his parcel). <br><br>  In general, there is a very long <s>cycle of the</s> circus, so I will go straight to the next date: <br><br>  <b>September 24, 2009 in the</b> evening, having gathered anger, I begin to write a letter: <br><blockquote>  Subject: Payment Investigation 63405092314087 <br>  Good evening. <br>  I sent a parcel on August 21 to the city of Sochi, if you believe the tracking of mailings on your site, it is stuck somewhere in Krasnodar, in the sorting center.  Please understand this situation. <br>  The parcel was cash on delivery and the declared value of 3045 rubles, a check is on hand. <br>  Sincerely, Kapatsky Alexander, <br></blockquote><br>  The next day they send me the answer: <br><blockquote>  Subject: Search for a payment 63405092314087 - 901271 <br>  Dear Alexander! <br>  For further search of the postal item, it is necessary to submit an application for the search for RPO in any post office (in writing).  The application is accepted from the user within 6 months from the date of dispatch of the RPO on the basis of an identity document, a sender or an addressee (as well as their representatives).  The application must be accompanied by a receipt (or its clear photocopy), issued upon receipt of the postal item. <br>  If you have questions, please contact the Tomsk Oblast Federal Postal Service Administration: 8 (3822) 51-55-09 kachestvo@ufps.tomsk.su;  kgs@ufps.tomsk.su <br>  Upon further appeal on this issue, please refer to reference number 901271 <br>  Sincerely, Telecontact on behalf of Russian Post <br></blockquote><br><br>  I was more or less happy about this and was going to go to the post office on Monday. <br><br>  <b>09/28/2009 I</b> wrote the application as expected, attached a copy of the receipt (do not throw out these papers never!) I took it (by the way, they don‚Äôt even give anything in return) and waited ... <br><br>  As time went on - from October came up from behind the corner and it rained ... hm, so what am I talking about :) <br>  So look again tracking and oh!  miracle!  )) <br><br>  <b>10/01/2009</b> My package was found and goes to me back to Tomsk (it is asked: why the hell do I need it here?) I start to look for the phones of this post office, to call to the support of the ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù, where they gave me the phone number for which no one for 2 days didn't pick up <br><br>  <b>10/08/2009 A</b> friendly aunt calls and says: In general, we conducted an internal investigation here and decided that our fault was not here (here I took a breath in the chest, when suddenly I understand what she means by ‚Äúour‚Äù - there is no Tomsk fault).  Well, I agree with this and without an inquiry, as it were :) (but thanks anyway, Krasnoperova GS <br><br>  Further from the stories, I realized that the postman allegedly wore notifications almost every day (there were as many as 3 times, and since there was no one at home, he put them in the mailbox of a private house), the head of the department didn‚Äôt sleep, thought about deliver my package to the addressee, but eventually changed his mind and sent it to me (sarcasm about the boss). <br>  Here I was struck by the following: the last record about the location of the parcel was 08/27/2009 in the department 350964 and then the return comes from 354054 ... Wait!  And where is the record that the parcel was delivered to this wolf's lair 354054 ??? <br><br>  I received an answer to the last question that this branch would have been there if the delivery of the parcel to the recipient had taken place.  - but is it not stupid ?? <br><br>  <b>That is, in fact, I don‚Äôt know where my package is: in the district center or directly at the post office of the recipient.</b>  (why then do you need tracking at all? Well, the last step could be completed) <br><br>  Going further ... <br><br>  <b>10/20/2009</b> I receive my parcel at my post office and pay for it the amount of 237.10 rubles (I paid the same amount for sending), I was also asked: Do you not refuse it?  Will receive?  (I wonder what would happen if you refuse?) <br><br>  <b>10/20/2009</b> On the same day I sit down at the soap and scribbling a new letter, in which I inform the following: <br><blockquote>  Subject: FW: Payment Tracking 63405092314087 - 901271 <br>  Hello! <br>  I received my parcel back and paid 237.10 rubles (I enclose the check and scan of the package in the attached document, the ‚ÄúReturn‚Äù file). <br>  Total 237.10 + 237.10 = 474.20 rubles, I paid for my package to go for 2 months to an unknown destination and return in a pretty worn form.  And I do not observe any further actions, except for one call, which I was promised to sort out.  Can I find out the status of the problem? <br>  Sincerely, Kapatsky Alexander, <br></blockquote><br>  I do not receive a single reply to this letter within 3 days and I begin to attack all the webmail boxes of the ‚ÄúMail of Russia‚Äù I know (in particular), in particular the head office and the UFPS of the Krasnodar Territory. <br>  On the same day, on October 23, 2009, I receive a piece of the official letter in my inbox: <br><blockquote>  Dear Colleagues! <br>  An email from Kapatsky Alexander regarding the improper provision of postal services OPS No. 354054 in Sochi has been sent to the email address of FSUE Russian Post. <br>  Sending this address to your address, I ask you to check on the specified facts. <br>  Information on the results of the audit and the measures taken, by November 6, 2009, should be communicated to the applicant at the email address: ***, a copy of the response should be sent to the email address Client@russianpost.ru with the note ‚ÄúResponse to appeal No. 902079‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  And again, as time went on, I was still waiting ... and now, finally, it was <b>06.11.09,</b> hurray !!! <br><br>  I receive mail in the form of a doc-file, in which the scan of the document (by the way I want to note - well done, it did it all right on the 5th. Thank you!). <br><img src="http://img2.pict.com/80/95/6e/1928737/0/800/blank1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>And so the war is lost - capitulation :)</b> <br>  Losses: 237.10 rubles * 2 + more than two months of wasted time + nerves of ordinary citizens * 2 + the contents of the parcel razdurochennoe from such trips (not cheap electronic components, which is the most offensive). <br><br>  I want to add more. <br>  The marketing of the Post of Russia is not even lame, but just crawling without legs on the edge of the precipice, it seems that all this brand renewal and bringing the structure in line with the requirements of the time have been reduced exclusively to changing signboards and forms, a lazy and clumsy bureaucratic giant who is absolutely incapable of competing without state support. <br><br>  Sympathy is not waiting - help help :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74528/</a></p>
