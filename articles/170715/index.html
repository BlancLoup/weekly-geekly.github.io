      Network virtualization in Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) from the System Center 2012 Service Pack 1 (SP1) family includes a number of enhancements that allow administrators to be more flexible when it comes to virtualization and data network management.  Today's post talks about two improvements: virtual machine networks (VM Networks) and gateways (Gateways). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Networks and Gateways </h1><br><br>  Let's first define our new objects and understand what their essence is. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Virtual machine networks (VM networks): virtual machine networks allow you to use network virtualization, i.e.  creating a logical and isolated virtual data transfer medium over common network interfaces.  To realize this opportunity there are several ways: <br><br>  ‚ó¶ Network Virtualization (Hyper-V): if you want to support several isolated tenants in parallel (a tenant means an isolated logical infrastructure of a client or user, which is perceived as a separate physical object) with their own data networks isolated from third-party data networks - in In this case, you must use network virtualization.  In order to do this, you need to create a logical network, and on top of this logical network you can create a set of networks of virtual machines, each of which is an option of network isolation using means of Hyper-V network virtualization.  With this type of isolation, your tenants can use any IP address that is possible, no matter what address ranges are used in other virtual machine networks.  It is worth noting that network virtualization is thus only available on hosts running Windows Server 2012. Hosts running Windows Server 2008 R2 do not support this technology. <br><br>  V VLAN-based configuration: if your environment uses networks with all the usual VLAN identifiers for network isolation, you can use VMM to simplify the process of managing virtual networks. <br>  To configure a network of virtual machines based on VLANs, you must perform the following steps. <br><br>  1. Get information about the numbers of existing VLANs in the current physical network. <br><br>  2. In VMM, create a logical network and select network areas within a logical network and make sure they are not connected. (Do not select the option to use Private VLANs if you have not activated and do not use this technology. In within the logical network, create a separate network area for each existing VLAN. Set each network area with a name that reflects the meaning and purpose of the identified network in your environment. <br><br>  3. Associate the network regions with the physical adapter on the Hyper-V host.  This can be done in the host properties inside the VMM management console (section Hardware -&gt; Network adapters).  Alternatively, you can also collect all the necessary information and specify it in the uplink port profile and logical switch, and then apply the uplink port profile to the desired physical interface. <br><br>  4. Create one virtual machine network for each network region (and VLAN) in your configuration. <br><br>  ‚ó¶ ‚Äúno isolation‚Äù mode: this is the simplest configuration, where the network of virtual machines is the same network as the logical network.  This configuration is suitable for a host management network.  In this case, the network of virtual machines provides functionality exclusively at the level of the logical network.  To configure this option, create a logical network, and then create a network of virtual machines and select the ‚ÄúNo isolation‚Äù mode. <br><br>  In each logical network, you can create and use only one network of virtual machines in no isolation from the rest.  Consequently, a logical network that supports network virtualization can create one network of virtual machines without isolation, and other networks with isolation. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Gateways: to connect the network of virtual machines with other networks, you can configure the network of virtual machines to use the gateway.  (This configuration requires a logical network and network virtualization to create a network of virtual machines).  To configure the network of virtual machines to connect to other networks in your environment, for the gateway parameter, select the value Local networks.  As an alternative, if you are a hoster or want to allow your customers and tenants to connect to their physical networks.  In this case, you must select the Remote networks option - as a result you will receive a connection via VPN. <br><br>  Before you configure the gateway, you need to fulfill some requirements: <br><br>  VMM networks are configured by combining several VMM elements with each other.  These elements are: <br><br>  1. Logical networks (the basis for networks of virtual machines or VM networks). <br><br>  2. (Optional) Load balancing options. <br><br>  3. (Optional) Parameters of ports and logical switches.  You can use multiple VMM configuration elements together to seamlessly and accurately configure multiple network adapters over multiple hosts.  These items include: <br><br>  ‚ó¶ Native port profiles for uplinks <br><br>  ‚ó¶ Native port profiles for virtual network adapters <br><br>   Port Classifications <br><br>  ‚ó¶ Logic Switches <br><br>  Also, be aware that if you want to add a gateway to your configuration, you must first install a software provider from your gateway on the VMM server and restart the VMM service. <br><br>  If you are going to connect networks through a VPN tunnel in order to connect to third-party networks, you will also need to know the IP address of the VPN server.  You also need to know the authentication method of the VPN server.  If you use a predefined shared key, then you can use Run As accounts to save the parameter data.  You can also authenticate with a certificate if this option is available. <br><br>  In brief, virtual machine networks and gateways in VMM 2012 SP1 are everything. <br>  Soon you will be able to find more information about VMM 2012 SP1 on the <a href="http://www.msftva.ru/">MVA</a> portal, which is prepared by our MVP - Mikhail Komarov. <br>  I will also be glad to see you at the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/cloud/jj980536">event dedicated to System Center 2012 SP1 in the office of Microsoft Russia on March 11</a> . <br><br>  See you in new and amazing meetings! <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Fireman <br>  George A. Gadzhiev <br><br>  Information Infrastructure Expert <br>  Microsoft Corporation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170715/</a></p>
