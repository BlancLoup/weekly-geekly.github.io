A year and a half has passed, a respected community can assess which of us has turned out to be right.

      The initial thesis reads as follows: Habr was killed first of all by the lack of understanding of Thematic Media, what Habrahabr is and why it took off - unlike other TM projects, half of which have already been buried, and the other half are flying low. <br><br>  The fact is that Habr in the form in which it existed in 2010 was not at all a ‚Äúwebsite about IT‚Äù such as 3dnews and Ferra.  Habr was, first of all, a circle of interests.  A bunch of geeks gathered and discussed, in general, what was interesting to them - including, but not limited to, space, desktops, substances, the theory of evolution, the greed of the copywriters, the comb of Churov and so on.  From time to time TM arranged raids and banila with a particularly cruel flame, but, in general, the situation suited everyone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next thing happened: Habr grew and grew and gradually grew to very large sizes.  This led to a bunch of unpleasant consequences: <br>  - it became profitable to write for money any reviews of gadgets and other slag; <br>  - the level of discussion began to fall frankly, and the level of the flame, respectively - grow; <br>  - good fit posts (good fit == interesting to the geek core of the audience) began to write simply uninteresting, because they were drowning in every slag and received far fewer comments, advantages, asterisks and just that. <br><br>  In general, however, Habr was more alive than dead.  But then the administration entered the business, with the grace of a hippopotamus who solved all of the above problems: <br><br>  - no quality articles?  Let's declare Habr a place strictly ‚Äúabout programming‚Äù, let us grow a ‚Äúquality content‚Äù with a carcass / stuffed figure by means of ‚Äúincentives for authors‚Äù and corporate blogs; <br>  - a lot of flooding?  One half is banned, the other half is cut off; <br>  - everything "not about IT" we will move to separate platforms. <br><br>  The most unpleasant thing is that the <em>administration has fully achieved its goals</em> .  Habr has become a collection of good articles about programming.  No, really, there are of course not many of them, but they are quite qualitative.  But the community died at the same time, Habr is no longer a collective blog, namely, that the platform for publications with thin comments. <br><br>  In the then discussion of the opening of Giktaims, I expressed the thesis that someone would definitely make a ‚Äúnormal habr clone‚Äù that would take the audience away from TM projects.  This did not happen, because Habr dies not in favor of any other platform, and this is quite understandable from the foregoing.  Personally, I stopped writing on Habr, because the level of the community fell.  Where will I go?  Obviously, where there is an interesting society to me - Facebook, Telegram, whatever.  My hypothesis is that the audience of the old Habr has slowly spread to other places of geek parties, that's all. <br><br>  Finally, instead of a conclusion.  These processes, in my opinion, are irreversible.  There is no ‚Äúold‚Äù Habr, it cannot be revived, and nothing like it on the horizon is foreseen.  So it goes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/278341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/278341/</a></p>
