Judging by the best-selling games in history - no.  Here we will talk about first-person shooters Battlefield and Call of Duty, and the world of Minecraft, and the simulator of the murder of prostitutes GTA V. <br><br>  And now the mystery: which game was the best-selling in history?  I'm sure most of you can handle it easily.  But the answer is still at the end of the article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ab/aed/4fb/3abaed4fb6dc1f37b2b3b373e99114f1.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  World of warcraft </h4><br>  The game World of Warcraft was released in 2004, by 2007 the number of users reached 8 million people, and in 2010 it exceeded 13 million.  This is the most popular MMORPG in the world by the number of subscribers, as evidenced by the entry in the Guinness Book of Records.  Over the entire history of the game have registered more than 100 million accounts, and the number of players floats between 7 and 10 million people.

      World of Warcraft <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/251662/">was one</a> of the first six games in the Video Game Hall of Fame. <br><br>  To support sales, Blizzard used beautiful images of famous people.  For example, Chuck Norris.  Which is a hunter, but does not hunt, since hunting implies the likelihood of failure. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WGisxNm6ybQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Below are two more commercials featuring Mr. T. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BAibYnDUH6c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And the movie with Ozzy Osbourne, indecently expressed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OgYWLSrmlI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In 2016, a movie based on the Warcraft game was released with Viking by Travis Fimmel in the title role.  The picture was met with mixed feelings, revealing a lot of flaws in it.  But the film collected the box office - with a budget of $ 160 million, the world's fees amounted to more than 433 million.  It is worth saying that the film was announced in 2006, 10 years before the release. <br><br>  Fortunately, Uwe Boll was denied participation in the filming of the film, as his "work" could have a negative impact on the sales of the game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Rxoz13Bthc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Battlefield 3 </h4><br>  Battlefield 3 was the eleventh game in the Battlefield series.  The release took place in 2011.  Already in the first week the game was sold in the amount of five million copies, and in less than a year this mark reached fifteen million.  The game involves the passage of the campaign and multiplayer mode. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRqfFfuVuNE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd8/735/85a/fd873585af47bbc57d2ad61686a3c2d1.jpg"><br><br>  Battlefield IV by 2014 and could not overtake its predecessor.  This is largely due to flaws - Electronic Arts was even sued due to the fact that the advertisement spread false information about the game.  Game developers sometimes sin with such things that the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/279918/">creators of No Man's Sky have</a> once again <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/279918/">shown</a> . <br><br>  In October 2016, the fifteenth game will be released in the series, Battlefield 1 based on the First World War.  Time will tell whether it will fall into the list of best-selling games in the future. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c7nRTF2SowQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-vAxVh8ins" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Call of duty </h4><br>  The success of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 became apparent on the first day after its release, November 10, 2009.  The day the developers set a record and sold 4.7 million copies of the game, overtaking on this parameter Grand Theft Auto IV.  Seven years have passed since that moment, but the game still has the warmest feelings for many. <br><br>  The game of the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, on the contrary, caused outrage.  In early 2010, as part of the spring session of the meeting, they began to discuss Call of Duty, proposing to equate games with extremist materials.  It was about scenes of violence, namely about the murder in the game of unarmed people at the airport.  The level of "No Russian" in the Russian version was removed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/429l13dS6kQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In November 2010, the game Call of Duty: Black Ops broke the record of its predecessor - it sold 5 million copies per day.  Total sales of the game in 2012 exceeded 26 million copies. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OtRnpC7ddv8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  November 12, 2011 Activision reported that for the third year in a row, the game series of Call of Duty sets a world sales record.  In just one day, 6.5 million copies were bought in the USA and England.  Until 2013, 28.5 million copies were sold. <br><br>  This game is dedicated to the end of the Third World War and is a continuation of Modern Warfare 2. Personally, I consider this game the best in the series.  But this is my subjective opinion, tied, perhaps, including on a nostalgic mood towards her.  It is still nice to sometimes turn on the battle mode with bots for survival. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coiTJbr9m04" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a7/2c9/bc2/0a72c9bc2a122df790bd72a29e373b82.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Pok√©mon Red, Blue, Green and Pok√©mon Gold and Silver </h4><br>  In 1996, Nintendo released Pok√©mon Red, Blue and Green in Japan on the Game Boy.  These were the first games on the console from the series about Pokemon.  Three versions were sold in the amount of 23.64 million copies.  As we can see, the popularity of Pokemon already at that time affected sales of video games, so the success of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278412/">Pokemon Go</a> is quite logical. <br><br>  Let's remember what Pokemon Red looked like on a Game Boy in 1996.  With such graphic capabilities, then it was necessary to make an excellent gameplay.  Or the main thing - to choose the right characters, how do you think? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9giCebGY8-s" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Two new versions of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver were released in 1999 on Game Boy and Game Boy Color.  They could not succeed their predecessors, but 23 million copies were still sold, making these games one of the best-selling video games in history. <br><br>  To 151 minds of Pokemon from previous versions, another 100 were added, for a total of 251 characters. To collect all Pokemons, it was not enough to go through one game - for example, Gold.  Users needed to exchange Pok√©mon with players of the Silver version, as well as old games. <br><br>  A little more balm for the ears in the form of old 8-bit music in the gameplay of Pokemon Silver. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1b2W38pNMg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Nintendogs </h4><br>  Long before the goat simulator, but after tamagotchi, Nintendo decided to make a dog simulator for the DS console.  From 2005 to 2011, Nintendogs sold 23.64 million copies. <br><br>  In the game you need to care for the dog, control is carried out using the touchscreen and a microphone.  Using a wireless connection between consoles, you can communicate with other users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/109/a2c/955/109a2c955723f56d1eac1df8697765aa.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Diablo iii </h4><br>  The famous RPG Diablo III was released in 2012.  The game set a record for the daily sale of games for personal computers - 3.5 million per day.  In the first week, sales reached 6.3 million copies, and a total of 30 million copies were sold.  Perhaps, if Diablo III was released on several platforms at once, it would break Call of Duty records. <br><br>  Diablo III was warmly received, but the fans who played in the previous versions decided that the atmosphere was different.  The colors are too bright, a little Gothic and so on.  In this regard, they put forward a petition to Blizzard demanding to change the color scheme.  The company refused. <br><br>  Below is a Diablo III add-on trailer: Reaper of Souls. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbL-7SKeB6E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And a little bit of humor - television advertising games for game consoles. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KE7i92-5SM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Super mario </h4><br>  In any such rating should be Super Mario.  If we were talking about gaming franchises, this particular character would have come first.  Super Mario Bros. Game  for Nintendo Entertainment System (in Russia read "for Dendy") it was sold in the amount of 40.24 million copies. <br><br>  Anime was filmed on the game, a strange 1993 film and, of course, porn, in which Ron Jeremy took part.  Nintendo had to buy two porn rights to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/262448/">bury them forever</a> .  But Youtube remembers at least such a small thread without, in fact, the main action. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGuMm3xXHAU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Keep a little weird game advertising straight from the 1980s. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzln22voxVM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The list of best-selling games in history includes Mario Kart Wii, New Super Mario Bros., New Super Mario Bros.  Wii.  Each of these games was sold in quantities of at least 23 million copies.  But the total sales of all franchise games are 528 million units. <br><br><h4>  Grand theft auto v </h4><br>  GTA series games are largely due to their popularity of the ability to move freely around the world and do whatever they want.  You want - push people, you want - you complete tasks, you want - you kill prostitutes.  Because of the latter, Grand Theft Auto V has even been <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/242434/">banned in Australia</a> . <br><br>  The game was released in September 2013 on the seventh-generation consoles, in 2014 - on the eighth-generation consoles, and in 2015 on personal computers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jy7ceLVVgU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The PC version with 60 FPS and Full HD is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/248340/">amazing</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KPJ8LT_48RU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The advertising campaign of the game went off with a bang and with scandal.  On the poster below, you can easily find out Lindsay Lohan, moreover, there is a mission in the game, where you need to save a character with a biography similar to the history of Lohan from the paparazzi.  That's just on the covers of the game is not a famous actress, but the model Shelby Velinder.  The actress sued Rockstar and lost. <br><br>  A total of 65 million copies of the game were sold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e6/e49/f5a/8e6e49f5adbf1a0a064ef47c8328033d.png"><br><br>  The predecessor of the GTA V, released in 2008, the fourth part of Grand Theft Auto, was sold in the amount of 25 million copies.  She could not overtake the 2004 Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas with 27.5 million sales.  You can remember childhood with San Andreas <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.rockstargames.gtasa%26hl%3Dru">on Android</a> today, only you will have to pay more than five hundred rubles.  Blasphemous so preying on nostalgia. <br><br>  Welcome to the Jungle - invite Guns'n'Roses to GTA: San Andreas. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YjASEB59Cc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h4>  Wii Sports </h4><br>  The Wii Sports mobile game went on sale in November 2006 and was sold in quantities of more than 82 million copies.  The recipe for success was simple - the game was delivered right in the box with the Nintendo Wii prefix in all countries except Japan. <br><br>  The game has received various awards for innovative gameplay.  This collection of five sports simulators involves motion control with the help of controllers. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqaPFAZS1K8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Mobility in the game has become a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, people began to pick up fifth points from the couch and spend time together for exciting games.  On the other hand, televisions suffered from this. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jIUUzmflyBQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Taking off controllers was not uncommon.  Still, each of the sports in the set - tennis, baseball, bowling, golf and boxing - involves active waving hands.  You can just forget that the bowling ball is rolling inside the game, and try to knock down the pins with a plastic piece in your hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d0/f76/431/9d0f7643132313072ce691754f39f125.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de3/3ee/221/de33ee221104c0340081f29d4b3f276b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f86/f6f/184/f86f6f184839c3fc76c4d54992cd5539.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Minecraft </h4><br>  So beloved by the younger generation Minecraft was sold in the amount of 107 million copies.  In 2011, Markus Persson, a Swedish programmer who founded Mojang, released it on Windows, OS X and Linux.  A few months later, she came out on Android, iOS, and then switched to Xbox 360 and One, PlayStation 3, 4 and Vita game consoles.  In 2014, Microsoft bought the developer company Minecraft for two billion dollars. <br><br>  The game has become one of the most popular in the world.  Total has sold over 107 million copies.  But why did she even become popular?  Why are they so fond of schoolchildren, they constantly shoot videos on Youtube? <br><br>  Perhaps, as in the case of GTA, a big role is played by the openness of the game world.  Minecraft gives room for imagination and creativity.  You can hunt, you can build buildings and cities, or blow something up.  And everything - in a world like Lego.  And almost everyone likes Lego. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ac/e21/bbc/7ace21bbcd7f21b687b7c8fa86857d81.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Tetris </h4><br>  June 6, 2016 Tetris turned 32 years old.  This game has visited almost all gaming platforms, as well as graphical calculators and media players.  In its motives <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/275998/">in China they want to make a</a> science fiction feature film.  And this will deal with the American producer Lawrence Kazanov, responsible for the film "True Lies", as well as taking part in several animated television projects for Lego. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b0/494/77a/2b049477a65cc49e24a043e375f9b40a.jpg"><br>  <em>Why are there a calculator, in Tetris it was possible <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/218617/">to</a> play <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/218617/">on the wall of a skyscraper</a></em> <br><br>  The game was created by Soviet programmer Alexey Pajitnov.  The name comes from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE">"tetramino"</a> and "tennis."  "Tetramino" are geometric shapes of four squares.  There are seven such figures in Tetris.  The figures fall into a beaker with a width of 10 and a height of 20 cells.  The goal is to collect a horizontal row of 10 cells, which then disappear. <br><br>  In the history of the game, it was not only ported to all sorts of platforms, but also changed the rules, complicated, refined.  Tetris did the volume, it was color and black and white, with a variety of musical accompaniment.  Even the "physical" Tetris sell.  In 2009, designer Andrew Liszewski (Andrew Liszewski) began selling his <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/69036/">360-degree version</a> in which the figure appears in the center, and then falls to any side that the player chooses, turning the console. <br><br>  The rights to use the game in the machines bought by Atari.  Nintendo got the rights to port to NES and Game Boy.  Then, in the late 1980s, the game hit the Sega.  And in 1996, Pajitnov founded the Tetris Company in order to start getting money for his invention.  In 2014, Tetris Company announced a deal to port the game to XboX One and PlayStation 4. <br><br>  For 2014, the number of mobile installations of the game <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2014/04/07/mr-tetris-explains-why-the-puzzle-game-is-still-popular-after-three-decades-interview/">was</a> 425 million, 35 million - for the Game Boy, plus about 70 million copies were sold.  It is difficult to say how many unlicensed cartridges and devices with this game were sold. <br><br>  So Tetris is not just a leader, but an absolute leader with a huge advantage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0c/426/57c/a0c42657c0dc6b1a06ce1190c7490cbb.jpg"><br><br>  <strong>Let's talk about your favorite games now.</strong>  <strong>And no matter how many copies of these games were sold.</strong>  <strong>What did you like to play before, and what do you include now?</strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398293/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398293/</a></p>
