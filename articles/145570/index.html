  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The development of e-justice in the arbitration system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In August last year, we <a href="http://pravo.ru/edition/view/59949/">wrote</a> about how experts evaluate the work of the service ‚Äú <a href="http://kad.arbitr.ru/">Card file of arbitration cases</a> ‚Äù (CR).  During this time, the service base has been replenished, and by mid-June 2012 more than 9,019,230 cases were available.  The average daily attendance of the Ring Road increased by 75% to 200,000 people.  From the moment the service was commissioned, it was visited by 9,161,974 unique users who viewed 220,579,071 pages.  The total number of visits was 61,028,826. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c9/dad/628/1c9dad6281976e69bbb982b5bcc40fd3.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The project ‚Äú <a href="http://kad.arbitr.ru/">Card file of arbitration cases</a> ‚Äù currently plays a large role in the work of a lawyer.  It allows you to learn information about the movement of the case without much effort and phone calls to the secretaries and assistant judges, to use the bank court decisions.  The function of informing by e-mail in relation to cases of interest allows you to quickly respond to any changes in the case. <br><br>  In this case, the CR is used not only by participants in arbitration disputes, but also by those companies that rarely apply to arbitration courts or do not appeal at all.  The CR can be used to make a decision about concluding a contract, as it is possible to find out information about the current affairs of the counterparty and determine its reliability and solvency. <br><br>  We continue to improve the service and at the same time take into account all the wishes of the Supreme Arbitration Court of the Russian Federation and users.  We present to your attention the innovations of the Ring Road and other services of the arbitration system of the Russian Federation.

    <h4>  Convenience search </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/701/30f/e1f/70130fe1f1ed2aa29d20ca6cb056d690.png"><br>  The search for business cards by TIN and OGRN parties has become available.  It is not uncommon for manual filling in the data to indicate different spellings of the names of participants in the processes, and the user had to search for the cases separately for each of them.  Now, if you search using numbers, it will be as accurate as possible. <br><br>  In addition, the search capabilities are expanded as you enter the case number and select the court.  If the prefix of the specified case does not coincide with the selected court, then the search results will display the cards corresponding to the main number of the case and the ordinal number of the case in the specified court. <br><br><h4>  Combining the services of the judicial system </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/319/bfe/f64/319bfef644b804253f4f9296c6140f1c.png"><br>  Separate attention should be paid to the services of subscription to information on the cases of ‚ÄúElectronic Guard‚Äù and submission of documents in electronic form to the courts ‚Äú <a href="https://my.arbitr.ru/">My arbitrator</a> ‚Äù.  Now you can manage business subscriptions and apply to the courts from one office.  Also in the "Electronic Guard" there was an opportunity to add comments to subscriptions and divide them into categories of "affairs" and "participants." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16f/8c2/1b9/16f8c21b9614b1546125786695f4690e.png"><br>  During the entire existence of the service ‚ÄúMy Arbitrator‚Äù 496,914 documents have been submitted, of which 442,136 have been accepted into the work.  From the beginning of this year to mid-June, 239,155 documents have already been submitted and 215,814 documents have been received, which is about the same as for all of 2011.  200,454 subscribers currently use the ‚ÄúElectronic Guard‚Äù service, which is 20% more than the number of users at the end of 2011. <br><br><h4>  Mobility </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0da/4ab/dd8/0da4abdd8afa30c719c99966ad15e2f6.png"><br>  In the middle of May 2010, the KAD mobile app for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/arbitr/id500039565%3Fmt%3D8">iOS appeared</a> , at the end of June of the same year - for devices on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.parcsis.kad2">Android</a> platform, and in February 2012 for <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/95bfb364-2935-47e1-848a-6977702b0444">WP7</a> .  Since the advent of the application, they were installed by 35,100 people. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a87/69b/921/a8769b9218761d534fef4cfb72d6e48f.png"><br>  In May 2012, for the Android application, it became possible to store the necessary documents in the device‚Äôs memory, which allows you to work with them without an Internet connection.  In the near future, this functionality will appear for iOS and WP7. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/08a/12b/314/08a12b3141ebd1c54844f863c8c983d7.png"><br><h4>  Expectations and plans </h4><br><br>  As part of the improvement of the service ‚ÄúCard file of arbitration cases‚Äù, it is planned to implement the display of a bankruptcy card, in which, in addition to general information about the procedural stage of bankruptcy, users will be able to view creditors' claims and decisions on them.  In addition, the service ‚ÄúDecisions of arbitration courts‚Äù will be improved, namely, the number of possible views of cases will increase without narrowing the search criteria. <br><br>  Also realized another wish of users.  In the near future, it will be possible to upload meeting information in a different format and synchronize it with iCal and Google Calendar. <br><br>  Now it is testing the service ‚ÄúVoice file of arbitration cases‚Äù, to which you can join by calling +74959821160.  The service is implemented using the system integrator KROK and the Speech Technology Center.  In order to obtain information on the case over the phone, the user simply has to dictate the case number. <br><br>  Work on the improvement of services continues.  We will be happy to receive your feedback and suggestions to the mailbox uis@arbitr.ru They will definitely be taken into account in further development. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145570/</a></p>
