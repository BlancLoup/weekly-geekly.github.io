We look forward to hearing from you. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Well, this is trivial.  Remember the recent conversation in the palace.  I argued that each subject must be identified, that is, assigned to it a separate identifier.  What for? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : To distinguish one subject from another. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Right ... Do you distinguish yourself? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : What is the question ?!  Each of us has our own "I", which allows us to distinguish ourselves from other people. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : So, each of you, like any other creature, is assigned a separate identifier? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Thank you Buddha!  Buddha is great! <br>  <i>Bow to the statue of Buddha.</i> <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : So your own "I" exists to distinguish you from other beings who also have their own "I"? <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Well, yes.  Exactly. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : So why the hell did you, having your own "I," need a refutation of solipsism, wouldn't it have already been refuted ?!  What does solipsism say?  He claims that only your ‚ÄúI‚Äù exists, and no other ‚ÄúI‚Äù exists.  However, in this case, the one who created our universe ... <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Buddha? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Aha, Buddha! .. So, in this case - if only your ‚Äúme‚Äù existed - the Buddha would not need to identify you.  It is the presence of your own "I" as an identifier of the subject that proves the existence of other "I", because it is impossible to consider the Buddha as a clumsy, who creates the universe without proper understanding of its structure ?! <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : That you, prince, of course, is impossible!  We understood and agreed.  Now, if someone stutters in our presence about solipsism, we will laugh in his face and exclaim: ‚ÄúMy own‚Äú I ‚Äùspeaks about the opposite!  Buddha is great! ‚Äù

      <i><b>The author warns!</b></i> <i><br></i>  <i>The past adventures of Prince Calaf were quite lively discussed at Habr√©.</i>  <i>During the discussion, many fascinating conjectures were expressed - in particular, that the author of the post:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>a) asshole</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) an ass,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>c) troll.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I want to believe that the charges do not meet the criterion of falsifiability Popper.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, in order to avoid consequences, please do not read this post for people suffering from epileptic seizures, as well as graduates of physical and mathematical schools who are not able to imagine that matter is also information.</i>  <i>To confirm that you understand and agree, click the cat.</i>  <i>If your technical education does not allow you to put up with it, and you want to read, ask to poke your wife or child - they still don‚Äôt understand a damn thing, they can be forgiven.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Yes, reading is also not recommended for people without a sense of humor.</i>  <i>Please confirm.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : With solipsism figured out, thank Buddha. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : You are so smart, prince ... <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> ( <i>modestly</i> ): Yes, I am. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Could you imagine a more complete structure of your informational person? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : I will leave Beijing tomorrow morning, but I will try to make it.  To begin with, what stopped in a conversation with Princess Turandot.  The system of an information person has three identifiers denoting the internal structure, and signs relating to the field of the beyond. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Yes, yes, we remember. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : I explain: not every person has his own table, as you might think, but there is a general table of the universe, in which each of us is identified by its own identifier. <br>  <i>Draws a twig on a dirty floor.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/994/43c/c5e/99443cc5ef27b5123167fdf6d52ec5ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Each object in the table of the universe is a combination of its perceptions from the subjects. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : We understand. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : With identifiers figured out, go to the signs.  As I explained earlier, the signs are exorbitant for the system, introduced from the outside, so that the system itself can not be determined.  In this example, this is the name of the object.  During my explanations to the princess, I heard someone in the crowd shouting about the illegitimacy of using a thesaurus in solving the problem of ‚Äúhyponym-hyperonym‚Äù.  You know, this screamer is right: there can be no verbal values ‚Äã‚Äãin the table of the universe. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : And what then is? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : That is the only transcendent that is available to man. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : What?  What is this? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Sensations, it goes without saying.  Five sensations are available to man: sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste.  It is they who fill the world around with human content, while everything else ‚Äî I mean identifiers ‚Äî only structures this content.  Here is how the table of the universe should look more complete. <br>  <i>Draws.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cff/baf/6f7/cffbaf6f7959861663d4b0f28f2a9dd6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  How can you characterize an orange as a material object?  As something spherical and orange, not emitting sounds, having a pleasant smell and taste.  The data of our senses are primordial, they cannot be somehow determined from the information system itself, because they are transcendent.  Therefore, being for us is our sensations. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : It is difficult to deny.  But it seems to us, dear Prince, your information is not enough.  In this system, the person himself, in particular the human body, is lacking, because along with his own ‚ÄúI‚Äù, established by the identifier ID_3, each of us also perceives his own body as belonging to him and no one else. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : You are absolutely right ... if you don‚Äôt know how identifiers and signs relate to each other. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : And how do they compare? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Each identifier, which determines the internal structure, corresponds to a set of features that determine the external content.  Because it is the content that can be structured: identifiers themselves are meaningless, since in this case they define an empty system.  ID_2 is a link to ID_1, therefore we need to set the attributes that correspond to IDs ID_1 and ID_3.  What are the suggestions? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : This is so unexpected ... Need to think ... <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : You will think tomorrow when I leave Beijing.  Okay, I will not torture my friends - the signs relate to the identifiers as follows. <br>  <i>Draws on the picture arrows.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95c/a56/f60/95ca56f6073e84c5ab8c3e6d37d56437.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Do you have evidence or is this wisdom incomprehensible to mortals? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : What is there incomprehensible!  You just did not think about this topic, but think, and everything will become as clear as two and two.  People feel exactly the same, in this sense, it is easy for them to agree among themselves.  Is it not obvious that, for example, vision gives an idea about objects, but at the same time - no idea about a subject?  When you observe an object visually, it is in any case an object, but by no means a subject: visually, this bowl or hookah ( <i>points to them</i> ) are exactly the same objects as my hand or foot ( <i>shows</i> ).  If you focus on the vision, to establish where my body is, and where objects surround it, I can only be mentally. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Perhaps that is so. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : On the other hand, signs that relate to the subject responsible for the subject ID_3 show only the subject.  For example, touch.  Do you really think that tactile sensations are perceived by the skin, because there are corresponding receptors on the skin? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Well ... generally we think. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Oh, do not tell my socks!  Maybe the opposite?  Touch refers to subjectivity, so everything that you perceive tactilely belongs to your body?  Feel the difference: vision refers to objectivity, therefore any visual image is an object, and touch refers to subjectivity, therefore any tactile perception is a subject.  The same with the other sensations: some belong to objectivity and characterize objects external to you, while others relate to subjectivity and characterize you as a subject.  And this subject is not some kind of identifier, but quite a material body with arms and legs. <br>  <i>Draws on a dirty floor with a twig - something quite simple, like this:</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb0/4c5/10c/fb04c510c40e925a2c6e3ac0cc43759f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  By sensations alone, a person perceives his body as a subject, by other sensations, an external objective world surrounding himself, as a result of which a person appears in his usual mental object-subject shell. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : What an unexpected turn!  However, Prince, you lack important details. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : What? <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Mind. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Hinting that I'm an asshole?  We know, heard ... <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : That you, dear Prince, we hint at the lack of your concept of thinking. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Indeed, I forgot about thinking.  Well, of course, of course ... The fact is that the table of the universe is not one - there are two of them, and the carriers are at different levels. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : How so? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : When we accepted the information character of our universe as an axiom, we thereby removed the carrier of this information from our area of ‚Äã‚Äãcompetence.  The universe, including us with you - information.  Probably, this information is recorded on some carrier - we must assume this, because in our world information is always recorded on a tangible medium.  But on what carrier our universe is recorded, we will never be installed, because the carrier is outside our system.  This is known to the one who created our information system - the Buddha ... <br>  <i>Everyone is looking at the Buddha in the corner and bowing.</i> <br>  However, within the framework of our information system, matter is only matter given to us in sensations, which can be used as a material carrier.  It is used, not only by people in writing, but also by the Buddha himself, when with his most gracious decision he programmed people for self-propagation. <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Do you want to say that the human brain is a system in a system? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : This look almost corresponds to the ordinary perception.  Thoughts are really recorded in the brain, thus we have one information system consisting of elements of another information system, therefore I assert that these are systems of different levels. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Sorry, but if matter is information, what we agreed on ... how can we get another information system from the elements of one information system? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : There is nothing easier.  Imagine a symbol belonging to one information system.  Let it be the hieroglyph "A". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/625/b3d/a1d/625b3da1d2fade102ceb66d4273891b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sages</b> : Presented. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Now take a lot of hieroglyphs ‚ÄúA‚Äù and lay out the big hieroglyph ‚ÄúB‚Äù from them.  Is this not possible? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4f/431/9b7/c4f4319b71f0eabfe56cea48c314f73c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Sages</b> : Perhaps, of course. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : The resulting systems will be information systems of different levels: at the lower level there are many hieroglyphs ‚ÄúA‚Äù, and at the upper level - one big hieroglyph ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  This makes it possible to understand why the human brain is so complex: to achieve a given complexity, it is necessary to use a huge number of elements.  Thus, the whole universe is dual: it is the first table, which has the structure described above and is responsible for the reflection of the material world, and at the same time the second table, which is responsible for thinking and composed of the elements of the first table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24c/adb/fc6/24cadbfc65976ee3bbc523d986bcac20.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Which again corresponds to the ordinary ideas that the world is divided into the material and the mental. <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : And what is the structure of the second table? <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : And if I say I do not know? <br>  <b>Sages</b> ( <i>disappointed</i> ): Ooooh! <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Calm, I have some thoughts on this.  First of all ... But what's the noise? <br>  <i>Nearby, you can actually hear a woman screaming, then scuffling, then people with broadswords, with their black bandages covering their faces, rush into the caravanserai.</i> <br>  <b>The broadswords</b> : Stay around!  Special operation! <br>  <i>All freeze on the ground.</i> <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> ( <i>sages</i> ): What kind of warriors? <br>  <b>Sages</b> : Imperial Guard. <br>  <b>The imperial guard</b> ( <i>at the sight of the prince</i> a): Ah, there he is! .. The rest, get out of here!  Scat who said! <br>  <i>The rest run away in fear.</i> <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> ( <i>in unpleasant amazement</i> ): So you are looking for me, worthy? <br>  <b>The imperial guard</b> : You, you ... ordered to find and deliver to the palace, to the princess Turandot. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Ah, that's it!  ( <i>Wise men</i> ).  Listen, my dears, and your emperor does not have a younger daughter, not with such a scum character? <br>  <b>Wise men</b> : Unfortunately, dear prince. <br>  <b>Kalaf</b> : Oh, damn ... That's how I felt that I would not have time to finish my thinking about how I felt. <br>  <b>Imperial guard</b> : Well, what got up?  Hands behind your head and forward. <br>  <i>A minute later, no one remains in the caravanserai, one unshakable stone Buddha in the corner.</i>  <i>Suddenly, the lips of the statue are parted in a sly smile, and the Buddha says to himself:</i> <br>  <b>Buddha</b> : Here is the insolent bastard!  But he almost guessed, almost guessed! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebc/6cf/a58/ebc6cfa58b66eb377e59f705b8a86872.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165263/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165263/</a></p>
