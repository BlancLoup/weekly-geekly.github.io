  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 nightmares freelancer-copywriter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And the copywriter dreams of a nightmare ... He dreams that the Great and Awful Customer returned for revision all the texts crammed over the last year, and the keywords were mixed and scattered across the screen, like butterflies in a spring meadow.  And what should the poor copywriter do now, how not to wake up in a cold sweat with his cheek pressed against the keyboard and the unfinished text in the asset. <br>  However, the days of a copywriter are often not much better than such nightmares.  Here are just the five most common stalemate situations, each of which is well known to the author with the experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/679/939/151/679939151dbb973869fa1d9a1962982b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Nightmare number 1. Inadequate Customers</b> <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is not always possible to recognize the future problem customer, so to speak, ‚Äúon the shore‚Äù.  Insight comes after the next return of the text for revision.  Usually the refusal to accept the article in the first and second reading is justified by a postscript, very reminiscent of the anecdotal phrase: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how, but not so.‚Äù  At the same time, the reason for the second revision may differ significantly from the contents of the comment to the first.

Moreover, the requirements may change literally "on the go."  Rhetorical: ‚ÄúYes, and I forgot to add that ...,‚Äù is able to depress more than one copywriter.  In addition, the customer may, until the last moment, pull up with the check, but at any time of the day or night to demand the earliest possible revision of the text. <br>  - Run away from such a customer.  And the sooner and further, the better.  For in the time spent on alterations, attempts to understand the essence of the claims and altercations, it would be quite possible to have time to create and hand over a couple of different excellent texts, or even more. <br><br>  <b>The second nightmare.</b>  <b>Unclear Terms of Reference</b> <br><br>  Such a situation is quite accurately described by the saying: ‚ÄúUnclear TK is the result of the HZ‚Äù, where the last abbreviation is a wordplay that is not translatable from freelance copywriter.  No, of course, there are also customers who clearly know what criteria they should, and which should not be answered by the future text.  They clearly understand how to structure the structure of the article, and can also correctly calculate the number of kinoznakok necessary for the disclosure of the topic.  Such customers aim at all gold and carefully transferred from one copywriting hand to another.  Just kidding, in fact, such customers are not given even to the best friends and on pain of the deadline.  There is a legend that such super customers once were authors themselves. <br><br>  <b>Nightmare third, but not the last.</b>  <b>Greedy customer</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8c0/dc2/c01/8c0dc2c01ebf19fd47e67f6e7b244bf4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such customers usually bargain for every penny.  They are so cleverly able to make up the TZ, that the copywriter has to write the text for a much larger number of characters than is stipulated in order to fully cover the topic.  If the essence of the article, however, seems greedy to the customer is not disclosed, he with a clear conscience may refuse to pay at all.  It is also good if such a customer has enough decency not to use the text that he himself has rejected.  The above characters simply do not appreciate the work of others, because they do not know how to work intensively themselves.  In addition, they are not averse to taking advantage of any situation in order to get the text for nothing. <br><br>  <b>Nightmare under the number 4. Writing false reviews and dubious advice on medical topics</b> <br>  The most nightmarish, is not it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/55f/15a/699/55f15a699caff466d5b9294ff5a9106e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is so senseless and, moreover, inhumane, to give untested or frankly harmful (not at Oster's) medical advice that it‚Äôs absolutely pointless to explain the moral side of the question. <br>  And did you meet such orders, where you need to write an enthusiastic review about the product, about the quality of which vague doubts torment not only you, but also the customer himself.  Although there is no, just nothing torments the customer, on the contrary, such texts feed him very well.  By the way, many copywriters who take on the most difficult and poorly paid texts, absolutely do not want to write fake reviews with inaccurate numbers.  Even if they are promised a very specific amount for it. <br><br>  <b>Nightmare fifth.</b>  <b>Uninteresting topics</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d9a/b16/b3a/d9ab16b3a455a067df47529cb0473e8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A copywriter, who has to sprinkle a myriad of texts about tractor models every day, build air conditioners and wall cladding, burns out pretty quickly.  In this case, the author continues to scribble thousands of signs of hateful texts on the machine, not feeling any moral satisfaction from the work that was once his favorite and was considered creative.  As a result, many authors face a problem called the ‚Äúwriting barrier‚Äù and stop writing altogether, or at least for a long time. <br><br>  It would seem that such nightmares can not be defeated.  After all, the problem lies not in the specific author, but in the relations within the tandem customer-copywriter.  And the struggle between these two opposites is bound to be eternal. <br>  But the decision is so elementary.  You just have to look at the situation from the right angle and break the stereotype in your own head.  Who is the text for?  For customer?  Not at all! <br><br>  Articles are addressed not to intermediary customers, and even to site owners - they are intended for readers.  Hence, it should write for them.  Stop!  But then who will pay for the articles?  Readers will be.  Here are just articles in this case should be written completely different ... <br><br>  There is a Grrow.me service for solving the problems of freelance copywriters. Here the authors create content and receive rewards directly from readers.  Readers earn along with the authors, distributing their materials. <br><br>  This is not a typical situation, because free content is the sea, and authors (copywriters, bloggers) are used to writing to order or receive advertising revenue. <br><br>  However, the Grrow model works. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b52/a16/a23/b52a16a2386d8b89390f3f2492a8116c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What does the service offer? <br><br>  Authors - publish content and assign the cost of viewing. <br>  Readers - to search for interesting content, share it and receive 30% of the remuneration of the author. <br>  Bloggers and the media - to put the widget and receive rewards from readers on your site. <br><br>  We really want the authors to get a decent reward for their work.  Constantly improved the created content, and readers will be definitely grateful for it. <br><br>  <a href="http://grrow.me/authors">Get rewards from readers</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291268/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291268/</a></p>
