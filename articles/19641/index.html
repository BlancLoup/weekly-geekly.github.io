  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Demo "Fallout"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A recently hurt topic about a foul made me wander through resources to see what was going on in this mini-world, read about work on the third part and found out another interesting thing: it turned out there was a demo version, even before the first fold came out, by the way, there is a Russian-language case translation to the demo, which is really rarely: <br>  Here is a demo (22mb): <a href="http://www.fallout-archives.com/files/12/46p1.php">www.fallfall-archives.com/files/12/46p1.php</a> <br>  Here is the translation-Russifier (840kb): <a href="http://wasteland.ag.ru/%3Fid%3D463">wasteland.ag.ru/?id=463#n463</a> <br><br>  Features of the demo version and differences from the main game: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The only demo version of Fallout was released in April 1997.  It was allowed to play only for Max Stone, Vault 13's ‚Äúmuscles.‚Äù The role system was exactly the same, but perks and treitures were not available.  The action took place in the town of Scrapheap - a modified and significantly reduced version of Junktown.  The settlement was run by two gangs, Crypts and Fools.  The crypts controlled the generator, and the Fools were going to challenge their right to it.  The player could join one or the other, or fight with both.  Do not forget that the battles were to be harsh, and there were no save and load functions.  There was a wonderful quest with the addition of Dogmeat'a.  True, there was no benefit from the dog, if bitten by the enemies, it was very reluctant.  The dialogues connected with each other and with the player's actions were presented quite solidly.

      Of the weapons, only 10mm SMG and miniguns were presented (at the leaders of the gangs or in the locked refrigerator).  Armor - leather or metal - was the main external difference between the warring gangs.  Naturally, worse protected were more numerous.  Before the attack, it was necessary to go reconnaissance, looking into the lair of the enemy.  "Good" could be considered the ending, in which grateful residents tell the hero about the road to Necropolis.  But for this, on the territory of Scrapheap there should not have been a single gangster.  Another interesting option is to break the generator with wire cutters, depriving the gang conflict of any meaning.  The ‚Äústandard‚Äù outcome is the victory of one of the gangs, when its opponents were destroyed and its leader did not die. <br><br>  Interesting features that did not live up to the full version: <br>  The font color in the dialogs was not green, but gray.  At the same time in PipBoy'e he was the usual green. <br>  In the PipBoy, there was a Clues button (evidence), in the full version it turned out to be ‚Äúbroken‚Äù. <br>  An aimed shot cost 5 AP, and reloading, using things from the hand, opening inventory - 0 AP. <br>  The combat mode could be activated in dialogs or by starting shooting, but not by pressing the ‚ÄúA‚Äù button.  If you wanted to attack a moving target, then you had to seriously sweat, ‚Äúcatching‚Äù it with the cursor. <br>  Missing by the enemy, it was possible to hit the wall and write off a certain amount of health points from it. <br>  If you delve into the resources of the game, you can find images of Vault-Boy, illustrating the advantages and disadvantages, elements of the role-playing system GURPS, on which it was planned to establish Fallout. <br>  While playing in the character editor, you could see the differences in the role-playing system.  For example, the Small Frame trait gave +2 Dexterity, and Finesse increased the chance of a critical hit by as much as 20%!  The procedure was calculated by the formula PE + AG, the Night Person Trait increased it by 5. <br>  There was no weight limit. <br>  Stimpacks have always recovered 12 HP. <br>  You could play Fallout on a computer in the Crypts lair, getting 100 experience points for it. <br>  In PipBoy, two missions are marked, Scout out the Crypts for the Fools and Stop the Gangs from attacking Adytum.  The second entry is simply amazing, and it appeared at the start of the gang war. <br>  After the start of the battle (but before the first shot), it was possible to have time to talk to Lex and call him a coward.  He joined the player, although he never took part in the fights. <br>  In the accompanying "user manual" featured 15 locations (in the full version there are only 12).  Judging by the Fallout Bible, the missing 3 cards are the carved out camps of raiders (Vipers and Jackals) and Burrows (a village of sensible raccoons). <br><br>  PS In order for the demo version of Fallout to work normally under Windows XP, do not forget to enable the compatibility mode with Windows 98 in the properties of the executable file. <br><br>  I sit now I remember the old days, the main thing is that the story is new and interesting, though short ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19641/</a></p>
