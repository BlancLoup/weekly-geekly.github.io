Rollbar</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0cc/bef/d76/0ccbefd76ab0eddbb202d05fb3f0b469.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboard Rollbar</i> <br><br>  They write on their site "Catch mistakes <s>if you can</s> while users have not done it for you."  Well, let's try.  Rollbar provides cloud service and is able to work with several programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãdue to the implantation of its SDK in a controlled application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hy/-b/nn/hy-bnnrnyju0als7yw7dj3xrmvc.png"><br>  <i>Rollbar code implantation</i> <br><br>  On dashboard groups errors, shows the total amount.  Not supercosmic techology, but allows you to see errors from the entire stack of the application.  For some reason on the site, they <a href="https://rollbar.com/vs/new-relic/">compare themselves with New Relic</a> .  I understand that the appointment is similar, but why comparisons for Appdynamics or Dynatrace are not made are a mystery. <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  Not a lot, but not a little: JavaScript, Angular, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Django, PHP, Clojure, .NET, Android, iOS, Haskell, Drupal, Rails and others. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  Standard type set: <br><br>  - disable or hide certain monitoring objects that you know about; <br>  - determine the degree of severity of each error and receive a notification if the error persists; <br>  - send any event to a team member that needs to be resolved in order to keep the dashboards pristine. <br><br>  And there is also an interesting feature - the delivery of ready-made parameters for the repetition of a transaction through curl. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b68/34c/a8a/b6834ca8a484ced4a5c328a659be20b4.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Query parameters through curl</i> <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  Datadog </li><li>  Flowdock </li><li>  Github </li><li>  Help Scout </li><li>  Logentries </li><li>  Logstash </li><li>  Mailgun </li><li>  Pagerduty </li><li>  Slack </li><li>  Trello </li><li>  Webhooks </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  Free up to 5,000 events per month, up to 100,000 events $ 41, up to 500,000 events $ 124.  A complete list of prices can be found <a href="https://rollbar.com/pricing/">on the vendor's website</a> . <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://raygun.com/">2. Raygun</a> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf1/117/730/cf1117730944d5634769099b56647b87.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboard Pulse</i> <br><br>  Raygun offers 2 cloud services: Real User Monitoring (aka Pulse) and Crash Reporting.  Pulse monitors user sessions and detects performance problems, for each of which you can configure an alert.  It has a separate dashboard that informs you about the load time of pages from specific countries, browsers and devices. <br><br>  Crash Reporting monitors the operation of the application itself and displays diagnostic reports and other related data on the dashboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc7/509/45d/bc750945d92f7f9048eb00e84fc383c6.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboard Crash Reporting</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  .NET, Android, Drupal, Go, iOS, JavaScript, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Unity and others. <br><br>  Just in case, if you suddenly did not notice the absence of Java in this list (which does not support any bad tone today): in order to trace Java, add the Raygun4Java library to the application.  This allows you to send exceptions directly to Raygun dashboards.  If anything, the Raygun documentation has a description of how this is done. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  Raygun is able to group multiple errors.  On the dashboard, you can tag the error groups or their instances for later reporting. <br><br>  In each group of errors, team members can see status updates, comments, and other information, and the number of users affected by each error is shown on the dashboard. <br><br>  There is a full-text search option that helps you quickly find the right error.  Well, where to without the support of webhooks and sending notifications to third-party alert systems. <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  Asana </li><li>  Assembla </li><li>  Bitbucket </li><li>  Campfire </li><li>  HipChat </li><li>  Intercom </li><li>  Jira </li><li>  Pagerduty </li><li>  Slack </li><li>  Trello </li><li>  Webhooks </li><li>  Zendesk </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  Raygun sells Pulse and Crash Reporting as 2 different services, for which you have to pay separately.  For unlimited version you can buy both at once. <br><br>  The price for Pulse starts at $ 99 / month for 100,000 user sessions per month.  The next tariff plan is $ 198 / month for 200,000 sessions, and for 500,000 sessions, they ask for $ 495 / month. <br><br>  The price of Crash Reporting starts at $ 49 / month for 25,000 errors and from a maximum of 5 applications.  For $ 149 / month, it is allowed to process 250,000 errors from a maximum of 20 applications, and for $ 499 / month 3,000,000 errors from 50 applications. <br><br>  Well, there is a superfood enterprise fare for both services, which starts at $ 999 / month for an unlimited number of sessions and events. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://sentry.io/">3. Sentry</a> </h2><br>  I found several articles about this thing on Habr√©, even Navalny‚Äôs headquarters <a href="https://habr.com/company/fbk/blog/347320/">used it for his Reaper</a> .  Sentry began as a small piece of code that has become a full-scale error monitoring tool, catching and debugging errors in the sale.  You can install it or use the cloud version. <br><br>  In the dashboard, you can see the trace of the call stack, determine the URL of each error, parameters and information about the session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62e/40c/ffb/62e40cffb32c6f7d92b99eab3135e7c2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sentry Dashboard</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, C #, Objective-C, and even Swift. <br><br>  Raven is a Java client for Sentry, it uses popular logging libraries to collect and convert log files.  The library takes this information and sends the data to Sentry. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  Errors are captured in real time, each error includes information about the runtime environment and user data.  If the user experience is the key source of data for diagnosing errors, Sentry can request feedback from users every time they encounter errors. <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  HipChat </li><li>  Github </li><li>  Slack </li><li>  Trello </li><li>  Heroku </li><li>  Campfire </li><li>  Jira </li><li>  Pagerduty </li><li>  Gitlab </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  For use on their facilities - free then.  For commercial use in the cloud, the price hovers around $ 26‚Äì $ 449 / month for a limit of 1 million events per day.  To assess the number of events there is a 14-day trial. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.overops.com/">4. OverOps</a> </h2><br>  OverOps helps developers understand when, where, and why code breaks.  It fixes exceptions and errors, and this is also the <u>only solution</u> (I have not met another one like this), showing the state of the variable that caused it, through methods and machines.  If you want to learn about the product a little more - <a href="https://habr.com/company/jetinfosystems/blog/314874/">on Habr√©, I once wrote about him</a> .  Of the installation options: on-premise, hybrid (database in analytics in the cloud), SaaS - there are plenty to choose from. <br><br>  With OverOps, you get an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe actual code that was running when the exception or error occurred.  An interesting tool for finding, analyzing and correcting errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c64/e06/223/c64e06223745973715abb8ab60cff5db.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>OverOps error analysis screen</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  OverOps supports all JVM languages: Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy. <br><br>  The OverOps agent is installed in just a few commands in the console.  It works as a Java agent, so there is no need for changes to the code or assembly, you need to attach this Java agent to your JVM. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  For those who prefer to view the logs every time an error occurs, the tool inserts a direct link to the dashboards in OverOps with this particular error in the log.  Directly from the log, after clicking on the link, you can see the source code with a trace of the call stack and the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the variables that caused the error.  In conjunction with Splunk or ELK it will be convenient to use it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ftime_continue%3D12%26v%3DeF4vv3Nf8vY">see the minute vidos on YouTube</a> . <br><br>  From the dashboard, you can configure alerts based on the error rate, filter errors by application, code location, time, etc. <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  Jira </li><li>  Slack </li><li>  HipChat </li><li>  Pagerduty </li><li>  Graphite </li><li>  Grafana </li><li>  Nagios </li><li>  Zabbix </li><li>  New relic </li><li>  AppDynamics </li><li>  Datodog </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  The free version is only in the form of a trial.  They did not post prices on the site, if anyone needs it - contact me, I can find out the price. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://airbrake.io/">5. Airbrake</a> </h2><br>  Airbrake is a tool for collecting and tracking exceptions and errors in an application.  Each error includes the environment in which it occurred when it was first discovered, the type of error, and other details.  Embedded in the application in the form of SDK.  The service works from the cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/819/d99/e9f/819d99e9fd2623282137770d022b8d67.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboard Airbrake</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  Ruby, PHP, JavaScript, .NET, Python, Django, Node.js, iOS, Swift, Android, Go, Angular, Flask and others. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  Airbrake shows the stack trace and metadata for each error, groups them by type, users, and environment variables. <br><br>  There is a dashboard that shows when each error first occurred, in order to understand whether this error occurred after the release was rolled in or before it.  Mistakes can be attached to team members so that it is clear who is responsible for correcting them. <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  Assembla </li><li>  Bitbucket </li><li>  Campfire </li><li>  Flowdock </li><li>  Github </li><li>  Gitlab </li><li>  HipChat </li><li>  Jira </li><li>  Lighthouse </li><li>  Pivotal tracker </li><li>  Slack </li><li>  Trello </li><li>  Webhooks </li><li>  Zapier </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  They give a 30-day trials, but they ask for data in return.  IMHO, for the test fit. <br><br>  The tool is rated by the number of events.  The lowest tariff plan costs $ 59 / month and includes 10,000 errors per month in 5 applications.  Over 300,000 errors per month and an unlimited number of applications will be asked for $ 129 / month, and finally, 1 million errors per month and an unlimited number of applications cost $ 299 / month. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.bugsnag.com/">6. Bugsnag</a> </h2><br>  Bugsnag keeps track of errors and exceptions within the application and try to determine the root cause and evaluate the impact on the user.  Artificial intelligence in action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/808/dff/531/808dff531f082eb3bc1f9ddf7e87eadb.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboard bugsnag</i> <br><br>  The toolbar provides an overview of all errors with the ability to filter unresolved.  It groups errors that have a similar origin in the code, and helps to visualize and compare various error trends over time with graphs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e03/54f/4b2/e0354f4b2b4aace344a499432e70cc83.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Dashboards with an index of performance for each release</i> <br><br>  Embedded in the application in the form of SDK, works as a service from the cloud.  Bugsnag to a Java application can be added using Gradle, Maven or manually.  It is also possible to add an SDK using the Spring and Spring boot. <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  Android, Go, iOS, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, Ruby, Unity. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  On dashboards, you can hide errors as long as they do not meet the conditions you define or turn off the sound when errors occur, if they are not important.  Each error contains data on the number of affected users and how many times this has happened. <br><br>  The error status menu provides additional information: shows the progress of the errors, the activity feed shows the progress of changes of each error over time. <br><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  The free plan supports up to 7500 errors per month for one user.  The tariff plan for the team starts at $ 29 / month and comes to $ 59 / month for 150,000 errors per day for 5 team members.  To find out the conditions of an unlimited corporate tariff plan, you need to contact them. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://stackhunter.com/">7. StackHunter</a> </h2><br>  Stackhunter can extract data from Log4J and Logback.  Each error includes a stack trace, HTTP request, JVM properties, JMX attributes and when and where this happened for the first time.  StackHunter keeps track of uncaught exceptions, as well as errors logged in Log4J and Logback.  Installed on your server. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f1/2af/900/4f12af90061ce8090c890d336f6360ae.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>StackHunter Dashboard</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  This is a tool specifically designed to catch Java exceptions.  It supports JDK 6 or higher and requires Servlet 2.5 or higher.  Installation is simple: you need to deploy instackhunter.war on a web server. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  StackHunter tracks exceptions by connecting to Log4J and Logback.  The tool offers one web interface where you can view all exceptions. <br><br>  On the dashboard, you can see all application exceptions, filter out unique exceptions, or see which ones affected users or their sessions.  Similar exceptions are grouped together. <br><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  There is a 30-day trial period.  Prices are asked to request them directly.  If you need help with prices - please contact. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.vbatelemetry.com/">8. VBAtelemetry</a> </h2><br>  Although it is not productive applications, but for personal tasks in the field of macro debugging in MS Excel, it was impossible not to mention this useful piece.  Works in conjunction with Azure Insights.  Helps to catch macro execution errors and monitor their performance.  VBAtelemetry can be used for free, because both Azure itself and Azure have corresponding free tariff plans.  To work requires the installation of a small agent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/057/152/2d0/0571522d036701b704e4881cd5c97cd0.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Insert key in macro code</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/224/a22/5aa/224a225aa92df5f362a3173d1d46977c.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Macro performance in Azure Insights</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  Oddly enough, but only VBA. <br><br><h3>  Opportunities </h3><br>  The capabilities of the tool can be listed in three functions: <br>  <b>TrackPageView.</b>  Control over the forms and tables that the user opens. <br>  <b>TrackEvent.</b>  The function that determines the data on which events need to be sent to Azure Insights. <br>  <b>TrackError.</b>  Function to send code execution errors to Insights. <br>  <b>TrackMetric.</b>  Function to monitor performance.  Measures the execution time of the code. <br><br>  Integration: <br><br><ul><li>  Azure insights </li></ul><br><h3>  Prices </h3><br>  You can use it for free, but a pop-up window will pop up.  You can pay $ 39 for the key and forget about it.  If you buy from 20 keys, they give a discount of 50%.  The required number of keys depends on how many instances of Azure Application Insights you will use.  If one - you need only one key. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://getappenlight.com/">9. Appenlight</a> </h2><br>  Open-source and free.  The tool tracks the executable code.  Work requires the introduction of a lightweight SDK.  The application server itself comes in the form of an OVA image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f97/c80/f82/f97c80f82a2a98c2eba4889897ca212f.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>Interface appenlight</i> <br><br><h3>  What programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported </h3><br>  Python, JavaScript, NodeJS, PHP, Ruby and others.
