  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Logitech Performance Mouse MX Mouse Review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/100/685/6d2/1006856d200c1342920ff5054a5741e9.jpg"><br>  Hello, Habravchane! <br>  This review was born from my response to the request of a habrauser to advise a good mouse.  When I clicked the ‚Äúpublish‚Äù button, I found that instead of a simple recommendation, I rivet information on the whole review I want to share with everyone. <br><br>  About a year and a half ago, after several unsuccessful mice, I decided to strain myself, and choose a mouse that would be pleasant and convenient to use for a long time for my basic needs.  Namely: browsing, 3D shooters and Photoshop.  I‚Äôll just make a reservation: I‚Äôm not an avid gamer, and I don‚Äôt make money by design, so I can‚Äôt talk about a very narrow circle of the pointing devices designed specifically for this purpose.  But I love to shoot from the machine, photoshoshit photos, and sit on Habr√©.  Besides, I'm a very picky person. <br><br>  It was decided to delve into the market of mice on the Internet, go around all the shops and touch all the models in order not only to read, but also to know how they lie in hand.  For the sake of interest, I searched in all price and thematic categories in order to make an informed choice based on the best price / quality ratio.  Unfortunately, my touchscreen doesn‚Äôt hit the touch mouse, because  at that time, they were just beginning to be sold in my country, and they were worth as an inexpensive netbook.

      Requirements: <br><ul><li>  High accuracy (good laser + correct weight + good glide) </li><li>  No wire </li><li>  The ergonomics of the case, but without special rocket-science forms and other garbage, to which you need to get used.  Just to take in hand - and immediately convenient </li><li>  Pleasant to the touch material, and that the palm does not sweat with prolonged use </li><li>  Several <i>conveniently located</i> additional thumb buttons </li><li>  Customizable buttons for different applications </li></ul><br>  Wishes: <br><ul><li>  Beautiful design </li><li>  Rechargeable (I do not like to change batteries) </li><li>  A wheel that is not only spinning, but also pressed left / right (there is nothing more convenient for browsing tabs in the browser, and Copy / Paste in a text editor) </li><li>  Charge indicator on the mouse itself </li><li>  The ability to <i>easily</i> change the DPI setting for increased sensitivity, and vice versa (convenient for some actions in Photoshop, and in shooters for a sniper shot) </li></ul><br><br>  Won <a href="http://logitech.com/mice-pointers/mice/devices/5845">Logitech Perfomance Mouse MX</a> .  Besides the fact that she meets all my requirements and (!) Wishes, she also has a series of nice bonuses: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Works great <i>on any</i> surface (glossy / matte / denim / sofa / thick glass / ...) </li><li>  It has a small mechanical button under the wheel, by clicking on which the wheel stops ‚Äúclicking‚Äù, and turns at a given speed on inertia, like a bearing (which is very convenient for Lepre and other sites with a length of 100,500 comments) </li><li>  A battery is simply one rechargeable NiMH AA battery, i.e.  it (her) can be easily and cheaply replaced with a new or more capacious one, if such a need arises </li><li>  After the battery critical signal is given, you can use the mouse for at least another day. </li><li>  The mouse can be used even when the battery is dead.  A microUSB cable is simply stuck in front and the mouse temporarily becomes wired. </li><li>  The attentive reader has already singled out for himself this point from the previous one: charging on MicroUSB. </li></ul><br><br>  Full charge lasts about one week.  I don‚Äôt know if this is bad or good for a <i>laser</i> mouse, but you have the opportunity to insert any AA battery to your taste.  Maybe some super mega-durasel-ultra will work for a month, I have not tried. <br><br>  Of the minuses: <br><ul><li>  Actions for all buttons (except left and right) are configured in SetPoint, but application-specific actions can only be hung on Back / Forward and Scroll Left / Right </li><li>  The first couple of weeks, instead of pressing the middle button (wheel), you can involuntarily perform the scroll left / right action with the same wheel.  After a while, you will get the hang of it, and you will press everything ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù, but, nevertheless, this is not a very pleasant moment. </li><li>  There is no dock for recharging, where the mouse would be proudly placed at night. </li></ul><br><br>  Despite the drawbacks, I must say that I haven‚Äôt had anything more convenient.  I have already had a mouse for a year and a half, and in excellent condition - the case did not loosen, the plastic did not darken and peeled off. <br>  Moreover, despite the fact that this is not the newest model of Logitech, this mouse is still relevant, and continues to be the flagship of the Logitech series of mice, and, in my opinion, the most competitive product relative to the latest models from other manufacturers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143427/</a></p>
