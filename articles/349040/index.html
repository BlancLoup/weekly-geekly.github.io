      If you want to become a web developer, then beware of the following. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Scattering attention </h2><br>  You will get a lot of advice from senior developers.  They will tell you which languages ‚Äã‚Äãto learn in the first place, what skills will be useful to you, and without what tools you will <i>definitely</i> not do.  And their reliable recommendations will completely contradict what you heard yesterday. <br><br>  Do not get lost in the wilderness of good advice. <br><br>  If you change programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand text editors every month and jump from one source of information to another - STOP!  You just walk in circles. <br><br>  The choice of language and development tools at this point seems important, but in reality these are details.  Any popular programming language will suit you.  What is important is the sequence. <br><br>  Choose one language and learn it so well that you can write a book.  Select one source of information and explore it inside and out.  Download the simplest text editor you can find and learn. <br><br>  Whatever you choose, do not spray on a bunch of different technologies. <br><br><h2>  Here, only imposters </h2><br>  At times it will seem to you that you are not created for this work. <br><br>  The impostor syndrome is the weakness of the developers. <br><br>  Anything can call it.  Oblique glance of the guy with mitap who <i>cannot believe</i> that you do not know what polymorphism is.  Unfinished application, for which you should start - and it falls.  Maybe your twitter is proud of your cool projects.  Anything can knock out a rut. <br><br>  The first step in overcoming the impostor syndrome is acknowledging the problem.  Bonus - if you tell this to a fellow developer.  Something wonderful will happen.  He is likely to exclaim: "I thought I was so alone!" <br><br>  Another way to get rid of doubt is proof.  Record your failures and achievements.  There is nothing better than to look back and understand: ‚ÄúHey!  That thing I tormented over three months ago is easier than the lung! ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  There is safety in numbers </h2><br>  Technical skills - only one ingredient in the recipe for a successful developer career.  The rest is good luck, coffee and other people. <br><br>  Developers often believe that they cannot find work, as they lack experience.  In fact, they should pay attention to job search skills. <br>  Imagine two developers who are simultaneously starting to look for work, they are from the same city and with the same experience. <br><br>  Developer ‚ÄúA‚Äù is a prodigy.  She began to study programming at 10 years old and fixes bugs with a glance.  She makes a summary and sends out hundreds of sites. <br><br>  Developer "B" - newbie.  Promising, but started programming not so long ago.  She also draws up a resume and receives an invitation for an interview at the meeting where she came during the week.  She tells everyone she is looking for work and wants to talk to someone who is developing. <br>  Who will get the job first? <br><br>  I put on "B". <br><br>  Developer "A" may be a ninja code, but it means nothing if nobody knows about it.  Her resume, along with 1000 others, will filter the algorithm and never read it. <br><br>  Developer B, on the other hand, has a whole army of those who are looking for work for her.  She accidentally spoke with someone whose brother, cousin or best friend works in a company with open vacancies.  This man handed her resume, which was approved, and she received an invitation for an interview. <br><br>  Her brother / cousin / best friend will give her advice on how best to prepare for the interview, the interviewer and the personnel manager will also know that she has personal recommendations.  She is halfway to getting a job before the interview begins. <br><br><h2>  Crossing the finish line </h2><br>  Self-taught developers are often not sure when to start a job search.  It is very difficult to self-assess your level.  No manual "What should know junior." <br><br>  How to make employers take you seriously? <br><blockquote>  Here is the secret: they want to hire you when you can convince the employer of this. </blockquote>  It sounds obvious, but think what it really means.  This means that even without knowing anything about programming, you can get a job because you liked the employer.  And it also means that you will be overlooked, even if you are a walking encyclopedia. <br><br>  Separate technical skills and ability to hire. <br><blockquote>  One does not affect the other, but the connection is not as linear as one might think.  You are judged not by your <b><i>actual</i></b> skills, but by your own <b><i>perception</i></b> of your skills. </blockquote>  The first impression, based on your self-confidence, affects further communication.  If you exude confidence, the interviewer will assume that you know what you are talking about.  If you are not confident in yourself, then you will assume the opposite. <br><br>  The good news is that confidence can be developed.  Every time you leave the comfort zone, you realize that you underestimated yourself.  Your ego will notice it.  Do this constantly and confidence will appear on its own. <br><br>  The most important thing is to take into account the influence of negative and positive internal dialogue.  They can affect everything - from when you start a job search to how much you will receive. <br><br>  So are you ready for a job search?  You are ready exactly from the moment when you have confidence in it. <br><br>  CDR: Reddit.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2wrxyt/a_python_programmer_attempting_java/">Python programmer attempting java</a> . <br><cut></cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349040/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349040/</a></p>
