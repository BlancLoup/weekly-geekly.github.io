Android Development: Architecture Development</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/334510/">Introduction (with links to all articles)</a> <br><br>  In the water article I already wrote that the planned client for the project should be the Android client: accessible to a large audience, light, functional, beautiful, fast (not an app, but a dream!).  If everything is clear with the grounds for choosing a platform, then how to implement all the listed requirements on the basis of it - it was clear that not everything was clear. <br><br>  Previously, the development of Android was not engaged, therefore, quite valuable sources of information for me were:

    <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/android-programming/">The book "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide"</a> (acquaintance with the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/335146">translation from the publishing house "Peter"</a> confirmed the previously existing principle: "you can read the original - read the original"); </li><li>  <a href="https://developer.android.com/">Google Website for Android;</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920029397.do">The book "Efficient Android Threading" by O'Reilly;</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5EvxWifIgro%26list%3DPLQC2_0cDcSKBNCR8UWeElzCUuFkXASduz">Video from the Yandex Mobilization project.</a> </li></ul><br>  After studying the specified sources of questions with architecture of Android and interaction of their components did not remain.  However, one important question remains: what will be the structure of the application itself?  A couple of examples and prototypes showed that with the growth of the functional, everything quickly began to turn into a "noodle": <br><br><ul><li>  The logic of working with Android objects (Activity, Preferences, TextView ....) Was mixed with business logic; </li><li>  Storage objects figured in the interface building code; </li><li>  Unit testing turned into hell because of the need to work with native Android objects and replace them with <a href="http://robolectric.org/">Robolectric</a> instances; </li><li>  Verification of the asynchronous code was possible only on the device or the emulator (on the principle: ‚Äúlaunched-checked-repeated‚Äù). </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It became clear that you need to take a step back and look around: Android is not the first year, there are people who have been developing code for a long time under this platform, there are large developing projects - respectively, there is where to get information about well-established practices. <br><br>  The main criteria for finding a good architecture for an Android application were: <br><br><ul><li>  easy testability of the developed code and its components - easily tested code is easy to develop and change without fear of creating a bug or ‚Äúdumping‚Äù the application; </li><li>  weak connectivity of components, in which parts of an application / components can be developed by different developers without the need for super-intensive interaction (at least for a while). </li></ul><br>  The search led me to an interesting video on YouTube: <a href="https://youtu.be/AlxMGxs2QnM">‚ÄúWe are writing a test code‚Äù</a> (recording a speech by Evgeny Matsyuk (a) from the Mobius mobile development conference) (there was A LOT OF IT!), Which described what I needed.  For implementation, it was necessary to explore some additional resources and tools: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">The original article "The Clean Architecture"</a> , it is necessary to note the presence of a good explanatory <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobileup/blog/335382/">article on Habr'e "Misconceptions Clean Architecture"</a> ; </li><li>  Fernando Cejas blog with articles <a href="https://fernandocejas.com/2014/09/03/architecting-android-the-clean-way/">‚ÄúArchitecting Android ... The clean way?‚Äù</a> And <a href="https://fernandocejas.com/2015/07/18/architecting-android-the-evolution/">‚ÄúArchitecting Android ... The evolution‚Äù</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://google.github.io/dagger/">Dagger 2</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a> . </li></ul><br>  The development of a prototype with these practices together with the study of RxJava took a lot of time, but after some time the first prototype was ready.  A distinctive feature of it was the terrible number of created interfaces and classes when adding new screens: 3 interfaces and 3 classes (Activity / Fragment and its interface, Presenter and its interface, Interactor and its interface) - a classic example of overengineering.  Formally, nothing has changed to the current moment, but I suppose this is the other side of the benefits.  But on the output we get an easily tested application with a weakly related structure. <br><br><h3>  Implementation </h3><br>  I will cite the components of Clean Architecture for refreshment in my memory from the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobileup/blog/335382/">article on the Habr ‚ÄúDelusion of Clean Architecture‚Äù</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-k/kt/hx/-kkthxtngkxey7pkrri_j1mkwkm.png" alt="image"><br>  Each Android component and element of the selected architecture is presented in the following table: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Class</b> </td><td>  <b>Level</b> </td><td>  <b>Implemented Interfaces</b> </td><td>  <b>Purpose</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Implement Activity / Fragment (XXXX_Activity / XXXX_Fragment) </td><td>  Ui </td><td>  I_XXXX_View </td><td>  Actual implementation of the action with Android elements: changing properties, getting callbacks, starting services, working with the Android API </td></tr><tr><td>  XXXX_PresenterImpl </td><td>  Ui </td><td>  I_XXXX_Presenter </td><td>  View Level Coordination, View Logic - I_XXXX_View, I_XXXX_Interactor Interface Method Calls </td></tr><tr><td>  XXXX_InteractorImpl </td><td>  Business / Use Cases </td><td>  I_XXXX_Interactor </td><td>  Implementing the core logic of the application, calling the methods of the I_XXXX_Repository interfaces </td></tr><tr><td>  XXXX_RepositoryImpl </td><td>  Data / Repository </td><td>  I_XXXX_Repository </td><td>  Realization of direct interaction with data sources, external API, Android network and database, ContentProviders, etc. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><h3>  Organization of interaction </h3><br>  The interaction of components and data transfer is organized taking into account the fact that a user of any Android application receives more data than it enters.  Respectively: <br><br><ul><li>  signaling to deeper layers goes through normal synchronous calls (press the / scroll / enter data button -&gt; call the method); </li><li>  receiving data from the lower layers is organized through asynchronous Rx-streams (received a call -&gt; sent data with the results); </li><li>  synchronized data retrieval is minimized (most in initialization code and in other auxiliary and rare screens). </li></ul><br><h3>  Package Organization </h3><br>  In the original article, Fernando Cejas proposed 2 options for organizing ‚Äúby levels‚Äù and ‚Äúby functionality‚Äù; I developed a combined approach for myself: <br><br><ul><li>  First by level (ui, data, business) </li><li>  In ‚Äúui‚Äù on the main screens ‚Äúnews_watcher‚Äù, ‚Äúnews_tape‚Äù, etc. </li><li>  In "data" and "business" - on the main entities "news_header", "news_article", etc. </li></ul><br>  An interesting feature was that the number of Interactors became equal to the ‚Äúnumber of main screens‚Äù + ‚Äúnumber of entities‚Äù: there are often situations when you need to organize clever data acquisition (for example, with a combination from different sources) and copy this code into every interactor where he needed was completely reluctant.  In this case, taking into account the fact that Interactor is used in a single copy - they can store a certain state important for the execution of the method, I implemented it as follows: Interactors of screens, turn to Interactors of entities for corresponding methods (which leads to the appearance of delegating methods in Interactor screens <br><br><h3>  Initialization </h3><br><ul><li>  <b>Activity / Fragment:</b> <br><ol><li>  Android is being created (non-singletone, w / scope) </li><li>  initialized in View methods # onCreate () (with completion in Fragment # onViewCreated () for Fragment) </li><li>  Presenter inside is assigned to the c / o Dagger2 </li><li>  Presenter initialization inside is performed in the specified methods (View # onCreate (), with completion in Fragment # onViewCreated () for Fragment) </li></ol></li><li>  <b>Presenter:</b> <br><ol><li>  created via Dagger2 (non-singletone, w / scope) </li><li>  View is assigned by View itself, via Presenter # bindView () </li><li>  initialized in the method Presenter # initializePresenter (), called View (because initialization must be done at the right moment, after initializing View) </li><li>  Interactor inside is assigned / initialized by c / s Dagger2 </li><li>  Interactor-&gt; Presenter communication is created in the Presenter # initializePresenter () method (another Interactor method for Rx initialization) </li></ol></li><li>  <b>Interactor:</b> <br><ol><li>  created through Dagger2 (singletone, w / o scope) </li><li>  initialized through Dagger2 (Interactor # initializeInteractor) </li><li>  The repository is assigned / initialized internally by the Dagger2. </li></ol></li><li>  <b>Repository:</b> <br><ol><li>  created through Dagger2 (singletone, w / o scope) </li><li>  initialized through Dagger2 (Repository # initializeRepository) </li></ol></li></ul><br><h3>  Testing Approaches </h3><br>  In terms of testing, nothing revolutionary: <br><br><ul><li>  UI level - JUnit + Mockito + Robolectric </li><li>  Business Level - JUnit + Mockito </li><li>  Data Level - JUnit + Mockito </li></ul><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343446/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343446/</a></p>
