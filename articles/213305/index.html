  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Galaxy Win Duos: what is a middle class smartphone from a market leader?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I will not hide: I am primarily interested in unusual for our latitudes gadgets, like the same <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/211248/">Moto G.</a>  However, it is sometimes useful to look at something noticeably more poppy, on what the shelves of Russian stores are full of.  Why?  Because the people on the whole will not buy Moto G (and will not even know about its existence), it goes to the shops and sweeps Samsung devices from the shelves.  The people have many options: the Korean manufacturer has released a huge amount of relatively inexpensive (that is, not over 20+ thousand rubles) smartphones that look almost the same and have a similar set of functions.  Who wants a big screen - takes one model, who appreciates compactness - another ... In general, sometimes it seems to me that Samsung has a kind of virtual designer: one engineer is responsible for stretching and narrowing the case, the other ‚Äústretches‚Äù the camera resolution, the third is the screen resolution and the display itself ... As a result, dozens of products fly out of this ‚Äúsecret KB‚Äù, the differences between them (and they are usually small) are very difficult to understand and which give a very similar user experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfa/804/6d9/dfa8046d9447b379d0896b8c6a4bb416.jpg"><br>  A couple of weeks ago, the Samsung Galaxy Win Duos got into my grabber - just a middle-class smartphone, the main feature of which I would call a rather large screen: its diagonal is 4.7 inches.  For the reasons stated above, I do not dare to argue exactly how it differs from its counterparts in the Samsung line, but I‚Äôll just tell you about my impressions of this product. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The first thing that catches your eye is the dimensions: some kind of it is so wide, this smartphone, surround.  For some reason I immediately called him to myself ‚Äúa penguin‚Äù (in rhyme with the Galaxy Win).  The same Galaxy S4 is about 3 mm longer, already 2 and thinner too by 2. But I‚Äôll remind you, it‚Äôs 5-inch ... Yes, in the case of low-cost devices, developers have to use completely different materials, different design methods, and therefore the output state employees are often larger than flagships with a similar and larger diagonal.  Nevertheless, I don‚Äôt really blame the Galaxy Win: it fits into my hand quite well, the typical Samsung back panel plastic is pleasant to the touch (and it‚Äôs less dirty than SGS4), the device is traditionally perfectly assembled.  The frame for the metal framing the front panel, the silver edging of the hardware button under the screen and the silver speaker slots visually ‚Äúincrease the price‚Äù of the smartphone, this is a fact.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2e2/c44/70a/2e2c4470af3f6aeae7dc1adccb6654ef.jpg"><br><br>  But the location of the power button on the screen upset.  It is located closer to the center of the right side, that is, not at all under the thumb of the right hand, and you have to reach for it.  Below is a comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S4, in which this key is located much more correctly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c59/25d/e45/c5925de45f4089d2c70de027d7ab88db.jpg"><br>  Bottom Galaxy S4, top Galaxy Win Duos <br><br>  The touch buttons below the screen glow white, and in the off state they are almost invisible.  By default, the settings are set to automatically turn off the backlight after a couple of seconds, which is confusing.  Look at the panel, there seems to be a button, but it is not.  You press - immediately lights up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c65/c2d/1e3/c65c2d1e3c5156406a10762c453d3c46.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c5/904/fab/4c5904fab6ac7b0adca4c617d2ac1c12.jpg"><br><br>  However, the situation can be changed in the settings.  I think this is such an attempt to gain a fraction of a percent in favor of reducing energy consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94d/36b/0ff/94d36b0ff5323651c5d1efd91abdcb9b.jpg"><br><br>  Under the battery cover there is actually a battery, as well as a pair of spaced SIM slots (both microSIM format) and a memory card slot.  Immediately tell about all this farm.  The battery in the Samsung Galaxy Win Duos has a capacity of 2,000 mAh.  For two days the device is able to withstand, if you talk for an hour and a half a day, not to play games and not watch videos, without denying yourself the charms of mobile Internet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ba/bf7/6fa/4babf76fab87647718ee2a972343c793.jpg"><br><br>  MicroSD card with a capacity of 64 GB smartphone recognized  Hot swap is supported. <br><br>  <u>With "Sims" everything is interesting</u> .  Firstly, unlike many ‚Äúdvuhsimochnikov‚Äù on the platforms of the company MediaTek (and Qualcomm, however, too), there is no separation of slots into ‚Äú2G / 3G‚Äù and ‚Äúonly 2G‚Äù.  Any of the cards can be made to work in third-generation networks, although in parallel both of them cannot function in 3G mode, only in turns. <br><br>  Secondly, in Samsung Galaxy Win Duos, as well as in many Korean-made devices, is implemented, we will say, the ‚Äúvirtual mode‚Äù Dual Sim Dual Active.  That is, the radio module is one, but using software from one card to another, you can configure forwarding.  The same can be done on any smart, except that it will take a little longer.  In short, in the case of Galaxy WinDuos, talking on one number, you can find out that they are calling you on the second.  And the caller to the second number will hear a phrase like ‚Äúthe subscriber is talking.‚Äù  True, before that, in most cases, he will listen for 10-15 seconds to silence.  In general, this is not a real two radio modules, as in the HTC One Dual SIM, but a ‚Äúcrutch‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de9/84e/903/de984e9034b7bee4349e381c2f5feb5c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/65c/5cc/d37/65c5ccd373f39a4d51a7b1e1b3829d2d.jpg"><br><br>  The Samsung Galaxy Win Duos uses the well-known Qualcomm MSM8225Q Snapdragon S4 Play chipset.  Recall, it includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS modules, 4 ARM Cortex-A5 computing cores with a peak frequency of 1.2 GHz and an Adreno 203 graphics accelerator. All this is complemented by 1 GB of RAM, from which something is usually available 250-300.  There is no LTE, GLONASS, NFC, MHL / HDMI (not really, and I really wanted to, honestly).  \ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bb/d40/502/6bbd40502530cc548f9cf87fc45dffaa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/909/19c/1d1/90919c1d1b8f2052aa10fa23b6986ee0.jpg"><br><br>  <u>The device</u> seems to be <u>working</u> smartly - as far as the interface is concerned.  The video in Full HD1080p he pulls very, very weak.  I inserted a memory card with 1080p recordings from an iON Air Pro Wi-Fi extreme camera into Galaxy Win Duos, and a regular player, which Samsung devices are famous for their omnivorousness, but the smartphone could not reproduce anything.  Put MX Player - also nothing: the sound goes, and the screen is black.  I specified hardware decoding in the settings, and only after that the videos were able to play.  But with brakes ... So for Samsung Galaxy Win, the limit of possibilities is at the level of the HD720p, and even lower is even better. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e86/2ce/70a/e862ce70abd7e5494564494a79eb9992.jpg"><br>  Attempting to play Full HD video from an iON camera in a regular player ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/340/ba2/ba6/340ba2ba610402db89bdbf434a2970e1.jpg"><br>  ... in MX Player, the videos still started, but with brakes <br><br>  <u>Everything is also complicated with games</u> : the same Asphalt 8 in Google Play is simply not a search.  Why, why, it is not clear: on the Highscreen Omega Prime Mini, in which Qualcomm MSM8225Q Snapdragon S4 Play and 1 GB of RAM also stand, this game is located and runs without problems. <br><br>  Sorry, in general.  Given the fact that the "Penguin" is a <u>very good screen.</u>  Yes, the diagonal of 4.7 inches and the resolution of 800 x 480 dots "fit" together not in the best way, but it is clear that Samsung ate the dog on the screens, and not just one.  The image does not seem grainy, the viewing angles are quite wide, and the picture is very pleasant in color.  It seems to be a little faded, which, in my personal opinion, is just fine when watching a video.  I remember once the similar image I saw on the display of the very first Sony PSP (‚Äúbbw‚Äù).  It was used by many at that time as a portable video player. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/7a5/c4e/5e67a5c4eabc60b541b7a418a1685954.jpg"><br><br>  As for the screen technology, I can‚Äôt say anything specific: Samsung calls it ‚Äújust TFT‚Äù.  The display cover is apparently glass, but the origin of this glass itself is also not indicated;  so, apparently, about Gorilla Glass is no question.  Oleophobic coating is.  Multi-touch supported, the touchscreen can handle up to 5 simultaneous touches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db3/066/0b8/db30660b87bfa3f894f5f26fddb1c4d7.jpg"><br><br>  <u>The software in Samsung Galaxy Win Duos</u> is based on Android 4.1.2.  Everything is simple here: Qualcomm has not released an update for the MSM8225Q with a more recent version of the operating system, and therefore both Samsung and B-brands are in the same position. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f2/8e5/833/9f28e5833c852a5c530e49422e88a47d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f83/72e/525/f8372e5253df9a527b5ced5da048b51f.jpg"><br><br>  The TouchWiz interface and the Samsung proprietary software suite is, of course, available.  Here you and Group Play (I have not seen anyone use it at least once), and ChatON (I use it myself), and the Samsung Hub content service, and Samsung Apps‚Äôs own software catalog. <br><br>  There are more significant improvements.  For example, the curtain of the notification panel can be lowered on the locked screen (if memory serves me, this is a chip from Android 4.2.2). <br><br>  There is a power saving mode, which cuts off small voracious functions and allows, in theory, to save 15 percent of energy.  The charge level can be displayed as a percentage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e5/f97/ed8/0e5f97ed8df5939e114f1129524bdffa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a28/88d/b25/a2888db25ca99bd75a772feaed92d194.jpg"><br><br>  There is a simplified desktop mode - for those users who cannot get used to the new device (I think it will be relevant for older people who migrated to a Samsung smartphone from some antediluvian ‚Äúbutton‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00f/fdc/eb3/00ffdceb35d05381b0998f6304062f4d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e73/4dc/70c/e734dc70c4fbe988e206a0232c79b938.jpg"><br><br>  In the notification panel there are switches for many options and screen brightness adjustment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/316/1c1/b4e3161c1b20713bc9eb34a06ead05d0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd6/6f9/aef/fd66f9aef29ec8437daab0c6a6b889a3.jpg"><br><br>  Integrated into the blacklist pleased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8db/f47/7ff/8dbf477fff24253bc88d81d002ad08dd.jpg"><br><br>  I also recall the ability to control gestures.  Although, again, I never saw a person who would seriously and for a long time use it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8b/dc6/869/f8bdc68691173857796f685cd5911978.jpg"><br><br>  Dispatcher running applications tricked and convenient - as in the Galaxy S4. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc6/520/7e4/bc65207e4fb03911ab5000f36c2dac4d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/546/1f6/673/5461f6673e5c8107a23305ad9665fad4.jpg"><br><br>  The background of the main menu is not black, hurray: it changes along with the picture on the desktops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b9/46b/120/3b946b120ad49366a6c4353598d6dcde.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d0/75d/47a/8d075d47af413088021358973d2ac002.jpg"><br><br>  By holding the power button, the device can not only be turned off or switched to ‚Äúairplane‚Äù mode, but also the mobile Internet can be restarted or turned off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae0/247/d59/ae0247d59be1d2dfa61e5ec58e568f3c.jpg"><br><br>  Something like this.  In principle, everything is very cool in terms of software - comfortable, nice, simple.  I like a lot more than the ‚Äúbare‚Äù Android.  But there are also jambs: for example, applications for some reason cannot be transferred from internal memory to a USB flash drive.  Memory in Galaxy Win Duos 8 GB (5 available), which is not very much, so this option would be very appropriate.  I remember that it was not in the Galaxy S4 either, but with one of the firmware updates it appeared.  Maybe in our hero sometime will appear ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/fcd/2e3/b7bfcd2e36f0078c661aff4238ce7185.jpg"><br><br>  <u>What is left?</u>  <u>Oh yeah, the camera, or rather the camera.</u>  Galaxy Win Duos has 0.3 megapixels in front, and there's nothing to talk about here.  Rear 5 megapixels with autofocus and flash.  Frankly speaking, you expect more from the apparatus for 8 seconds and thousands of rubles - not in terms of resolution, but in terms of quality.  I was never impressed.  Completed the picture of the ability to record video with a maximum resolution of 480 x 720 pixels.  Again, I remember Highscreen Omega Prime Mini with the same chipset, which is written in HD720p. <br><br>  Photo examples: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fd4/07d/8b1/fd407d8b133c9b391f28dc4503f09e40.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12f/ea0/c1c/12fea0c1c03d0d1b6a4bf44e9c998375.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f8/575/a89/9f8575a895e7dab1b7c906a232b5f0ad.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a9/a74/ee7/8a9a74ee7ee38c2414b51f3686ec3362.jpg"><br><br>  But the interface is convenient - I like it more than the application for shooting from Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05a/09f/6e1/05a09f6e18f5831179bd9321ad49a746.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7cd/5a4/3d0/7cd5a43d072d9e99763d96e90b775c9d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a9/403/bdb/4a9403bdb0912adbcf34452a42ee676d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/157/32e/716/15732e71655c30486984da0c391ea493.jpg"><br><br>  Taking the Samsung Galaxy Win Duos to the test, I was also pursuing one hidden goal: to see whether such a smartphone would work for my father.  He has long wanted something relatively inexpensive on Android, with a relatively large screen.  In my opinion, the device will suit him, although before buying, I will let him hold Highscreen Alpha Rage in his hands - not over 8, but over 5 thousand.  (It‚Äôs just that the device remained just after the test and is gathering dust in the nightstand.) To be honest, I would not overpay 3,000 for TouchWiz and a rather buggy (and ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù) implementation of Dual SIM Dual Active.  I didn‚Äôt find other key advantages of the Samsung product over the Highscreen model: the Korean and Android are older, and the hardware is weaker, the screens are comparable ... Yes, the case may be nicer.  But not critical.  All this once again shows that the A-brands, with Samsung at their head, are moving to defeat in the class of budget smartphones - they do something really low-cost and at the same time they cannot be technological.  Qualitative - yes, advanced - no. <br><br>  PS Galaxy Win Duos I got without packaging and bundling.  But there is nothing interesting: waste paper, charger, headset and, in fact, everything. <br><br>  PPS I also recommend that you familiarize yourself with the review of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/190854/">LG Optimus L5 II Dual</a> , which, as it turned out, also significantly blends B-brands on most parameters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213305/</a></p>
