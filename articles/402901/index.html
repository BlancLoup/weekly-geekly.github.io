A brand new DJI Phantom 4 was chosen as a drone, and you can see a short report from the event itself with the most interesting moments below: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1S3I4o6xYt8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  And now a few words about the product itself and its technical characteristics (about glasses, of course, with the drone, you probably already know well without us. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Not a revolution, but evolution </h2><br><p>  In February 2017, Epson Moverio BT-300 video glasses went on sale in the Russian market.  Earlier we already <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/217939">talked about the previous version of the Moverio BT-200 glasses</a> : and even <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/epson/blog/235285/">held a contest for developers</a> who were satisfied with both ourselves and the participants. </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1FyoAPuvk9Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  So, Epson Moverio BT-300 is the title of the lightest transparent binocular video glasses in the world. </p><br><p>  Their weight is <i>only 69 grams</i> .  It would seem that the difference in 19 grams between the versions is not so significant, but when you have to wear such glasses on your nose for a long time - the absence of these 19 grams is a significant advantage. </p><br><p>  However, the main feature is a completely new display based on Si-OLED technology!  Take a look at the picture - as they say, the difference <i>on the face</i> ! </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4HOR4__9rM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/projection/1161047/">Si-OLED</a> - development engineers Epson.  With this technology, each pixel of the image is a source of light and glows only when needed.  What does this give?  Right!  Great contrast and excellent color reproduction.  About the contrast I want to say separately.  In the previous version of the glasses, the more or less traditional illuminated LCD matrix was used, in connection with which, one could see the boundaries of the projection area, even if no images were displayed on the screen (that notorious ‚Äúillumination‚Äù or how it is often called abroad - ‚Äúglow "). </p><br><p>  <b>In the case of Si-OLED, this effect is no longer observed.</b>  The image from the glasses is perfectly ‚Äúsuperimposed‚Äù over the visible through the transparent glasses of the surrounding space, which allows achieving even greater immersion in the world of augmented reality.  I think many owners of phones or TVs with OLED-screens are well aware of how cool it is. </p><br><p>  And the rest of the successor to the Epson BT-200 can all the same as the previous version, only with a better camera and productive stuffing (even more cores, megabytes and megahertz). </p><br><p>  For clarity, the differences Epson Moverio BT-300 from the previous model was issued in a small sign: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59b/bf1/5ae/59bbf15ae1db44c9ac4b3486348292bc.png"><br><br><h2>  What does it have to do with Epson and DJI? </h2><br><p>  The fact is that <a href="http://epson.ru/publication/news/1157915/">in the fall of 2016, Epson announced a partnership with DJI</a> , although we did not pay much attention to this partnership.  Of course, with the release of Epson BT-300, we plan to improve, and proudly position new video glasses as FPV for DJI drones (and not only). </p><br><p>  Many of you know that DJI is the leading manufacturer of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).  The result of the collaboration was the DJI GO application, optimized for working with Epson Moverio BT-300 video glasses.  The DJI GO app is compatible with DJI Phantom, Inspire, Matrice and Mavic drones, as well as with the DJI Osmo system. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7de/e5a/31d/7dee5a31d596456bbf9a04647061f4a9.jpg"></div><br><h2>  How it works? </h2><br><p>  To get started, just download the DJI Go application from the Moverio App Market app store and install it on the glasses.  Having launched the application, follow the prompts on the points screen to configure and connect the points with the drone control panel.  Everything!  You can take off! </p><br><p>  Thanks to the built-in BT-300 displays, the pilot sees the image from the drone's camera, and due to the fact that the glasses are transparent, he can directly observe the flight of the drone itself.  <b>Such a solution meets the European requirements of aviation agencies for unmanned aerial vehicles, in particular, the principle that UAVs should remain within the direct view of the pilot.</b> </p><br><h2>  Other features </h2><br><p>  In addition to improving the safety of piloting a UAV, a comprehensive solution ‚Äúvideo glasses and drone‚Äù provides users with a new tool for working with augmented reality in areas such as construction, agriculture, emergency services, environmental protection, research, cinema and many others. </p><br><h2>  It is better to see once </h2><br><p>  Points are available for testing in our Moscow <a href="http://epson.ru/demo/moscow/944161/">demozala on Novoslobodskaya</a> .  We will be glad if you come to visit and share your impressions about working with Epson Moverio BT-300 in your blog or even in the comments. </p><br><p>  We thank you for your attention! </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e55/3fa/b75/e553fab75df7402d808c26248171c2f4.jpg"></div></div>
