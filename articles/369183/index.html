      Recently at the <a href="http://www.fortuneconferences.com/global-forum-2015/">Fortune Global Forum</a> , which was held on November 4, leading experts in the field of robotics at a round table agreed that progress in the field of computer technology will lead to <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/kakoe-budushee-ojidaet-finansovih-robotov-konsultantov">robots becoming much more useful in business</a> .  However, in the question of whether robots can force people out of their jobs, opinions are divided. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The author of the book The Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Rise of the Jobless Future (Martin Robots Take Off: Technology and the Unemployed Future) Martin is very worried about the fact of the growing demand for the use of robots.  In his opinion, this means that most routine work will be done by machines.  <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/cennost-lydei-kak-rabotnikov-podverglas-somneniy">Ford doubts that this trend will lead to mass unemployment.</a>  At the same time, it will significantly increase the difference in wages between unskilled workers who are most at risk from the introduction of robots, and representatives of top management.  The latter, in turn, will <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/komu-budut-prinadlejat-roboti">hardly feel the presence of robots in the labor market</a> . <br><blockquote>  "I believe that information technology in this matter plays an important role," - said Ford regarding the crowding out of workers. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Ken Goldberg, a professor of engineering from Berkeley, University of California, and the leader of the People and Robots university project, disagrees with Ford.  He claims that progress in the field of robotics is not so terrible as it is being tried to teach.  "Most mechanical robots have the skills and dexterity of a two-year-old child," says Goldberg.  ‚ÄúThere is still a lot of work to be done before the moment when the robots have enough potential to replace skilled workers.‚Äù <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúTechnologies are rapidly developing, and today there are enough reasons to say that any crisis will come soon,‚Äù Goldberg added. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Ryan Nawani, vice-president and head of packaging materials manufacturing company Jetline Group, noted that after some time robots will be able to completely replace people in production.  However, the next generation of workers, compared with their predecessors, understands technology much more deeply and therefore has a sufficient number of skills that will help them to save their jobs. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIn the end, the world will be better,‚Äù said Navani. <br></blockquote><br><br>  All forum participants agreed that future specialists should be able to prepare and accept changes.  However, talk of a possible replacement of people with robots still <a href="http://www.robo-hunter.com/news/opasatsya-li-poteri-svoego-rabochego-mesta-iz-za-robotov">excites some people</a> .  One of the participants of the round table expressed concern that one day the robots would reach such a stage of development that they would be able to take control of a futuristic world in which people would become ‚Äújust a service for cars‚Äù.  Goldberg hastened to assure everyone that it is still very early to worry about this, because there are no prerequisites for believing that cyborgs will take over the world, and people will remain only their attendants. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369183/</a></p>
