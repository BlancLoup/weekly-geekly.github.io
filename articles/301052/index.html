  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Watch out! Cycle bike! Or 5 service errors worth 1000 rubles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I sometimes find myself writing about some quite obvious things - from time to time I repeat banal things like ‚Äúcommunicate with the client in human language‚Äù, ‚Äúbuild processes around the client‚Äù, ‚Äúlearn to solve problems‚Äù.  Everything is true, but without examples, these are only formulations - vague and useless.  Fortunately, personal experience threw me a wonderful case with typical errors of client service.  And today I will tell you how Velobike rightly took 1000 rubles from me and unfairly did not return them.  In a furnace of insult and emotion - today we learn from a bad example and analyze what the guys did not do as they should have. <br><br>  <strong>You just do not know how to cook them!</strong> <br>  The first bell rang when a friend complained that he had mistakenly written off 100 rubles for 2 hours of skating, to which I calmly answered - the fool himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c17/f90/188/c17f90188d69be86fa39dae6c4b773e1.png" alt="IMG_0729" width="228" height="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a9/87d/f5b/0a987df5bea882c5049f62093521ac6a.png" alt="IMG_0731" width="300" height="202">

      For some reason, the universe has become attached to this occasion and decided to teach me a lesson because I am cleverly clever. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two days later, I rode the usual route from 1905 to the Arbat, parked great and saw on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e7/a38/d5c/6e7a38d5c2d13ef177fbbc6a6ceaafe9.jpg" alt="velobike2" width="740" height="555"><br><br>  The ride time showed 33 minutes - it didn‚Äôt meet the free half hour :( Well, of course I‚Äôm slow, but there were 2 subways with steep ascents of 25 steps on the way, and Moscow is not suitable for cyclists; , and generally to blame for everything ... Then I plunged into thoughts about the fate of the motherland and went to work. <br>  Three hours later, SMS came. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdf/efa/2f8/bdfefa2f877e510406f69b20ef314199.png" alt="IMG_0728" width="377" height="724"><br><br>  Well schazz I make them !!! <br>  I called the support service.  The girl clarified whether I waited for the SMS about the end of the rental, advised the next time to wait for it and promised to transfer the claim to the technical service - they will understand.  To secure success, I wrote a letter in support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e6c/884/d0f/e6c884d0f938c5c1a155171d20e45c56.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 15.16.27" width="827" height="148"><br><br>  I had no doubts that I would be given a refund, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been in customer service for 8 years and I know how such issues are solved‚Äù - I thought.  But in Velobike they thought differently. <br><br><h2>  Error 1. Answering machine </h2><br>  I was already taken aback by the answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f2b/414/64c/f2b41464c583a18fa6dd5a7f04d51a45.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 11.21.03" width="840" height="531"><br><br>  Clerical and copyright user agreement - are you serious?  They dismissed me from a monstrous pattern, without a shadow of sympathy and trying to figure it out.  Hey, we have 2016 here, now even banks are not responding like that. <br><br>  <strong>So how should it be?</strong>  The inability to communicate with the client in a normal language is not the worst thing that happens in the service.  This can be learned.  Yes, I would not be so offended, and Velobike was not so ashamed if the response showed empathy, apologized, humanly argued the position and politely refused to return.  But this is not a solution.  When there is a problem, but there is no system solution, we get such letters.  Correcting here is not the text, but the approach to service.  What it is, we understand further. <br><br><h2>  Error 2. Deafness </h2><br>  I climbed to look for similar cases - you never know, I alone do not read the user agreement - everything can be.  The first request in Google issued a group of Velobike Vkontakte.  Well, well, well.  The guys even have smm, it means they still feel that they need to be closer to the people, and they can help solve any issue there.  And again, did not guess.  Claims like mine are a dime a dozen.  And the answers transparently translate the policy "you do not know how to read the conditions - here and suffer." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be1/bee/a41/be1beea41d940af578ba96a5bad48ccb.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 13.33.25" width="789" height="290"><br><br>  <strong>So how should it be?</strong>  Once - an accident, three times - already a system.  If customers report the same problem, the red light should be on and blink and the siren should wail - it's time to stop playing the denial. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a35/95d/cd8/a3595dcd8311628d278efb16dd4c93ba.jpg" alt="Comics-Template-in-comments-yet-2ch-289178" width="488" height="644"><br><br>  So, <br><h2>  Complaint ‚Üí acknowledgment of a problem ‚Üí search for reasons ‚Üí search for a solution. </h2><br>  The cycle must be repeated until victorious.  There are complaints, a problem on the face.  The contact center, I give my hand to cut off, spends the lion's share of the time to process precisely these claims, even with templates.  So go look for reasons. <br><br><h2>  Error 3. It is also written on the fence </h2><br>  What is written there in the conditions and where to read them at all?  I go to the site, looking for, where they mention the necessary text message after skiing.  So, on the main and in the tariffs section, it‚Äôs written everywhere - wait for the SMS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a9/c79/462/6a9c79462f468c553a518cda0f3249c8.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 14.38.59" width="250" height="668"><br><br>  <em>Why no one is waiting - we all wrote in Russian letters and the picture was still hung on all pages.</em>  <em>And we send a text message 5 minutes before the end of the 30 minute ride!</em> <br>  Yes, because it is not clear that this information is important and what the consequences will be if you do not follow the instructions. <br><br>  <strong>So how should it be?</strong>  It is not enough to highlight in bright red letters on the site. <br><h1>  WAIT SMS !!! </h1><br>  People need to explain why these actions are required of them, to show the benefits.  Did I know that you need to wait for SMS?  She knew, and even taught others.  Why did not wait?  Because I did not expect it to be so important that I risk losing money and not return it. <br><br>  Smska for 5 minutes - a great move in the right direction.  But let's be honest - who reads SMS while driving?  I even imagine it badly: with one hand on the wheel, the other with a telephone, and not looking at the road, knocking down pedestrians?  What if after 30 minutes of skiing send another SMS: <br>  <em>‚ÄúDude, the time is free, and you didn‚Äôt bet great, or you did, but something went wrong and we didn‚Äôt fix it.</em>  <em>If you don‚Äôt already ride, check that you have blocked the bike, otherwise the money will be written off and you don‚Äôt have enough ice cream - there‚Äôs some heat in the street :) ‚Äù.</em> <br>  And this will remove some of the claims.  Because SMS will come at the moment when the person has set great and is sitting at work.  He will read the message without any problems and save his money. <br>  It is not enough to inform about the important, make sure that you have done everything for the client to hear you. <br><br><h2>  Error 4. Passive aggression </h2><br>  I keep fumbling around the site, trying to justify Velobike.  Stumble upon Frequently Asked Questions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4b4/c76/bef/4b4c76bef5191b7c7da3b6bb12b6aa7d.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 08/11/41" width="717" height="349"><br><br>  Velobike as it hints that it is a state.  office, not a friendly service for hipsters.  Whatever the client says, the essence is still the same.  So let's write two identical questions to two different questions.  We will repeat the same thing, in the end he will tire of arguing and will fall behind.  ‚ÄúYou violated‚Äù - the typical tone of communication between a state and a person - is accusatory, cold and arrogant.  From which you want to cringe, blush and go on your own to stand in a corner, hanging his head.  I'm stupid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/488/4d7/dd1/4884d7dd1d55c6e538b98e6eda2c5529.jpg" alt="Opyat_dvoyka" width="536" height="600"><br><br>  Method of carrot and stick in action.  Do you like to ride - ride.  But just that - you are a violator.  Thanks at least do not automatically open a criminal case. <br><br>  <strong>So how should it be?</strong>  Always proceed from the thesis that if a client fails, it is your fault and no longer a draw.  It means that your service is garbage, it means that you could not explain something, it means that you didn‚Äôt train the employees badly, it means you didn‚Äôt draw the client‚Äôs interaction with your service map.  Without awareness and acceptance of this thought, nothing will move and in the end the company will drown in customer negatives and disappointment.  You do not want to confess yourself in the jambs in person in front of the client - please, then in a quiet dismissal of the guilty or tear off your hands and head. <br><br><h2>  Error 5. No solution </h2><br>  After the first auto answer and refusal, I did not give up and wrote another letter.  In it I summed up the arguments, which are now disclosed in detail in this article.  And asked to send a message to the level above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d88/26c/5c2/d8826c5c2bffbf5525f27616ac09a84d.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 16.32.14" width="892" height="89"><br><br>  Well, now a person will join the conversation, I hoped, and we will find a solution amicably.  But everything turned out to be worse than I thought. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a9/18a/18e/1a918a18e4d1100a295371fa3112ab28.png" alt="Screenshot 2016-05-17 16.34.27" width="960" height="198"><br><br>  The soulless robot on that side was relentless.  It turned out that there is no such thing as a ‚Äúnon-standard approach‚Äù in Velobike.  They did not recognize the problem and refused to solve it.  Instead of messing up with returns and (God forbid!) Finally fix the discrepancies in the systems, Velobike shifts the responsibility to the client.  They are so comfortable. <br><br>  <strong>So how should it be?</strong>  In fact, a non-standard approach should not be.  The approach should be just standard, but take into account non-standard situations.  The general recipe is as follows: describe all possible scenarios in the maintenance process, select appropriate solutions for them and write instructions for employees ‚Äúhow to act if ...‚Äù.  At the same time, only clients determine the adequacy of the decision.  If it is inadequate, you will immediately find out about it - we recall error 2 and the chain ‚ÄúComplaint ‚Üí acknowledgment of a problem ‚Üí search for reasons ‚Üí search for a solution‚Äù.  The starting point for you is one - the convenience of the client. <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br><h4>  1. Forget to refer to the User Agreement.  Talk humanly. <br>  2. Listen to what customers say and respond to the case. <br>  3. Focus on the important.  Make sure customers hear you. <br>  4. More boldly admit mistakes - this is the only chance to correct them. <br>  5. Start from the beginning, taking into account the needs of customers. </h4><br><br>  Here is my answer to the moral damage :-) And what would you advise Velobike?  Share in the comments your bike stories that will help the guys to establish a good service. <br><br>  UPD <br>  The guys react, it's cool :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/925/445/52c/92544552c2c04be69976ed1ecb03027f.jpg" width="300"><br><br>  UPD 2 <br>  Read the sequel about how after this publication <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/usedesk/blog/317210/">Velobike implemented UseDesk.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301052/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301052/</a></p>
