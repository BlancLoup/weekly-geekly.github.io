  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another portable radio in a secure case - teXet TM-540R</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Under the brand teXet came another mobile - TM-540R.  It seems to be the usual dust and call dialer, of which recently divorced fully, but not quite.  Included with the novelty is a removable antenna - by screwing it, teXet TM-540R can be used as a walkie-talkie. <br><br>  The developers say the following: ‚Äúthe phone operates on the European licensed system PMR (Private Mobile Radio, from English.‚Äú Private portable radio station ‚Äù) in the VHF band at allowed civil frequencies 400-470 MHz.  Keeping in touch with any compatible device or with a similar model is possible at a distance of up to 1.5 kilometers in open areas. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75e/e63/29e/75ee6329e5d0300b52d7bba032f1aaa8.jpg"><br>  teXet TM-540R <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In principle, a piece can be useful for anglers and other hunters.  It is also quite realistic to use it in the city: the standard for such devices, the ‚Äú2-inch screen, FM-radio, Bluetooth, two SIM-cards, a player, a memory card slot‚Äù set will be quite enough for many.  Another curious thing is a small additional screen on the back panel, which displays data on temperature, pressure and height above sea level.  Specific options, but someone will certainly come in handy.

Compliance with the standard IP67 (protection from dust and dirt + being under water for half an hour at a depth of a meter without compromising performance) today will not surprise anyone.  But the developers say the following: ‚ÄúEach element of the case is designed in such a way as to maximally secure the functional centers of the phone - in case of a fall, the screen and the camera will be protected by a protruding edge, and ribbed inserts will protect the side edges from damage.‚Äù  Yes, a couple of years ago, I also thought that the rubber protrusions around the screen could protect the latter from damage, and threw the new Samsung B2100 Xplorer into the dirt to argue.  The result is a scratch in the center of the screen: the dirt is not perfectly flat, and even with pebbles, and the phones can fall at an angle ... Although if you look closely, teXet looks more muscular (read - it has larger rubber protrusions) .  Perhaps, in such a situation, he would not have stayed with a damaged display. <br><br>  <b>TeXet TM-540R video demonstration:</b> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9RSUkeTCwc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjAZ8LcRHDNBYDrrB70aBjjALz9zg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b4/32c/8a3/8b432c8a3113fa8d14bbc9ddc9f15966.jpg"><br>  The device is already sold at the price indicated on the official website, the price is 5,999 rubles (or about $ 187) <br><br>  It is worth adding that teXet has been developing the topic of protected devices for quite a long time - sometime (in August 2012), he was one of the first to bring such an Android background to the Russian market.  Speech on the model teXet TM-3200R.  And in May 2013, the model TM-3204R replaced it.  The design of the smartphone has not changed at all (and this is good, as there are few brutal devices on the market), but the filling has been noticeably refreshed.  The processor has become a dual-core (Qualcomm MSM8225 with a frequency of 1 GHz), the amount of RAM has grown to 768 MB, the built-in memory - up to 4 GB.  The version of the Android platform has changed from 2.3 to 4.0. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/432/64d/638/43264d638a5b1c58c6144c0a37a5d344.jpg"><br>  teXet TM-3204R <br><br>  There are similar in purpose smartphones, for example, the RugGear.  However, according to its characteristics, the RG210 Swift II most likely corresponds to an elderly teXet TM-3200R: it also has a single-core processor and an operating system of version 2.3.  And the design is less pleasant, in my opinion. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55a/b81/3ac/55ab813acccae07be98fdd485e844635.jpg"><br>  RugGear RG210 Swift II <br><br>  But back to the protected cell phones with walkie-talkies.  I note that in general there are enough similar models on the market.  Previously, they were not equipped with walkie-talkies, they were quite expensive, and the most famous brand in this segment was Sonim.  Later, small and large (but, as a rule, small) companies managed to establish contacts with the factories that produced phones for Sonim, and now we have what we have. <br><br>  Here, for example, GinzzuR6 Ultimate.  In his case, it is already working as a walkie-talkie at a distance of 3 to 5 kilometers.  True or not, I don‚Äôt know, didn‚Äôt test it, although it would be interesting.  It is alleged that the device can withstand the arrival of a half-ton car - again, who knows.  The screen is 2 inches, two SIM-cards, a 2-megapixel camera - everything else looks alike.  That's just the back of the display is not, but there is a GPS-receiver with maps of Russia from the Chinese developer SunaviNavigation.  (Interestingly, they have at least Moscow, not to mention the forests and marshes of our vast country?) If we forget about the functionality of the radio, it turns out that Ginzzu has a lot of secure phones - 6 pieces, and all are different.  In general, this brand, judging by its official website, does not focus on some means of communication.  Ginzzu has sports (and also protected) cameras for underwater photography, which, among other things, can act as a DVR.  There are power adapters, external batteries, car holders ... Smartphones are not visible yet, but I think they will appear soon. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d5/883/a99/5d5883a99254a87dc6ea52c21b4d7ba9.jpg"><br>  Ginzzu R6 Ultimate <br><br>  The price of handsets with walkie-talkies is around 6,000, for the same amount you can take both teXet and Ginzzu.  I'm not sure that their audience is very big.  In general, it is assumed that if you are a builder or an oil industry worker, then you must have a brick phone with a titanium case that can be fed to the whale, followed by the death of the latter and the floating of the phone on the surface of the water.  But in fact, similar ‚Äúspecialists of a severe profile‚Äù, on the contrary, are drawn to the iPhone and other devices of this kind, I have noticed this more than once.  What do you think?  Would you buy yourself such a ‚Äútelephoneojip‚Äù? <br><br>  PS Would you be interested in a review of such a non-killed phone? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188656/</a></p>
