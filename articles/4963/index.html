No dial-up modem compares to them in terms of the saturation of the sound range).  There was also Spectrum-Z - the car is clearly more powerful, because on it, my friends and I even played some kind of ‚Äústrategy‚Äù (it doesn't matter that instead of the graphic ‚ÄúCivilization‚Äù there was a simple text).  We did not care that in 2007 we would work at computers, whose power in the early 90s of the 20th century allowed us to control all the country's space satellites. <br><br>  Now our gurus are Tim O'Reilly, Sergey Brin and Anton Nosik.  We ourselves form the information environment in which we live.  We became <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1961/">people of the year according to Time</a> .  The fraction of a second spent per click on an extra link causes our dissatisfaction and discussion of the features of the structure of the upper extremities of the webmaster who created the site.  Each hang of Windows, according to signs, should cause an attack of hiccups in Bill Gates.  We are all more or less susceptible to the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/article/1930/">syndrome of mouse rage</a> (oh, those British scientists) ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/16a/2c6/526/16a2c652628a31837cb8c86afd8f93d5.jpg" width="250" alt="OLPC" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  Once again, reading that this year the ‚Äúgrandfather-frost from the UN‚Äù ‚Äúwill give‚Äù children of Africa with the price of 100-140 US dollars, I understand that there are still a lot of problems in Africa.  The ‚Äúflowers of life‚Äù from the ‚Äúblack continent‚Äù are not so greatly favored by fate, however, like the more adult residents of the poorest countries in the world.  Heat, disease and world capitalism - all this is not very conducive to the survival of children in Libya and Congo.  The <a href="http://www.laptop.org/">OLPC</a> project (One Laptop Per Child - ‚Äúeach child has a laptop‚Äù), according to which all these children will be given out green XO laptops, will contribute, as it seems to me, to only one - the early cultivation of new carriers of mouse rage syndrome.

      Imagine that you are an innocent child from Congo who has been given a green flat box.  You have been told that you can drop her and even play her football, but in general this box is the computer with which you will learn digital literacy.  Inside it is the OS on the Linux kernel, a text editor with the option of italicizing the text and the browser (no holivar!).  The information will be processed using a 500 megahertz processor, 128 MB of RAM and 500 MB of flash memory for files.  With the help of four USB ports you can connect additional equipment;  for example, a mouse: this is perhaps one of the few devices that will not greatly strain the power of a computer.  With the help of wireless connection, you can exchange cheat sheets with your classmates. <br><br>  By the way, with the XO laptop, you can exclude physical education lessons from the Congo‚Äôs school curriculum, because laptops will be charged from ‚Äúmanual traction‚Äù: by twisting the handle on a special ‚Äúelectric coil‚Äù for about 5 minutes, you will ensure a relaxed use of a text editor and other applications on XO In one hour. <br><br>  Thus, thanks to a hundred-dollar laptop, the children of Congo, after a couple of weeks of working with him, will be ready to form guerrilla groups to overthrow the country's government, which made them such a ‚Äúgift.‚Äù  After all, the government pays the purchase of these "computers" from the OLPC. <br><br>  The cunning plan of George W. Bush and Yulia Tymoshenko has been revealed: they want, under the guise of the UN and OLPC brand, to change the state system in the poorest countries of the world.  Some of them have oil, some have gas, some have bananas.  The revolution will be carried out with the money of the governments themselves.  In my opinion, this is brilliant. <br><br>  If the plan fails and there will be no revolution, in any case, after 10 years, young people will come to study at RUDN, who will hate computers no less than Lenin hated the bourgeoisie.  How to prevent this insidious plan is unclear.  There is almost no time left: already this year the green boxes will be in the hands of poor children. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4963/</a></p>
