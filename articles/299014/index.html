Whether the point of view of the president and the government on this issue fully coincides is still unknown. <br><br>  Arkady Dvorkovich drew conclusions from this rather dangerous for the funds.  At the end of January 2016, the Deputy Prime Minister announced that ‚Äúit is still to be decided‚Äù whether the existing structures will survive - Rosnano, RVK, Bortnik Foundation, VEB Innovations, Skolkovo.

      As part of optimizing innovative development institutions, there is a discussion about the consolidation of existing funds, a source told RBC.  Optimization can take place in two scenarios. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Joining the oldest venture capital organization - the Bortnik Fund - to one of the existing institutions for innovation development is the first scenario. <br><br>  Integration with RVC, the Fund for Infrastructure and Educational Programs or the Industry Development Fund (FER) was also considered, but all of them were recognized as ‚Äúunpromising‚Äù, the vice-president of one of the large funds said. <br>  The most likely scenario is to join Rosnano or Skolkovo, say two sources of RBC. <br><br>  The first decisions on the future structure of the innovation development institutes system can be made within the next three weeks.  According to him, until mid-March ‚Äúthe architecture of the system of development institutions should be presented to the Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, after which‚Äú relevant instructions will follow, ‚ÄùRBC <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/02/2016/56d429459a7947f24fa8262f%3Ffrom%3Dmain">reports</a> citing its own sources. <br><br>  Will the institutes supporting start-ups and small businesses as a whole work more efficiently after optimization?  Was the work of the Bortnik Fund effective until today? <br><br>  Megamozg <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/173825/">cites the</a> point of view of a start-up participant who had experience of working with the foundation: <br><blockquote>  You can work with the Bortnik Fund.  You can get support for the project.  A team of 2-3 people in the first year and 4-5 in the second (there is another third year of the program: 3 million per year) will succeed. <br><br>  There is one thing that spoils the rosy picture: if you have a nonstandard situation with documents and formalism, for example, one of the team members is a citizen of another country, and the issue needs to be resolved, then by a call to the fund, the decision to achieve will not work.  For each step aside, you need to write a letter to the general director of the fund. <br><br>  The goal of the foundation is to help your company get on its feet and become self-sufficient.  There is a danger of getting hooked on numerous funds - driving around the country and asking for all the money, while concentrating on the market and the products or services being sold. <br><br>  The Bortnik Fund is a good help at the start, but be careful with the money that came to you not from the market. </blockquote><br>  The Bortnik Foundation has existed since 1994.  Over 20 years of activities of the Assistance Fund: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ received over 45,000 applications <br>  ‚Ä¢ more than 12,000 contracts for R &amp; D, <br>  ‚Ä¢ supported by more than 10,000 young innovators, <br>  ‚Ä¢ more than 4500 startups were created, <br>  ‚Ä¢ 64 regional representative offices of the Assistance Fund in the territory of the Russian Federation were opened. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The Fund has invested 38 billion rubles in about 5,000 startups <br><br>  Who specifically do not like the results of the Bortnik Fund?  Will the Rosnano or Skolkovo win from the merger?  It is known that the results of the two institutions mentioned above proved to be very controversial.  On February 7, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23958/">wrote</a> that a meeting was held in the Kremlin on the development of the Russian innovation system with the participation of representatives of the Expert Council under the Government.  Apparently, innovative state projects do not solve the tasks. <br><br>  So, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/269964/">there is a</a> possibility that Rosnano and Skolkovo will cease to exist. <br><br>  We interviewed experts in order to understand the situation by asking one question: <br><br>  <b>- Do you consider as an effective measure the merger of the Small Form Support Fund in the scientific and technical sphere (the Bortnik Fund) with the institute of innovative development: Rosnano or Skolkovo?</b> <br><br>  Leonid Delitsyn, an expert GC <a href="http://www.finam.ru/">"FINAM"</a> : <blockquote>  The Bortnik Fund is one of those organizations for which there were few complaints and complaints, although the structure has been working for more than twenty years.  Apparently, this is due to the careful organization of the examination. <br><br>  The fund allocates relatively small funds to a large number of companies in the early stages.  Quite often, high-tech start-ups that turned to our venture capital funds indicated that in the early stages they received grants from the Bortnik Fund. <br><br>  Merging with such major projects as Skolkovo or Rosnano will mean the takeover of the Bortnik Fund.  Perhaps in the course of subsequent restructurings, he will eventually be completely lost. <br><br>  On the other hand, from the point of view of information support for innovation activities of the state, the Bortnik Fund does not bring any special bonuses to the state.  Therefore, everything will rest against the ultimate goals and criteria for achieving these goals. <br><br>  If informational influence is more important, then it must be admitted that the Skolkovo and Rosnano brands are better promoted - everyone knows them.  In this case, preserve and strengthen the workers, but information assets of the poor should be theirs. <br><br>  Certainly, the authorities will benefit from the point of view of simplifying management - they will have to make decisions on a smaller number of development institutions, and ask - from a smaller number of managers. </blockquote><br>  Lyubov Simonova, expert of <a href="http://www.almazcapital.com/">Almaz Capital fund</a> : <blockquote>  To understand that the Bortnik Fund will remain a separate structure, a lot of time is not needed. <br><br>  Each of the companies in the list has its own functions, which are written for them, including  on the sites on which their activity is focused. <br><br>  So: <br><ul><li>  RUSNANO implements the state policy on the development of nanoindustry, acting as a co-investor in nanotechnology projects with significant economic or social potential. </li><li>  RVC OJSC is the state fund of funds and the development institute of the Russian Federation, one of the key instruments of the state in building a national innovation system.  (i.e. infrastructure unit) </li><li>  Skolkovo: Implementation of the project to create and ensure the functioning of the Innovation Center (Project) Skolkovo is carried out in order to develop research, development and commercialization of their results (FZ-244) </li><li>  A ‚ÄúBortnik Fund‚Äù is the Fund for Assistance to the Development of Small Forms of Enterprises in the Scientific and Technical Sphere - a state non-profit organization in the form of a federal state budgetary institution, established in accordance with Government Decree No. 65 of February 3, 1994 </li></ul><br>  The ‚Äúfund‚Äù in the title is not quite, and not always, the organizational and legal form of this company. <br>  The tasks of the ‚ÄúBortnik Fund‚Äù, again, which have been registered for a long time, taking into account legislation, are the following: <br><ul><li>  Conducting state policy development and support in science and technology </li><li>  Creation and development of support infrastructure </li><li>  Promoting the creation of new jobs for the effective use of the scientific and technical potential of the Russian Federation </li><li>  Financial, informational and other assistance </li><li>  Involving young people in innovation </li><li>  Attraction of extra-budgetary investments in the sphere of small innovative entrepreneurship </li></ul><br>  The tasks of RUSNANO, RVK and others are their own.  And they can also be read on their pages. <br>  RVK and Skolkovo form the ecosystem, Rosnano develops the nanoindustry. <br><br>  Theoretically, Skolkovo and Bortnik Fund can be combined - everyone has a task, this is the creation and development of infrastructure.  Still, each of them has its own ecosystem. <br>  In my opinion, it is necessary to adjust the interaction of all these structures not by uniting organizations, but by uniting and adjusting the development plans of each individually in the general concept of the development of the Russian Federation. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299014/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299014/</a></p>
