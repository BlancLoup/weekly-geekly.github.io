Of course, the most reliable option to become a student of any Russian university is to get the maximum of the Unified State Exam.  However, points are not always the best indicator of academic achievement and ability.  An example of this is the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/334232/">story of</a> Ilya Glebov, who is now studying information security technologies at ITMO University. <br><br>  Of course, what happened with Ilya is a unique case, but at the ITMO University there are <a href="https://abit.ifmo.ru/page/69/">more than 20 projects</a> that allow the graduate to get additional points to the USE guaranteed.  One of them is ITMO VKontakte Olympiad, which starts very soon - in February.  More about her tell under the cut. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/347936/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/95c/01a/ca6/95c01aca632a4b908b8c2f2d3c7ee974.jpg" width="700"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Briefly about the Olympiad </h2><br>  The ITMO VKontakte Olympiad is a joint project of the ITMO University and the social network.  This year it is being held for the second time. <br><br>  <b>For whom</b> : schoolchildren of 7-11 grades can take part in the Olympiad. <br><br>  <b>Directions</b> : Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Social Studies, English and Computer Science. <br><br>  <b>Key dates</b> : correspondence stage - from February 12 to March 12.  Full-time tour - from 6 to 8 April. <br><br>  <b>Features of the Olympiad</b> : in order to take part in the correspondence round of the Olympiad, you do not need to go anywhere or submit applications on special sites and portals - just enter the <a href="https://vk.com/olympvk">official community of</a> the ITMO VKontakte Olympiad and enter the registration data in the application. <br><br>  It will be possible to perform the tasks of the absentee round at any time from February 12 to March 12 - the participant is given one hour to test.  By the way, it is not necessary to choose only one direction - you can compete in several disciplines at once. <br><br>  High school students who qualify for the final of the Olympiad will be invited to an in-person tour, which will be held at ITMO University in St. Petersburg from April 6 to April 8.  The total time allotted for the Olympiad in full-time tour is 6 hours.  At the same time, no more than 2 hours are allocated to one discipline - which also allows you to participate in the final in several directions at once. <br><br>  <b>Prizes to the winners</b> : a victory in the full-time stage allows you to earn up to 10 additional points to the sum of the unified state examination when you enter ITMO University.  Among the prizes are: virtual reality helmets, <a href="http://itmostore.ru/">ITMO.STORE</a> branded products, as well as 50 tickets to the VK Fest festival from the VKontakte social network. <br><br>  <b>In addition</b> : 10 participants who scored the most points during the correspondence tour will receive a travel grant.  Grant covers the cost of travel to St. Petersburg and stay in the city during the full-time stage of the Olympiad.  The full-time stage involves not only solving problems, but also a cultural program - excursions to the sights of St. Petersburg, visits to the laboratories of the ITMO University, lectures from University scientists and VKontakte employees. <br><br><h2>  What gives participation in the Olympiad </h2><br>  10 points for the exam, in fact, not so little - many participants of the Olympiad last year told that for them these points were decisive: <br><br><blockquote>  In total for the exam, I earned 260 points.  The points for the ITMO VKontakte Olympiad helped me a lot to enter the chosen direction, since the passing score was 269. <br><br>  - Daniil Merenkov, direction ‚ÄúInformation Security Technologies‚Äù </blockquote><br><blockquote>  [The sum of the points is] USE 159, +10 for the Olympiad.  In general, yes, points greatly helped me to enroll in my program, since at least it was 163. <br><br>  - Lisa Khodyr, ICT direction, ‚ÄúSoftware-protected infocommunications‚Äù </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The decisive role was played by the ID points [points for individual achievements] obtained for the Olympiad.  It is thanks to them that I am now studying at ITMO. <br><br>  - Ksenia Kocheshkova, direction "Information systems in the humanitarian sphere" </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1f/ky/n0/1fkyn0pkvehk3s2akebt0ddduti.jpeg">  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hackny/10165026525/">hackNY.org</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC BY</a></font></i> <br><br>  Among the winners were those for whom the extra points were not decisive - but the Olympiad itself, as students note, helped them test their knowledge, and the victory gave them confidence when they entered. <br><br>  And for someone, prizes and gifts have become an additional motivation to participate: <br><br><blockquote>  270 points in total for math, Russian and computer science and 10 for ITMO VKontakte.  Additional points were not decisive, but they allowed me to be more confident in my admission. <br><br>  - Igor Tcherezov, direction ‚ÄúComputing Systems and Networks‚Äù </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The USE was 282 points (100 for computer science and Russian, 82 for math), for the ITMO VKontakte Olympiad was added 10. They did not become decisive, as I did without entrance examinations from another ITMO Olympiad, and the decision to enter here was made already a year ago, but gifts for participation became quite a big motivation, and I just wanted to check myself out. <br><br>  - Sergey Tynyanov, Department of Computer Technologies </blockquote><br><h2>  How to prepare </h2><br>  The first is to use the demo version for each of the subjects (they are all in <a href="https://vk.com/olympvk">the</a> ITMO VKontakte Olympiad <a href="https://vk.com/olympvk">group</a> ).  Many of the guys who won the full-time tour noted that they were trying out test assignments as training.  This year, the participants had an additional opportunity to prepare - now the group has not only demos, but also analyzes (with answers) of the full-year assignments of the last year tour.  Another plus of this Olympiad is that it can be prepared for and according to the usual tasks collections for the Unified State Exam (that is, without distracting from the educational process) - therefore, some of the winners of last year focused on them: <br><br><blockquote>  I was preparing mainly based on the materials that were posted in the official group of the Olympiad, at the same time I was preparing for the USE, which also helped me. <br><br>  - Igor Cherezov </blockquote><br><blockquote>  To my surprise, the tasks of the Olympiad turned out to be quite real; these were tasks that could be solved by someone who was well versed in the school curriculum. <br><br>  - Ksenia Kocheshkova </blockquote><br>  Many of the participants of the Olympiad who entered ITMO University, advise not to delay the preparation for the exams and actively use the opportunity to get additional points - even if they are not decisive, this will allow to tighten the knowledge before the exams: <br><br><blockquote>  I advise you to participate in olympiads (not only ITMO VKontakte), they develop the mind very well, besides, they allow you to enter without entrance examinations. <br><br>  - Sergey Tynyanov </blockquote><br>  Last year, most of the participants of the Olympiad (more than 60%) were pupils of the 11th grade.  However, the winners of the Olympiad 2017 recommend using this opportunity not only to graduates (ITMO VKontakte Olympiad is designed for students from grades 7-11) - this will allow to understand the technique of the competition and gain experience of participating in competitions: <br><br><blockquote>  It is necessary to start preparing [for admission] in high school, when I liked some subject, so that the Unified State Exam was just an unpleasant formality, and not a terrible surprise. <br><br>  - Rufina Kharisova, direction ‚ÄúNanomaterials and nanotechnologies of photonics and optoinformatics‚Äù </blockquote><br><blockquote>  If we speak specifically about the Olympiad and the Unified State Exam, then it is necessary to start preparing as early as possible, at least from the 8th grade, at least from the 5th grade.  To prepare to enter, for example, in ITMO in the 11th grade is already late, time is too short for that. <br><br>  The earlier you start to participate in competitions, the greater the chance to win and be ready for all the surprises that may arise every year. <br><br>  - Yaroslav Yakimov, direction "Information Security" </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dh/m5/-4/dhm5-47ichu1lzt2idyxvclhp6q.jpeg">  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/150684305%40N05/31303121384/">m1try</a> CC BY</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Statistics last year </h2><br>  The ITMO VKontakte-2017 Olympiad attracted more than 2,200 participants, most of whom decided to test their strength in computer science and mathematics, which is natural ‚Äî these are the core disciplines for admission to ITMO University.  75 participants of the Olympiad were among the winners of the in-person tour (in all areas).  Of these, 33 people took advantage of additional points and as a result became students of ITMO University. <br><br>  To date, more than 3,500 people have already registered to participate in the Olympiad - it is therefore likely that even more applicants will have the opportunity to increase the amount of points this year when they enter ITMO University. <br><br><blockquote>  On the exam, I received a total of 256 points in the three subjects.  Due to the diploma of the ITMO VKontakte Olympiad, I received another 10 points.  But in fact, they were not decisive when they entered the university, because I did without entrance examinations.  Although it was nice to be in the ranking of applicants higher than those who have points for the ID [was] lower. <br><br>  - Artem Krylov, direction "Information Systems and Technologies" </blockquote><br>  You can take part in the Olympiad starting from February 12.
