    <h2>  How the key was created </h2><br>  The history of this network of coworkers dates back to 2013 in St. Petersburg.  In those days, the Key was an IT bar, in which a club and an educational lecture center for specialists got along in the same space.  Along with night dances, hackathons and cybersport tournaments, the Russian Bitcoin community held offline meetings here. <br><br><blockquote>  The concept of an IT bar led to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa co-working techno hub for programmers.  However, the opening of such a technohab was no longer held in St. Petersburg, but in Moscow. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/_d/4r/is_d4r5k3pqzkswd7ftmawb9x7y.jpeg" width="350" align="left">  The First Key in the capital appeared in March 2016.  The premises for the new coworking were searched near the center or in the center, with rich infrastructure around, with high ceilings and large windows.  Under the "sight" were the historical industrial zones of Moscow, which experienced a surge of gentrification in the early 2000s.  Suitable space was found at the Three-Mountain Manufactory - the oldest textile factory in Moscow in 1799, a ten minute walk from Ulitsa 1905 and Krasnopresnenskaya metro stations. <br><br>  The next Klyuch site appeared six months later on the territory of the gas-cylinder plant ‚ÄúArma‚Äù - literally three minutes from the Garden Ring.  Now the network consists of five coworkings: "Key Trekhgorka", "Key Armagh", "Key Silk", "Key Patriarshie" and "Key Danilovskaya Manufactory".  A total of about a thousand jobs are recruited at the five sites. <br><br>  The guys say that a new site is already under construction on the Kuznetsky Most, the opening of which is scheduled for the beginning of 2019.  For 2019, it is planned to open several more sites in the center of Moscow ( <i>and not only Moscow</i> ). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We rise in the Key with @alinatestova</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tj/u4/yj/tju4yjr1bkrbns9wqwrxt5c0imu.jpeg" width="500" align="left"></div></div><br>  The place for coworking at the Trekhgornaya manufactory is chosen with soul and history.  This is the atmospheric factory space of the end of the XIX century, in which the business quarter is located.  There are many parking spaces, convenient entry to the territory, the metro is within walking distance. <br><br><h2>  IT bar </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/xd/6x/rfxd6xlkfaj6ezds4jdx1yuhpm8.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>IT bar in coworking Key</i></font></sup> <br><br>  This site was designed with an eye on the history of St. Petersburg - the very first - Key.  Because the first thing you see at the entrance is a bar.  Here residents can drink coffee, eat light salads (for example, with couscous and feta cheese) and sandwiches (with chicken and baked peppers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/40/vm/us/40vmusul0jl4l2pwue5wfycskjc.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Who cares, in a personal tell about coffee</i></font></sup> <br><br>  At evening events, which take place in Klucha Hall, beer, cider and snacks are taken at the bar (for example, nachos with guacamole or olives with chili and orange zest).  The bar is open on weekdays from 10:00 to 20:00 and is open to all visitors, not only for residents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zs/_l/xv/zs_lxv0s7ptbln9gwhjaltroogc.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Nice to go further motivational posters</i></font></sup> <br><br>  Inside the co-working itself everything is designed in the same style.  The ceiling height of six meters, a two-level layout, bare brick walls.  This gives the room an atmosphere that adjusts to work.  Plus allows you to do redevelopment without unnecessary investment in repairs. <br><br><h2>  Conference hall </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1i/ju/ip/1ijuipanq-rlpeuxc24swwzpib0.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>In the photo from the events, he seemed bigger, but even more comfortable.</i></font></sup> <br><br>  Opposite the bar is a conference room.  It is regularly rented for various events.  However, preference is given to events that would be of interest to residents of the Key.  For such events, special rental conditions are offered.  Moreover, all co-working residents can hold one event per year for free. <br><br>  Google (the accelerators program Developers Launchpad), Netology, Loreal, Red Bull, Rostec, Yota, Sberbank and many others held their events here.  The event agency DEPART√ÅMENT organized its courses at the Klyuch site, Future Biotech conducted a winter school for young scientists.  And more recently, in the conference room is a collective viewing of lectures from the venture capital fund Y Combinator. <br><br><h2>  Openspace and offices </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/vb/pc/zavbpc0ckrg-baqvhlth-l5fcp8.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>This is the main space of coworking.</i></font></sup>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>The total number of seats in openspace is 52. About 70% of them are constantly occupied</i></font></sup> <br><br>  Along the perimeter of the coworking space are closed offices.  Mostly they are teams of 3-4 people (and more).  All of these offices were booked before the opening, and since then there is always a small queue.  Of the very first resident offices at <a href="https://bazium.com/">Trekhgorka, Bazium</a> , <a href="http://vsmetane.ru/">Smetana</a> , <a href="https://thelocals.ru/">Locals</a> and <a href="https://lobster.media/">Lobster</a> are still operating today. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ua/m3/xg/uam3xgbxvs5aiadclywzpwxk5ju.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>This is one of the mini office</i></font></sup> <br><br>  Such an ‚Äúoffice‚Äù work format allows teams to quickly (and without the cost of finding, repairing, furniture and equipment) organizing a workspace for themselves and not wasting time and nerves on the office life ‚Äî cleaning, internet, paper in a printer, etc. ‚Äî are answered by the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bp/xd/fc/bpxdfciaay5k4spaov5fz6sumye.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>It seems that someone is using it.</i></font></sup> <br><br>  On the territory of the coworking there are literature exchange points.  Such ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù, without obtrusiveness and ‚Äúpioneer camp‚Äù networking is the most effective from the experience of the founders and residents.  Most often, books are read here, in soft Key recreation areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/on/8k/ym/on8kymieqlaaefzig-8kusq1bpw.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>We are leaving the first part of the "cowinging" (openspace)</i></font></sup> <br><br><blockquote>  "Cow" in the door is not a typo.  The word was born during the construction and design of the first site.  As the guys say, ‚Äúcowing‚Äù is a local term for openspace.  There is also a ‚Äúcommerce‚Äù - it means separate offices. </blockquote><br>  Another poster on the door is about Key's partners: the fitness club "Section" and the online English school <a href="https://habr.com/company/skyeng/">Skyeng</a> .  I was told that, in general, partnerships are ‚Äútied up‚Äù in different ways: one of the companies goes to co-working on <a href="https://thekey.space/partners">their own</a> , the founders turn to someone themselves.  So, for example, it turned out with a coffee shop ‚ÄúDoubleby‚Äù on ‚ÄúArmagh‚Äù - managers often went there for coffee and decided to negotiate a discount for residents. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ap/h0/7y/aph07ydxjrutvqaq-_mhlygnujo.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>On the photo - partners posters</i></font></sup> <br><br><h2>  Kitchen </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/2i/qe/tw2iqeh3bjmhivstl000rsw2sv8.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>The kitchen area is not very big, but it is enough</i></font></sup> <br><br>  There is a fridge in the dedicated kitchen area, where residents leave their food, microwave, kettle.  There is a common dining table.  The area, though small, is optimal for eating and socializing, given that many people eat at Klyuch‚Äôs bar or go out to dinner at numerous establishments on Trekhgorka (Doublebi, Touch√©, Buro Canteen, Friendship, etc.). <br><br><h2>  The second part of coworking </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/ar/ff/3earffiiuvou47jtcdyurwskk0w.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Go watch</i></font></sup> <br><br>  The key to the Trekhkgorka is divided into two parts - the second is the newer.  Openspace is much smaller: there are only 14 places (the rest are offices), of which almost everyone is busy during the season.  However, residents with unfixed space can move from site to site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8c/4x/kz/8c4xkzmfotidbwuisf8qt7sjgii.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Lockers are in the first open space</i></font></sup> <br><br>  In the Key cameras work around the clock.  But those who wish can rent a locker for valuables.  They are available to both residents and guests.  The rental price is 900 rubles per month at all sites of Klyuch, except the Patriarchs (there is a locker at 1,500 rubles per month). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/s1/1z/0ks11z3stmrx4bvrwmaeclf81wq.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>We also checked the poufs, quite normal</i></font></sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wy/4w/wc/wy4wwcg5tm4jilwu9tepxhtxm0w.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>This is what mini-peninspace looks like.</i></font></sup> <br><br><h2>  Second floor </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f2/qm/m7/f2qmm7plf8xuug7msugzs7plwqc.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>The second floor with offices is an add-on.</i></font></sup> <br><br>  At the expense of the superstructure with offices, Key architects increased the size of the site from 350 to 550 square meters.  m. Now on the second level are the offices of four companies.  All the premises are occupied, but it is known that one of them - an office for ten people - is vacated in early November. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a1/en/yc/a1enycqrdrirspwis_co1fqz3w4.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Here we recorded the podcast " <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/glph-media/id1435713366">GLPH</a> " - we are still releasing the release.</i></font></sup> <br><br><h2>  Talk </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pn/f9/e3/pnf9e3je39uu24wiz6b4_vi8izi.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>As you have noticed, themed posters are everywhere.</i></font></sup> <br>  In the ‚ÄúKey‚Äù co-working on Trekhgorka there are two meeting rooms for 12 people, called Landau and Lifshits (after the name of the famous textbook on theoretical physics in narrow circles).  The rental price already includes a projector for presentations, a whiteboard and water for guests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/05/da/au05dasq1qaoj3mguoxd42ziz5a.jpeg"><br>  <sup><font color="#A9A9A9"><i>As you have noticed, themed posters are everywhere.</i></font></sup> <br><br>  You can book a meeting room through the <a href="https://thekey.space/meeting-rooms">form on the website</a> .  Residents of Klyuch can use the meeting room free of charge an hour a day, as well as a 50% discount on rent for all of them.  Late in the evening, at night and on weekends, residents can use the meeting room for free. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Our other photo tours and podcasts in Habr√©:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Photo tour <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/413121/">of the Moscow coworking #tceh</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/419267/">SOK coworking</a> photo tour </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/424109/">VSCE</a> " - a podcast about media entrepreneurs [listen to <a href="https://t.me/vscemedia/6"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a>  <a href="https://t.me/vscemedia/6">Telegram</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/vsce/id1410854336">iTunes</a> , <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/vsce/2">Web</a> ] </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/company/vsce/blog/423447/">GLPH</a> " - a podcast about content marketing [listen to <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/5"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a>  <a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/5">Telegram</a> , <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/podcast/glph-media/id1435713366">iTunes</a> , <a href="http://vigorousspace.co/glph/1">Web</a> ] </li></ul><br><hr><br><blockquote>  Additional materials on content marketing in our microformat: <br><br> <sup><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/31">Why companies need an English-language blog on Habr√©</a></sup> <sup><br> <a href="https://t.me/atscale/9"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/atscale/9">The Game of Archetypes: How Storytelling Works for Tech Brands</a></sup> <sup><br> <a href="https://t.me/atscale/8"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></a></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/atscale/8">How to Scale Your Corporate Culture</a></sup> <sup><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></sup>  <sup><a href="https://t.me/glphmedia/24">Podcast: "When you - Glavred Rusbase"</a></sup> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425623/</a></p>
