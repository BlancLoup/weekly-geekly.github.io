  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Application Development Phases</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I and a couple of my friends recently independently decided to start developing applications for IOS.  Well, it is clear that they immediately began to "fill the bumps", but when I accidentally stumbled upon a series of articles - I realized that I would find them early, perhaps many questions in our work would not have arisen. <br>  So I decided to share the translation of the first article out of four (I did the translation myself, I did not attach myself to the text, a link to the source at the end of the article). <br><br><h4>  <b>Application pre-development phase</b> </h4><br>  Before you start implementing your idea, you should ask yourself five questions: <br>  1. Who will use your app? <br>  2. What are your competitors? <br>  3. Why is your application unique? <br>  4. When will you release it? <br>  5. How will people interact with your application? <br><br>  Consider each question separately. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  1) Who will use your app? </h5><br>  It is obvious that not all users of the iOS platform will be interested in your application.  People older than 50 will probably not be able to download games, they are more interested in exchange rates, calculators, guides, etc.  It is also not always that the audience targeted by marketing coincides with the end users of the application (for example, children simply do not have the opportunity to buy applications).

      When you decide on a potential audience of consumers, you need to talk with representatives of this audience.  Ask them what they like and what they don‚Äôt like in similar applications, and also could advise them to improve something in your idea.  As a platform for communication with the target audience can be forums on topics.  All of the above is extremely important.  You can spend a lot of time developing things that are completely useless to the end user.  You can even take photos of your audience and hang it on the wall next to the computer, so as not to forget about the end users. <br><br><h5>  2) What are your competitors? </h5><br>  In view of the fact that the AppStore audience is large, there is a high probability that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping a new application will not be unique.  But do not worry, competition and struggle is a good sign that speaks of a healthy market. <br><br>  Before you start developing you need to do some research.  In the AppStore, using keywords related to your idea, try to find the following information: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Are there many applications similar to your idea? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Which ones have the highest rating? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Does your idea have anything special compared to other applications? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Will my application be good enough to compete with the rest? <br>  ‚Ä¢ What is the size of applications like yours? <br>  ‚Ä¢ Which categories are applications like yours? <br>  ‚Ä¢ What is the AppSore page for these applications? <br>  ‚Ä¢ What screenshots are used on these pages? <br>  ‚Ä¢ etc. <br><br>  We pay attention to these things when we want to buy an application. <br><br>  If you are trying to continue Angry Birds, and only one thing will be different from previous versions - instead of birds and pigs, you decide to use cats and mice, you should think about adding new unique features to the game.  Because  There are a lot of similar applications if you don‚Äôt add something new and special to your application (distinguishing it from other analogs) - it‚Äôs not very likely that the application will be popular. <br><br>  Pay attention to the reviews and user reviews about the analogues of your applications, try to evaluate these analogues yourself.  (Do not pay attention to unconstructive criticism).  Pay special attention to applications rated 4-4.5. <br><br>  Pay attention to the size of your application, because it determines the possibility of downloading the application from the cellular network. <br><br>  Correctly select a category for the application, because it helps users quickly find the application they need. <br><br>  Pay particular attention to the application icon, it is her first thing that will lead a potential user. <br><br><h5>  3) Why is your application unique? </h5><br>  You will immediately answer this question if you have dealt with the previous one.  REMEMBER - this question is not about quantity, but about quality!  The application must have a chip that has been honed so much that users should recommend the application to their friends.  What is your application feature? <br><br><h5>  4) When will you release it? </h5><br>  When you decide what you want to do, you need to determine the timing of the work.  The more you develop an application, the more you invest in it and the more risks you face.  On average, it is considered that application development should take 2-3 months.  If you need more time to develop - you can release it with the minimum necessary set of functions, and the remaining features can be included in the application updates. <br><br>  Remember - the application must be SIMPLE, the application is good when it is WELL IMPLEMENTATION ONLY ONE THING. <br><br>  You can add new features to the application based on the feedback of users, this will keep the demand for your application at a high level. <br><br>  Do not set impossible tasks for yourself (such as writing Infinity Blade alone). <br><br>  Remember - maybe you will encounter a lot of resistance as you approach the implementation of the last 10% of the application (they say that the last 10% of the implementation requires 90% of the time), FIGHT! <br><br><h5>  5) How will people interact with your application? </h5><br>  After all the work done, you need to develop the most convenient interface for the application.  For successful work in this direction it is necessary to consider options for sketching the user interface.  And remember the success of the application directly depends on its convenience for the user.  The application should be simple and beautiful. <br><br><h4>  <b>Development phase</b> </h4><br>  In the process of developing an application, you can do some things that can increase the success of your application: <br><br>  1. Forming rumors about the application <br>  2. Creating a teaser trailer <br>  3. Writing a vaccination <br>  4. Integrating Analytics APIs <br>  5. Push Notifications and News Feed Integration <br>  6. Adding ‚Äúpopular‚Äù features <br><br>  And now, in order of each: <br><br><h5>  1) Forming rumors about the application </h5><br>  Often developers have a question - When to start marketing. <br>  This is what statistics answer to us: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c58/667/3e7/c586673e70a02507b5a748101c606495.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are some advantages of starting marketing work, towards the end of the application development: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ You may have a good effect as if from a new application - will fall on the crest of a wave <br>  ‚Ä¢ You will have something to show, rather than in the initial stages (because the project is almost ready) <br>  ‚Ä¢ It is easier to first finish the development, and then proceed to marketing, rather than engage in everything at the same time and be torn between different directions. <br>  ‚Ä¢ You are absolutely sure that you will complete the project. <br><br>  There are advantages to those developers who start marketing from the very beginning: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ You start to interact with the target audience very early, which in turn can help you hone the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour project <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can help form rumors about your application right from the start. <br>  ‚Ä¢ By the time of release, people will already know about your application, which makes it more desirable to download <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can assemble a group of potential beta testers of the application in advance. <br><br>  The choice of approach to marketing is determined separately for each application. <br><br>  To attract potential audience to your project, you can use the following services: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Start a blog and upload information and content related to the application being developed to it. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Visit and write on forums where you can advertise your application. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Twitter, Facebook, Vkontakte <br>  ‚Ä¢ YouTube <br>  ‚Ä¢ If users subscribe to you and advertise you, give them something in return <br><br><h5>  2) Creating a teaser trailer </h5><br>  Here is what the statistics say about using teasers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b2/eae/e7d/9b2eaee7d63b90268279e885ec2d4932.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Teaser creates intrigue and dramatically increases interest in your application. <br><br><h5>  3) Writing a vaccination </h5><br>  Graft allows you to draw the attention of potential buyers for you and your application. <br><br><h5>  4) Integrate Analytics APIs </h5><br>  This will help you to track the popularity of your application, allow you to analyze its sales and the possibilities of their improvement. <br><br><h5>  5) Integrate Push Notifications and News Feed </h5><br>  This simple thing in implementation will help ‚Äúopen the door‚Äù to each of your users. <br>  Here is what the statistics tells us about the use of these capabilities by developers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b8/cdb/3b2/2b8cdb3b235da719aa061e76425b4854.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  6) Adding ‚Äúpopular‚Äù features </h5><br>  Such as: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Beta testing <br>  ‚Ä¢ Game Center <br>  ‚Ä¢ Excellent UI <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bowl of user achievements <br>  ‚Ä¢ Feedback Support <br>  ‚Ä¢ Multiplayer <br>  ‚Ä¢ etc. <br><br>  Link to the source: <br>  <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com/11359/how-to-market-and-promote-your-games-and-apps-part-1">www.raywenderlich.com/11359/how-to-market-and-promote-your-games-and-apps-part-1</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144733/</a></p>
