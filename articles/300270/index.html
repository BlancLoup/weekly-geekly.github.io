  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Source of free ideas for startups</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The world's largest transport company Uber does not own cars, the popular social network FB does not generate content, and there is no inventory on the balance sheet of the richest retailer in the world, Alibaba.  The founders of startups that initiated these businesses are neither smarter nor richer than others, but they turned out to be more efficient, knowing that to generate new ideas it is not necessary to be a genius, but to be able to analyze all the data available to the company. <br><br> <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/hpe/blog/25693/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/cc6/a1e/cf8/cc6a1ecf879724132fd78d7ad8aa553e.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the coming years, the digital transformation will determine the development strategy of the entire IT industry: mobility, clouds, Big Data, the Internet of things and predictive analytics will provide companies with competitive advantages and significantly reduce the cost of bringing new products and services to the market.  Most company executives agree that the delay in business adaptation to work in the digital era of death is similar, however, as noted <a href="https://megamozg.ru/company/hpe/blog/24780">in the article</a> , in order to avoid the company's collapse in the new environment, it is necessary to change the IT infrastructure, protect digital assets, and adapt employees to work in the digital age and Finally, use all available data effectively. <br><br>  Digital transformation no longer requires simply storing data for subsequent leisurely analysis, but their processing in real time.  By 2020, thanks only to the Internet of Things, the amount of stored data will increase by 6-7 times, but the effectiveness of their use will depend on how businesses are transformed into data-driven enterprises.  The creators of Uber, FB and Avito realized this before others, recognizing in time that value is brought by the analysis of combinations of various information, and you can collect, understand, analyze, establish hidden connections using the Empower the Data-Driven Organization approach - providing organizations with new analysis-based capabilities. data.

      All the companies mentioned use the HPE Big Data Platform, which can rightly be called a data monetization platform.  It is based on two integrated products: <a href="http://www.osp.ru/os/2011/10/13012223">HPE Vertica</a> - working with structured data (SQL), support for Python, R language, as well as all ETL tools from leading market players and <a href="http://www.osp.ru/os/2013/06/13036848">IDOL</a> - processing unstructured data, allowing customers and partners to quickly build from unified blocks composite analytical applications for solving a specific business problem.  When working with this platform, companies do not need special expertise in working with data - their time is spent on finding new ideas.  Today, there are more and more startups that build their business only on data, but Data Driven technologies appear in traditional companies, which are enabled by analytics to offer new products and services. <br><br>  The well-known Russian telecom operator applies the analysis of raw data from base stations to the segmentation of subscribers by age, the presence of a specific smartphone model and by car or public transport going to work from 9 to 10 am. <br><br>  The monetization platform allows for the route of these people to display targeted advertisements on billboards, targeted specifically at a specific group of customers.  It is clear that this significantly increases the effectiveness of campaigns to promote goods and services, in fact, opening a new page on the B2B and B2C market. <br><br>  The largest retail companies, using the monetization platform, analyze data from 3D cameras, evaluating the flow of customers to identify their requests and identify ‚Äúhot‚Äù zones in the sales area.  As a result, they change the order of goods in the hall, adjust the operation of cash registers, form offers for discounts in real time, and if at some point the number of children in the store increases, then the hall either broadcasts or monitors display advertising of goods corresponding to this age group.  In addition, as a result of recognizing the emotional state of customers, they can be offered to participate in various promotions. <br><br>  Collecting sensor readings from car insurance companies evaluate their client‚Äôs driving style, and then offer him discounts on policies or referrals to extreme driving courses. <br><br>  E-commerce companies and marketplaces, such as Avito, can use Vertica to filter ad content, eliminate duplication, and comply with regulatory requirements. <br><br>  The list of examples of specific monetization of data made on the basis of Operational Analytics (Vertica) and Service Manager Smart Analytics (IDOL) systems can be continued, but it is clear that traditional analytics are unlikely to allow finding similar business solutions, offering users only ‚Äúarchaeological‚Äù information, usually little impact on operational business.  The analyst can take the whole working day only to find the necessary information on all corporate information systems, and Vertica and IDOL can become tools for finding new ideas in real time, helping to find valuable data and automatically generate, for example, a presentation to the company's management. <br><br>  What exactly does a startup, usually knowing everything about its client, need to monetize this knowledge in real time?  A simple tool for testing hypotheses and generating ideas that does not require large resources for development and implementation is required.  Any startup can today get a full-featured <a href="https://my.vertica.com/community/">Vertica</a> configuration for free, and a free, for beginner businessmen, IDOL On Demand version from the cloud will allow analyzing media data with support for the Russian language and full-featured <a href="https://www.havenondemand.com/">search tools</a> .  Today, more than 50 Russian companies and over a dozen corporations are using the HPE Big Data Platform analytical tools to monetize available data, both from their own and from external sources. <br><br>  Any business today is customer-oriented, which means that a client can be acquired only by making an offer that is difficult to refuse, for example, by offering a lower price, or by guaranteeing a return of goods or services, and for this you need to learn how to work effectively with raw data, understand their meaning, to know everything about the client.  What is needed is not analytics, received by email once a month, but constant real-time analytics (‚Äúad hoc‚Äù), enriched with retrospective information and allowing non-specialists in IT to make decisions based on data. <br><br>  How do organizations manage their data and record data from external sources?  How not to lose the necessary information?  How to keep a client by collecting all the open information about him?  How not to miss the moment of launching a new product or service on the market?  How to find out when it should, and when there is no offer specific services to a specific client?  How to increase customer loyalty?  Answers to these and similar questions allows you to get a data monetization platform. <br><br>  Digital transformation is changing business - even in Russia, 3% of GDP today is already brought in by the digital economy, in other words, 2.2 trillion rubles.  the budget does not give hydrocarbons, and data.  Is it time for all domestic enterprises to think about this?  Business management based on outdated data can continue to be considered the norm, and business users should not be faced with IT‚Äôs task of providing real-time data decision support systems.  However, by 2018, 67% of developers worldwide will focus on business innovations, although so far only 33% of them are.  Already today, such former startups as Square, Stripe, Landing Club, Prosper and SoFi, ‚Äúeat lunch for bankers of traditional financial institutions‚Äù, and if you don‚Äôt want to repeat the fate of the latter, take a closer look at the means of discovering new ideas for your business,. based on data analysis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300270/</a></p>
