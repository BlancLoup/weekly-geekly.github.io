  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Geocontext and marketing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Given: Saturday.  Beautiful sunny day.  You are in the city center, you need to pick up the booked tickets for the concert, give the boots for repair, withdraw money from an ATM, buy food for yourself and the cat.  Turn on the iPhone, open the map, determine your location.  You drive in the search box ‚Äúshoe repair‚Äù, ‚ÄúATM‚Äù, ‚Äúcash desk on Tsvetnoy Boulevard‚Äù, ‚ÄúRoyal Canin‚Äù (I do not eat Whiskas, you have to walk separately for food).  Find the nearest points, build the best route and go.  Optimize distance and time. <br><br>  Or.  In the evening beforehand, you list the To do list in your phone so that the reminder to withdraw money comes at the moment you pass by the ATM. <br><br>  Or.  You go to the hypermarket.  Your wife sends you a shopping list.  The application determines your location, searches for products from the list in the hypermarket and builds the best route: eggs here, milk to the right.

      Quite futuristic and geeky.  What unites all three examples?  Geolocation  The application determines the location of the user.  Such a simple function, but in marketing a coup. <br>  So, swap roles.  <b>What is a geo-referencing business?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Gartner forecasts, in 2012 the number of potential users of geoservices will reach 526 million. <br><br>  1. The most obvious application of geolocation technology found in transport systems: this is the management of cargo fleets, and tracking of employees' vehicles in the "fields", and monitoring the movement of employees themselves, and autonavigation systems. <br><br>  2. The ability to mark the places of sales of goods on the map (relevant for the FMSG-sector, catering, retail chains).  For example, already today a grocery chain can link its billboard with a logo, an address, a link to a website, a phone number and a discount coupon to a card.  Or the same Royal Canin can mark the points of sale with the logo in the POIdo system, and they will appear on Cartase Mail, in avtonavigators and in mobile applications. <br><br>  3. Advertise a product that is directly or indirectly related to the user's viewing of the map.  If a person is looking at a location map, he may need a taxi.  If he studies traffic jams, it is logical to offer him services for car owners, for example, refueling, car service, car wash, etc. <br><br>  4. Information about the geographic behavior of the user (location, movements, area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest), which can then be used both to build marketing communications and to highlight specific audiences.  For example, if it is known that a person lives in New Jersey, and works in New York, then he hardly needs a grocery store advertising in the city: few people will buy food for a week, two hours away from home. <br><br>  5. Promotions: You can promote a brand, for example, by announcing that the first person who finds a point on the map with a moving minibus, caught up with it and said a code word to the driver, receives a smartphone as a gift.  Involvement, resonance, brand promotion. <br><br><h5>  <b>Future</b> </h5><br>  Navigation in large shopping centers: laying a route to a specific product / brand or tracking the movement of customers in the center. <br><br>  The problem of laying a route directly to the doors of a particular store in high-rise malls or to a shelf with the necessary goods in hypermarkets (you enter the shopping list in the application, and the application plots the route from the goods to the goods) has not yet been completely resolved. <br><br>  Today, the introduction of technology is hampered by problems with receiving a GPS signal indoors: the walls of a building shield it.  The Russian company Spirit DSP last year developed a positioning technology for a weak and reflected signal, but for processing weak signals, a powerful processor with a clock frequency of about 3 GHz is needed ‚Äî as long as it is a laptop level.  However, the developer of processors for mobile devices, the company ARM, has already announced the release of a processor for a phone with a clock frequency of 2.5 GHz, so this future is not far off.  In addition, there are already GPS-signal repeaters installed on the roof of a building that distribute the signal indoors, but they have not reached Russia yet. <br><br>  Another solution for in-store navigation and monitoring the movement of customers in the store was found by the ShopKick application in the USA.  For users, the program integrates the social component with a hunt for discounts: automatically checks customers in the system‚Äôs partner stores, issues virtual kickboxes (which can later be exchanged for real discounts or products) and allows you to share your product impressions with the world.  Marketers also collect very valuable demographic information about customers (collected by the application during installation) and their route through the store.  In principle, the technology allows you to control the behavior of the consumer, prompting routes and paying attention to the right products. <br><br>  Some of these technologies are already working today (geo-context advertising, the ability to put a billboard on a map), while the other cases described are currently available only in the US - the same shopping list, which is transformed into a route through the store.  In any case, the interest of such large companies - trendsetters to geo, like Google, Facebook, Twitter and VKontakte leaves no doubt about the promising direction. <br><br>  What do you think about the future of geo-technology? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110503/</a></p>
