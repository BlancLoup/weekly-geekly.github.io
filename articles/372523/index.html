  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia grew by 10 cm in 100 years: a study of the growth of the inhabitants of 200 countries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since 1914, Russian women have grown by 11.7 centimeters, and men - by 9.5 centimeters.  A study of the average height of 18-year-old men and women over the past hundred years has shown the effect on growth of such factors as nutrition, hygiene and health care of specific countries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dda/144/55e/dda14455e77d1903d28c0fd0a9afc949.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Scientists from Imperial College London have processed about one and a half thousand sources, including government studies on public health and military data.  <a href="http://www.ncdrisc.org/country-profile.html">The result was</a> information on average growth and its change from 1914 to 2014 for 18-year-olds from 200 countries. <br><br>  South Korean women (by 20 centimeters) and Iranian men (by 16.5 centimeters) grew the most.  And American men in the 1960s stopped growing altogether: in 1914 they were in third place in terms of height, and a hundred years later they were on the 37th.

      Men from South Africa grew only 1.4 centimeters over the century.  The reason for this could be the economic situation in Africa in the 1980s.  Due to the health crisis that followed, as well as poor nutrition, many children could not fully realize their growth potential. <br><br>  Latvian women are the highest - their average height was 169.8 centimeters.  Among men champions - the Dutch with 182.5 cm tall.  At the other end of the spectrum, men from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">East Timor</a> were the shortest with 159.8 cm of height, and Guatemales became the lowest women ‚Äî their average height was 149.4 centimeters. <br><br>  The average height of Russian women in 1914 was 153.6 centimeters.  In 2014 - 165.3, an increase of 11.7 centimeters.  Men grew only 9.5 centimeters, from 167 to 176.5 centimeters.  Ukrainians grew by 12.3 cm to 166.3, Ukrainians - by 10.8 cm to 178.5.  Residents of Belarus were higher by 12.3 cm, their average height was 166.3 cm, Belarusians grew by 10.7 cm to 178.4 cm. <br><br>  The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jul/26/tall-story-men-and-women-have-grown-taller-over-last-century-study-shows">publishes</a> full tables for both genders. <br><br>  The authors of the study say that the reasons for the increase in growth were the achievements of countries in the field of medicine, the availability of a varied diet and hygiene.  Genetics have a great influence on the growth of an individual, but the average population growth depends on it to a lesser extent.  The population of many countries will grow about the same if it is in the same conditions. <br><br>  Growth gains benefits.  Firstly, high growth is associated with longer life expectancy.  Secondly, it reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  Third, statistically, high people have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/08/genetic-study-shows-mens-height-and-womens-weight-drive-earning-power">an average higher income</a> , high men are more attractive to the opposite sex.  There are also disadvantages - studies have revealed increased risks of a number of oncological diseases. <br><br>  The global growth trend has important implications.  ‚ÄúOur growth today is highly dependent on the environment in which we grew up.  In turn, our growth affects our longevity and our health.  If we give children a better start in life now, they will be healthier and more productive for decades to come, ‚Äùsays study co-author James Bentham. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372523/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372523/</a></p>
