Reload ideas</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this publication, I would like to talk about my experience of interacting with the Android system, about the transition from an ordinary user of Google phones to developers and about working on creating an application.  Immediately I will clarify, it will not be about utilities or games, but the development of Android launcher. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78c/17d/71e/78c17d71e103463d8311815abb3e4c5d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  From Symbian to Android </h4><br>  So, I tasted the ‚Äúgreen robot‚Äù in 2010.  My first device on Android was the legendary, though not so popular at the time (hi Desire), HTC Legend.  The metal handsome pleased me for a long time not only with his appearance, but also with fresh experience of interaction with a smartphone.  And, believe me, it was really well felt after the dominance of Finnish pipes with Symbian on board.  Separately, it is worth noting the shell HTC Sence, which at that time gave a lot of points handicap solutions from competitors.  I do not accidentally emphasize the shell and later you will understand why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After some time, the pleasant feeling of owning the HTC Legend turned into a strong brand loyalty.  In choosing a new device, I did not think about it: Desire S, and later HTC One, replaced the Legend.  And everything would be fine, but:

    <ul><li>  upset the sluggishness of HTC with the release of new firmware; </li><li>  Sence's shell developed a bit in the wrong direction, as I would like; </li><li>  and the last thing that put me off was the marriage in my last two tubes. </li></ul><br>  Well, and if to be quite frank, there was also a more important point, which played its part in HTC's shaky commitment - Android 4.1.  The design of the new OS, the speed of its work, bribed.  I no longer wanted to dwell on the HTC Sence.  Yuzat naked Android, I decided on the "real" Google Phone.  And I got, as it seems to me, the first successful device from this line - the Nexus 4 model. <br><br>  The hardware in the phone worked fine, the software was updated in a timely manner.  It would seem, what more could you ask for?  And I already wanted something of my own. <br><br><h4>  From user to developer </h4><br>  Books, forums, mastering the SDK and sleepless nights.  At first I released a simple widget.  Then I decided to lean on skins for popular applications.  It was easy to do them, but the main thing was that everything was simple with monetization - if you make a good topic for such a popular app, such as exDialer, you do not need to think about its promotion.  Users of the application have enough, as well as those who want to pull on it a new, current shell.  Fortunately, the list of topics available in the market could be accessed from the application itself.  My themes sold well and that was a bribe.  I probably would have continued in the same vein, but I ‚Äúoverdid‚Äù somewhere, violating one of the many points in Google‚Äôs policy.  My developer account was ruthlessly banned.  And if the development, even of such simple applications as skins, was a good experience for me, then the Google Ban became an excellent lesson. <br><br><h4>  From software garbage to a serious project. </h4><br>  For a while, having gone down, I decided to move on.  And then the question, "what"?  I needed an idea.  I didn‚Äôt want to make the game, and I didn‚Äôt feel the strength in myself.  To make a good game, you need to be an avid gamer yourself.  And I couldn‚Äôt brag about it, as well as phenomenal knowledge in programming, game design, etc.  I did not have a big budget.  I also thought of a ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù dialer, SMS client or organizer, but the existing solutions in the Market more than suited me.  I never figured out how to make them better. <br><br>  Going into a dead end, I started a ‚Äúbrainstorm‚Äù from the beginning.  And then there was the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa launcher, which could be the very same phone call, SMS client, and anything else at all.  It's great that the idea came not one, but together with clear pictures in my head, the mechanics of work and the way of monetization.  Enlisting the support of a talented developer, we started to work.  Now about everything in order. <br><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  Perhaps, to someone the essence of the idea will seem disgracefully simple.  Perhaps someone has already met a similar product (as I did not try, I could not find anything like it).  The idea is this: I ‚Äúthrew‚Äù standard icons of labels from the lower bar, and in their place put a ribbon with smart tiles, each of which can be like the same label, so something much bigger.  The familiar functionality of the staff launcher remained in place. <br><br>  The name was born of itself "SlideUP", which is translated into Russian and denotes the action that activates the main highlight of the launcher. <br><br>  Take for example the label of the Phone.  In the standard launcher, we click - we get into the Phone application.  In my version is the same.  The difference is that you can not only click on the icon, but also snap it up, thus opening a small curtain with additional features.  And here everything is logical, pulled the tiles of the Phone - got to the list of selected subscribers.  Or pulled over the camera - they opened the last shots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/566/63e/b6b/56663eb6b1904b27beb9d10ac3ca6bef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By clicking on the ‚ÄúAll Apps‚Äù shortcut, you can go to the list of all applications installed on your smartphone, or you can tap and open the list of the most needed ones.  And you can poke around in the settings to find the right toggle switch, or you can just pull the right tile. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90c/fe5/980/90cfe5980fd04a8ab78895397db26213.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here many may notice that they say there is an upper curtain with similar functionality and they will be right.  But I also have something to object to, holding in my hand, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Note, can you reach the top curtain with your thumb?  Not.  And my tape at the very bottom of the screen, and therefore in the zone of reach of a finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6e/4f7/58b/c6e4f758b45f474cbcd6c1ce0a5952ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I imply that a legitimate question may arise about ordinary widgets, or rather, about the fact that, in essence, this is the same as the ‚Äúfilling‚Äù of my tiles.  Yes, in part this is so, but by design all the widgets are seriously different and, placing them on the same screen, you can get a not entirely aesthetic picture.  Of course, this is a subjective opinion, but it also has the right to life. <br><br><h5>  Monetization </h5><br>  And then everything is simple.  My tiles are a kind of blocks that you can buy from personal preference.  The launcher itself will be free with a set of four basic tiles: Phone, Messaging, All Apps, and Camera.  Additional tiles can be installed from Google Play separately, in the first stage I plan to release tiles for Settings, Weather and Music Player.  Then it can be Organizer, Notes and even tiles for popular social networks.  Links to additional tiles in the market will be displayed in the settings of the launcher itself.  Such a peculiar in-app purchase, difficulties in advancing tiles should not arise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fa/3d0/075/3fa3d00754e240d8bc8ec57e8c6dc44a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Difficulties </h5><br>  Of course, with the implementation of the idea was not so smooth.  The first version of the launcher has already entered the <i>beta</i> stage and I have something to say.  Pitfalls turned out to be even more than I could imagine.  This includes the implementation of gestures on the desktop and access to some system functions.  And taming the camera, sharing with SMS and Hangouts.  The topic is capacious enough to disassemble it in this post.  I would love to make out each problem and its solution in a separate material, if I am given the opportunity.  I think many of my achievements will be useful. <br><br><h5>  Plans </h5><br>  Now I am actively testing launcher, polishing the functionality already laid, so that you can put a stable version on Google Play.  But the plans for the next stage are already clearly understood.  The main thing that needs to be done, in addition to working on new tiles, is to save the launcher from the "children's sores": <br><br><ul><li>  add migration assistant from other launchers; </li><li>  provide launcher with the ability to make backup copies of settings, so that if necessary you can easily return to the usual form; </li><li>  organize work with desktops; </li><li>  There are thoughts about the refinement of the design of some elements. </li></ul><br><h5>  Feedback </h5><br>  Work on the launcher is still in full swing and it is never too late to rethink and fix something.  I very much hope for practical advice and comments, the good, the Habrahabr audience has always been famous for its professionalism in such matters.  I am pleased to answer all questions. <br><br>  <b>UPD 1:</b> Uploaded a demo video on YouTube: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/42weYda51Aw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjHxOasZThg0oU916F7BsJOsqFaVA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>UPD 2:</b> The project is now on Kickstarter, for those who are interested, here is the link: <a href="http://kck.st/10J6bNF">kck.st/10J6bNF</a> <br><br>  <s><b>UPD 3:</b> Those who wish to take part in closed testing, which will be held a little later, please write in a personal or dstolbov@gmeil.com.</s> <br><br>  <s><b>UPD 4:</b> Friends, thank you very much to everyone who wrote to me yesterday about their desire to take part in testing the launcher.</s>  <s>Frankly, I could not even imagine that there would be so many people willing.</s>  <s>Habra is an amazing place with no less amazing people.</s>  <s>As promised, to everyone who sent the letter yesterday, I will send an installation file.</s>  <s>Unfortunately, I cannot accept more applications - I just cannot process this amount of information.</s>  <s>At least in the first stage.</s>  <s>Thanks again to everyone!</s> <br><br>  <b>UPD 5:</b> Published launcher on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dslideupdev.launcher.upl">Google Play</a> .
