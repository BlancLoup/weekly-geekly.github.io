But so far it is a kind of studio, from which various music is transmitted on the ‚Äúfat‚Äù channel.  At the moment, the administration otmazyvatsya that passes the "preformat", and in general it is only beta, but in their future plans, they have not yet decided. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  As it seems to me, 2.0 obliges the active participation of all listeners, moreover, technically it is not so difficult.  Winamp, which allows you to implement network broadcasts, has long maintained its resource on which there is (almost) a complete list of registered and not very online radio stations that broadcast in a variety of formats.  And here, I think, we need to give people the opportunity to broadcast their programs and music sets, right from home, the benefit of Winamp has already taken care of us. <br><br>  In the future, each author and musician who sounded on the air, assesses the public registered on the site.  It is naturally necessary to conduct preliminary auditions and small conversations in order to know what will go on the air.  Here are these thoughts, I was visited.  Perhaps the administration will come to this, but for now I don‚Äôt understand why there is a ‚Äúindex‚Äù 2.0 in the title.  Perhaps they are trying to figure out how to get money from all this, or maybe it is generally just a whim. <br></blockquote>

      It was my <b>IMHO</b> , relatively pilot project announced a month ago.  But, so that there were no fair comments by commentators, I decided to offer below my vision of a draft of this direction, which legitimately has an ‚Äúindex‚Äù of 2.0. <br><br>  In my opinion, the following should ideally be done.  Create a social network, once it is 2.0, the main feature of which is the direct "radio" broadcast on the network.  Technically, this can be done through a plug-in to Winamp, which allows you to broadcast audio to the network.  The plug-in is both for Win, and for * nix, OSes.  And each user of the network who installed this software and offered his own program, as described below, can potentially go on the air. <br><br>  Network users create topics in which they set out the topics, format and musical accompaniment of their program.  The rest of the users vote, correct and express their opinions about each published announcement.  Some of them may offer their assistance in organizing the program. <br><br>  Say, every weekend, for example, analyzing the data, the network administration, based on the discussions, plans a corresponding schedule of programs for the next week.  After conducting their program, users who are given "airtime" time receive feedback on the organization of their program, and its quality.  That, in turn, means either further development of this program and repeated ‚Äúbroadcasts‚Äù, or if users did not like the program, it is deleted from subsequent schedules. <br><br>  What is the difference between the ‚Äúlive broadcast‚Äù and the podcast, everything is very simple, when there is a broadcast, you can interact with the organizers of the program in real-time, unlike the dead MP3 downloaded after recording.  It also helps not only to revive the ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù, but also improves the quality of the ‚Äúproduct‚Äù prepared by users for the ‚Äúbroadcast‚Äù. <br><br>  Perhaps confused, but I tried to be as clear as possible. <br>  I would like to hear the opinion of the population about my guesswork and assumptions. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : I hope that UPDATE will make my thoughts more understandable, I apologize for the brevity and low content in the original version of the post ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46800/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46800/</a></p>
