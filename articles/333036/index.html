      The first step was examined Russian-speaking segment of the Internet.  It turned out that there are two organizations that seem to be engaged in the sale of Yubico products. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all - this is the site yubico.ru.  Currently it does not work.  (Hint - a direct link to the PDF file ‚Äú <a href="http://yubico.ru/pdf/yubikey_manual.pdf">yubikey_manual.pdf</a> ‚Äù - in Russian, who needs it).  But at that moment, when I did the analysis and selection of the key seller, this site was still functioning.  However, even then I noticed a strange thing - modern devices were not presented on the website for sale - for example, the Yubikey 4 key that I was interested in. Also, old software versions were indicated in the description of existing products.  Moreover, the site offering a digital security product was on plain http.  And even more.  When I inquired about the possibility of buying a key in an e-mail correspondence, the answer came to me from the mail domain <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/mail/" class="user_link">mail</a> .ru. <br><br>  It was possible to make the assumption that the seller does not offer new devices.  The assumption turned out to be true, the site actually ceased work. <br><br>  The second organization that offered the sale of Yubikey was even stranger.  It is called <a href="https://thekernel.ru/yubico">&gt; the_kernel</a> .  I did not find the online store;  On the one hand, prices are the same as those of the manufacturer, but the lack of the ability to place an order, pay for it and wait for delivery was a little surprised.  For the XXI century it is - to put it mildly - weird.  Especially for those who do not like to follow the links, live in the First See, and want to have a Yubikey, I give contact information from the site.  Perhaps the data is still relevant.  Here they are: <br><br>  121357, Moscow, st.  Vereiskaya, 29, bld. 33, office D216.2 (BC Vereiskaya Plaza 3) Tel.  +7 499 648-8848 Email info [dot] ru [at] thekernel [dot] com Web <a href="http://www.thekernel.ru/">www.thekernel.ru</a> <br><br>  Here, on the <a href="https://toster.ru/q/257189">Toaster,</a> there is also a small branch on the acquisition of Yubico devices. <br><br>  One of the participants of the discussion (@Driwars) mentioned that the customs did not miss the key purchased on Amazon to the addressee.  Keep this in mind. <br><br>  So, in the Russian Federation the situation with retailing of Yubikey keys is less clear.  What can the western (for someone - eastern) market offer us? <br><br>  As a rule, the manufacturer can offer the lowest price, so it will be reasonable to search for the possibility of buying goods directly from Yubico.  However, given the cost of delivery, which can be a significant amount in the total value of the goods, it makes sense to look at other market players, for example - Amazon. <br><br>  Let's get started <br><br>  The question is - does Yubico directly sell devices?  The answer is yes, it does.  Opening the main page of the site <a href="http://www.yubico.com/">www.yubico.com</a> we see at the top of the button "BUY NOW", and when you click on it, <a href="https://www.yubico.com/store/">go</a> directly to the opportunity to buy goods.  This is already good!  In addition, we draw attention to the fact that when buying there is an opportunity to issue a discount - for <a href="https://www.yubico.com/github-special-offer/">GitHub</a> users and for <a href="https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-education/">students</a> .  As far as you can see, the discount is the same and is 20%, and this is very, very good! <br><br>  We proceed to the payment procedure, but before that we look at the delivery (Shipping).  And here - once - and we see this phrase: <br><br><blockquote>  * no shipping to: Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, Russia, Sudan, Syria </blockquote><br><br>  Wow!  How unexpected!  Russia between Iran and Sudan, in a pleasant neighborhood with North Korea and Syria ... For contrast, you can look through the list of countries where you can buy and get a device with delivery from Yubico. <br><br>  So what are the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/shipping-and-buying-information/">options</a> ?  For Russia - on the offside specified <a href="https://thekernel.ru/yubico">&gt; the_kernel</a> .  You can try to contact the representatives of this TNC. <br><br>  And what about the Amazon?  Let's take a closer look. <br>  We find in the search for Yubikey, change the country to Russian Federation to the right in the field ‚ÄúShip to‚Äù and see the following in the field of product description and delivery: <br><br><blockquote>  This item does not ship to Russian Federation. </blockquote><br><br>  Like this. <br><br>  What to do if you still want to have a Yubikey device for testing or functional use? <br><br>  There may be several options: <br><br>  1. If you have the opportunity for work or on a personal initiative to go abroad, go there and buy there.  Or, having previously paid for the goods and delivery, either on vacation or through friends and acquaintances. <br>  2. Ask your friends / relatives / colleagues / friends living abroad to buy the device and send it to you.  Terms agree themselves. <br>  3. Use the services of forwarding.  Type of Shopotam and Bandera.  I think there is nothing illegal in this. <br>  4. Barter.  Say, with the Hindus.  You give them the code, they give you the key. <br>  5. Something else.  Insert your own point. <br><br>  What up to me?  How did I buy the key?  I used clause 3, having considered all expenses beforehand.  Total, in the implementation turned out like this: <br><br>  the cost of the key Yubikey4: $ 40 <br>  discount: - $ 8 <br>  Delivery to the address in USA: $ 5 <br>  tax: $ 2.88 <br>  total - output from Yubico: $ 39.88 <br><br>  Shipping Services: $ 5.78 (and I think this is a very humane cost) <br><br>  In total, the total is $ 45.66, which is 2,735.52 rubles at the current rate. <br><br>  Successes! <br><br>  PS There is a new product line.  <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/">There was a</a> key with a USB-C interface. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333036/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333036/</a></p>
