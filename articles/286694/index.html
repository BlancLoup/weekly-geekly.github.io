Usually the situation is somewhat different, but this year the demand for equipment was not rising very actively.  Probably the reason - the crisis and the desire of buyers to save money.  At the same time, the fall in demand is expressed in units of goods sold, but the market volume in money terms is growing.  This is due to the devaluation of the ruble. <br><br>  Different companies selling appliances, the situation is also different.  For example, the company Candy sales of washing machines fell by 30%.  This was stated by the managing director of the company in Russia, Anton Kharin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúM.Video‚Äù doubled sales of budget categories of devices: mp3-players, electronic readers, photo frames.  In addition, sales of budget smartphones are also growing, growth in this category was 45%.

      Euroset reports that from February 9 to March 8 of this year, 3 million phones, smartphones and tablets were sold in Russia.  In piece terms, this is 3% (100 thousand devices) less than last year.  But in monetary terms, sales rose to 22 billion rubles, which is 16% more than last year.  The vice-president of the company, Viktor Lukanin, said that over the holiday week, the smartphone market has shrunk by 5% in quantitative terms, and has grown by 10% in monetary terms.  The cell phone market fell by 28% in physical terms and increased by 25% in cash, tablets - by 1% increased in "pieces" and the sales in rubles increased by 21%. <br><br>  The ‚Äúre: Store‚Äù network confirms the decline in sales of smartphones and tablets in piece terms.  But net sales during the holidays increased by 49%. <br><br>  Another retail chain shows a drop in iPhone sales by 25%.  The company associates the fall with the rise in price of smartphones by 70%. <br><br>  Samsung, in order to increase sales, decided to reduce marketing payments to retailers, reducing the price of products.  This is done in order not to lose share in a falling market.  For example, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, thus, is now sold for 45 thousand rubles, which is 5 thousand rubles more than at the beginning of the year. <br><br>  For the fourth quarter of 2014, sales of household and computer equipment showed the maximum growth over the entire monitoring period.  So, for this period, sales in cash exceeded 500 billion rubles.  But in January, sales fell, and according to experts, there is a possibility that after April the volume of the market will begin to fall in monetary terms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286694/</a></p>
