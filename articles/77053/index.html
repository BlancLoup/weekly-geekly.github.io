      The article in a reduced form is distributed in <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4006823/The_Flashbulb_-_Soundtrack_To_A_Vacant_Life_%255B2008_MP3_V0_VBR%255D">torrent files</a> with the music of this musician, for example. <br><br>  I have always been interested in the view of copyright and piracy on the other side of the barricades, namely the point of view of the musicians themselves.  Since both the position of the RIAA and the position of the users of illegal content in general is known. <br><br>  Everything turned out to be much more complicated.  More than once I came across messages, and I bought this album (on Amazon / aytyuns) and supported my favorite artist.  Hmm, are you sure about that? <br>  Picture to attract attention: <br><img src="http://hyperboloid.ru/doc/revolution_ru_files/image001.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Beg a few excerpts from the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  About Napster: <br>  ‚ÄúDigital music piracy already existed, but with Napster, everything became so damn easy ...‚Äù <br>  - America stopped buying music and a new industry appeared to make money on the general theft of albums of their favorite bands. <br><br>  About RIAA: <br>  - Anyone who engages in piracy of music (or was engaged) under the new law should RIAA $ 750 for each track downloaded and $ 150,000 for each track shared ... <br>  - 0% of the money from the proceedings fall into the artist's pocket. <br><br>  About consumers: <br>  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even going to deny that I‚Äôm sometimes tempted to smash a random person who praises my music:‚Äú I downloaded all your albums and ... ‚Äù. <br>  - The RIAA relied on music pirates to destroy the independent market, and the independent music fans did just that. <br><br>  About Amazon: <br>  - When I began to meet musicians who surpassed me in recognition and sales, I noticed that many of them were in a much worse financial condition. <br>  - So, is it possible that Best Buy, Amazon or Borders earned more than all of us together from the sale of one of my albums? <br><br>  About iTunes: <br>  - Since Apple opened iTunes, I sent them an email for an email, trying to find out how to put the content of my Alphabasic label on iTunes.  Over and over again, I filled out their forms, and they never honored me with a response.  Many of my friends are faced with a similar problem.  Of course, the majors had no problems getting on iTunes, and ran from a low start to pick artists with the help of new technologies. <br><br>  About Apple: <br>  - Last year, Apple‚Äôs website promoted iTunes as ‚Äúfair for an artist.‚Äù  Believe me, no one more than I despised Apple's false advertising tactics and unethical ways of doing business, but this was the last straw.  I started sending Apple emails and letters demanding to indicate the share of each artist in the iTunes interface, if Apple truly believes in its fairness.  This, of course, did not happen, but they removed their statements of justice from the site. <br><br>  Plan Z: <br>  - The recipe is simple.  Many of us - the artists - have fans who gladly buy and listen to our music.  It is time for a hunger strike for that part of the music industry that has treated us so badly, that, no matter how arrogant it sounds, needs us more than we do.  None of today's consumers will stop listening to their favorite group just because Circuit City (*** major CD shop) does not sell its CDs. <br><br>  Instead of an afterword: <br>  - As a rule, the best way you can support an artist is to buy his album directly from the record label, if possible <br><br>  <a href="http://hyperboloid.ru/doc/revolution_ru.htm">Full article (by Garin).</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77053/</a></p>
