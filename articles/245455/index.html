In addition, our brain is naturally sharpened to constantly digest information, and in the conditions of an artificial famine, it will start to finish building something on scraps that somehow reach from outside. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Boundary solutions:</b> listen to everything that comes from the world and not listen to anything ‚Äî two non-working extremes, since in the first case your input channels are overloaded and you lose the opportunity to adequately analyze the input information flow, and in the second you switch the brain to the listening mode and react too emotionally - like the crunch of a branch in the night forest, when the head immediately draws a bear / maniac in the dark, although you could not even hear or crush it in the darkness of the day. <br><br>  <b>A hybrid solution:</b> listen to everything, but filtering is very expensive in terms of resources: you still need to work and live once.  To remain functional and to control the situation, you need to skillfully and constantly understand not only the work and your tasks, but also 27/7 be an analyst included in the information field in order to quickly sift out improbable facts and understand who creates an information stuffing at a specific moment in time. or causes panic by another law in the field of taxes for individuals, for example. <br><br>  <b>Next is the usual task, not even from the theory of systems, but from mechanics:</b> <br><ul><li>  The engine (your brain) except gasoline, which runs, sucks air from the external environment.  In normal mode, this air is good and everything is fine.  Now in the air, which the engine needs is a mass of impurities (parasitic information that the brain processes as well as useful), because of its quality, the mixture drops and the engine as a whole works worse (you get distracted, argue about anything with your colleagues, think about global and processes not under your control - the quality of work and life falls) </li><li>  To control the entire environment, by definition, it is impossible: all surrounding people can dump waste into it (even just colleagues, not to mention traditional and Internet media) </li><li>  Not to feed the engine with air is impossible: the work stops, the engine begins to greedily swallow any air and it only gets worse </li><li>  What remains?  To give air directly from the engine to the engine: a clean flow of information that helps the engine to work well + reduces parasitic and increases the payload.  If you give a stream of air under pressure, the engine ceases to drain the air outside, where the pressure (flow of information) is less </li></ul><br><br><blockquote>  <i>With this model, we are really talking about the dynamics of the process, and this is planned for the next article in this series.</i>  <i>Comrades motorists, subarista and mechanics: please do not rush to the embrasure for such a free use of your favorite model of the world: this is the same descriptive use of the engine model as in the case of the globe, which we describe our small planet.</i>  <i>Let's return to the solution and check it first in statics.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Let's check this solution for sustainability</b> , so as not to rely only on our statements in its performance and consider the conditions under which it will work. <br><br>  Downloading useful information solves only one problem - free your head from what is stopping you and isolating you from ‚Äúinformational impurities‚Äù.  In order for new information to lead to a meaningful result, something else is needed. <br><br>  From the experience gained in the process of becoming managers, directors and entrepreneurs, from communicating with friends of top managers, the following picture emerged.  To get some result in life you need to a) do the <b>right thing</b> and b) <b>do the</b> <b>right thing</b> (what and how). <br><br>  <b>Do the right things + Do the things right.</b> <br><br>  We have already said that a sustainable way to reduce the number of "exported" on top of the headstocks and to be able to influence the processes in the system in which you are (company or department) is an upward movement.  For 7 years of work we have collected simple recommendations that help our students to move, get new positions and projects, implement the necessary changes. <br><br>  Our list was simple and short: 7 correct things and 8 principles on how to do these things correctly. <br><br>  <b>What are the 7 things you need to do:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  <b>To give a result</b> : the result must be given, a silver bullet "how to have positions and accomplishments without putting work" we do not know </li><li>  <b>Ensure the transparency of the process</b> : what is transparency and what do subordinates and managers think about us in each unit of time + how does this affect the results and pleasure on the way </li><li>  <b>Ensure the trust of the customer, the boss and the team</b> : there is such a thing as a ‚Äútax on trust‚Äù and then it goes off scale so that the work turns into hell, when you don't even want to think about how to do something different, just to wait pm and go home </li><li>  <b>Work with the customer</b> : trust, expectations, how to behave in case of problems, how to postpone deadlines and argue the point of view </li><li>  <b>Work with the manager</b> : trust, expectations, and all the same, with the amendment that this is your boss and that is no easier </li><li>  <b>Work with the team</b> : any manager or team leader ‚Äústands on the shoulders‚Äù of his team;  why, among some managers, the team is an engine to the results, while others have an anchor that firmly fastens the boat to the middle of the swamp ... </li><li>  <b>Working with yourself</b> : there is nothing sadder and more disgusting than a cool specialist who spent a lot of time and energy to become a leader or to pull a big piece of work and ... died on this top, having spent all his strength while climbing up </li></ol><br><br>  <b>How to do things right: 8 basic principles of growth</b> <br><br>  <b>1. Work in the long</b> <br><br>  One way or another, if you want to grow well, then you cannot do it without the help of other people. <br><br>  This does not mean that you need to tearfully beg them for help.  This means that their opinions about you and your work affect your future. <br><br>  Remember the old fact about the fact that all people in the world are connected to each other with no more than five handshakes?  Now we are not just connected, we can also communicate - through the social network.  And if someone wants to get feedback about you as a person, he can do it in 2 minutes.  In the 1st minute he will find someone to write to, and in the 2nd minute he will receive a review. <br><br>  If you give a result due to the fact that in the dark you are looking for colleagues or a customer, then what will happen to a career when this becomes known? .. And this will become known for sure. <br><br>  If you want to reach a new level of quality, then it‚Äôs worth working with people for a long time, thinking ahead about the impact your actions will have on your relationships with people.  From this principle the following follows: <br><br>  <b>2. Abandon manipulations</b> <br><br>  Manipulation is a hidden influence on a person in order to achieve some of his goals.  We will not go into technical methods, disassemble light manipulations and heavy ones.  talk about the levels of the picture of the world, the roles played by the manipulators ... We will hook on the key word - hidden. <br><br>  Everything hidden sooner or later becomes apparent.  And when a person, having cooled down from the discussion, realizes that he made the decision on emotions, and you have caused emotions, he will have a feeling that he has been led.  Or deceived. <br><br>  How will this affect your long-term relationship?  What will he then say if he is asked to give feedback on you? .. <br><br>  In addition, people standing around will come across less and less.  Life is too short to spend on working with unpleasant people.  People who steal your positive attitude and your good emotions. <br><br>  And here it is worth noting that some people also steal time.  From here we will derive two more principles: <br><br>  <b>3. Write on the case</b> <br><br>  It's amazing to see how many people swear in the mail.  social networks and other forums.  We try not to write negative - for several reasons: <br><br>  but.  This delays the solution of the question - a person turns on emotions, and then logic is turned off.  Further, he begins to defend himself from his trophy poop, moving further and further away from the essence of the discussion. <br><br>  b.  It is not clear how a person will perceive it.  If God forbid, he will have a hypertensive crisis, or when he comes home he will fall for the children - this is not good.  Why should it happen because of you?  Among other things, the person remains emotional sediment.  And if we work in the long run, then this sediment should be positive, not negative. <br><br>  at.  Everything that is written on the Internet remains on the Internet.  So, when our children grow up, they may want to read what their father and mother wrote there.  I'd like to see from the pages of the written they see calm, positive, confident people, and not slippery trolls. <br><br>  Public discussions in the same way can be seen by your future employers or clients.  Will they then work with you?  No one will say in advance. <br><br>  If a conflict begins in the mail, it is much better to call or go to the person personally.  The conflict immediately resolves. <br><br>  <b>4. Speak shortly</b> <br><br>  Once upon a time our good friend the director formulated his life credo: ‚ÄúTalk less, do more.‚Äù People can listen to you for a long time and carefully, but they will still look at things. <br><br>  Therefore, it is not worth spending a lot of time on discussions.  Spend them better on business.  And so that words take less time - you need to prepare for conversations.  Pick up arguments, think over the conversation, be able to pick out a constructive grain in the words of the interlocutor, be able to flesh out his and his point of view.  But this can be learned, it is not difficult. <br><br>  <b>5. Do not forget anything</b> <br><br>  The best way to spoil relationships with people is to forget what they promised.  the discrepancy of expectations with reality always gives rise to unpleasant feelings: injustice and resentment. <br><br>  As an officer said there in an old Soviet joke: ‚ÄúComrade cadet, if you have a head like a toilet in which nothing lingers, get a notebook.  And better two - like mine. " <br><br>  Record, put reminders in the calendar and phone, keep promises.  That is how a trust builds up.  which then repeatedly returns. <br><br>  <b>6. To be clear</b> <b><br></b>  <b>7. Be consistent</b> <br><br>  Life is not a fairy tale, and you and I are not a hundred bucks to please everyone.  Making unpleasant decisions is part of the game.  And you will definitely do something unattractive to other people: reductions, dismissals, making other decisions, etc. <br><br>  But people do not need pleasantness - they need clarity and expectation of your behavior.  A pleasant surprise is good.  And unpleasant - unfair.  Explain your actions and do it ahead of time - then people will take it with understanding, and your accumulated trust will not merge at one moment due to a non-negotiated decision. <br><br>  <b>8. Ecology and karma</b> <br><br>  Do you believe in karma?  Stupid question for people who have received technical education, and relying on knowledge, not on faith.  But in work with people this concept is for sure.  It is called in different ways: credit of trust, something else.  Essentially it does not change. <br><br>  According to the results of communication with you people, your actions, people begin to treat you either better or worse.  And then you become either easier to work with them and negotiate, or more difficult. <br><br>  The idea is that if you work with people in the long run, then it‚Äôs rather silly not to think about this karma.  Popular wisdom formulated it a long time ago: ‚ÄúNot a shit where you live.‚Äù We will say more modernly: ‚ÄúBe eco-friendly.‚Äù But the essence is the same. <br><br>  <b>Summarizing.</b> <br><br>  Understanding the rules and models does not say what to do.  And there is a gap or a phase transition between knowledge and actions. <br><br>  A short illustration: many of us can explain and understand the principle of operation of an internal combustion engine, but it‚Äôs not clear where to start, what to grind in what order and how to assemble to get a working engine.  There is no process, sequence, step by step formula. <br><br>  And about this: how the transition from principles to practice takes place, how to make knowledge work, which helps us in the implementation of long-term projects and how more than a third of our students achieve atypical and, sometimes, truly amazing results we will discuss in the next issue of this cycle. <br><br>  <b>What we have disassembled at the moment:</b> <br><ol><li>  How does a state or business system behave in relation to you at the moment of crisis? </li><li>  How the situation developed in 2008 and counter-examples of crisis thinking, behavior and results </li><li>  Solution in statics: counter-loading information that is tested and useful in perspective (knowledge) </li></ol><br><br>  <b>What else will be in this cycle of materials:</b> <br><ol><li>  <b>Dynamic solution</b> : your efforts must be capitalized.  The transition between theory and practice - increasing your income and changing positions to more responsible ones.  Our offer: a long-term program of study and transition. </li><li>  <b>On December 16th (BT), at 11-00 MSK,</b> we will conduct an online presentation of the new Stratoplan School of Management annual program, which was designed by us taking into account all the principles and ideas that we parse in this cycle of materials. </li><li>  Sign up now to not miss and forget: it's free and takes less than 30 seconds: <a href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1202720948275279617">attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1202720948275279617</a> </li></ol><br><br>  Do not switch.  Before communication! <br><br>  - <br>  <b>Respectfully,</b> <br>  Alexander Orlov, Slava Pankratov <br>  Managers School Stratoplan </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245455/</a></p>
