  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Calculation of trust rating in rubles of the Russian Federation (and other currencies). Society of trust and economy of trust</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúDo you respect me ?!‚Äù - a rhetorical question.  ‚ÄúDo you trust me?‚Äù - it is also always given how rhetorical and that already smacks of manipulation. <br>  How to determine exactly the trust between people?  For centuries, philosophers have been thinking about this ... And how much money can you trust your friend?  Spouse (y)? .. So ... <br>  In modern society and business, management costs are extremely high, and all this is well managed ... not very well. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The cost of operating control systems is so high that they absorb most of the surplus product of the systems managed.  They (costs) make up to 50% of the product produced (we look at the aggregate tax rate, it is painfully the same in different countries).  Same thing in business. <br>  And another 400-500 years ago, in a dense feudal world, all control was enough for 10-20% of GDP (royal / church tithe or day corvee).  Taking into account population growth and labor productivity, management costs, in absolute terms, increased over the period of modernity in HUNDREDS (!) TIME. <br>  Attention, question!  How to <s>gnaw red tape</s> to reduce management costs?  I have been thinking about this for several years.  One technology is understandable - it is the acceleration of information circulation, through the introduction of IT.  The faster and more complete the information on the ‚Äúnervous system‚Äù of society and enterprise, the higher the quality of decisions, the lower the costs of overcoming ‚Äúmanagerial friction‚Äù. <br>  What other ways are there?  A significant part of the management resource is spent on checking incoming information.  This makes it necessary to duplicate information channels (to produce states), to double-check reports (to produce more states), to work out complex decision-making procedures (delaying adoption to infinity).  The reason is that there is no exact confidence in the quality of information sources, communication channels, and executive elements.  Moreover, the share of authenticity / uncertainty is also not known in advance: we do not know in advance who exactly transmitted the information and who distorted it (hello to Parkinson).  Initially, ‚Äúbefore the first flight‚Äù - there is no data on whether a specific employee is a quality element of the system or not. <br><br>  That is, another reserve to reduce ‚Äúmanagerial friction‚Äù is precisely the optimization of personal risks, that is, an increase in CONFIDENCE between the participants of the system. <br><br>  How to determine the measure of confidence in a particular person?  At the level of ‚Äúdo you respect me ?!‚Äù is a rhetorical question.  But how much to hang in grams? <br>  Such a scheme occurred to me. <br>  Let's start with the fact that we will create a game in the existing social networks: ‚ÄúTrust Network‚Äù, where we will offer each participant to determine how much money he is willing to entrust to each of his friends, pop stars, politicians.  That is, the rating of each member of the Trust Network will be determined by the <b>trust trust</b> - the amount of money that the principal (I, you and any member of the network) can trust the other member (trusted).  This is realized by the possibility of direct acceptance (without my consent) by this trusted person to write off the amount specified by me from my game account.  (Upd :) In essence - this is the conclusion of a contract of guarantee for a person for a specified amount. <br>  So we will measure trust in a specific amount - the amount of money that I / we / you are ready to entrust to a specific person. <br>  If a person did not live up to your trust, let him down, threw you away from him your credibility REMOVE.  That is, the more a particular person trusts other people, the more money he can dispose of.  And if he is optional, changeable, deceitful, then his credit will quickly fall to insignificant proportions. <br>  On a large scale, it is already possible to institutionalize such obligations, for example, to allow participants to link their ‚Äútrust‚Äù account to real accounts in social networks and to dispose of real money. <br>  Then the model of a ‚Äútrust society‚Äù is obtained, where the most ethical, honest people dispose of the largest sums of money, and not like now.  And further, new users will join the ‚Äúnetwork of trust‚Äù in order to: <br>  1. get and increase your trust rating, <br>  2. see the trust ratings of business (for example) partners. <br>  And this already creates a new market product - a ‚Äútrust rating‚Äù, with which, for example, you can come to a bank or to an investor.  Indeed, the investor has no risk of investing money in a person‚Äôs project if he sees that this money will be covered by that person‚Äôs ‚Äútrust network‚Äù.  Well, if no one trusts a person, then ... clearly ... <br>  So ‚Äúzones of trust‚Äù will arise - around some projects, ideas, people.  Some people will be included in several zones of trust, there will be ‚Äúbridges of trust‚Äù between different zones. <br>  Due to this, we can reach a new quality of economic relations - the ‚Äúeconomy of trust‚Äù, where the level of reliability of a partner is known in advance, by the trust of other people towards it.  That is, within the ‚Äúnetwork of trust‚Äù, personal business risks will be reduced by several times, which will make doing business within the network more profitable than outside, which will attract more new participants. <br>  And then - it will open up prospects for a "new honesty," just now comparable to the "interplanetary chess tournament in New Vasyuki ..." :) <br>  Of course, ‚Äútrust networks‚Äù already exist in different versions: in families, in companies of friends.  A ‚Äúnetwork of relative trust‚Äù can be called any business corporation, a certain level of trust exists within professional associations.  It is important to make trust measurable, and existing networks to be interconnected. <br>  To the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ‚ÄúNetwork of Trust‚Äù I was pushed by the ideas of the ‚Äúzones of trust‚Äù by D. Peskov aka Sartac. <br>  ... And then the business is to write a game for social networks.  I'll do it after the New Year, I invite you to participate. </div>
