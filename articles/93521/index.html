And even the most successful projects obviously achieve financially less significant results than construction, trade, work in government agencies, etc.  I do not have clear statistics (and there are none), but decide for yourself when a car for 100-150 thousand cu parks at your house  - what are the first ten occupations that come to mind?  and ten more?  and more? ... when the list of those who can potentially afford such a machine will be the owner of an IT company? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why so?  All solid idiots and do not know how to work?  Or around all the enemies and do not give a new way?  Mega corporations seized power and crush competitors?

      Without pretending to be objective and based only on personal experience (for six years at Microsoft, development of a partner network + two successful IT startups) I give a rating of top-1o problems you need to know: <br><br>  1) Team.  Most large companies take people on low wages, using their name and potential benefits for the employee (experience in a large company, growth prospects, correct entry in the Trudovik).  Consequently, in order to hire really standing professionals in a startup you will have to pay a lot compared to your expectations.  Or it is long and difficult to look for not only employees, but also like-minded people, which slows down the hiring process very much. <br><br>  2) Starting capital.  Initially, it seems that you can start with a table and two chairs.  But in fact it is better to outsource all domestic problems - otherwise at some point you will find that you are not earning money while standing in line at the tax (and therefore the business is doomed).  Very many things require initial investment (team, training, branding, office, website, etc.).  Without them, the business immediately positions itself as very immature - Customers pay less - it is more difficult with payback and promotion.  IMHO without a million rubles should not begin.  At a minimum, the ability to earn that same million at the start is a good test before the organization of the company. <br><br>  3) Your knowledge.  It requires a terribly rare fusion of IT knowledge (obviously needed), managerial skills (there are few of these in our camp, in all industries) and sales (yes, the first commandment is that the director provides most of the sales, it‚Äôs impossible to hire salespeople). <br><br>  4) Idea.  Lack of business knowledge often leads to an inability to assess the financial prospects of your startup.  Saw millions of examples.  It seems that people forget the simplest math when they discuss their favorite idea.  Consult with someone experienced, better from no IT business. <br><br>  5) The will to win.  One of the well-known theories of management says that starting any new business in the beginning we ‚Äúlight up‚Äù and live on the drive, and then in 3-6 months comes an understanding of the complexity and tediousness of the business we are engaged in.  This period must be experienced; after acquiring the necessary skills, everything will be better.  But many companies and ideas burn in this difficult period. <br><br>  6) The ability to admit their mistakes.  It seems to many that ‚Äúeverything on the map‚Äù is a mistake and an end, companies follow the original course regardless of anything.  But in fact, as a result, they lose the main advantage of a startup - mobility and flexibility. <br><br>  7) Legal insecurity.  If you work in the B2B market, then all your customers are bigger, sometimes capital, which binds you hand and foot, because you really cannot sue them.  Expect hand-wrenching on the part of customers beyond all reasonable options. <br><br>  8) Growth problems.  Are you a great start-up with 5 employees?  To become a start-up in 10 employees - all over again, all the problems almost from scratch.  And to manage a company of 50 employees, a completely different mentality and knowledge is needed.  Control your height. <br><br>  9) Competition.  Predominantly ‚Äúunhealthy‚Äù - in the market there are a lot of those who ‚Äúdid not succeed‚Äù or those who ‚Äúdid not dare‚Äù and if you are successful - you become a target for an attack.  Envy is a terrible feeling.  Avoid talking about your successes whenever possible. <br><br>  10) Initially high expectations.  Consider that even building your successful and stable IT business you will not become a ‚Äúnew Russian with intelligence‚Äù.  There are no freebies and if you don‚Äôt want a major disappointment in your life, don‚Äôt wait for financial results.  Interesting work, intellectual people around, innovative solutions, sometimes an understanding of the benefits of their work for customers.  But not money. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93521/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93521/</a></p>
