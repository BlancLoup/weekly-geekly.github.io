Buffett is one of the most successful investors in history, regularly included in the list of the richest people in the world.  He spends huge sums on good deeds, but buys cheap costumes on sales. <br><br>  Buffett, this "man-money", lives in a small house and drives an old car!  Why does the 81-year-old billionaire and the most generous patron of the day save?  He claims that ‚Äúevery saved dollar will turn into hundreds, thousands and millions if it falls into good hands.‚Äù <br>  Savings: how to save money without compromising the quality of life? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Love nice clothes?  Want to buy it at a bargain price?  Follow the example of Warren Buffet: buy things on sales!  Seasonal discounts can save significant amounts. <br><br>  2. Refuse purchases of semi-finished and packaged products.  They are more expensive than natural and high-quality products, which are sold in large supermarkets and markets.

      3. Do you know that the store space is organized so that the visitor buys more goods?  With each visit to the supermarket, a person spends 10-20% more if he arrives without a shopping list.  Have you already got a convenient notepad and pen? <br><br>  4. Taxes are one of the main categories of human expenses.  Use financial tools to defer profit taxation.  You already know what a UIF is, a life insurance policy? <br><br>  5. Do you have a computer?  Use software that is distributed free of charge within the freemium business model.  High-quality operating systems, security programs and open-source office offerings ‚Äî it is convenient and convenient to exploit legal free programs. <br><br>  6. Smoke?  Ask how much the treatment of peptic ulcer, myocardial infarction and cancer in private clinics.  You already know how to save these funds.  By the way, you can buy a lot of exotic fruits if you give up cigarettes. <br><br>  7. Why spend money on an expensive fitness center?  Jogging in the stadium, a set of dumbbells and expanders - what else is needed to maintain shape?  Listen, even a bike is cheaper than an annual subscription to a fashionable sports center! <br><br>  8. Do you know how much dentist services cost?  This is a good reason to visit your doctor every six months.  Old problems with teeth sooner or later make you pay bills without looking at the total amount. <br><br>  9. Insure car, housing?  Make a contract at the office of the insurance company.  You will receive a discount at the expense of the agent's commission, but for this you will have to bargain. <br><br>  10. Use a debit card to which a savings account is attached with a free withdrawal and withdrawal mode.  It is more profitable and safer than carrying money in your wallet. <br><br>  11. Pay loans early!  You will be surprised at the amounts that can be saved thanks to this habit. <br><br>  12. Leave appliances on in stand by mode?  Full shutdown of electrical equipment from the network at night saves up to 6% of the monthly payment for electricity. <br><br>  13. Are you cold?  Do not touch the electric heater!  Do warm up, wrap yourself in a blanket. <br><br>  14. The stomach and the wallet will be delighted if you refuse to visit the cafe during the lunch break.  Take to work lunch from home. <br><br>  15. Why do I need a cell phone?  People use the Internet using a computer, take pictures with a camera, fly to the moon on space ships.  Maybe you will not buy a new phone model? <br><br>  16. Do you guess that one day you will go on a well-deserved rest?  Apply for participation in the State Pension Co-financing Program.  This will help you to double the contributions to your account in the pension fund. <br><br>  17. Cellular operators are very nervous when you make calls using Skype, write messages in ICQ and e-mail.  Naturally: they are losing income, and you save your money! <br><br>  18. Pay for debit card purchases, withdraw cash at ATMs of ‚Äúyour‚Äù bank.  So you will save money on commission. <br><br>  19. Do not lend money.  This will save you a lot of money and nerves! <br><br>  20. Buy yourself a second wallet or open a separate account for the money saved.  Put there every saved ruble.  Do you remember that this money will multiply multiply if it falls into good hands? <br><br>  Each person uses their own financial strategies and tricks. <br>  Friends, you can change the name of this post to "200 ..." or "1000 ways to save money."  Share with your users ways to save! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132808/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132808/</a></p>
