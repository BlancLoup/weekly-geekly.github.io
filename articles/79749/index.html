      Actually, I‚Äôll say right away that there are no radical changes in the new model.  Unless, of course, is not considered, which is his heart, the new <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975087614%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0"><b>Intel Atom</b></a> <b>N450 processor</b> .  Yes, yes, the same pebble, which was recently announced by Intel and received the code name <b>Pine Trail</b> .  What, in fact, hints at the letter ‚Äú <b>P</b> ‚Äù in the model name.  In order not to inflate this review, I advise you to at least see the pictures in <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/79131/">this</a></b> post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/461/a70/5c0/461a705c0e6d443c5259617f9b7a5e23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see, there is no difference in gigahertz and megabytes, but at least there is a video ( <b>Intel GMA 3150</b> ), _integrated_ into a _64-bit_ processor core, which only slightly affected its thermal pack.  A new processor - a new chipset: now it is <b>Intel NM10 Express</b> . <br><br>  Hmm, even the CPU-Z utility still does not know about the new code name of the processor;) Although the model identified correctly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa8/9c3/3ad/fa89c33ad4d2fc2e03e3682cca98198f.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62c/4a8/a4a/62c4a8a4a8864efda8c45835abffcc71.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it is still the same portable assistant, although some nuances did appear.  For example, changes in the layout - from version 1005HAG differs only in the new form of Enter. <br>  The second is the operating system.  Now it's Windows 7, which everyone waited for.  In this engineering sample, the operating system is Windows 7 Ultimate (Maximum), although the version of Windows 7 Starter (Initial) will be on sale.  Perhaps the initial version will load even faster, the maximum version does it in 30 seconds.  Turns off in 10. <br>  When you switch to power saving mode (battery saving), the taskbar color changes - it becomes gray (initially white).  Absolutely no hints on the brakes of Windows 7 were found - despite the fact that the recommended amount of RAM is 2GB.  Everything loads quickly, draws, collapses, unfolds, etc.  Nice, damn it!  ) <br><br>  There is noise from the netbook, but it is insignificant - the cooler quietly does its job, occasionally clicks the hard drive (there is no way to make it quieter through AAM).  With a large long-term load, the speed of the cooler is increased, but even in this case there is no discomfort. <br>  As for the temperature regimes - even with a load, the netbook remains very cool, except that the bottom left corner of the keyboard heats up slightly. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like it - again, the glossy case and the screen (you have to admit that the case is very scratch-resistant), not the most convenient layout (the Enter button also connected to the arrows).  I do not consider the absence of a drive minus, since  This is a netbook, and conventional drives, in principle, are not so necessary.  Many people don‚Äôt like the resolution of 1024x600, but I‚Äôm getting along very well with him - someone manages to work with smaller screen diagonals. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab7/53e/8e4/ab753e8e41da37a86255b927ac973266.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The performance of the 1005P and 1005HAG is almost equal.  Is that the first in Win7 performance index is 2.3, and the second - 2.2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/128/496/c37/128496c3783a5200d8991dbeeefa2072.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Most delicious </h2><br>  In economy mode (Wi-Fi turned off, backlight 40%), even on a 4400 mAh battery (48 Wh, 10.8 V, 6 cells), the laptop worked for 10.5 hours !!!  It‚Äôs even interesting how long it would work if the battery was in it as on the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/68768/">ASUS EeePC 1000HE</a></b> (there was a 8700 mAh battery, 7.2 V, 62 Wh).  For comparison, the 1005HAG on a 2200 mAh battery (23 Wh, 3 cells - there was no other) worked for about 4.5 hours, and for 4400 - about 7-8. <br>  This, of course, is not 12 hours, which the manufacturer promises on a beautiful sticker ... but, in any case, the result is really outstanding!  Although I do not exclude that having refused to myself in all comfortable working conditions, it is possible to squeeze out of the battery even 12 hours.  And if you replace the regular drive on the SSD ... <br><br>  Requested to specify the parameters of the adapter) Here you are: + 19V, 2.1A, 40W. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  Honestly, I don‚Äôt know what to think) Intel‚Äôs roofing felts took another step forward in mobile processor building, Windows 7‚Äôs roofing felts had such a positive effect ... we forgot to turn off the sockets from the outlet) In general, the work time was really pleasant.  And something tells me all the same, that this is more the merit of the processor, rather than the OS. <br>  With what features of the components of the netbook will go on sale, I do not know yet, but I think it will still be perfectly suited to perform the majority of non-resource-intensive tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16b/2d7/fea/16b2d7fea57ecf2d5b5525da6f70bf81.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Little educational program for marking netbooks ASUS </h2><br>  It turned out that many are worried about this issue;) Let's fill the gaps of ignorance using the example of the EeePC 1005HAG. <br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Eee</b> ‚Äù means ‚Äú <i>Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play</i> ‚Äù (Easy to learn, easy to work, easy to play) <br><br>  The first two digits indicate the diagonal of the device.  In this model, it is 10 "(more precisely, 10.1"). <br>  The next two digits are the model number. <br>  The letter <b>H</b> means that a hard disk (HDD) is used inside, not an SSD.  <b>A</b> - the little motor is <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975087614%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0">the <b>Intel Atom processor</b></a> .  <b>G</b> - availability of WiMAX module.
