  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Some ways to get startup funding</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Entrepreneurs are always full of great ideas and effective ways to implement them, but, like everything in this life, starting a new business requires certain sacrifices, in this case most often it is cash.  Collecting this money you need to crawl for many hours with a business plan from one investor to another, hoping to find enough interested in investing in you.  This approach often takes several years and does not always produce the required results. <br><br>  It is often difficult for a budding entrepreneur to understand the many investment schemes in order to find the most profitable one.  It would be ideal to collect a full room of investors and let them fight for the honor of financing your business, unfortunately this scheme of financing has no relation to reality, which is a pity) However, having mobilized the network‚Äôs capabilities, your startup can receive satisfactory financing. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <a href="http://rbcdaily.ru/addition/article/562949993016556">Niche</a> financing </h4><br>  Is there something special about your idea?  There are various grants adapted to any specific business owners or specific business ideas that can get the idea off the ground.

      Determining your niche has an additional benefit.  When you seek funding, you can summarize in a few words what distinguishes your business from others.  You can find someone who has a particular interest in what your business offers. <br><br><h4>  Grant Search </h4><br>  When it comes to financing, nothing can compare with the grant.  Money is provided free of charge.  It is clear that obtaining a grant is extremely difficult, but you need to try. <br><br>  The most affordable grants related to the specifics of your business, as well as social.  There are grants for minority business owners, women, single mothers, and many others.  Most grant programs require extensive detailing of all aspects of your business. <br><br><h4>  Win a contest </h4><br>  Another sign of growing support for small business startups is the number of competitions that encourage innovation by offering greater financial rewards.  <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ru/start-ups/">The Amazon Web Services Start-Up Challenge</a> provides annual awards of $ 50,000, plus the same business loan each year.  MIT offers a reward of more than $ 350,000 each year. <br><br>  To improve your chances of success in contests, you need to find ways to make your project stand out from the crowd. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3">Crowdfunding</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf7/09a/c7c/cf709ac7c21d4f4689a03c8089386172.jpg" alt="CF" align="right">  Sites like Kickstarter and Boomstarter provide an ideal platform for financing startups.  Crowdfunding can relate to the financing of a company by selling small shares of the company to a wide range of investors.  This type of crowdfunding has recently received the special attention of American officials.  In April 2012, the US president signed a new law called JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act), which allows start-up companies to collect up to $ 1 million through crowdfunding, without filing papers and registering for the sale of shares, as previously practiced. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a9/93c/6d5/9a993c6d536b436589de3d372222624b.jpg" alt="VC" align="left"><br><br><h4>  Find a business angel </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB">Business angels</a> are constantly looking for great ideas, but do not think that they will give you money just like that.  In exchange for your financing, you will usually be asked to promise a significant chunk of the company (usually a blocking stake, not a controlling stake).  If in this case you still feel comfortable, then a business angel, what you need. <br><br><h4>  Take credit </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e44/e4c/752/e44e4c752a6f4b5ca4771ddbbf204b51.jpg" alt="Loan" align="right">  In the end, you can always try to take a loan, and often this can be done on special conditions, but for this you will have to provide the bank with a business plan and any other information that might interest them.  Including with estimated or other documents that disclose exactly how money borrowed will be spent. <br><br>  In search of money, try not to complicate.  Write a good business plan and hone it up, until your ideas hit everyone who hears them, this will greatly increase your chances of getting funding. <br><br>  Similar article <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/4910/">‚ÄúWe are looking for money.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/4910/">A catalog of investors for a startup</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284004/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284004/</a></p>
