  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Since 2018, domestic Russian roaming has been eliminated. How much will it cost to subscribers?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From 2018, Russian mobile operators will force them to completely eliminate national roaming in the territory of the Russian Federation, following the example of the EU countries.  But only if in the EU the process took many years, everything will be done quickly in Russia.  By the end of 2017, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) and the Ministry of Communications will prepare a number of regulations, Vedomosti reports.  For telecom operators, this will be a big loss: for example, in 2016 they earned more than 29 billion rubles on roaming. <br><br>  However, FAS promises that the operators will not remain in the loser: they will be allowed to earn more on other services.  True, it is not entirely clear on what.  The representative of the FAS said about the "removal of barriers to business," but did not specify which barriers.  For now these are empty words. <br><br>  The operators themselves say that lost revenues simply have nothing to compensate for, so that they will have to be passed on to subscribers.  That is, if earlier domestic roaming was paid only by those who used it, then in the future all subscribers will pay it evenly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to independent experts, we are talking about 3-4% of the revenue of operators, that is, it is about 30 billion rubles for all operators or 214 rubles per year for each resident of Russia, including newborns.

      However, the authorities promise to avoid such an effect that the cancellation of roaming does not affect the wallets of subscribers.  For this, it is necessary to compensate the operators for expenses in some way: for example, by reducing taxes and fees.  Thus, a representative of MegaFon envisages the liberalization of sectoral legislation in order to reduce the costs of operators for the construction of communication networks and traffic routing. <br><br>  First of all, the operator MTS needs compensation from the state.  Perhaps it will satisfy the option of simplifying the access of fixed operators to the infrastructure of residential buildings. <br><br>  It should be noted that smaller operators who overpaid for interconnect will benefit from the cancellation of roaming (VimpelCom and Tele2), but the larger ones will lose (Megafon and MTS).  That is, subscribers of the first two, probably, can not be afraid of price increases.  Well, for MegaFon and MTS subscribers, you can probably expect additional paid options and offers more traffic for big money.  According to estimates of the director general of TMT Consulting, Konstantin Ankilov, to compensate for the losses, cellular companies will have to increase the average bill of each subscriber by 15‚Äì20 rubles per month. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373837/</a></p>
