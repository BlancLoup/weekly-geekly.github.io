  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Robotics educational sets MRobot with Intel Inside</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to all!  My name is Maxim Massalsky and I represent the Maxxlife Robot team - MRobot.  Our team consists of enthusiasts and professionals who create robots.  We are actively developing the direction of educational and ‚Äúdo-it-yourself‚Äù robotics in Belarus, as well as promoting our educational kits in robotics and electronics abroad.  Today I would like to tell you about our experience in integrating Intel products, namely Intel Edison and Intel Galileo, but I'll start with a small introduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/94c/0e8/c6a94c0e87534c229776b4f95bbd54c9.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Small introduction</b> </h4><br>  I have come to robotics from car sport.  In 2013, I decided to make my cars smarter.  I found like-minded people on the forums, and in the evenings we began to gather in a small room at DOSAAF, which I was kindly singled out for past achievements in the car sport.  For six months, we made the Maxxlife Robot I unmanned vehicle for the competition of wheeled racing robots RoboRace. <br><br>  These competitions are now very popular in Belarus.

We decided to go there to show our unmanned car model and see what others were doing.  Already at the exhibition we met with developers from Italy, Sweden, USA, France and China, and at the Intel stand I saw the presentation of the Intel Edison board, and I really wanted to get it myself right at the MakerFaire exhibition.  Therefore, I, having shown my ability to speak beautifully, talked loosely with the developer Intel, his name was Carlos Montesinos. <br><br>  I told him about my unmanned car model.  He liked this project and he told me: ‚ÄúCome to the stand in 4 hours, I will think of something.‚Äù  Four hours later I came to the Intel stand and he kindly presented me with the Intel Edison Arduino-breakout kit.  Thus, I got the first Intel Edison, which largely determined the fate of our team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/719/0bc/083/7190bc08375345fcae89eeed07732021.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The exhibition gave a huge impetus to our development.  We received an incredible amount of information, and realized that we need to create new robots.  We had a spacious room, where we went beyond the closed party and founded an open laboratory on robotics and the Internet of things <a href="http://vk.com/cookrobot">maxxlife Kitchen Robots</a> . <br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe laboratory is that everyone can come and do their own project. <br><br><h4>  <b>How did we make educational sets with Intel motherboards and wrote a book</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>A1 Robot Kit and Intel Edison Beginner Book</b> </h5><br>  I understood that the experience in our team is already quite large and worth sharing.  We had the idea to make educational kits on robotics and electronics for enthusiasts, makers, schools, universities and technical creativity centers.  We have thought of a multi-level concept from simple to complex. <br><br>  Over the summer of 2015, we created the A1 Robot Kit A1 based on Intel Edison, and I wrote a book on Intel Edison for a beginner!  Intel liked the book and decided to print it out, and also make an electronic version that is available on the <a href="https://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php%3Fact%3Dattach%26type%3Dblogentry%26id%3D46584">Intel Education Galaxy</a> educational portal <a href="https://edugalaxy.intel.ru/index.php%3Fact%3Dattach%26type%3Dblogentry%26id%3D46584">.</a> <br><br>  A set of Robots A1 is the first step for any person: a student, student or adult who wants to join electronics, mechatronics, robotics and programming. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/23b/a97/b7f23ba979c746299f620186bcff0352.jpg"><br><br>  Thanks to this set and a book created specifically for it, you can easily learn how to create more than 14 electrical programmable circuits based on the Intel Edison microcomputer.  The book goes from simple to complex.  First, the reader learns to program the board and blink the LED, read the readings from the sensors, and then create simple smart home systems that work with the Intel IoT Dashboard cloud and are part of the Internet of things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbe/357/09a/dbe35709aa924e89a7b6adf83742b49d.jpg"><br><br>  With the Set of Robots A1, a person acquires the necessary initial skills to automate their activities, to make the elements of a smart home with their own hands, and, perhaps, to gain the necessary knowledge to create their own robot assistant!  This set was our first product from the line of educational sets # Robotics for beginner makers and inventors. <br><br><h5>  <b>Wheeled Robot Rover M1</b> </h5><br>  After the first step is passed, a person can understand what is interesting to him and what is not. <br>  We decided not to stop there and began to think about what set to do next.  ‚ÄúWe have a lot of experience in creating wheeled robots!  So why not make an educational wheeled robot ?! ‚Äù, we thought.  And so they created their wheeled robot RoboRover M1, to participate in the competition of wheeled robots Roborace. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/syXVEaDcIwk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhmUo1NiEYhN0TRhKVKMGXqrJRpiw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The control board in the robot is Intel Edison.  The Rover M1 is a completely ready and multifunctional robot, which only needs to be programmed using a standard set of sensors, and the possibility of upgrading with the help of additional parts offered by us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91f/e8e/08c/91fe8e08c972447b9944bb5b64adc0b3.JPG"><br><br>  For our robots, the RoboTrack track was created (shown in the video above), so that it was comfortable to work with robots in schools and universities.  RoboRover M1 is positioned as a platform for studying robotics and learning programming through competitions of mobile robots based on Belarusian-made platforms. <br><br>  Now on the basis of such robots in Minsk in the centers of technical creativity there are circles "Racing robots".  Children love to make autonomous cars against the background of the rapid robotization of real cars. And parents are very happy, because in the form of competitions their children not only program the robot, but also learn mechanics and electronics.  The best option for learning robotics is to program stand-alone wheeled robots! <br><br>  As an example, in Novosibirsk, at the CodeFest 2016 conference, Intel used such robots to draw attention to its booth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/161/b22/3b0/161b223b05734f93a3ab29d10c410504.JPG"><br><br><h5>  <b>Robot manipulator RoboRuka P1</b> </h5><br>  After the wheeled robot, we decided to make a robotic arm.  In May 2016, JuniorSkills started in Minsk and it was important for us to participate with robots of our own production.  In the category ‚Äúindustrial robotics‚Äù for our manipulator, we took a popular design and slightly modified it.  It turned out a robot RoboRuka P1!  Roboruka P1 is a manipulator with four degrees of freedom (4DOF) and claw-capture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af2/2cd/fd1/af22cdfd1c6b4359aee8376a11ec80db.jpg"><br><br>  Such a manipulator allows you to study the programming of the movements of the links of the robot, as well as to understand in practice how to solve the direct and inverse problems of kinematics, because one of the most difficult tasks of robotics is the programming of a robot manipulator with a different number of degrees of freedom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/cf6/3ce/471cf63ce8e442a992c1cc482ab1d65f.jpg"><br><br>  The robot manipulator caused a stir in the centers of technical creativity of Belarus, and in Minsk at JuniorSkills 2016 our teams took the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places!  The robot was subjected to numerous loads - it is difficult for children to work carefully, the kids' team even dropped their manipulator, but the robots withstood two days of continuous work and did not let down any of the teams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3c/9eb/38c/f3c9eb38c2d841628eb130bd91cc868d.JPG"><br><br>  On the basis of such robotic manipulators, a circle has already opened in Minsk, where we started teaching children how to program, they are very interested in all the movements of this robot.  Naturally, we first give them basic knowledge of kinematics, physics, electronics, and then show how this basic knowledge is used in such a manipulator in practice.  Kids love it! <br><br>  Over time, we began to form our mission - to provide students, schoolchildren, inventors and makers with the equipment and ecosystem for studying IT and robotics based on products from Intel.  Now we are working with technical creativity centers in Belarus and really want to find partners in Russia and Ukraine.  With the help of our products, makers, modern enthusiasts and inventors can now create without problems!  Based on Intel Edison, we create interesting products for robotics.  Come to us and see what you can do with Intel inside. <br><br>  <a href="http://mrobot.by/shop/roborover">Site M-Robot - all for technical creativity.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395529/</a></p>
