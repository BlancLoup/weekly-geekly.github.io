  <section class="page js-page"><h1>C ++ Developer: Bjorn Straustrup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Bjorn Straustrup - born June 11, 1950 in the Danish city of Aarhus. <br>  After graduation, he entered Aargus University in the department of computer technology.  In 1975 he graduated and received a master's degree. <br>  Later continued his education at the University of Cambridge in England. <br>  In Cambridge, in the Computing Laboratory, he was engaged in the design of distributed systems, and in 1979 he was awarded the degree of Ph.D. <br>  In the same year, Straustrup moved with his family to New Jersey (USA), where he began working at the Bell Labs Computer Research Center.  When he was doing research at the company, Bjorn Straustrup needed to write several simulation programs.  SIMULA-67 - the first object-oriented language for modeling could be ideal for such tasks, if not for its relatively low speed of program execution. <br>  In New Jersey, he has a son, and he begins to devote more time to his family. <br>  SIMULA-67 and BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language) did not suit Bj√∂rn and he begins his work on C by adding classes to it. <br>  Initially the name was ‚ÄúC with classes‚Äù (With with classes) <br><a name="habracut"></a>  In 1983, the language has undergone significant changes and received the name C ++.  The name came up with Rick Maschitti.  The term C ++ is an increment operator in C, which seems to hint that C ++ is more than just C. <br>  Stroustrup developed its language in such a way that it was preprocessing in C, and not compiled into machine language, which opened access to it for hundreds of thousands of C users who had the appropriate compiler. <br>  In 1984, Bell Labs was reorganized and received the name AT &amp; T Bell Labs.  The first to whom the company offered C ++, and almost without any payment, were universities.  It happened in 1985.  In order to soften the situation, Stroustrup simultaneously published one of the most widely known books ‚ÄúC ++ Programming Language‚Äù, which was published in four editions (1985, 1991, 1997, 2000), and was translated into 19 languages. <br>  The language quickly found its audience.  In 1987, 200 people gathered at the C ++ conference.  The following year, according to Koenig, the number of participants increased to 600, and in the early 1990s, the number of users, according to his own estimates, was close to half a million.  This made this language the world leader in speed of distribution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/236/176/d4b/236176d4b0c10ae8e45e6cc3658d4c8c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1990 he published his next book, The C ++ Reference Manual for the C ++ Programming Language with Comments (‚ÄúThe Annotated C ++ Reference Manual‚Äù) <br>  Which later was awarded an award for unsurpassed skill in the field of technical documentation according to the magazine ‚ÄúDr.  Dobb's Journal. <br>  In addition, according to Fortune magazine, Straustrup is one of the ‚Äútwelve best young American scientists‚Äù. <br>  In 1993, he was awarded the Grace Murray Hopper Prize. <br>  In 1995, BYTE magazine recognized him as "one of the 20 most significant personalities in the computer industry over the past 20 years."

      Stroustrup, meanwhile, continued to work at AT &amp; T Bell Labs, where he headed the large-scale programmatic research unit and was actively engaged in improving his language and creating its standard.  The ANSI / ISO C ++ standard was released in 1999. <br><br><img src="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/Bjarne.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Up until 2002, Stroustrup was the head of programming research at Bell Labs. <br>  Currently he is a professor at Texas A &amp; M University. <br><img src="http://root.loopback.su/habralogger/empty.gif"><br>  Areas of no scientific interest - general history, photography, music and travel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77210/</a></p>
