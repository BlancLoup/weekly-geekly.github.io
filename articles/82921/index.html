The team consists of 3 students.  It is fair to note that the majority of students study in the field of applied informatics in economics, where I also study.  The essence of the Olympiad is to create a project to automate some business process of a particular organization. <br><br>  My acquaintance with this Olympiad began in the fall of 2007, we prepared for a long time and we were sent to Ufa in April 2008, where we took second place.  The first three teams were supposed to go on an all-Russian tour.  But then he did not take place.  Having decided that the Olympiad will not be held, we began to improve in other areas of IT. <br><br>  But in April 2009, our manager said: "Team, in a couple of weeks we are going to Moscow for a regional round of the Olympiad."  We haven‚Äôt opened anything for a year and almost fought over the books that each of us will read.

      The Olympiad itself consists of three parts: <br><ol><li>  Tests. They have questions on information security, on design, on information management, on databases.  This is an independent work. </li><li>  The main task, it takes 4 hours.  After that, you hand over your completed project, you can no longer change it.  Then a break, after which, within 1.5 hours, preparation of the presentation. </li><li>  The last part, performance and presentation of the project in the form of Power Point slides, <b>strain and read how to properly present information using slides.</b> </li></ol><br>  This tour ended tragically for us.  We were awarded the best project, and we had to share the 3rd place with one team, it was visible in the table, which was displayed on the big screen.  But for some reason it happened that when we talked in the finals about the distribution of seats, they just took us and forgot, they just forgot.  And our victory in the nomination for the best project sounded like a consolation prize.  Our leader at this crucial moment somewhere dumped.  We approached the organizers with a request to explain to us what happened after all.  Nobody listened to us, they just didn‚Äôt listen and everything, damn it, we were just sent and closed a sign.  In principle, this meant that we were not going to any national tour, and we didn‚Äôt even want to go after that.  I think it is clear that we were experiencing at that moment.  After, in Moscow, it was already impossible to find out, do not ask why. <br><br>  Then we quarreled not only with our leader, but also among themselves.  Our manager wrote to Moscow, they apologized to him.  After a couple of weeks of quarrels, common sense won out after all, and we decided to go.  We had a month to prepare. <br><br>  I went in and said that <b>I Want First Place</b> !  And no drooling and grimacing about the fact that there will be Moscow, Novosibirsk, and God knows who else!  We go for the first place. <br>  The important thing is not to win but to take part.  <b>These are the words of those who have too much free time!</b>  I feel sorry for killing one month of my life in order to simply live a week and walk around Moscow.  And in general, how much can you already participate in this Olympiad!  We must already win! <br><br>  And preparation began. <br><br>  Preparation begins with the fact that it is necessary to correct what has turned out badly before.  Our project was recognized by the jury as the best that remains (?) - performance and tests. <br>  At this time, the tests decided to take out in the individual competition, which means everyone is sitting and reading what he wants in his spare time from the team training. <br>  Speech  With the performance, we messed up, messed up on a grand scale.  Up to the point that I started to turn blue, turn green and so on. <br><br>  How is this fixed? <br>  We decided that we would conduct a pair of computer security, since our supervisor taught this subject to our stream.  The topic we got is ‚ÄúEncryption Algorithms‚Äù (DES, AES, RSA, etc.).  The bottom line should be that everyone in the audience understands how it is encrypted and decrypted. <br><br>  We are done with flaws. <br>  But it is impossible to show in the project what we showed then, we need a serious upgrade. <br><br>  Now it's time to tell in detail about what should be presented in the main task and in general what it is. <br>  You are given a description of the organization, its documentation and a description of its business processes in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEF0">IDEF0</a> notation, 20-30 minutes after the start (or maybe right away) they distribute 1C forms used in this organization. <br>  At the end you must provide an automation project.  You can automate HR, CRM, or warehouse operations, depending on what task you‚Äôve got, but these are the three main objects that you need to imagine. <br><br>  The automation project includes: <br><ol><li>  The ‚ÄúTask Statement‚Äù or ‚ÄúTechnical Assignment‚Äù document, or rather this and that (we wrote only the problem statement).  Documents should be based on guests, if you want to take you at all seriously.  <b>Be careful with the choice of GOST, which will prepare.</b>  Some are no longer valid, and on most Internet resources you will not be told that this series is no longer valid.  And someone on the jury will know this, and believe me, do not miss the chance to tell everyone! </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Gantt chart.</a>  This can be done in the MS Project office application, in which enough books have been published and written in many accessible languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the Internet.  I approached its development very carefully.  It represented the life cycle of the software release process, based on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Solutions_Framework">MSF</a> model, it outlined what each stage consists of, provided documents that should be at each stage, and much more that only allows this scheduler to be used. </li><li>  The database schema in <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERwin_Process_Modeler">Erwin</a> (of course, you can draw it in Access and even in Paint).  The database is developed at the logical and physical levels.  It's probably silly to say that you should just understand perfectly what a normalized database is and know how to set the keys correctly.  <b>Examine this product and all the nuances</b> will be cut down mercilessly.  On the databases, the jury always has a lot of questions. </li></ol><br>  The system architecture should also be presented. <br>  This is a required part. <br><br>  <i>You are not tired yet?</i> <br><br>  Let's move on to upgrade our project.  Listening to competitors in the regional tour, I wrote down original ideas and wrote down the word OLAP, to my great shame I did not know what it was then. <br>  Your project must contain a scientific novelty.  We have this become <a href="http://www.spss.ru/atwork/dm.htm">Data minig</a> , the existence of which we learned, of course, in the month of our training.  An intuit course was taught, all algorithms were learned and written out, and applications were found in all branches of life.  Read more, broaden your horizons.  <b>Read as much as you can</b> , even diagonally. <br>  And, of course, we decided to pervert over the network architecture.  Read about <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAS">NAS</a> and <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D1%2585%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585">SAN</a> . <br>  A nice addition will be a prototype of interfaces (of course, with working buttons) and a feasibility study. <br><br>  We also clearly described how much time we needed and divided the tasks.  Who and what will perform, in what order.  If you decide to create a team, you need to come up not only from the side of someone who knows well, but also that you know how to listen to each other.  We have three girls in our team, and it is often difficult for us to agree with each other, despite the fact that we are friends from the first year.  What you will not do for the purpose! <br>  <b>An organized and solid team is the key to success.</b> <br><br>  A little advice, everyone should know not only their part of the practical task, but also understand everything in order to check it with a fresh look. <br><br>  So III Tour. <br><br>  I'll tell you a little about the organization of the event itself. <br>  As mentioned above, it is organized by the Moscow State University of Economics, Statistics and Informatics.  Students are accommodated in the hostel, which is located on the campus.  The cost of living is 500 rubles.  per day, this is the standard throughout Russia.  Rooms for three and two people, with TV, kettle.  Every day there are free and good meals, it is considered good form in the conduct of the Olympics. <br><br>  Your team will be given 2 computers, they will be installed: <br>  AllFusion <br>  Design IDEF 3.5 <br>  MS Office 2007 full package <br>  MS SQLServer 2008 <br>  Delphi7 <br>  Visual studio <br>  You can also ask for additional software, by discussing it with the administrators in advance by mail.  In real time, they could not organize access to 1C from the computer classroom. <br>  The second time, worse living conditions were waiting for us, and in general a lot of trouble happened along the way. <br>  We arrived at the hostel, there was no hot water anywhere and even a basin, the water was boiled in a 1L kettle.  Rising in the evening on day 1 on the elevator, I was anticipating how comfortable it would be with this kettle: ‚ÄúIn general, for complete happiness, it is necessary that there is no light either.‚Äù  And what do you think?  We turn on the light in our room, but it is not!  And the neighbors have!  And sockets work for us, but there is no top light!  My friends looked at me maliciously: ‚ÄúPeople like you used to be burned at the stake!‚Äù They love me))) <br><br>  I'll tell you a little about our performance and the jury. <br>  The jury includes all team leaders plus independent experts who have every right to ask any questions.  You have a whole evening before the performance to remember what you were doing, to understand the lyatas and come up with an original answer.  <b>Prepare a list of possible questions and answers in advance.</b> <br>  An example from our presentation: <br>  We said casual about data mining, highlighting its advantages.  As expected, the jury was followed by many questions to which we were ready. <br>  There was a bloop about whom we did not even suspect.  The automation project was supposed to cost the customer 750 thousand rubles.  (that we do not read), they learned only in the evening from the head.  We have a feasibility study, everything is counted there!  We met, we are great. <br>  The jury looks at our network architecture, where we used SAN (wrote about it above).  In general, we initially planned to use NAS, I looked at its cost, SAN is steeper, well, we assign him 10 points in the feasibility study ... well, no, 15 thousand rubles ... The jury asks the question: "Do you remember that the project should cost 750 thousand?" (many have not read it before, <b>read the manual from and to</b> ) We open our feasibility study with serious people.  And then the jury member just starts laughing.  ‚ÄúAnd where did you buy a SAN at that price?‚Äù  It's not even just a boo!  This is from the hands of the fourths! ‚ÄùAnd so that you don‚Äôt have to smile sweetly and invent on the move that you have your people everywhere and great discounts, well, customs can also give you the confiscated goods - <b>think over everything to the smallest detail</b> , from the cost of the Win version Server, which you will need, to arrows on the database schema. <br><br>  Everybody liked our performance very much. <br>  Personally, I really liked the GUU team, they performed very well, but, unfortunately, the jury did not rate them. <br><br>  There were 13 or 15 teams from all over Russia. <br><br>  We took first place!  YES!  YES!  YES!  I told you! <br><br><ol><li>  Saratov State University </li><li>  Magnitogorsk State University </li><li>  the place was divided by the universities of Novosibirsk <br><ul><li>  Novosibirsk State University of Economics and Management </li><li>  Novosibirsk State Technical University </li></ul></li><li>  State University of Management </li><li>  Tver branch of MESI </li><li>  MESI </li></ol><br>  I do not remember further. <br><br>  My friend took first place in the individual competition! <br><br>  <a href="http://pivso.mesi.ru/main">Official site</a> where you can find information about events held at MESI. <br><br>  Ps.  I can not write.  The site is not very convenient directions to the University.  It will be more convenient for you to get to the metro station Slavyansky Boulevard, then go to Kutuzovsky Prospekt via the crossing near the metro station and get off at the bus stop.  On the windshield you need will be written MESI.  Go 5-10 minutes.  For comparison, from art.  Metro University about an hour. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82921/</a></p>
