But in fact, there is nothing much to say: the user can download the video, the user can watch the video, all for free.  And the lawsuits are also attached ... for free.

      <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> <br>  Another attractive project from Skype authors is still in Beta, but it comes from all fronts: P2P content distribution system;  an impressive amount of really valuable video, cool GUI, almost bug-free player operation, high-quality video.  If you stumble upon invite, then get great pleasure from the video content and from the project itself. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.babelgum.com/">Babelgum</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c78/979/68e/c7897968e65d871dca0b2de32badb21d.jpg"><br>  Babelgum is similar to Joost for 2 reasons: P2P content distribution system, and free, but not excluding advertising, content.  The service is in the open beta stage, and everyone can try it, despite the fact that the number of downloads per day is limited.  Channels include content such as news, music, documentary, sports, animation, etc.  The video is played smoothly, the interface is beautiful, but not as perfect as that of Joost.  Feature: do not despair if the video does not start playing immediately;  a small amount of time is needed for its initial buffering, but, unfortunately, there is no loading indicator. <br><br>  <a href="http://zattoo.com/">Zattoo</a> <br>  Television based on P2P technology, with its software client, focused on European channels (over 50).  Unfortunately, it does not work in those countries that are not included in the list of supported. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.veoh.com/">Veoh</a> <br>  Veoh is a slightly different project from the others on this list.  Its downloadable client looks like a VCR: you can even save movies for later viewing.  You can also watch videos online in the Flash version of the video player.  Basically, the service is focused on watching videos offline, all videos over 45 minutes in length can only be viewed on the player being downloaded, not via Flash.  Content is both generated by users and laid out by professional publishers who protect their video with copyright. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.ngtv.com/">NGTV</a> <br>  NGTV, or No Good TV (Bad TV), is television, which will bring you a lot of emotions.  A huge amount of music, all entertaining content, full of foul language. <br>  It is better for children not to watch, although in reality they see all this and so on the screens of ordinary Television. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.getdemocracy.com/">Democracy</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/006/fe0/69c/006fe069c364856c2eb610b599c2daa8.jpg"><br>  Democracy is actually a media player with which you can watch all your video files on your computer.  But the difference from the usual is that Democracy can connect to a huge number of video hosting sites and to the portals of various publishers.  In the end, this is a media organizer that will allow you to structure your offline and online video.  As a result, a great project, certainly not as cool as Joost.  But Democracy has a really bright future. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.episodenetwork.com/">EpisodeNetwork</a> <br>  Episode network - a large directory of links to video on the network.  The portal does not ‚Äúhost‚Äù the video, but you can find links to a lot of illegally uploaded content, such as episodes of some TV series. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/">Dailymotion</a> <br>  One of the largest video distribution portals, Dailymotion is as old as YouTube and almost as popular.  Unlike YouTube, DM is not covered by constant publicity, so here you can still find a lot of really interesting content that has already been removed from YouTube. <br><br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google video</a> <br>  Despite the fact that Google bought YouTube, there is still a lot of unique content on Google Video, and the user interface from which not everyone can switch. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.blinkx.com/">BlinkX</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/74d/71f/c1f/74d71fc1fbdae08164b49e95ae17951b.jpg"><br>  BlinkX is a search engine for audio and video content that indexed about 12 million hours of video.  So this is a search engine, you will not relax here, immediately choosing a show and starting to watch it.  We must sweat and find where it is really laid out.  But it is convenient to look for those shows whose names you just completely forgot, but remember, for example, the name of the presenter or the names of the guests, or the actors of the series. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.channelchooser.com/">Channelchooser</a> <br>  Simple appearance and interface, a bit annoying.  And in fact, a video portal offering a large selection of shows from various TV channels. <br><br>  <a href="http://freetube.us.tc/">Freetube</a> <br>  Freetube is one of these sites that pursue simplicity: no download, no subscription: just a bunch of neatly sorted shows and TV shows.  Many people really liked this portal. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.televee.com/">Televee</a> <br>  Cheap, depressing portal interface scares initially.  But if you try, you can find a lot of good TV shows (for example, Prison Break (Escape from Prison)). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.guba.com/">Guba</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2a3/7be/68d/2a37be68dd8548217da06be30ec94d71.jpg"><br>  Guba is a combination of collectively laying out video and video for hire, which means that you will have to pay for some content.  Despite this, a lot of interesting things can be found on the free part of the portal.  Guba also allows you to upload videos to PC, iPod, PSP and other portable devices.  The site itself is unique because it uses the content of USENET groups. <br><br>  <a href="http://wwitv.com/">WWITV</a> <br>  Catalog of links to streaming video, sorted by country.  The coverage is quite wide, although some countries are represented by only one television channel. <br><br>  <a href="http://blip.tv/">Blip.TV</a> <br>  Blip.TV is a portal for distribution of video, which was shot by users themselves.  This means that there are fewer coutries here than on YouTube, and the technical staff here are quite pleasant.  In general, the best place to find the "new" Spielberg, or in extreme cases, Larry Clark. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.channelking.com/">Channelking</a> <br>  Another directory of video content that can be viewed using Windows Media Player. <br>  This resource is only for the very desperate. <br><br>  <a href="http://stage6.divx.com/">Stage6</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac2/17e/144/ac217e144808be14fb16bec067cb5056.jpg"><br>  Stage6 is a website that hosts various DivX videos (that is, using the DivX codec).  To view, you need a special plugin, the so-called DivX web player, but for the quality of video clips converted by DivX, you should pay attention to this portal. <br><br>  <a href="http://tvunetworks.com/">TVUnetworks</a> <br>  TCUnetworks is a China based TV company that distributes its content over P2P.  The content is mostly Chinese, but you can also find something in English. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dontwatchme.com/">Don't watch me</a> <br>  Well, a very "underdeveloped" list of various video content. <br><br>  <a href="http://tapeitofftheinternet.com/">Tape It Off The Internet</a> <br>  Tape If Off The Internet, or shorter than TIOTI, is a service designed to track the releases of your favorite shows and TV shows.  The service was launched a long time ago - in 2005 - and still in Beta status, which, in general, is not a very good sign. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.streamick.com/">Streamick</a> <br>  The portal is ‚Äúwretched‚Äù (just extremely ‚Äúwretched‚Äù), but it has surprisingly good content. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.tv-links.co.uk/">Tv links</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d5a/a00/d5e/d5aa00d5eabad953d7cb142b7966d83f.jpg"><br>  TV Links is another portal to which you can safely address the question ‚ÄúCan it be legal?‚Äù <br>  Wonderful collection with links to a series of popular shows and TV shows.  Enjoy until you cover up. <br><br>  <a href="http://dynamic.abc.go.com/streaming/landing">ABC</a> <br>  A selection of TV shows and shows from the channel ABC.  But only for visitors from the United States. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.freemoviescinema.com/">Free Movies Cinema</a> <br>  A neatly sorted collection of old and interesting films from various online sources.  Small, but rational selection, a lot of films from which is really worth watching. <br><br>  <a href="http://peekvid.com/">Peekview</a> <br>  A selection of TV shows and movies, including such popular ones as Buffy (Buffy), Pimp My Ride (Pimp My Ride) and others.  Also, a large number of anime is present in the collection. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fox">Fox myspace</a> <br>  On its MySpace page, Fox offers several of its TV shows for free - if you are in the USA.  And for the Europeans what?  And nothing. <br><br>  <a href="http://tv-video.net/">Tv video</a> <br>  An excellently organized directory of episodes of current TV shows, such as Grey's Anatomy (Gray's Anatomy), Lost (Lost or Survivor), and 24. Is it legal?  I do not know, but still there are many episodes. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.chooseandwatch.com/">Choose and watch</a> <br>  Another of these long streaming video directories that plays content in Windows Media Player.  More than 300 channels are indexed, and, according to the owners of the catalog, there is even something efficient there. <br><br>  <a href="http://streamingtvepisodes.com/">Streaming tv episodes</a> <br>  ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX - free episodes of TV shows of these channels on the Streaming TV Episodes portal.  Not much, but you can find something interesting. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.yourtvlinks.com/">Your TV Links</a> <br>  Quite an extensive list of TV shows, cartoons, anime, music and advertising. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.itv.com/">ITV</a> <br>  ITV is the largest commercial television network in England, and you can watch some content for free on the web site.  Unfortunately, in reality nothing worthwhile;  instead of full versions of episodes and shows, you will see trailers and short clips. <br><br>  Push: <br>  I really liked <a href="http://www.joost.com/">Joost</a> , I've been using it for about a month now. <br>  I also really liked the <a href="http://www.ngtv.com/">NGTV</a> project, I advise you to pay attention to it, quite funny. <br>  Some of the portals presented do not work in the Russian Federation, but only, for example, in Europe or America. <br>  There is nothing to be done, only if the proxy to search for the desired country. <br><br>  The list of portals is taken from <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/06/18/33-ways-to-watch-free-tv-online">http://mashable.com/2007/06/18/33-ways-to-watch-free-tv-online/</a> . <br>  The translation is done by Mofas, not literally, with your personal notes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10957/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10957/</a></p>
