Help us in this reviews. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Feedback </h5><br><br>  If your application is a large commercial project, then most likely there was a QA (testing) stage or at least a launch on the end device.  Then, the GUI designer made the final touches and your application is available to the end user.

      How can I leave a review: <br><ul><li>  Through the browser (http://www.windowsphone.com) </li><li>  Via Zune </li><li>  Via smartphone based on Windows Phone 7 </li></ul><br><br>  In all these cases, the user logs in with his account and leaves a review, which is the following: <br><br><ul><li>  Review date </li><li>  Author </li><li>  Rating </li><li>  Headline </li><li>  Description </li><li>  Region (in Marketplace) </li></ul><br><br>  Each user of the application can leave one review for the current version of the application, <b>but</b> can change it.  Thus, you can get feedback on the application.  It is also worth noting that reviews in different places of publication may be updated in different ways.  Often there is a situation when there are reviews in the Dashboard (create.msdn.com), but they have not yet appeared on the site.  This is due to the fact that the user left it through the phone. <br><br>  Rating - a number from 1 to 10, which translates into a 5-star system.  Therefore, you can see the rating in the Marketplace of this type: <br><img src="http://s1.ipicture.ru/uploads/20120117/3i3GqdeS.png" alt="rating"><br><br>  This rating is generated on the application page and you can see that it has the name ‚ÄúratingLarge fourPtFive‚Äù.  It turned out by transferring the average rating (8.588 in this case) to asterisks and rounding.  Step rating: half a star.  This moment is a bit hidden, but I assume that this is exactly what is happening. <br><br>  We now know the structure of the review.  How to work with him? <br><br><h5>  Work with review </h5><br><br>  The most important element is the content of the review.  Without considering the cases when the user made a mistake or was not guided by logic when making a review (a false review is always difficult to detect), there most likely contains either a description of the problem encountered by the person or an enthusiastic joyful response about the application.  We will try to increase the number of the latter. <br><br><h5>  Review Description </h5><br><br>  When processing feedback to improve the application, I had some tips that could be useful to someone: <br><ul><li>  Do not take everything too close to your heart.  Focus on the problem - it is more useful. </li><li>  Come up with a solution that suits both you and the user. </li><li>  Do not enter into an argument in the reviews (very bad option) </li><li>  Have a clear vision of your application (not the development plans, but the main task) </li><li>  Don't change the app after one bad review. </li></ul><br><br>  I remember myself very worried when one angry review (almost offensive) appeared on the application page.  There were a lot of emotions, but the desire to make the application better prevailed. <br><br><h5>  Write to the author </h5><br><br>  Now only the author's name (login) is available, but there is an application that will allow the author to write through the Zune message system.  This application is <a href="http://wp7reviews.tomverhoeff.com/">Windows Phone 7 AppReviews</a> .  Posted by: Tom Verhoeff.  His <a href="http://blog.tomverhoeff.nl/">blog</a> . <br><br>  Key features: <br><ul><li>  View reviews for all regions where your app is hosted. </li><li>  Export data to CSV </li><li>  View statistics </li><li>  View reviews </li><li>  The ability to write a review author </li></ul><br><br>  Click on the author and enter the message.  The text of the message is limited.  Be concise and do not forget to leave contact information.  Then send a message.  There are no confirmations, and for the region ru-RU it is written ‚ÄúNot available in your region‚Äù, but the message has been sent. <br><br><h5>  More tips </h5><br><br>  In the application's help or on one of the pages, add the ability to write to the author.  This will simplify the process and do not need to wait for a possible answer.  The user himself will be able to report an error. <br><br>  It is convenient to compare Stacktrace with the revocation date, if it contains a technical error.  If it is not processed, then you will see it. <br><br>  I hope this information will help the developers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136538/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136538/</a></p>
