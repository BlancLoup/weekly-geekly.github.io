Moreover, Mr. Klimenko also said that 22 thousand municipal authorities are ready to go for it immediately. <br><br>  Ksenia Sobchak talked with German Klimenko, about the upcoming changes, about the problems of the Internet industry in Russia, about the new status and the old ‚Äúsinners‚Äù of the newly-minted official. <a name="habracut"></a>

      "Megamind" leads the most interesting quotes from the <a href="https://snob.ru/selected/entry/104251/page/2">interview</a> . <br><br><h4>  The main problem of the state is communication with the Internet </h4><br><blockquote>  The main problem of the state in communication with the Internet was that they did not meet or overlap - no luck.  The problem was in discommunication. <br><br>  Now I will explain with an example.  In principle, the state does not understand how Pavel Durov can not accept officials appointed by Putin.  And it is very simple.  He grew up in his apartment, in his school, he began to earn early.  He is the generation that does not understand the value of state communication at all.  Therefore, he had big problems. <br><br>  The first wave of programmers, especially dotcom, spawned a very interesting feature: in an empty environment where there were no managers, programmers came to power.  I really respect programmers, but when they come to power, they absolutely do not understand the rules.  They are not managers, they have done business, money has appeared, but the level of their mutual relations with the authorities is zero.  They do not understand why we need this relationship.  That's all the problems. <br><br>  I want to draw your attention to the fact that the problems you are talking about are very dependent on the knowledge of officials.  It seems to us that we are equal to ‚Äúthat Internet‚Äù: they have Google - we have Yandex, they have Facebook - we have Vkontakte.  It all looks very beautiful with one small exception: the Internet came to us 10 years later.  Therefore, they have all the officials trained, and we have the only minister Nikiforov to whom you can write by Telegram, to arrange a meeting.  The state is always quite conservative, I see no sin in it.  Officials are trained, we are 10 years late, but we are catching up.  And if we have 90% of untrained officials, it is still 10% of specialists. </blockquote><br><h4>  About closing Twitter, Telegram, Facebook and other resources </h4><br><blockquote>  Twitter representatives came to me, asked questions about the future.  I honestly told them that they had foreshadowed the future with their own hands, they put a sword and banner in the hands of local developers. <br><br>  If you ask about Telegram, I will repeat my theses again, and you will again make the headline: ‚ÄúKlimenko still wants to close Telegram‚Äù.  Although I do not want to close it, I just predict his death.  When Twitter asks me about the future, I‚Äôm telling you that if you turned off Microsoft and Google‚Äôs paid services in Crimea, you donated to local manufacturers an unkillable argument against foreign companies. <br><br>  Google performs for the US National Security Agency 32 thousand requests per year.  In Russia, it is two times smaller than the population, that is, our law enforcement agencies must make about 18 thousand requests with a request to disclose data suspected of pedophilia, drug addiction, and the organization of murders.  I have one question for you: is it worth asking Google to disclose information about criminal acts so that you personally feel safe? <br><br>  I am a supporter of equality, both tax and any other.  If Yandex is forced to issue data, then the rest must also issue data and comply with Russian legislation. <br><br>  Do not misunderstand me: for one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D10153714219683672%26set%3Da.86024203671.79648.706428671%26type%3D3%26theater">comment</a> of the editor-in-chief of Meduza Gali Timchenko, that I ‚Äúlicked myself‚Äù the position of adviser, I, as an individual, would have closed this site long ago.  Well, that I have no rights. </blockquote><br><h4>  About the first steps in business </h4><br><blockquote>  My very first own business was typing.  I then very quickly typed.  I gave ads in the newspaper "From hand to hand."  And he always said that if I ever get rich, I will put a monument to this newspaper.  At this point, the demand for programming was about zero. <br><br>  And then in the company ‚ÄúEleks‚Äù, where my mother worked, there was a problem with the accounting department.  It was necessary to do something, and the first program ‚ÄúAccountant without problems‚Äù appeared.  I put it, I figured it out, it seemed to me that I know everything, and I began to give the following announcements to "Hand in Hand": "I keep balance sheets."  I still do not know how many companies I have ruined, because my level of understanding of accounting was zero. </blockquote><br><h4>  On the status of presidential adviser, companies, torrents and offshore sale </h4><br><blockquote>  If the torrent is not closed, then the law is respected.  This is the same as offshore companies: offshore companies are not prohibited, this is a normal service. <br><br>  I do not sell anything since January 4, 2016.  Until December 22, I never dreamed of switching to a civil service.  And now, to the public's demand, you are clearly exploiting the term ‚Äúpresidential adviser‚Äù.  Do not worry, please continue, you have the right. <br><br>  If I wanted to hide something - I assure you, there are things that you will never know, and you do not need to know.  I am quite well able to use all means. <br><br>  In the possession of the torrent, I see no sin.  If he belonged to me, I would say that. <br><br>  Our main problem on the Internet is the legal definition of ownership.  Suppose I have a programmer in my shares, to whom I have given 10% physically, and 30% legally.  Our legislation does not support this.  How will I do it? </blockquote><br><h4>  About plans and forecasts </h4><br><blockquote>  Such a question arose two years ago: what will happen after Yandex?  What will happen after Facebook?  And the answer now has become absolutely obvious.  After ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, after Facebook there will be ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù.  I do not like this word.  But it will be the integration of the Internet with iron. <br><br>  With anything - with construction, with housing and communal services.  If we do not do this, we will lose.  As oil is now turning into rubble, Yandex, Rambler and Mail.ru will also turn into rubble.  There will be other companies, most likely foreign ones.  If we talk about telemedicine, then it is clear that our chips, bracelets and other gadgets will not be there, but there may still be our software products. <br><br>  Yes, my minimum task is to try to dock famous developers and try to establish a dialogue between government and industry. <br><br>  We spend $ 2-3 billion annually on the purchase of software for government agencies.  This is the money that we could spend on developing our own software. </blockquote><br><h4>  Quiz </h4><br>  <b>Name the three most talented businessmen in Russia, including those from your industry.</b> <br><br>  Tinkov, Kaspersky and, probably, Arkady Volozh. <br><br>  <b>If you now had only $ 1 million, in which new business would you invest it?</b> <br><br>  On the contribution. <br><br>  <b>VTB, under 12%?</b> <br><br>  Yes. <br><br>  <b>Imagine that you have a magic wand, giving you the opportunity to change any three laws in Russian legislation.</b>  <b>What are these three laws?</b> <br><br>  I would cancel the VAT.  I would give more rights vigilantes.  We have such a problem that the state does not trust citizens to defend themselves.  And I personally do not have the right to expel homeless people from my doorway. <br><br>  <b>If you had the opportunity to kill any brand, which one would you kill?</b>  <b>You can make it so that something just will not be - the same Facebook or "Yandex".</b> <br><br>  Recently, I have been more concerned with the children's topic, because my youngest child is five years old.  To be honest, some cartoon producers ‚Äî let's call them the common word ‚ÄúTeletubbies‚Äù - deserve no mercy at all. <br><br><h4>  <b>PS:</b> "Greedy Ghouls" </h4><br>  Yesterday <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/56b8eadb9a7947bb75854a89">it became known</a> that German Klimenko refused to apologize for his words about the rights holders, whom he had previously called ‚Äúgreedy ghouls‚Äù. <br><br>  In late January, Klimenko, in an interview with the RSN, said that in the face of falling incomes, rightholders must drastically reduce prices, but they do not do this: "If we say simple words, rightholders demand their own, you can call them greedy ghouls or whatever." <br><br>  After that, the leaders of the largest Russian companies, producers and film industry workers addressed an open letter to Klimenko, in which they expressed dissatisfaction with his position.  The letter was signed by Konstantin Ernst, Karen Shakhnazarov, Alexander Tsekalo and some others. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI, at first, did not even read what they wrote.  I was interested in another question - around me bad people suddenly go out and start saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not bad‚Äù.  Nobody meant any people, it was about a simple thing: that if the right holders want the population to become legal and honest, you need to lower prices.  But they do not, because they are greedy ghouls, "said Klimenko, explaining that he does not give up his words.  ‚ÄúAnd when they say to me‚Äú Herman, will you apologize? ‚Äù- I say: I, first of all, I won‚Äôt even read,‚Äù RBC quoted him as saying. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298570/</a></p>
