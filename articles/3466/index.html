Project management, Life is like one big project.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Intro.</b> <br>  Everyone knows that there is such a profession to manage projects. <br>  Some people think that any programmer can do this with knowledge and a deep understanding of the process. Someone thinks that everyone has his own business and the performer must perform, and the manager must manage. <br>  Anyway, Project Manager, Project Manager as a profession exists, develops and is in high demand. <br><br>  This is the first post on my professional blog. <br>  I noticed that there are people who are interested in the theory and practice of process management in a company built on Project activities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My experience is not great, but I realized that I have something to share professionally and the experience grows exponentially, so first I will share what I know now, and I will continue to grow before your eyes (I hope) with you.

      I will not write point by point, and take notes in the form of notes, it will be more a story about how I came to what I do with highlighting, emphasizing the main and important points that will somehow overlap with the theory. <br><br>  <b>Who it?</b> <br>  So what is a Project Manager?  The project manager is a philosophy of perception of the world, I understand that it sounds loud, but it is just that. <br><br>  Man A leader is a lifestyle - this is a worldview in which you can plan, know how to balance, know how to respond to the prevailing circumstances, conditions. A project manager is a person who connects the creative stream with technical knowledge, marketing and deep knowledge of the technological environment.  (We are not talking about turning people into cyborgs, which lay out all their lives on planning, resource management and control of tasks, we are talking about a normal balanced understanding of the place of the profession in a person‚Äôs life). <br><br>  <b>Who can become a Project Manager?</b> <br>  You know, when I was little, I wanted to become a lot of people ... <br>  Fireman, Gorbachev, Archeologist, Historian, but each time my parents found reasons to dissuade me, arguing that they need to initially have some qualities for someone to work (relatively speaking, innate predispositions): <br>  Being a fireman - you need to be very brave and strong, this is not for you. <br>  Gorbachev - you, that this is the president, where you are before him, you need to study well. <br>  Archaeologist - they receive little and constantly dig in the ground. <br>  Historian - you write poorly in Russian, a lot of mistakes. <br><br>  And for the project manager, I was supposedly very slow and dispersed.  But I realized one thing (I didn‚Äôt open America, but still) - For me, this work has become an eternal challenge to my slowness and dispersion, all my forces are aimed at improving myself in the desired direction, so if you think that this is not for you , but you feel that you are still drawn to project-management activities - Dare. <br><br>  In conclusion, I will say that this is not a simple matter, but extremely interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3466/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3466/</a></p>
