This is of course my personal conclusions, I hope everyone will find something of their own.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt know the author, but if I like it, I‚Äôll add one more life-affirming one to upd. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In Brooklyn, New York, there is a school for the poorly trained d, etey.  Some children stay in this school for the duration of their studies, others go to other schools after a certain time. <br><br><h4>  Divine perfection </h4><br>  <b>About this</b> day, during a charity dinner, the father of this school made a speech that none of those present would forget.  After praising the staff and organizing the school, he cried out: ‚ÄúWhere is the impeccability in my son, Shay?  All that God created, he created with perfection.  But my child cannot perceive and understand things in the same way as other children.  My child cannot remember dates and numbers in the same way other children can.  So what is the divine perfection? ‚Äù <br><br>  Everyone at the charity dinner was shocked by the question and saddened by the suffering of his father.

      ‚ÄúI believe,‚Äù continued the father, ‚Äúthat when God allows a person like my son to be born, impeccability is reflected in the way people treat him.‚Äù <br><br>  And then he told the following story about his son - Shay. <br><br>  One afternoon, Shaya and his father were walking in the park.  Not far from them, boys played baseball.  Shaya asked: "Dad, do you think they will let me play with them?" <br><br>  The father knew that his son was not at all sporty and that most boys did not want him to play on their team.  But the father understood that if his son was taken to play, a sense of team spirit and playing together would give Shay great pleasure. <br><br>  Then the father went up to one of the playing boys and asked if his son Shai could play with them. <br><br>  The lad looked around, looking for support from his comrades.  But without meeting anyone's eyes, he made the decision: ‚ÄúWe are now losing six points and playing on the eighth serve.  I think he can play in our team and we will try to give him a bat in the ninth pitch. ‚Äù <br><br>  My father was delighted, and Shaya smiled broadly! <br><br>  Shae was told to take the glove and go to the centering short position. <br><br>  By the end of the eighth submission, Shai's team won back five points, but was still behind.  Toward the end of the ninth submission, Shai's team was able to play another point and now the outcome of the match was decided.  It was Xai's turn to pick up the bat. <br><br>  Will Shay's team allow to play in such a responsible situation, when victory depends only on him? <br><br>  Surprisingly, Shae was given a bat.  Everyone knew that it was unbelievable, because Shaya did not even know how to hold it correctly.  So the server took a step back and gently threw the ball high into the air, so that Shay would be easier to beat him.  Swing bat and ... by! <br><br>  Then one guy from Shai's team approached him and took the bat along with Shay to help him fight off this time. <br><br>  The server again threw gently the ball.  Shaya, along with a friend, waved the bat and together slightly slammed the ball to the server.  The server easily picked up the ball and now could throw it further to his player.  This would mean that Shaya lost and the game would have to end. <br><br>  Instead, the server picked up the ball and threw it with a force far behind his player. <br><br>  Everyone began to shout: ‚ÄúShaya!  Run!  Run to the first base! ‚Äù <br><br>  Never in his life did Shaya run to first base.  Eyes wide, a little frightened, he abruptly ran.  By the time he reached first base, the player in the opposing team had already picked up the ball.  He should now throw the ball to his next player at second base, which is why Shai, who was still running, was leaving the game. <br><br>  But this boy understood the intentions of the server, who launched the ball to him too much.  Therefore, he also intentionally with force and inaccurately threw the ball to his next player. <br><br>  Everyone howled: ‚ÄúShaya!  Run to second base!  Run to the second! ‚Äù <br><br>  Shaya ran straight to second base.  Then on the third!  He ran that was the strength!  The boys from both teams ran after him and shouted: ‚ÄúCome on, Shaya!  Run to your home base! ‚Äù <br><br>  When Shaya stepped onto the home base, all eighteen boys who were playing that day ran up to him, congratulated him, lifted him up and made him the hero of today's game, because thanks to him the team won a victory point. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn this day,‚Äù said the father quietly with tears rolling down his face, ‚Äú18 guys showed their divine impeccability‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Father's glance (parable promised in title) </h4><br>  This true story is about a boy and his father.  They loved to go to local football competitions together.  And even though the boy was always sitting on the bench, his father stood cheering him on all the time.  While the boy was in school, his father never missed a single game. <br><br>  The boy really liked football and he firmly decided that he would play.  He diligently attended all the training sessions, not missing a single one and always did everything in his power.  But, unfortunately, he was kept on the bench all the time.  And my father always came to the games and rooted for him, shouting words of support. <br><br>  So a few years have passed.  The guy went to college, but he didn‚Äôt work well in football.  The coach admitted to himself that he was holding him only because of his diligence and dedication, which helped other players to gather and gave them hope. <br><br>  The insistent boy did not miss a single workout while studying at the institute, but he never took part in the game.  The season of football meetings between the teams of the institutes was already ending, during one of the trainings the guy was brought a telegram.  He read it and froze.  After swallowing a lump in his throat, he said quietly to the coach: ‚ÄúMy father died this morning.  Nothing that I will miss the next workout? ‚ÄùThe trainer hugged him gently by the shoulders and said:‚Äú Of course, rest your son!  Last Saturday's game we can play without you. ‚Äù <br><br>  Saturday has come.  The last game was not in favor of the guy's team.  During the second half of the match, the guy quietly slipped into the locker room and put on his football uniform.  Then he ran onto the field to the coach.  His teammates and coach were very surprised when they saw that he came back so quickly.  ‚ÄúCoach, please let me out on the field!  I just have to play today, ‚Äùthe boy pleaded.  The coach pretended not to hear him - he did not want to release the worst player in the last decisive game.  But the young man insisted and finally, feeling pity for him, the coach allowed him to enter the field. <br><br>  After a minute, neither the coach, nor the players, no one on the field could believe his eyes.  This puny unknown guy, who had never played before, did everything excellently!  The enemy team simply could not stop it.  He ran, passed, intercepted the opponent's passes as a professional football player.  His team began to prevail.  And now, in the last seconds of the game, the guy intercepted the pass and scored the decisive goal with an accurate kick.  Spectators were raging.  The team players hugged and clapped him on the shoulders.  It was something! <br><br>  After everyone had gone, the coach was surprised to see that the guy was sitting alone in the corner of the locker room.  The coach approached and said: ‚ÄúSon!  I can not believe what I saw.  You were excellent.  Tell me what happened?  Tell me how you did it? ‚Äù <br><br>  The guy looked at the coach with tears in his eyes and said: ‚ÄúYou know, because my father died.  But did you know that he was blind? ‚Äù <br><br>  The guy swallowed a lump in his throat and smiled through force. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMy father came to all my games, but today was the first game he could see.  And I wanted to show him what I can do! ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúYour father is proud of you now,‚Äù the trainer smiled and patted the boy on the shoulder! <br><br>  <i>PS Here's a friend story, perhaps it is even true.</i>  <i>Probably this is not for Habr fasting, but there is so much negativity in the news, and if you live in Moscow, then it‚Äôs ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù to go out on the street) By the way, if you can (need it), I want to read similar stories from life, to lift the mood.</i>  <i>Vobschem all summer!</i> <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Transferred to parables, thank you.  Thanks for the karma, but I would like you to read more.) <br>  <b>UPD:</b> Added the second, did not do one topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92823/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92823/</a></p>
