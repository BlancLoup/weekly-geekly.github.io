  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Virtual Reality vs Augmented Reality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, there have often been discussions about the difference between augmented reality and virtual reality.  Both technologies are constantly on the ear, they are talked about in the media, talk online, write in books and show in films.  So what is the difference between virtual reality and augmented reality? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b90/85b/c26/b9085bc2692b48518959adb6fc806f4d.jpg"><br><br><h4>  What is virtual reality? </h4><br>  The concept of artificial (virtual) reality was first introduced by American computer artist Myron Krueger (Myron Krueger) in the late 60s.

      Virtual reality (VR) is a computer simulation of reality or the reproduction of a situation.  By technical means, it reproduces the world (objects and subjects) transmitted to the user through his sensations: sight, hearing, smell, touch, etc.  Virtual reality imitates both impact and reaction to impact. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As a rule, ‚Äúimmersion‚Äù in virtual reality is achieved through special gadgets.  Basic goals: <br>  - create and improve the imaginary reality of games, entertainment, video, 3D-films, etc .; <br>  - to improve the quality of life, to give an opportunity to prepare for a certain event, creating an imitation of reality, where people can practice certain skills (for example, flight simulator for pilots). <br><br>  Virtual reality is created using a coding language known as Virtual Reality Modeling (VRML).  It can be used to create a series of images, as well as specify the types of interactions between them. <br><br><h4>  What is augmented reality? </h4><br>  The term ‚Äúaugmented reality‚Äù was proposed by the researcher of the Boeing aerospace corporation Tom Kodell in 1990. <br><br>  Augmented reality (augmented reality, AR) is a technology that superimposes computer-modeled layers of improvements on existing reality.  The main goal is to make it more expressive, multifaceted and bright.  Augmented reality is developed in applications and used on mobile devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce2/608/0aa/ce26080aaa1946a087b73023f2c0b8b3.jpg"><br><br>  The most popular examples of DPs are a parallel front color line showing the location of the nearest field player to the gate during a televised football match, arrows indicating the distance from the penalty kick to the gate, the ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù puck flight path during a hockey match, etc. <br><br><h4>  Augmented Reality vs Virtual Reality </h4><br>  Augmented reality and virtual reality is the opposite mapping of one to the other with the fact that each of the technologies seeks to provide the user.  Virtual reality offers a digital reproduction of the real situation of life, while augmented reality provides virtual elements in the form of overlaying layers on the real world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f32/559/050/f32559050aea4a15b88e2ca5761cda19.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The similarity of virtual reality and augmented reality </h4><br>  <b>Technology.</b>  Augmented and virtual reality involve the same types of technology, and each of them exists to serve the benefit of users to enrich and improve their life experiences. <br><br>  <b>Entertainment.</b>  Both technologies are able to diversify the leisure of users, making it brighter and more fun.  More recently, these technologies seemed the fictional fruit of science fiction.  But now new artificial worlds come to life and are revealed to users who can control them.  Deeper interaction with the real world is also becoming achievable.  Leading technology magnates are developing new adaptations, improvements to products and applications that support augmented and virtual reality technologies. <br><br>  <b>Science and medicine.</b>  Virtual and augmented reality have great potential in modernizing medicine.  With their help, not only examinations and consultations, but also more serious things, such as remote surgery, are possible.  These technologies have already been used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. <br><br><h4>  Differences of virtual reality and augmented reality </h4><br>  <b>Purpose.</b>  Augmented reality enhances experience by adding virtual components, such as digital images, graphics, or sensations, as a new layer of interaction with the real world.  In contrast, virtual reality creates its own reality, which is fully generated and controlled by a computer. <br><br>  <b>Mode of transmission.</b>  Virtual reality, as a rule, is served to the user through a helmet or remote.  Equipment data connects a person with a virtual reality, allows you to control and manage your actions in this environment, simulating the real world.  Augmented reality is increasingly being used in mobile devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets to change the look of the real world.  These are the interactions of digital images and graphics. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.augment.com/blog/virtual-reality-vs-augmented-reality/">Link to the original article.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393835/</a></p>
