It does not matter what you sell - cough pills or a career excavator.  To sell or service a product or service, systems are needed that control consumer experience and constantly provide the customer with the right feelings and the right information. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oracle/blog/269225/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5b/7f0/6e3/c5b7f06e31ef4b8793497350d39d8311.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is believed that the majority of clients who bring money to business belong either to generation X or to the generation of millennials (Table 1). <br><br>  Traditionalists (1932‚Äì1945) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3b/7cc/1c4/c3b7cc1c43e943da830dd6655ce723bd.png">

Their main differences from the Millennials are collected in Table.  2 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/192/625/812/1926258126e94b1196500a8e294733d4.png"><br><br>  Loyalty (loyalty) of buyers to the brand is one of the modern myths.  A recent Oracle study found that customers are not loyal to the brand, but attached to it.  At the heart of this attachment is not a positive emotion, not the joy that consumption of products or services associated with a particular brand delivers, but the negative is the fear of losing the comfort that consumers get if they are forced to switch to a new brand. <br><br>  And this is not by chance.  According to the work of Brian Solis, a western media researcher and customer experience phenomena, many companies build their business model on the suffering of consumers.  A typical example is American airlines, which, according to Solis, diligently drive their clients into torment in order to cash in, saving them from this torment, instead of providing new content, new content, community and dialogue. <br><br>  Oracle helps to radically improve the customer experience of your customers.  The Oracle Customer Experience solution manages three fundamental components: continuous customer support across all channels, a proactive understanding of customer needs and optimal fulfillment of promises made to the customer.  In this article, we will look at Oracle solutions to increase customer loyalty in telecommunications and the retail industry, particularly in the retail banking industry. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Telecommunications</font> </h1><br>  Despite the massive consumption of products and services, telecommunications providers are not always able to cope with the high expectations of consumers.  Oracle Marketing, Commerce, Sales, Service, Communications and Retail solutions offer the following key components that can change this situation. <br><br><ul><li>  Subscriber lifecycle management. </li><li>  Intelligence-driven marketing: improving segmentation and targeting, reducing consumer churn. </li><li>  Perfect order: from price quotes to a contract. </li><li>  Service ‚Äúonce and ready!‚Äù </li><li>  Optimize corporate sales. </li><li>  Smart e-commerce. </li></ul><br>  For example, Oracle offers solutions that contain tools for simple selection of equipment and a tariff plan, personalized search for information and solutions, depending on customer needs and availability of sources on social networks and from external content providers.  Perhaps the inclusion of customer reviews and information from social networks in the product catalog. <br><br>  An exceptionally valuable service will be the proactive inclusion of a service provider when a customer needs help.  Most of the support service regulations only work when there is a signal from the client, and for this the client has to knock on different channels for a long time.  An electronic digital assistant, information in a proactive client chat, a function of a call from the site to the support service can help.  And most importantly - the ability to proactively diagnose a situation where a client needs help in the channel in which he is currently located.  This leads to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. <br><br>  A great opportunity for any supplier - ensuring ‚Äúperfect order‚Äù.  Oracle solutions will allow the customer to place an order online, pick up equipment (or communicate with an expert) in the store and will inform him of the current status of the order and the location of the equipment and employees. <br><br>  Inexhaustible topic of self-service.  The Oracle Customer Experience solution will allow you to offer customers enhanced self-service options ‚Äî offering help depending on the context, a set of questions for self-diagnosing a problem;  flexibility for self-management of services, self-activation and cancellation of services.  As a result, customers are motivated to use self-service tools or to contact the community for help. <br><br>  Oracle also has a set of solutions called Social Development Management.  It will allow you to ‚Äúlisten in‚Äù to social networks in order to understand what is important to your customers and use them to expand traditional marketing and service channels.  This is important not only in order to interact with the client without leaving the network, the entire social network (that is, roughly speaking, the whole world) will see that you are responding to customer requests.  As a result, you get a complete look at the customer using all possible channels, including online, stores, social networks, using both traditional and unstructured data. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#ff0000">Retail</font> </h1><br>  Modern retail trade is based on three elephants: attracting a client, its proactive understanding and optimal fulfillment of its requests.  In fig.  Figure 1 shows the Oracle CX for Retail solution map, the purpose of which is to associate each consumer interaction with your brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5c/5de/cdd/b5c5decddddb42deadccc0d21d39055f.png"><br><br>  Oracle offers cross-channel integrated customer travel for the retail business, including marketing, e-commerce, sales and service;  Enhanced business intelligence that helps ensure customer attachment and loyalty  solutions that ensure the client‚Äôs unimpeded path from desire to fulfillment, including supply chain management, Oracle Workspace Manager, and field service. <br><br>  Dynamic personalization is extremely important today - it is already successfully used by Amazon and iTunes, and your customers do not understand why you are not doing this.  The integrated set of Oracle Customer Experience solutions allows you to solve this problem. <br><br>  It is important to use the capability of the device through which the client interacts with you, and to optimize the content that the client receives for this device.  The generation of millennials uses at least two screens, and for the new generation that comes after millenials, already three or four screens are relevant - therefore, your content should be adequately displayed on all screens that customers use. <br><br>  A proactive understanding of customers can be expressed in real-time recommendations, and the dream of any marketer is an understanding of hidden potential.  The Oracle Commerce package has the functionality that allows you, by personalizing a website or a mobile phone screen, to anticipate what the customer wants to see and to deliver relevant content to the device screen. <br><br>  Optimization of operations involves interaction, integration of all channels and the provision of assistance - this will be the foundation of customer loyalty and affection. <br><br>  In general, loyalty is a very big and interesting topic.  Oracle offers the loyalty engine, called Siebel Loyalty, and allows you not just to cheat up any points, but to transform your program from discount to bonus, to create clubs according to your interests, thereby changing the consumer experience for the better. <br><br>  As an example of a complete industry-wide complex of Oracle solutions for the retail business, a set of Oracle industry solutions for banks can be given.  It allows you to manage the customer's life cycle;  manage marketing in real time, setting it to improve segmentation and targeting and reduce customer churn;  automate loan conveyor and debt collection, optimize corporate sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/f23/450/ca4f2345087c4962b5f19e11be73b69a.png"><br><br>  The map of functionality of Oracle solutions for banks is shown in Fig.  2. Most of this functionality remains relevant regardless of the industry, and it can be found in solutions for transport, in insurance and others. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is important to note that Oracle continues to develop its sales hit - Oracle Siebel CRM, in which sets of industry-specific accelerators, new interfaces for customers and employees, and also develops industry-wide functionality in cloud products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/269225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/269225/</a></p>
