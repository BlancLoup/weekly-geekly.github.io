  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MDK platform enters the Russian market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/875/efc/e8d/875efce8d3534b61867382bd180b6831.jpg" align="left">  The history of the development of instant messaging technologies, originating in the last century and replete with fascinating stories about breakthrough discoveries, steep ups and sharp falls, continues.  In August, a new MDK (Messenger Development Kit) communication platform was introduced in Moscow to create messengers on the white label principle.  Recently, statements such as ‚ÄúMessengers have taken over the world‚Äù are increasingly being heard.  Indeed, instant messengers occupy the first lines of the rating lists of mobile applications in almost all parts of the globe.  The ability to instantly send a text message, sticker, photo or video to colleagues and friends is actually every smartphone owner.  If some time ago the main platform for communication (both personal and professional) and information exchange were social networks, now there is a clear tendency to move to instant messengers.  The list of interesting ideas that extend the already decent list of features of IM applications continues to grow with successful projects: for example, Telegram allows you to exchange encrypted messages, FireChat can send messages without Internet at all. <br><br>  Under the conditions of tough competition among instant messaging favorites (like WatsApp, WeChat, FB-Messenger, Viber, etc.), a new brand appeared on the world stage and on the Russian IT market.  This is not a messenger, it is something more - a platform for creating instant messengers of any format using the latest developments and unique technologies.  The German company MDK (Messenger Development Kit), the development team from Tourmaline Labs (USA) and the Russian company 3data announced the completion of the infrastructure testing stage for creating instant messengers on the white label principle.  The MDK communication platform is primarily aimed at creating corporate instant messengers for large companies and government organizations of any profile that, in addition to transmitting diverse content - video, audio, text, also requires broad compatibility with networks and network protocols, a powerful security and encryption complex. , binding to payment systems and many other functions, none of which can be called secondary. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem of creating a good messenger that is suitable for all corporate tasks is further complicated by the fact that even two companies of the same scale working in the same field do not have, and by definition there cannot be two identical business models, and therefore the same tools to achieve business goals.  For example, a messenger for a state institution needs reliable protection, financiers will surely add maximum reliability and stability of communications to data protection, and a medical messenger in addition will require mandatory anonymity to keep medical confidentiality.  For a logistics company, the first place will be mobile integration with the ability to make quick changes to plans and send alerts to customers, and the restaurant business will be happy to send advertising and updated menu to mobile customers within a certain radius from one of the network establishments.  For high school, the most important may be a deep interactive dialogue between professors and students with the possibility of sending educational materials in any convenient format, and for online schools and courses - a mobile messenger application with an integrated form of payment for each lesson. <br><br>  Ingenious loners, who created masterpieces in their garages in the era of the "Wild West" messengers, simply can not cope with today's task of such complexity.  However, even an excellent team of coherently working programmers will have to spend a lot of time on creating a customized version of the messenger that is perfectly tuned to the tasks of a particular company.  And the money available to not every customer.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/393/27b/a1a/39327ba1a29a4bd9aa0dc991225646fd.jpg" align="left">  The creators of the MDK (Messenger Development Kit) successfully solved all of the above tasks by developing a communication platform for creating a contextual multifunctional application messenger with exactly the set of features that are required by a specific customer at a specific development stage of his company with unlimited ability to integrate all necessary and used third-party services. <br><br>  All the tools needed to implement the most ambitious large-scale projects have already been laid in the platform's potential, so the customer is left with nothing ‚Äî to show an unlimited flight of fancy at the stage of setting the task plus come up with an original name for his fully customized messenger.  The messenger platform, flexibly scalable to the needs of even the largest organizations, has a high-quality data processing infrastructure with their encrypted transmission and storage.  Thanks to the use of the MSQL protocol, low power consumption is incorporated into the MDK functionality.  In addition to secure storage of data in the cloud, the platform can also be installed directly on the customer‚Äôs equipment in its data center.  At the same time, personal data of users can be stored both in the cloud of the platform supplier and directly on the customer‚Äôs own servers.  One of the most important features of the platform is the ability to determine the locations for storing personal data of users, thereby observing local legislation. <br><br>  The enormous potential of the MDK platform, which allows it to provide multi-channel secure messaging for the needs of virtually any company and organization, lies in its flexible architecture designed to integrate data from external sources and content providers.  Users can enjoy deep profile customization, integration of multifunctional corporate mobile and context-sensitive applications, as well as any third-party media services and social networks - from ICQ to YouTube, Facebook and WhatsApp, with the ability to collect and analyze user statistics. <br><br>  Already in the basic set of MDK functions, there is full compatibility with all the platforms and operating systems relevant today, support for the exchange of audio (including VoIP), video, graphic or text messages among individual users or user groups, the ability to conduct chat subscribers and video conferencing and make payments . <br><br>  If necessary, using the included ContextKit context identifier and mega-geofencing technology, the MDK-based messenger can be configured for advanced control and monitoring of personnel and facilities.  Thus, the location service, which constantly monitors geolocation data, will provide analytics processing based on the location history of users.  Geofense will provide data collection and tracking of information on the movement of objects in local zones with a radius specified by the user, as well as sampling by various parameters.  Thanks to the accumulation of data on the duration of events, locations, type of tasks, start and end time of their execution, you can configure continuous monitoring of tasks in real time, simultaneously determining the distance of users from each other, as well as ensuring the secure identification of each of them by context-sensitive profile. <br><br>  Location services fully support geotags and sending push notifications about messages and upcoming events, thus facilitating scheduling for both individual contacts and groups of users.  The messenger can be configured to automatically work the voice recognition service, transfer audio messages to text and to another language using the same Google Translate, as well as transfer and receive money through third-party payment services of Google Wallet and PayPal. <br><br>  From a technical point of view, the creation of a flexibly customizable platform for a universal and highly scalable messenger is not an easy task, and not every team can manage it.  In the case of MDK Labs, established in 2015 in Berlin, two key factors most likely played a role.  The first is initially a high ambitious plan for creating an ultra-modern universal product in the corporate messaging market, and the second factor is an international team of global specialists with a deep specialization in each affected industry - from communications and security to TIME-industry, online payments and e-commerce. <br><br>  The platform was actively tested in the past six months in North America, Europe and Russia.  On the Russian side, the MDK platform was tested by 3data, which owns the necessary rights and licenses to represent the product on the Russian market. <br><br>  The new platform, accumulating all the latest technical developments and allowing to integrate any third-party applications and services, will allow Russian and international companies wishing to create a corporate messenger from scratch or looking for an opportunity to upgrade an already working tool of dialogue communication, not just to use all modern communication capabilities, but also to their most effective. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/267621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/267621/</a></p>
