      In this article, I want to turn novice designers to a number of elementary techniques that should be followed to obtain a stable working circuit and reduce measurement error or minimize the distortion factor of the audio path.  For clarity, the information is presented in the form of consideration of two examples. <br><br>  The recommendations are very simple and known to many, however, as my practice has shown, it is far from always even experts with experience adhere to them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#66a3be">Example number two.</font>  <font color="#66a3be">Trace simple op amp circuit</font> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0d/e22/662/f0de2266299041c79fa0ad88f6d176ab.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1. Amplifier circuit at the shelter</i> <br><br>  To begin, consider the simplest example.  Just a few resistors and capacitors are a non-inverting amplifier with a voltage gain of 2. Set ourselves the task of optimizing the area tracing and consider two options.  The board in both cases is double-layered, the upper signal layer is red, the bottom is blue.  The right option is not only slightly smaller in area, the main thing in it is less likely to cause parasitic connections. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df6/1fe/667/df61fe6679524d43b9c64f87e2954bba.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2. Two options for tracing the amplifier board at the OS</i> <br><br>  First, pay attention to how the blocking capacitor C2 is installed on the right side of the figure - at the minimum distance from the power supply terminal.  Secondly, the negative voltage coming from the source first goes to the capacitor and only from there to the OU power supply.  This simple technique greatly increases the efficiency of the blocking capacitor.  I did the same with capacitor C1.  By the way, if you use several blocking capacitors, for example, tantalum of large capacity and ceramic less, then the capacitor of smaller capacity should be located closer to the power supply, since it has less parasitic inductance and suppresses high-frequency noise better. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A small offtopic, not directly related to the topic of today's article</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <font color="#66a3be"><i>I strongly advise you to use the same technique when applying power to other types of microcircuits, especially ADC, DAC, and numerous power supply pins of microcontrollers.</i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>If you use the built-in analog modules of the microcontroller - ADC, DAC, comparators, reference sources, do not be too lazy to look into the datasheet and see which blocking capacitors are in what quantity and where to install.</i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>The interchange circuit in the form of a filter or at least resistance between the main <s>digital</s> power supply of the microcontroller and the analog one will not interfere.</i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>It is better to place analog ground with a separate polygon <s>or screen layer</s> , and connect with the main ground at one point, in some cases it is useful through the filter</i></font> </div></div><br>  The elements of the feedback circuit should be located as close as possible to the non-inverting input, which minimizes the possibility of interference to the high-resistance input circuit. <br><br>  Instead of separate ground conductors, grounding of the lower layer of the board with a <s>screen layer is used</s> , which reduces parasitic pickups.  At the end, one more recommendation - do not leave the bends of conductors at a right angle - smooth them out as much as possible, this reduces the length of conductors, the probability of pickups and signal reflections. <br><br>  We proceed to a more serious and interesting case from the field of measurements, where the trace is important for archives. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#66a3be">Example number one.</font>  <font color="#66a3be">Trace consumption current monitor on instrument amplifier</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/453/7a2/327/4537a2327f504033ba0510db1437c21d.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>3. Scheme of the current monitor using instrumental OS</i> <br><br>  The figure shows a diagram of the meter consumed current.  The measuring element is the resistance of the shunt included in the supply circuit.  The load on which the current is measured - <b>R</b> load.  The measured voltage is removed from the resistance <b>R</b> shunt and filtered using a symmetrical circuit on the elements R1, R2, C1-C3.  Chip U2 is used to supply the reference voltage.  R4, C5 - output filter. <br><br>  When tracing, of course, you must follow all the recommendations that were given above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c8/fe6/d74/1c8fe6d74b854ea2b16e2b564a33f0b9.png"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>4. Two options for tracing the amplifier board on the instrumental OS</i> <br><br>  Let us analyze the shortcomings that the left scheme has: <br><br><ul><li>  Since we have a differential input, it is necessary to make its two signal circuits as symmetrical as possible.  The conductors of the signal lines should be of the same length and close to each other.  Ideally at the same distance from each other; <br><br></li><li>  The resistor driving the gain of the instrumentation amplifier should be located as close as possible to the pins of the microcircuit.  Even a small parasitic capacitance between conductors that go to it in the left figure can lead to a loss of stability of the instrumentation amplifier.  In general, feedback loops should be as short as possible; <br><br></li><li>  The repeater chip of the reference source must be located as close as possible to the input of the reference voltage of the instrumentation amplifier. </li></ul><br>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>By following very simple rules you make your life easier.</i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>In some cases, they simply do not cause harm, in others they can significantly improve both the stability of the circuit as a whole and the measurement accuracy.</i></font> <font color="#66a3be"><i><br><br></i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>Do not hold a loaded rifle on the wall.</i></font>  <font color="#66a3be"><i>One day it will surely shoot and choose the most inconvenient moment for this.</i></font> <br><br><h4>  In preparing this article, TI experts blog materials were used. </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399955/</a></p>
