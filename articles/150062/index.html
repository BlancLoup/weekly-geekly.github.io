  <section class="page js-page"><h1>War and peace with the Office of "K"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In our country, and especially in law enforcement, there is a unique view of things, acts and thoughts of the people living in it.  Often, the hero from the criminal is separated only by the subjective point of view of the investigator, who takes the matter with your name in hand.  So it was in the situation with one of my friends. <br><br>  Our land is not very prosperous, quite the contrary.  To some extent even dense in terms of IT.  So, this young man studied at the university, which is very prestigious by local standards.  And so it was, at the department related to the protection of information.  Being naturally inquisitive and diversified by nature, he earned his living by keeping several websites, entertainment topics, monetizing them with various affiliate programs.  The money at the output was good.  The weather was spoiling, the session was in full swing, and the telephone rang. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  War </h5><br>  A certain employee of the Central Internal Affairs Directorate with a simple and straightforward surname, insistently offered to meet.  It‚Äôs not every day that such offers come in, so at the appointed time, my unsuspecting acquaintance arrived at the door of the police station.  After 5 minutes, the bell rang and a strange request was made to move to a place nearby, closer to the private sector.  Shadows of doubt began to actively rush in my head.  It did not take long to search, a man in officer shoes and a coat ideally suited the pattern of a police officer.  The contact happened without too much pathos, a certificate was presented to a friend and invited to walk in an unknown direction.  Along the way, an employee of the department carrying out the fight against crimes in the field of information technology explained that my acquaintance had been in the spotlight for a long time, and at the moment an impressive case has been gathered that includes mentions of such lowly worldly acts as: article 146 of the Criminal Code RF (violation of copyright and related rights), article 242 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal distribution of pornographic materials or objects).  Throughout the journey, a man in a coat painted disappointing prospects, in particular, it was about fines of more than 200 thousand rubles, a criminal conviction with a suspended sentence, a spoiled future, and poor parents whose son got off the wrong track.  Arguments that: <br>  - Sites do not contain distributions of licensed software, but only point to third-party resources that may contain these files; <br>  - The content of the sites is generated by users, and not personally by the administrator; <br>  - Finally, hosting sites located in the United States and Ukraine; <br>  caused only a smirk on the face of a policeman. <br>  After 10 minutes, they stopped in front of an old private house near the city morgue.  At first glance, it is absolutely not noticeable, inside it was even worse.  Repair house has not seen for a hundred years, wiped linoleum, wallpaper with roses, CRT monitors on the tables.  Then everything was not so prosaic, it was on the table, inside there were a lot of documents from the local Internet provider, indicating ip, sessions, logs from the hoster and other surprisingly detailed information. <br>  Consciousness in colors painted the near future: court, expulsion, disgrace for the family, work as a loader.  In my ears, louder and louder began to sound "going to Magadan ...".  The setting corresponded to the inner sensations. <br><br><h5>  World </h5><br>  The pause was long.  An employee of the ‚ÄúK‚Äù department got closer and a few seconds later said: ‚ÄúNow we have everything to give the matter a turn.  Here you are for one reason only and we can solve this question differently, with benefit for both parties.  If you cooperate, you will sign non-disclosure documents, you will go home as if nothing had happened.  Twice a month, provide information about the same as you, a detailed report. "

      The condition was such that any document capable of stopping the impending catastrophe was perceived as a blessing.  In addition, common sense gradually processing the incoming information, began to build profitable combinations for themselves. <br>  Life went on as usual, a couple of ‚Äúreports‚Äù were already sent to the addressee.  In the hands of a friend had a kind of weapon that could somehow neutralize the competitors.  Loudly said, but in fact, it was so. <br><br>  This story could have an amazing ending, but ended with an appeal to the former KGB.  There, a friend was listened to with interest and no more calls from law enforcement agencies were received.  The next few months were lived in a ‚Äúlimbo‚Äù state.  The adventure is over, as a friend does not regret a bit. <br><br>  Those sites have long gone, as there are no stupid rash acts, lack of security and empty risk. <br><br><h5>  findings </h5><br>  Such far-away things happen in the real world, with real people.  If your field of activity somehow overlaps with the criminal code, try to be most clear about the responsibility that would arise in the case of the worst scenario.  Based on the practice, the demonstration process can be organized even from scratch, decorating it all with beautiful ruffles. <br><br>  And that guy, of course, he behaved extremely stupid and thoughtless.  I haven‚Äôt talked to him for a long time, but I heard from friends that he had successfully graduated from the university, found a good job and got wiser. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/63a/b7f/e1f/63ab7fe1f6a7c313abda32120c6f9195.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150062/</a></p>
