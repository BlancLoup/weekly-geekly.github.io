  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the number of RSS subscribers? Post FAQ!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Friends!  Before writing this post, I looked through all 15 pages on Habr√© by the ‚ÄúRSS‚Äù tag and realized that so far no one had raised such a topic here.  And in vain!  That's why: <br><br>  I started using RSS feed just a couple of months ago.  And not because I didn‚Äôt want it - I just didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äúwhat this RSS feed is about.‚Äù  And recently started a blog, and I had to figure out to create maximum convenience for my subscribers.  Then I remembered my hopeless experience and decided to help those who are not in the subject.  After all, these people in the network more than 70%. <br><br>  I created a simple FAQ-list and published a reference to ‚ÄúFind everything about RSS‚Äù on it, along with the call to subscribe.  As a result, people began to subscribe more actively and even began to thank me.  Nice damn!  Here's what happened: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  =================== 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <strong>What is RSS?</strong>  This is a new and popular format for presenting information on websites and blogs.  In general, I myself recently started using an RSS subscription and found that it is extremely convenient and useful. :) <br><br>  <strong>OK!</strong>  <strong>Why an RSS subscription will be useful to me?</strong>  When surfing the sites, you get, in addition to text and pictures, a bunch of service information that the RRS channel practically ignores.  This saves traffic (money) and time (also money). <br><br>  <strong>Why will RSS feed be convenient for me?</strong>  Because it allows you not to run on different sites and blogs, painfully recalling their addresses, but getting updated information directly to the RSS aggregator.  Personally, I get up at six in the morning and until seven I drink tea with sandwiches while reading ‚Äúmy favorite newspaper‚Äù - that is, subscriptions to favorite sites and blogs.  I always know, and this is valuable. <br><br>  <strong>What is an aggregator?</strong>  These are special programs and services that automatically receive information from the resources you specified.  I would call them "Newspaper on request."  Because you quickly get only what you subscribed to yourself. <br><br>  <strong>Where to get these aggregators?</strong>  Personally, I use two things: <br>  1. My favorite Opera browser (free).  Choose in the menu "News Channels", then "Manage News Channels", then "Add" and everything - copy the address of the RSS feed. <br>  2. Google Reader is an extremely popular aggregator used by more than 30% of my RSS feed subscribers. <br>  In addition, quite popular: <br>  1. Yandex-tape.  Just go and select "Add RSS-feed" and enter the address of the stream.  This aggregator can be configured so that either headers or entire messages are displayed. <br>  2. FeedReader, Activerefresh are aggregators.  Everything is simple, download, install, add RSS-feed and feeds.  In general, programs - the sea. <br><br>  <strong>Is an RSS subscription better than an e-mail subscription?</strong>  Well, how to say ... Someone got used to the mail, but I love - "MY MORNING NEWSPAPER."  See, reading mail is a ritual that implies mandatory feedback, that is, an answer.  And reading updates is getting information without having to respond.  As if there is a discrepancy, I feel it.  Therefore, I use RSS, and I recommend you to subscribe now! <br><br>  <strong>And how do you know that there is an RSS subscription on the website or on the blog?</strong>  Easy.  Pay attention to the bright RSS icon or see if there is a text link, like ‚Äúsubscribe to RSS feeds (feed, stream, update, etc.)‚Äù.  The URL of this link or icon is the URL of the RSS feed. <br><br>  ========================================== <br>  That's all.  :) <br><br>  PS See HOW IT LOOKS OUT on my blog <a href="http://tavly.blogspot.com/">here</a> , and the FAQ-list is <a href="http://tavly.blogspot.com/2007/10/rss-faq-7.html">here</a> (just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cheap advertising).  Welcome!!! <br><br>  PPS I also recommend this to owners of blogs and sites with an RSS subscription, well, it can modify it a little.  After all, your readers will be comfortable and pleasant with you. <br><br>  PPPS By the way, maybe your subscribers have other questions? <br>  Then write - I‚Äôm happy to include them in this FAQ-list. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15261/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15261/</a></p>
