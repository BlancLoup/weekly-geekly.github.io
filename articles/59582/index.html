This, in turn, leads to an increase in the costs of managing, locating, powering and cooling the systems for storing and processing increasing data sets.  According to IBM, 15 petabytes of new information are generated every day.

      IBM's innovative database software will help customers deal with these problems by optimizing hardware usage, increasing administrative efficiency, simplifying the execution of applications created in other database software environments, and achieving a new level of intelligence through the use of valuable XML data. <br><br><img src="http://www.ogilvyaction.ru/someimages/soft_216_21.jpg" alt="image"><br>  ‚ÄúIndustries like healthcare, retail and banking services oppose rising energy costs by efficiently managing, analyzing and evaluating information to achieve better business results,‚Äù said <b>Leonid Altukhov</b> , director of software sales for IBM in Russia and the CIS.  ‚ÄúBy offering new innovations in the DB2 software and InfoSphere Warehouse, IBM continues to help customers and partners improve performance and reduce energy costs.‚Äù <br><br>  The new version of DB2, code-named <b>Cobra</b> , can further reduce the resources required for data storage, helping to save up to 75% of costs, including energy costs - more than any other database software available on the market.  This new offering from IBM is also the first software product in the industry that contains business intelligence functions for both relational data and XML data. <br><br>  The software also includes workload management tools and autonomic computing functions that improve application performance with high priority (such as preparing quarterly financial reports) and help IT staff more effectively manage growing data volumes, saving up to 35%. time for administration operations. <br><br>  The University of California <a href="http://www.uclahealth.org/">Medical Center</a> ( <a href="http://www.uclahealth.org/">UCLA Medical Center</a> ) uses this technology to provide rapid access to patient electronic records, while reducing the storage resources required to manage this data by 50%. <br><br><img src="http://www.uclahealth.org/images/reagan/full/0508-1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In addition, UCLA is currently developing three clinical applications using DB2 functions that allow you to analyze and better understand the common signs and condition of patients with the same symptoms or diseases in order to determine optimal treatment methods and improve the quality of medical care for the population. <br><br>  Another company, <a href="http://www.douglas-holding.de/">Douglas Holding AG</a> , which specializes in perfumery and fashion accessories, uses DB2 to manage the statistical trading data of its European network of 1,800 stores. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b28/706/070/b28706070b40455a48270a4c2b9bb8f5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The company uses an XML-based application as a link between store cash registers and data storage.  Having tested the new version of DB2 with its application, Douglas Holding AG noted an increase in the accuracy of trade statistics, which allows the company to better understand the purchasing habits of its customers and, as a result, to improve the overall business performance. <br><br>  InfoSphere Warehouse 9.7 Enterprise Edition, which is powered by DB2 9.7, also contains tools to simplify data analysis and extract valuable information from them.  Also released is the new edition of the Departmental Edition of this software, which is targeted at small companies and individual divisions of large enterprises.  This new edition allows organizations to transform their corporate data into relevant, accurate and consistent information suitable for business analysis. <br><br>  IBM's integrated data management (Integrated Data Management) approach makes it possible to increase developer productivity, which is a prerequisite for reducing costs.  DB2 9.7 contains new technology that makes it easier for IT professionals to quickly develop and deploy applications, including programs specifically written to work with other database software.  Now developers can take advantage of these new technologies by applying IBM Data Studio to design, develop, deploy, and manage information throughout its life cycle. <br><br>  Companies that participated in the IBM Early Access Program, noted significant time savings when deploying applications in the environment of the new version of DB2.  ‚ÄúIt may take a two-year effort to convert the application for a third-party DBMS to an application for DB2 of the previous version.  We were amazed when converting a similar application to work in a new version of DB2 took us just one week.  This opens up fantastic opportunities for expanding our international community of users, partners and developers.  We are very excited about our collaboration with IBM, which contributes to the creation and distribution of new advanced application deployment tools, ‚Äùsaid <b>Paolo Juvara</b> , CTO of Openbravo, a provider of a Web-based ERP solution and IBM Business Partner. <br><br>  EnterpriseDB, another IBM Business Partner, has contributed to expanding the functionality of DB2 9.7.  ‚ÄúWe are extremely excited to work with IBM to improve and expand database technologies,‚Äù said Ed Boyajian, chief executive officer of EnterpriseDB.  ‚ÄúWe are trying to take into account and use all the changes that are taking place in the developing market of database software.‚Äù <br><br>  DB2 Version 9.7 and InfoSphere Warehouse 9.7 will be available in June.  Customers, developers, and partners can test DB2 9.7 as part of the IBM Early Access Program. <br><br>  For more information, visit <a href="http://ibm.com/db2">http://ibm.com/db2</a> , <a href="http://ibm.com/infospher">http://ibm.com/infosphere</a> and <a href="http://ibm.com/breakfree">http://ibm.com/breakfree</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59582/</a></p>
