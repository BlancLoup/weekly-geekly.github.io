Representatives of <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/"><b>Unisender</b></a> , <a href="http://www.cpanetwork.ru/"><b>CPA Network</b></a> , <b><a href="http://www.epochtasms.ru/">Atomic SMS</a></b> , <a href="http://www.staffcop.ru/"><b>Atompark</b></a> and <a href="http://www.directlist.ru/"><b>DirectList</b></a> spoke at the seminar.  The seminar was attended by 90 people from more than 60 companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ac/311/2dc/6ac3112dccb621b7f4cebd55b2fd09d7.png"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Director of DirectList company Alexander Nosach opened the seminar with the topic ‚ÄúWe are building a targeted subscriber base‚Äù, a story about four main ways of forming a legal email-sending base.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a49/e74/b01/a49e74b017f4a88102834bc5be29b542.png"><br><br>  The next speaker - Dmitry Kandybovich, sales director of the Novosibirsk company Atompark Software, spoke about the generation of leads and their proper processing on the experience of his company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d1/38a/24c/6d138a24c28be1f23691dc4b7bf2c83f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b0a/ef6/50d/b0aef650dc608e6a5feffe9362fd9e78.png"><br><br>  At the end of the report, when the questions of the hall went, Andrei Burmus left Epochta to help a colleague.  His presentation on the integration of email and SMS distribution was as follows. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/021/3b8/7ba/0213b87ba941b4f4fec4eb4197647cd1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f30/e99/e82/f30e99e82eb3e96568fbba56b22d40ae.png"><br><br>  Colleagues from the CPA Network, Yevgeny Troitsky and Sergey Betin, spoke in tandem with the report "Combining communication channels Email &amp; Social Media". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/972/6ed/842/9726ed84234cd31b8c6d20ba8dfd13f6.png"><br><br>  By the way, I paid attention, watching both their performance and the improvised Burmus-Kandybovich tandem a little earlier, that duet performances look much more interesting than the monologue of one speaker.  Take this method into service for future events. <br><br>  The report by Natalia Solovyova, Marketing Director at Unisender, closed the lecture part of the event - she talked about what the right marketing mailings are and how to benefit from mailing errors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b6/24b/831/7b624b8317a007a3a49aa344846991e6.png"><br><br>  According to the participants, this was one of the most interesting reports from the seminar, so we‚Äôll post its adapted version for Habr here in a short time. <br><br><h4>  Practical work </h4><br>  The final stroke of the overall picture of the day was a workshop - an experimental format.  The idea was as follows: to use the collective intelligence of the speakers and experts of the seminar to solve practical cases of the seminar participants.  To this end, all the guests, along with an advertising razdatka, were given questionnaire questionnaires, which they could fill out during the seminar and pass to the organizers during the second break.  The speakers, therefore, had time to look at the questions and get ready to answer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a0/a2b/efe/7a0a2befe9401ac6042eb9f7cc764aee.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b9/792/d1c/8b9792d1c04b0a05be15a68087b4c891.png"><br><br>  Participate in the workshop as experts could not only speakers, but everyone.  So <a href="http://allleads.ru/">Alleads.ru</a> project <a href="http://allleads.ru/">manager</a> Ruslan Tatunashvili joined us: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/106/735/839/106735839e74129e314dd424f1465db4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/add/f95/a03/addf95a030c276026e58d11bf3b37862.png"><br><br>  ... and <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/">Unisender</a> technical director Alexey Kachalov: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dfb/aad/ee8/dfbaadee8ee8c6d0968caee58f2d9e8a.png"><br><br>  The questions were asked different - both in practical aspects of organizing email newsletters, and in general in business promotion, sales increase.  As it turned out, often the help of experts is required not even for some tweaks, but at the level of basic recommendations - how to count money, what to put at the forefront. <br><br><h4>  Participants and communication </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a2/6d8/d76/8a26d8d763268f99afd0fb92feb03a2b.png"><br><br>  A total of over 60 companies have registered for the seminar, including the largest player in the FMCG market, Unilever, UNICEF, content provider Svyaznoy Download, Buy Bonus, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/fastlaneventures">Fast Lane Ventures</a> , Kolizeo.ru, RedKeds, foodik.ru, Like Media, NBZ Computers, PR Technologies, RCCMedia, SearchCredit.ru, shopium.ru <br>  Soloweb, Staff-box.ru, TRAVELSYSTEM, TrueConf and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/331/495/951/331495951af4ee62e9c2051e77b6adb5.png"><br><br>  Particular attention in the organization of the event we paid to backstage communication.  I am deeply convinced that the significance of such events is not only in new knowledge, but also in the opportunity to personally communicate with experts in various fields and make personal contacts.  Therefore, we have allocated time for two breaks in the program of the event - 45 and 30 minutes.  For making these breaks tasty and nutritious, the Progress Bar and its sandwiches were in charge.  They looked very appetizing, but I did not have time to try them :( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f54/a1b/28b/f54a1b28bbcc6803ab313a0db45f640c.png"><br><br>  A live twitter broadcast of the #unisem <a href="https://twitter.com/">hashtag was</a> displayed on the big screen during the event.  A very convenient way to receive instant feedback from the audience, without interrupting speeches and without distracting the attention of all those present. <br><br>  By the way, I have to say a big thank you to the staff and especially the Digital October hardware, who provided technical support for the event - in general, the event was held at the level, including thanks to their reliable support. <br><br><h4>  Results and future plans </h4><br>  According to our feelings from the seminar and received during and after the feedback, we can judge that education in the field of email newsletters and the integration of various tools of online marketing is extremely in demand by the audience, so this seminar will be the first in the cycle of Unisender educational projects. <br><br>  Our immediate plans include educational seminars for final consumers of email and SMS mailing services, SMOs like the previous seminar, and professional events for representatives of advertising agencies.  Follow the announcements of our events on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/UniSender-Russia/193647834050726">Facebook page</a> , and the best way is to subscribe to our newsletter: <a href="http://www.unisender.com/ru/seminar/">www.unisender.com/ru/seminar</a> - fill out the form on this page and we will send you a notification about the next event.
