  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The conflict between the Russian film company and video blogger</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Film <a href="http://enjoy-movies.ru/">Enjoy Movies</a> in response to criticism of their films from video blogger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBadComedian">BadComedian</a> has already achieved the removal of several videos on YouTube.  In addition, <i>"... a lawsuit to BadComedian will follow ..."</i> - <a href="http://copyrasta.livejournal.com/39462.html">wrote</a> in his blog Artashes Andreasyan, brother of the founders of Enjoy Movies and composer of many films of the film company. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started at the end of December last year, when BadComedian (Evgeny Bazhenov) published a video in which he praised the comedy from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%2598">the Quartet</a> “Faster than rabbits” and critically responded to Enjoy Movies (their film “Friends of the Friends” was released at the same time as Rabbits, January 1): <br><blockquote>  “In a bonus, sticking naughty cancer cells like Andreasyan and Oganesyan boldly parasitized on well-established names, which suddenly, judging by some comments and reviews, also had a negative effect on the image of the children.  Although they naturally have nothing to do with the ungodly "What men do," and Satan's bold "What the girls are silent about, they have not." </blockquote><br>  For those who do not know - the Quartet And there are two films: “What men talk about” and “What men talk about”. <br><br>  The video did not remain available for long - followed by a complaint of VMA RUSSIA (the company’s owner - Artashes Andreasyan) about the illegal use of personnel from the trailer of the film “What Men Do” (2013).  BadComedian was forced to remove the video and upload a new one, without 13 seconds of frames, owned by Enjoy Movies.  At that time, BadComedian already had two warnings from YouTube, it was enough to get one more - and the channel would be blocked.  I must say that BadComedian is not the first time in conflict with film companies.  In the summer of 2013, Mikhail Galustyan secured the removal of the review on the film “Ticket to Vegas” - it described the film’s creators: “these pit ... ry touched the King” (Elvis Presley).  Later, Mikhail Galustyan registered his own trademark “Mikhail Galustyan” and deleted all the reviews where his face appeared.

      Other video bloggers unexpectedly came under the “distribution” - they also received a warning from YouTube about the illegal use of copyright objects (YouTube uses the ContentID system, which automatically finds and blocks the video).  We must pay tribute - complaints to other critics responded in a timely manner, it was enough only to write to Facebook Artashes about his “innocence”. <br><br>  Artashes Andreasyan writes in his blog that the controversial review was “ordered” by the distributor of “Rabbits”, the company DreamTeam.  As evidence, a letter from DreamTeam was brought asking to withdraw the review complaint.  Here is what BadComedian says (from Skype): <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Careful, many letters</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  “They didn’t pay for“ Rabbits ”.  I have a post about the fact that I can order a review, but I always express my opinion.  I occasionally tried to order a review of people, which I did then BadComedian.  I sent them the script, and they didn’t like the script where I carried this film and they didn’t buy anything from me.  Everything, in general everything, reviews or reviews that exist with me - this is the real opinion, and at any time if I am asked - I will repeat it with quotes from that view.  Everywhere, everywhere it says my opinion.  I wrote about the fact that they order from me „about“ -s.  If no one pays me money to create a video - I make a podcast.  And if someone pays - I do „about“.  But lately, only podcasts have to be done, and I did it on “Rabbits” because they had no advertising at all.  And the Quartet And I am not indifferent.  This can be understood in fact from all sorts of references to them and the constant mention of trailers and so on.  I went to the press show and naturally promoted Artashes' competitors, because I think that “Friends of Friends” is a bad movie.  And I promoted competitors.  And here it’s not a bubble, but a matter of comedy.  It would be much more pleasant for me to know that people are going to a film that I have promoted, which I consider good, rather than to "Friends of Friends".  And the most surprising thing is that if they didn’t have money even for a normal trailer, I don’t know, for a poster, for something else, they didn’t have any advertising company at all, but they still had money for me?  They now decided to pay me, but they could not do a normal poster or anything else?  And this is the funny thing.  You may notice that in general there was no PR company with “Rabbits”.  At all!  Only I did the one “paid for” video that the pier, and that’s it, they were no longer promoting themselves.  But this is one of the most stupid assumptions.  But nevertheless, here they are writing.  Sarik also wrote that he has accurate evidence that I did only all this for loot and simply, well, here is a quote: “he was brought up and he cannot divulge them”. <br>  I would not mind getting money for a movie on rabbits, but unfortunately I didn’t receive any money and didn’t plan to receive it, because the guys have bad money.  That's all.  If I were offered more money for this - I would say “Okay, so I’m going to make a video.  Will you give more money?  Well, super! “.  Well, that is, you can see, here I have there “about” s on “Ed” —y — this is also for money “about” s made.  Because I am sending a script, if they say “Okay, yes, this script is suitable” - I am doing “about”.  But of course this does not always work, that is, I’m doing some films in podcasts ... because the production of a video is quite a long event, I’m wasting my time for nothing. " <br></blockquote></div></div><br>  Vkontakte correspondence took place (see links at the end of the article) between Evgeny Bazhenov and Artashes Andreasyan, and the conditions for recalling a warning to YouTube were discussed.  An agreement was reached - Eugene removes someone else's content from his video and the complaint responds.  But at the moment the warnings remain. <br><br>  So far, BadComedian has not received a summons, but fears the closure of the channel.  Most video bloggers use footage from the film in their reviews, which can be regarded as a violation of copyright.  No actions like a return suit for slander are not going to take. <br><br>  I could not get official comments from Enjoy Movies itself, but people close to the company say the following: <br><blockquote>  “In fact, everything is easier than it might seem.  Enjoy Movies was ready to call off all strikes, but BadComedian chose the path of open boorish trolling and drove itself into a dead end.  That is, if before, Enjoy Movies simply demanded that he stop insulting people, now even they don’t want to hear about BadComedian and all the more so.  And yet - the strikes from Enjoy Movies and their partner “VMA RUSSIA” are not in any popular film critic except BadComedian, although all Yevgeny Bazhenov fans continue to fiercely believe that Andreasyan distributes strikes to everyone in a row. ” </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Public reaction </h4><br>  During the conflict, many people spoke in defense of BadComedian on the Internet, some websites supported it (vott.ru, yaplakal.com, pikabu.ru, kino-govno.com, kritikanstvo.ru), other video bloggers expressed their opinion (their videos, and videos of Eugene, are published on the website carambatv.ru): <br>  Lucas Kinonah - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBcfIEwu8EOA">www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcfIEwu8EOA</a> <br>  Kamikadze_d: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D6247IUx2Z90">www.youtube.com/watch?v=6247IUx2Z90</a> <br>  Sergey HellYeah: <a href="http://vk.com/video142244404_167084841">vk.com/video142244404_167084841</a> (carefully, mate) <br><br>  Eugene's subscribers and people sympathizing with him collect signatures on petitions asking them not to allow the closure of the channel, to stop the activity of Enjoy Movies, etc.  There was also a flash mob for cinema searching - Enjoy Movies films were given the smallest ratings.  But Film Search quickly responded by canceling such ratings. <br><br>  Renowned pranker Yevgeny Volnov posted a <a href="https://prankota.com/artashes">record of a</a> telephone conversation with “a certain” Artashes Andreasyan on the Internet.  But there is no confirmation that the recording is the voice of Artashes Andreasyan. <br><br><h4>  Other materials </h4><br>  The very video that started it all (original): <a href="http://vk.com/video-31263644_167294902">vk.com/video-31263644_167294902</a> <br><br>  It is the same, but corrected: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrJ_P9zE3BoU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJ_P9zE3BoU</a> <br><br>  BadComedian posted 2 videos in which he talks about the conflict: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4X13_NM5mBg">www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X13_NM5mBg</a> (the video was removed and subsequently re-cast by someone) <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5HIdQkOobL8">www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HIdQkOobL8</a> <br><br>  Discussion of the conflict, as well as BadComedian correspondence with Artashes on VKontakte: <a href="http://vk.com/badcomedian%3Fw%3Dwall-25557243_533215">vk.com/badcomedian?w=wall-25557243_533215</a> <br><br>  Archive of screenshots of correspondence on VKontakte and a few more “inconvenient” screenshots (archive received from BadComedian): <a href="https://db.tt/69OYfE81">db.tt/69OYfE81</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211969/</a></p>
