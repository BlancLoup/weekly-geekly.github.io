Telephones with dialing rings, home telephones and telegraph changed mobile phones.  The queues at the box office were changed from time to time by sites overloading.  Pokemon fishing replaced.  But the cashiers both sat at their cash registers in 1986, punching checks, and sitting.  They are overgrown with terminals, we - contactless payments, but the essence has not changed.  Routine, not changing <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">more than a hundred years</a> .  Until the XXI century has arrived. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/017/869/608/017869608c64b3ab4174943fa7b66ad1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In Russia, it seems to begin this year - because since 2017, all cash registers in our country are equipped with a mandatory internet connection.  How it happened, what it means, and why JS, Java, Kotlin and server developers have to warm up their fingers and blow the keyboards - in this article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Introduction 1. The main invention of Apple </h2><br>  The way in 2008 Apple changed the mobile development market in particular, and the way all smartphone users in the world use their gadgets in general.  To accomplish this, the company needed to implement only one simple idea: to give developers the environment and development tools - and they will create the product themselves to the best of their imagination and market understanding.

      This was not the only innovative move by Apple during the late Jobs, but probably the most important one - more importantly than the appearance of the iPhone itself, for example.  Because the iPhone has changed the way it interacts with a smart gadget, but the marketplace has changed the role of this gadget in our life.  Since then, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa marketplace has captured the markets - and not just mobile development. <br><br>  And new formats appear in those places where, it would seem, they did not wait. <br><br><h2>  Introduction 2. Tax - as the main European of Russia </h2><br>  Have you noticed how our tax is changing for the better?  In principle, this statement will not be very trendy, and it is clear why - even if the relationship between a citizen and the state changes for the better, then it does not always happen smoothly, quickly, or simply competently.  Nevertheless, the tax service in the Russian Federation, developing digital and online services, turned out to the maximum to a citizen.  No lyrics: just which body, no matter how tax, is interested in us, citizens, more?  They need our money - this is the strongest incentive to develop the convenience of receiving them.  In general, it is not surprising if you think about the fact that the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation went contrary to all the latest trends in state relations with the Internet, and took one of those very steps that will change a significant part of our lives, as Apple once did, creating the App Store. <br><br><h2>  Introduction 3. Law 54. Ticket offices go online </h2><br>  The already existing Federal Law No. 54 prescribes that right from this Saturday, July 1, 2017, all cash offices in the Russian Federation must connect to the Internet and send electronic versions of checks to the tax.  Instead of the usual ECL, the cash register should have a fiscal drive, information from which will be sent to the tax office through an intermediary - the fiscal data operator. <br><br>  If you thought that the guru of the local sha (y / ve) rma Ashot, whose kitchen only by the blindness of the Michelin Commission has not yet received a single star, it will not touch the same way as PayPass and Apple Pay did not touch, you're wrong.  No more black cash - at least legally.  If Ashot has a cash register, she will also go online <s>and google ways of marinating cat meat</s> . <br><br>  Next year, the reform will affect those who have so far managed without a ticket office.  Online ticketing will install everything: businessmen who provide services and conduct work;  own an online store, vending machine or payment terminal;  work on ENVD or patent system.  However, Big Brother is merciful to very small forms of small business: Law 54 left the possibility for some organizations and individual entrepreneurs to work without cash.  For example, without a ticket office, you can repair shoes, sell ice cream and watermelons, sell kokoshniks at fairs and carry baggage at the station.  For a complete list of exceptions, <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_42359/0c17a4091d18f33af58d3c20e17e1ac7f808242e/">see Section 2</a> of the CCV Law. <br><br>  And no one will make catching Wi-Fi in the forest: in areas where the Internet is bad, you can also work without an online ticket office.  What localities these are will be decided by the local regional authorities, and the federals state this to them.  Ask the administration of the district center, have your <s>village</s> Luhari village in the list of hard-to-reach places. <br><br><h2>  How it will change our lives </h2><br>  Very much.  Well, let's say, gills for breathing under water will not add it to us, and we will still go around traffic jams and not fly around (at least for now), but still purchases - the good old offline purchases still remain important and an integral part of our everyday life. <br><br>  Now the law describes the new features sparingly: for example, if the buyer asks, the seller must send him an electronic check in the mail or SMS.  But only "if there is a technical possibility."  Both checks are legally binding.  This, of course, is wonderful - but where is life-changing experience? <br><br>  By obliging virtually all cash registers to connect to the Internet, the Federal Tax Service actually forced the retail market to completely update its cash registers.  On cash registers connected to the Internet.  It is important for the law that they perform a couple of specific functions and meet certain standards.  And then - that the law is not prohibited, it is allowed.  For example, nothing prevents the cash terminal from turning into a smart gadget, opening an API for developers to develop applications for them. <br><br>  So did the company "Evotor".  The Russian manufacturer of new cash registers with Internet access (‚Äúsmart terminals‚Äù, as they call them), following Jobs‚Äôs precepts, added to their hardware what‚Äôs most important hardware: the ecosystem.  More precisely, the toolkit for its creation, which the company will present tomorrow, June 28, at <a href="https://evotor.timepad.ru/event/499325/">the Change conference</a> in the Moscow Yota Space. <br><br>  However, the <a href="https://developer.evotor.ru/">developer page is</a> already open to the public and contains the necessary documentation and API.  And continue to act at the behest of your commercial vein: under the terms of the ‚Äú <a href="https://evotor.ru/">Evotor</a> ‚Äù, application developers for their smart terminals share the profit with the vendor in half. <br><br>  The developers will have at their disposal not only the Evotor cash registers themselves, but also the options for the peripherals connected to them: scales, receipt printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers (what is commonly called a cash register ‚Äî where our hard-earned cashiers go); terminals <br><br>  Already implemented projects for the ‚ÄúEvotor‚Äù cash desks can be divided into the following development categories: <br><br><ul><li>  integration of commodity accounting (MojSklad, 1C) </li><li>  software for peripherals (device-specific drivers) </li><li>  integration with web services like Yandex Reference </li><li>  information export - for example, a telegram-bot, through which all cash activity is tracked </li><li>  marketing - for example, an application that can recognize customers by a preliminary profile (for example, on the basis of previous customer purchases) and offer tips to the cashier with recommendations for a particular customer. </li></ul><br>  And so on.  The beauty of this format is that we never know how the market, new opportunities and the response to customer demand will turn the use of even such a seemingly utilitarian mechanism as a cash app ... sorry, smart terminal.  In the end, it is unlikely that Steve Jobs, tearing off the blanket from the freshly launched App Store, could know that one day an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/big-bang-whip-the-whip-sound-app/id528016497%3Fmt%3D8">application</a> imitating the sound of a whip would appear (Vzhuhschsch! )? <br><br>  But the fact that it will change the way we want to shop - definitely.  It may be that someone doesn‚Äôt like it very much that the cash desk reminds him to take the milk that he usually takes (Got milk?) - but even now there are enough people who are not enthusiastic about constantly recording their location as spyware, who have gotten all kinds of reading tools.  But most people appreciate the convenience, simplicity, speed and courtesy of modern gadgets.  Surely we will appreciate how new cash registers help us to make life easier. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/331772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/331772/</a></p>
