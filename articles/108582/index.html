I will tell you about one of these tools - the service of searching and selecting ideas - today. <br><br>  <b>One head is good, but many are better</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://idea-manager.ru/">Idea Manager</a> is a service with a fairly simple idea: if, for example, you are the head of a company and you need to solve a certain task, but you don‚Äôt have enough ideas, ask your employees to share them.  They are the ones who know more about the company than anyone else and can help solve it.

      And to unleash the flywheel of the collective mind 100% - motivate them accordingly.  Ideas can and should be worth the money - so share them, rewarding all the ‚Äúgenerators of ideas‚Äù for participating in the process of their shares from the money saved or earned thanks to the solution found. <br><br>  The service is organized in such a way that it does not take time to study it.  Idea Manager is the easiest tool to get started right after registration. <br><br>  The important tasks of the system include increasing employee involvement in the life of the company.  They will not just chase the money, working off their hours, but also feel the opportunity to help her with something more, maximizing their abilities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>How does the Idea Manager work?</b> <br><br>  There are three levels of participation in the system: managers, members and admins. <br><br>  The function of managers is to set tasks, determine a budget, and then distribute it between ideas through evaluations. <br><br>  Setting the task, the manager selects departments (all, some or only his) companies that can participate in its solution, and whose managers, respectively, in the distribution of ratings.  For the rest, the task will not be visible.  The division of users into departments can be arbitrary and does not necessarily have to coincide with the actual structure of the organization. <br><br><img src="http://idea-manager.ru/i/newtopic.png" alt="Topic creation"><br><br>  When the task is set, the participants begin to offer their ideas, as well as comment and evaluate the ideas of other participants.  Each of them has 10 stars, which they distribute according to ideas according to their prospects. <br><br><img src="http://idea-manager.ru/i/discuss.png" alt="Discussion of ideas"><br><br>  Shortly before the closure of the task, managers evaluate the ideas and comments received, and depending on the assessments, the budget is distributed.  Everybody is rewarded - and who proposed ideas, and who commented, and who voted for the best ideas.  Due to this, the rating of ideas compiled by the participants really reflects their prospects. <br><br><img src="http://idea-manager.ru/i/finished.png" alt="Budget allocation"><br><br>  It is important to note that the names of the authors of ideas and comments are unknown to anyone until the publication of the results, which makes the voting process as objective as possible. <br><br>  Administrators have all the rights of managers, and besides this they have a controlling role.  They approve the topic budget, regulate users' rights, department lists, and can also edit topics along with their authors. <br><br>  <b>What gives Idea Manger</b> <br><br>  In fact, Idea Manager provides a new level of discussion of various tasks.  Meetings are short and few in number, and the task within the system can go several months and hundreds of people can participate in it. <br><br>  In contrast to internal corporate correspondence, all information is structured, messages are anonymous, a functionality has been created for evaluating received ideas and comments, and a well-thought-out bonus scheme for their authors has been implemented. <br><br>  As a result, management receives a rated list of ideas on a given topic with comments and additions, the best of which can already be discussed at the meeting. <br><br>  They say ideas are worth nothing.  Many rational proposals remain undervalued.  Idea Manager was created just to ensure that ideas can find real, expressed in money, value. <br><br>  <b>Product history</b> <br><br>  Initially, the project was created by me and my now former colleague, who had already managed to announce it on Habr√© <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/103690/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/103690</a> .  Due to some disagreements, we were divided, resulting in two projects with the same concept.  I started a little later, but this is not a waste of time - the project has been substantially refined and cured of many childhood diseases.  However, you have the opportunity to compare both options and draw your own conclusions. <br><br>  <b>Using Idea Manager</b> <br><br>  To look at the Idea Manger from the inside, it is not necessary to register.  You can use the demo access and see Idea Manager in the role of admin, manager and ordinary user, but the best option would be to order the system and try it out in your work.  The service is free for all companies up to 100 people. <br><br>  But it is best to test the idea in combat mode.  I created the topic ‚ÄúHow to improve Idea Manager‚Äù, set a budget of 5,000 rubles, and any habrovchanin can join the discussion and offer his ideas, and then see how it works ‚Äî collective intelligence and distribution of money for the result.  To log in with a unique account, take any login like ‚ÄúN@mail.ru‚Äù, where N = 1..100, and password ‚Äú123‚Äù Join! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108582/</a></p>
