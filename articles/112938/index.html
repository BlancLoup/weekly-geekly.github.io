      <b>history of the company</b> <br><br>  Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) was founded in 1974.  After the construction of the shipyard in Geoj in 1979, the company began to engage in shipbuilding.  In the eighties, a number of mergers and acquisitions took place - in particular, with such South Korean industrial giants as Daesung Heavy Industries and Hanjung (Doosan).  In 1985, the company established a research institute. <br><br>  In the early nineties of the last century, in the overall context of globalization and liberalization of world markets, SHI focused on business expansion and improving the quality of management.  In 1992, the first order was received for a floating unit for the production, storage and shipment of oil - FPSO.  In 1994, the company's IPO took place at the Seoul Stock Exchange. <br><br>  Already in the second half of the nineties, SHI significantly expanded the range of its activities: a plant was built in Ningbo, China, the first passenger vessel for 1,000 people and a deep-sea drilling apparatus were launched from the stocks.  In the XXI century, the company was restructured, and some units were sold.  Ultimately, this allowed SHI to become a global leader in its priority areas. <br><br>  <b>Shipbuilding</b> <br><br>  In total, the entire history of SHI launched 697 ships.  At the same time, the company has always relied on high-tech and expensive specialized vessels, such as icebreakers, eco-friendly vessels for the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG), mega container vessels and passenger ships. <br><br>  In recent years, SHI has released a series of giant container ships, many of which were purchased by the Swiss-Italian Mediterranean Shipping Company (which is why they received the MSC label).  They, perhaps, more than others amaze with their size. <br><br>  In December 2008, the MSC Daniela mega container container with a capacity of 13,800 TEU ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">twenty-foot equivalent</a> ) was built at the shipyards of the company in South Korea.  According to the bulletin of the classification society Germanischer Lloyd (GL, Germany), Daniela is the largest container ship ever registered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f72/ac5/9c9/f72ac59c92f7aa64c8a80fd3a4fece46.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The length of the vessel is 366 meters and the width is 51.2 meters.  It goes under the flag of Panama.  Its design is notable for such technical innovations as the separation of the cabin and the engine room and the use of steel with high tensile strength.  The latter is today a prerequisite for the construction of a mega container ship.  The use of plates with high tensile strength allows designers to reduce their thickness to an indicator that does not go beyond the required stiffness parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e84/6e7/a9c/e846e7a9cd5650f4f1b220d5cf312dbd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The company is also actively engaged in the production of equipment and platforms for deepwater drilling - in particular, FPSO.  In 2006 and 2007  SHI company successfully delivered the two largest platforms of this class in the world to the Sakhalin Energy Investment Company in Russia (see the photo below how they were transported).  And in 2009, Samsung Heavy Industries became the exclusive supplier of such equipment for Royal Dutch Shell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a12/92c/2ff/a1292c2ff0ccd76bf2dc52f142657025.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Engineering and construction direction</b> <br><br>  The Samsung Heavy Industries engineering and construction division is engaged in the construction and finishing of buildings for ordinary offices, financial institutions, as well as information and communication enterprises.  Since the early nineties, the company has been building heat and power plants, as well as waste treatment plants. <br><br>  SHI also deals with national infrastructure in South Korea, including bridges, roads, airports, subway facilities, construction sites, industrial complexes, ports, and special civilian structures.  In the framework of the same division, commercial semi-finished townhouses are manufactured for assembly under the brand La Folium. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/923/a9d/af9/923a9daf93fc6a90eefc48630a2709d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Control and automation systems</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51d/e1d/173/51de1d173affd3c4dbb6aef60daee93f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Control and automation systems were originally developed as part of the company's own research institutes (see above) for implementation in ships and shipbuilding technologies, but due to the maximum cooperation of the divisions, they are used today, for example, in the construction of buildings and factories. <br><br>  Today, SHI has more than two hundred original patents in this area, and development continues.  One of the latter is a special <a href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2011/01/the-samsung-heavy-industries-anti-piracy-ship/">system for</a> detecting a pirate threat, which has become an urgent problem of commercial shipping in recent years. <br><br>  <b>Wind energy</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/446/596/d75/446596d7563329c3ad0032518a2cfe0d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Work in the field of wind energy is a relatively new direction for SHI.  Now the company sets itself the task of achieving the seventh largest market share in the world (10%) by 2015.  To this end, the production of land and offshore wind generators of class 2.5 MW will be continued, and an assembly plant with an annual production capacity of 1600 units will be completed. <br><br>  By the way, collecting materials for this article, we almost accidentally hammered the Samsung Heavy Industries keywords into Twitter search and found that various green organizations actively provide a link to the vacancies of a wind power engineer.  We will give you a <a href="http://www.windindustryjobs.com/job/304043/wind-power-engineers/%3Futm_source%3Drss%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3Dgeneral%26ProcessedTrackID%3D2">link</a> just in case, suddenly there are such engineers among our readers ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112938/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112938/</a></p>
