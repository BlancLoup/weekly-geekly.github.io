It is not always possible to visit the place, and it is not clear whether it is worth wasting precious time on this visit. </li><li>  Visualization of construction objects.  It's all clear.  Especially for developers who are building not just a single object, but a whole complex of buildings.  The ability to walk / fly around and near objects gives an additional insight into whether it will be convenient to live / exploit this place.  And of course attracts buyers / investors beautiful scene. </li><li>  Visualization of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D1%258B_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">ISCAS</a> .

    <h5>  Project "Cultural Heritage of the Odintsovo District" </h5><br>  This <a href="http://odinculture.ru/">non-commercial project</a> was commissioned by the district administration, which in this way decided to immortalize the district‚Äôs memorable places: estates, monuments, military burial places.  For each object located on the map, a description was created in Russian / English, in text and audio form.  Each object was modeled in Unity3D.  You can walk around, look from different angles.  Textures were superimposed on real photographs of objects.  Unfortunately, the state of virtual objects is much better than real ones.  And it is likely that the figure will live longer. <br>  We assume the further development of this project: the addition of objects of culture, sports, objects of pilgrimage.  In general, all that will give an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe cultural traditions of the area. <br><br><h5>  The project "Forest Town" </h5><br>  The project to create a 3D model of <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2593%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">"Forest Town"</a> was commissioned by the developer. <br>  The video shows the scale of the project - from the area to the apartment. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rx5QKAeAAag&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgXG4RGjeTH7_g7tVBVLlzxs4z3oA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I asked our leading 3D developer Andrei Fedoseyev a question: <br>  <i>- Andrei, describe briefly for the Habrasoobshchestvo, what and how was done when creating 3D models of real buildings?</i> <br>  and here is his answer: <br>  <i>- The original task of the project was an attempt to implement a territory model based on Unity, which would allow us to visually demonstrate the development of the area, both for residents and for the developer.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The model was created on the basis of data that were collected in advance, namely: the master plan of development, projects of each house and satellite images of the territory.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>After the first builds of ready-made versions of the model, the draw calls went off scale beyond 40 thousand. Not to say that I was not ready for this, I counted on 20 thousand. The optimization question arose acutely and made me not sleep for 2 weeks in search of a solution.</i>  <i>At first, the entire project (50 unique multi-storey buildings plus small buildings, as well as garages, gazebos, paths, garbage cans, benches, lanterns, etc.) brought together only 10 textures.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The next step was to use the built-in system <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/OcclusionCulling.html">Occlusion culling</a> .</i>  <i>In short, the system prohibits rendering objects that the camera does not see.</i>  <i>For example, if there is a playground behind the house, then it will not be drawn, therefore, the overall load on the system is less.</i>  <i>With the right setting, you can achieve a drop of draucol by 10-20%.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And of course, the CombineChildren script, inherited from one of the unity demos, played an important role.</i>  <i>The importance of this script for me can not be overemphasized.</i>  <i>So, for example, we have 10 houses, draukola at the level of 4-5 thousand.</i>  <i>Create an empty game object, throw our houses into it and hang CombineChildren.</i>  <i>The general view of the scene does not change, and draucola 200-300.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>From the creation of 3D models to the final assembly of the project took about 3 months.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Well, a little about what worked with: Unity 3.5 (later Unity 4) + Playmaker + Easy road + ShaderBox + nuaj (a separate version with weather settings) + a pair of shaders from the local store.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Modeling: 3d max + google sketchup</i> <br><br>  If your OS supports Unity Web Player, then you can <a href="http://3d.ssc1.ru/">walk on our model</a> . <br>  Minimum system requirements for walking: Corei5 / 4Gb RAM / Video&gt; 5xx Nvidia <br>  Control: WASD + right button </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173371/</a></p>
