As is known, everything that a person feels or perceives, he does with the help of his central nervous system, namely the brain, and instinctive reactions with the help of the spinal cord.  Due to the fact that scientific progress is constantly evolving and not standing still, scientists study and understand the interaction of neurons (gradually better and better, but more questions than answers are generated), the cells that make up the human brain.  Understanding the processes of thinking, processing and generating information, more and more there is an understanding that what is happening is extremely amazing and wonderful, but it cannot be any other way! <br>  Our body is not perfect and unique in strength at the same time.  We can withstand such loads that not one device can withstand. <br>  device, but on the other hand we are so easy to "disable".  A person always strives to go where, he does not live (space, the depths of the ocean, etc.), look at what he cannot (different spectra, atoms, etc.).  In general, a person is unstoppable in his curiosity and aspiration in the knowledge of the world around him.  But there is a problem that the opportunities that the body provides us are lacking either now or will be lacking. <br>  In addition, knowledge is increasingly obtained, and in order to understand and apply them in practice, you need more time or a narrower specialization in studying the problem.  Thus, a person will change his body in the future, and already changes, for us it became the norm, but only a hundred years ago it was fantastic (plastic surgery, lengthening of bones, cosmetics).  Then he will go on genetic modifications in a pair using biocybernetic (devices that interact with non-living things) devices.  But here's the problem, will not we eventually become just a keg in which there will be a ‚Äúbrain-consciousness‚Äù and a device that removes and creates the complex structure of the electromagnetic field of the brain.  In addition, there should still be service devices, as well as a huge number of various probes, with the help of which it will be possible to explore the surrounding space ... <br>  Of course, you can go even further, and generally abandon the skin shell and live on silicon (?), Or be a stream of photons on a transparent substrate.  In any case, our consciousness is just a bizarre configuration (structure) of energy.  Because at this stage, the role of sensors is played by our body, eyes, tongue, etc., and we interact with the help of muscles, which, however, are controlled by thought ‚Äî an energy pulse ... <br>  PS: I do not pretend to technical accuracy, the main thing is that the global idea would be clear ... </div>
