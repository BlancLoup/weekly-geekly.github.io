      <b>15. Oracle buys ATG</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2010 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f57/d3f/fce/f57d3ffce3ce8a524be4e50104b89f53.jpg" align="left"><br>  You may not know ATG or Art Technology Group by name, but more than likely you have seen their work.  This company has created sites of such giants as BestBuy and Tommy Hilfiger.  Oracle paid $ 1 billion for ATG and for its audience in 2010. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>14. AOL buys MapQuest</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1.1 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 1999 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/394/924/cc8/394924cc8370fb5b5a197cd4409d6fd0.png" align="left"><br><br>  At the end of the 20th century, AOL paid a little over a billion dollars for MapQuest.  Bad that he did not see Google Maps literally "around the corner." <br><br><br><br><br><br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>13. Microsoft buys Fast Search &amp; Transfer</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount</b> : $ 1.2 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2008 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/203/63e/44f/20363e44fb379a4ed9c7cdf272c4d866.jpg" align="left"><br>  Microsoft buys FAST, a Norwegian company that specializes in search engine development.  In 2009, the Norwegian police found out that the company carried out illegal fraud in 2006 and 2007.  After that, the ex-CEO John Lerwick resigned in disgrace. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>12. Amazon buys Zappos</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1.2 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2009 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39c/e48/32d/39ce4832da7b2a76706e22db3ff7cd91.jpg" align="left"><br>  Zappos.com has made a name for itself by selling shoes with discounts.  By 2009, it was the largest online shoe store in the world.  He then expanded and offered all kinds of clothes and accessories.  In the same year, Amazon announced the purchase of its junior competitor for $ 1.2 billion. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>11. eBay buys PayPal</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1.5 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2002 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f45/f6b/b69/f45f6bb69c6c795620411c74153f9163.jpg" align="left"><br>  One of the first major sites of the first decade of the XXI century - eBay auction acquired PayPal, because it is a safe and user-friendly payment system.  Some PayPal employees went to work in such promising start-ups like YouTube and Facebook. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>10. Yahoo buys Overture Services Inc.</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1.63 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2003 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c2/b91/c30/4c2b91c305a11e62d927c1f6f03a4419.jpg" align="left"><br>  In 2003, Yahoo!  uploaded $ 1.63 billion for Overture Services inc., owners of search engines like AltaVista and AllTheWeb.  This purchase was supposed to help Yahoo!  in the fight against google.  By 2009, Yahoo!  strengthened, because it was announced that the search will work under the control of Bing. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>9. Google buys YouTube</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 1.65 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2006 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/683/fef/8b2/683fef8b2c8857d8dc09c0fd6964dbd7.jpg" align="left"><br>  In 2006, Google attracted attention by acquiring a one-year video hosting service.  Critics doubted that YouTube, which has already received complaints from film studios and music studios, is worth its money.  Google doesn't invest in YouTube, but today, the birthplace of millions of memes is the third most popular site on the Internet, after Facebook and Google. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>8. eBay Buys Skype</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 2.6 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2005 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c0e/93a/e8c/c0e93ae8c21ff62e16ff89fb3db45630.jpg" align="left"><br>  EBay is back in the game, having bought Skype for an unexpected amount of $ 2.6 billion. By 2009, VoIP and video calling services were used in television shows such as Oprah and Who Millionaire.  In the same year, eBay announced the sale of a controlling stake in Skype to a group of investors.  In 2011, Skype was sold to Microsoft for a huge amount - $ 8.5 billion. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>7. Google buys DoubleClick</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 3.1 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2008 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c9/4ba/b04/9c94bab04b5ed4b07f764736d73e7e34.jpg" align="left"><br>  Google can afford to do almost anything, thanks to a successful business model - advertising.  AdWords and AdSense bring in almost all of the company's revenue.  In 2009, Googleplex paid $ 3.1 billion to achieve complete dominance in the advertising field by purchasing DoubleClick, an advertising company with an impressive list of customers. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>6. Cisco Systems Buys WebEx</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 3.2 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2007 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c8/af4/0eb/5c8af40eb8d29b9424ec0ea2ec676f7c.jpg" align="left"><br>  Specializing in software for the corporate market, WebEx received a good amount from Cisco Systems in 2007.  The $ 3.2 billion deal implied some reorientation for Cisco, known for its offline products. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>5. Yahoo buys GeoCities</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 3.6 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 1999 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/14c/1ec/857/14c1ec8575382cd5b98c9d7ff65a614c.jpg" align="left"><br>  GeoCities is a free web hosting service, which in 1999 was the third most popular website in the world, numbering 19 million unique users per month.  Yahoo!  I bought this company for $ 3.6 billion. But the limited functionality and high cost of the servers meant that time was running out.  By the end of 2009, Yahoo!  closed this service completely. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>4. AOL buys Netscape</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 4.2 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 1998 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e52/1f5/f10/e521f5f105b546e007c6d9d23edcda24.jpg" align="left"><br>  In the 90s, AOL was not perceived as Google now, that is, a synonym for the word "Internet".  Dial-up provider and a huge Internet service made a major contribution to the acquisition of the Netscape browser to rid itself of the tyranny of Microsoft Internet Explorer.  Netscape was never able to distract users from IE, however, there were more browsers, so the project was closed.  Several Netscape developers have moved to create Mozilla Firefox. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>3. Yahoo!</b>  <b>buys Broadcast.com</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 5.7 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2001 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ba/760/418/7ba760418c1e6fba04900ed7beae89e1.jpg" align="left"><br>  Buying Broadcast.com by Yahoo!  for $ 5.7 - the biggest bubble in the history of the Internet.  This allowed us to make the name of the entrepreneur from Dallas - Mark Kyubana, a household name.  Unfortunately for Yahoo !, the main function of Broadcast is to aggregate radio broadcasts.  This feature did not provide competitive advantages and sustainable business models.  Today you can hardly find signs of the existence of this site. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>2. Microsoft buys aQuantive</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 6 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2007 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cec/3b3/a5e/cec3b3a5e8017d47acbae2e37f3c5b20.jpg" align="left"><br>  To improve its position in the online advertising market, Microsoft paid $ 6 billion by purchasing a digital marketing agency in 2007.  aQuantive and all other services were subsequently rebranded and named ‚ÄúMicrosoft Advertising‚Äù. <br><br clear="all"><hr><br>  <b>1. Oracle buys Peoplesoft</b> <br><br>  <b>Transaction amount:</b> $ 10.3 billion <br>  <b>Year:</b> 2004 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4da/c80/e50/4dac80e502fc10ad4069300b3f8f0243.jpg" align="left"><br>  The most costly takeover that lasted a year and a half was between Oracle and Peoplesoft, a manufacturer providing business software.  Larry Ellison, Oracle CEO, probably did not lose too much to worry about it: this amount is a little over a third of his own capital. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142134/</a></p>
