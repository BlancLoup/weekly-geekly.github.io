But Dmitry Anatolyevich is not enough.  He demands that all these conversations go, finally, to the applied track.  That is 1 billion. This is far from the limit.  Let's see how our first and not the last billion has been spent. <br><br>  So far, the most expensive state site belongs to the <a href="http://www.roskazna.ru/">Federal Treasury</a> , it cost the budget almost 82 million rubles.  It was developed by <a href="http://www.ibs.ru/">LLC IBS Examination</a> , oddly enough, the only company that submitted an application for participation in the <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D745929">competition</a> .  The office is serious, in its portfolio there are already 20 state projects, sites of Gazprom, Lukoil, metallurgists, machine builders, power engineers and other "small" bipods <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The subject of the contract is Works (services) to ensure system integration when creating and operating the official website of the Russian Federation on the Internet for placing information about placing orders for goods, works and services for federal needs, the needs of constituent entities of the Russian Federation or municipal needs.  To make such a site, the performer must have at least 17 specialists of various stripes on staff: <br>  - a specialist with degrees in the specialty "System analysis, management and information processing", <br>  - Certified IBM Certified Solution Developer, Oracle Database 10g Administrator Certified Associate, <br>  - certificates of training courses: "Basics of the IBM Rational Unified Process Methodology", "Using the Rational Software Architeet and the Model-Driven Architecture Concepts (MDA) for Information Systems Design," Business Modeling and Determining Requirements for Software Systems (Rational Unified Process) "," Fundamentals of functional testing using IBM Rational tools: Rational Robot, Rational Manual Test, Rational Test Manager "," Object-oriented analysis and design of IP using Rational Rose "," ILOG JRules for Developers ", should be on hand specialist having q  Plomo of professional retraining program "Management of state and municipal orders" and a specialist with certificate of professional qualification according to the program, "State and municipal order management."

      In my opinion, this is a simple transfer of the employees of ‚ÄúIBS Examination‚Äù to cut off unnecessary competitors. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the pop-up menu of the <a href="http://www.roskazna.ru/">site</a> does not work, it pops up, but disappears when hovering (in IE, Mozilla and Opera). <br><br>  82 Lemana is not the largest government order yet.  This week ended the <a href="http://zakupki.gov.ru/Tender/ViewPurchase.aspx%3FPurchaseId%3D798298">competition for the development of a site for the CEC of the Russian Federation</a> .  The initial (maximum) contract price: 145 460 000 rubles.  Subject of the contract: Experimental design work "Development of GAS" Elections "until 2012.  Implementation of the Technical project of development of GAS "Elections" until 2012.  Development of the subsystem GAS ‚ÄúVybory‚Äù Internet portal.  Creation of a program-technical complex ‚ÄúInternet portal KSA of the CEC of Russia‚Äù.  Who grabbed such a piece, is still unknown. <br><br>  I invite you to take part in new tenders!  And share the experience. <br>  Here are the current ones. <br><br>  - Tender for 50 million rubles.  from the Ministry of Defense to upgrade the software and hardware complex of the official website of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. <br>  - Tender from the Ministry of Health for 11 million rubles.  to carry out work on the revision, maintenance and development of a pilot version of the website ‚ÄúFederal portal of managerial personnel‚Äù. <br>  - And a small order from Rosavtodor for 7.6 million rubles.  on the development, maintenance, information and technical support of the Rosavtodor website, technical support of existing Internet resources. <br>  The <a href="http://www.zakupki.gov.ru/">government procurement portal</a> itself, on which these tenders are placed, also absorbs a lot of money, for the last 2 years, 180 million rubles has been spent on maintaining its work and modernization. <br><br>  By the way, it is not clear why a grant in the amount of only 1 million rubles was allocated for the development of the <a href="http://gosbook.ru/">‚ÄúGosbuk‚Äù</a> , a social network for officials?  It would seem that it was possible to roam here, the thing is not so trivial.  Registered users can maintain their own blog, comment on each other, post documents, indicate upcoming events, create communities and working groups. <br><br>  The first five of the most expensive sites of government agencies, according to Slon.ru: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://www.roskazna.ru/">Federal Treasury</a> - 81,800,000 rubles. <br>  2. <a href="http://www.government.ru/">Government of Russia</a> - 70.2 million rubles. <br>  3. The <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/">FSB of Russia</a> - 56,850,000 rubles. <br>  4. <a href="http://www.economy.gov.ru/">Ministry of Economic Development</a> - 55,000,000 rubles. <br>  5. <a href="http://www.ed.gov.ru/">Rosobrazovanie</a> - 47 million rubles. <br><br>  Site design originality is not different, on the left coat of arms, the site in the colors of the Russian flag.  But, as a rule, the conditions of the tender to this oblige, "adhere to a common style."  I also did not dig up the programmer delights of $ 1 million. <br><br>  The largest customer is the <a href="http://www.economy.gov.ru/">Ministry of Economic Development</a> , the total amount of contracts for creating websites in the network exceeds 154 million rubles.  Second place Rosobrazovanie - 133 million.  Third Government of Russia - 106 million. <br><br>  Of the executors of orders, the <a href="http://www.informika.ru/">FGI GNTI Informika</a> earned the <a href="http://www.informika.ru/">most.</a> The total amount of its contracts was nearly 109 million rubles.  The State Research Institute of Information Technologies and Telecommunications is a state-owned scientific enterprise created to ensure the development and promotion of new information technologies in the fields of education and science in Russia. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the ranking of the most wasted funds, the <a href="http://www.minzdravsoc.ru/">Ministry of Health</a> is in the lead, spending 2 million rubles to develop the concept of creating, developing, promoting and operating the portal ‚ÄúThe National System of Chemical and Biological Safety of the Russian Federation‚Äù. <br><br>  The first could not stand the nerves of the main Russian financier, Alexei Kudrin.  ‚ÄúWe still need to check how the costs correspond to the goals and functions.  It seems to me that these programs are expensive at the moment. ‚Äù  He cited as an example a pharmacy informatization project worth 14 billion rubles (1.8 million rubles per municipal pharmacy). <br><br>  It would be better to finance the pharmacy, but not informatization.  And this applies to all institutions attacked by the ElectroPresident. <br><br><br>  <b>upd: the</b> picture presented in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/keid/" class="user_link">Keid</a> comments <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/keid/" class="user_link">is</a> so good that I decided to put it in the title. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99317/</a></p>
